			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Rakhimov: "There Is Less and Less </F> Surrounding Nature, and More and More Environment"]    [Text] The Ministry of Environmental Protection and  Natural Resources of Tatarstan has called a republic conference  of workers of environmental protection organs for the first time  in the year and a half of its existence.    Coordinated and urgent activity to save the environment is  what is needed now. This thought was predominant in all the  speeches at the conference. Of course, on the whole, it brought  to mind the unforgettable meetings of party economic management  aktivs: a statement of the facts, miscalculations and successes  (alas, there are not many of the latter), and comparative  percentages. For a certainty, these are the shortcomings of an  initial effort.    In his speech Minister A. Shchepovskiy that the department  was just beginning to develop methods and ways of executive and  monitoring activity based on the implementation of priority  tasks--providing residents of Tatarstan with fresh drinking  water, resolving problems of industrial and everyday wastes,  including toxic and radioactive wastes, and establishing an  integral system of monitoring in the republic. The ecological  department published the first state report on the status of the  environment of the Republic of Tatarstan in 1993, and a  Tatarstan Green Book was issued in which analysis of materials  concerning the ecological situation was systematized and  presented for the first time. A Tatarstan Red Book will also  come out soon.    Problems that require priority attention were also  highlighted at the conference. These are the ecology of  agriculture, saving forest resources and restoring the purity of  natural waters, and cleansing the atmosphere in cities.    For example, due to erosion there is an average annual loss  of 70 tonnes of humus per hectare of land. In addition, a good  third of the mineral fertilizer is washed away, which pollutes  reservoirs and rivers. An ecological chemical analysis of the  topsoil in the republic showed that in half the rayons the land  is especially oversaturated with harmful elements from the  Mendeleyev table, among which are lead, mercury, strontium, and  arsenic. In addition, the aftereffects of the compounds of  agrochemical processing of the soil do not emerge immediately,  but after many years.    For a half century our undoubtedly valiant oil workers,  engrossed in increasing a well's output, were not overly careful  with the land, but now they are being forced to compensate for  the regrettable costs of irresponsible land use in hundreds of  billions of rubles. But is it not late to reanimate the  benefactress? Judging by the speech of A. Iskhakov, head of  administration of both Aznakayev and Aznakayevskiy Rayon, this  agricultural area, given all the bounties acquired from four oil  and gas producing administrations located there, can be referred  to as an ecological disaster zone. According to doctors'  findings, the water there is unsuitable for drinking, and the  air is polluted to a maximum. No matter how the oil workers try  to improve the ecological situation in the rayon, its condition  remains threatening for the health of the population.    The ecological problems in our republic are becoming  aggravated by the elimination of production and consumption  wastes. Up to 2.5 million tonnes are formed in a year in the  republic. Among them are not only raw materials byproducts (10  percent), but also especially harmful poisonous chemicals,  containing mercury, calculated in the tens of tonnes. The  Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of  the Republic of Tatarstan examined the technical and economic  justification of a plant project for the processing of wastes.  And as soon as it appears, it apparently will begin to work on  Kazan's needs. But what will the situation be with the needs of  the rayons?    The reports of representatives of Goskomsanepidnadzor [State  Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiologic Inspection] concerning  the effect of an unfavorable environment on our health were sad.  It was especially emphasized that the general ecological  condition is reflected in the rate of childbirth and the health  of the next generation. The death rate in the republic last year  exceeded the birth rate. Infant mortality reached 22 percent per  1,000 newborn. In comparison with 1990, the adult population has  begun to get sick a third more often.    Indeed, we have lost the time when we were still able to be  charitable toward nature. There is now a need for efficient  consolidation of all scientific and practical forces to  stabilize the process of barbaric use of nature and to relieve  the current condition of the nature that we have desecrated.  There are certain rays of hope: The Republic of Tatarstan  Academy of Sciences has turned to these problems in real earnest  and created an interdisciplinary council on ecology that is  coordinating the activity of five departments of the academy. In  addition, a special Institute of the Ecology of Natural Systems  has been organized that will have to prepare maps of the  ecological condition in the republic. It is clear that the  republic Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources is  still in the stage of formation and that the burden of concerns  that has fallen on it are excessive at the present time.  Moreover, they have to be resolved with the meager sum that is  available. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural  Resources was allocated R7 billion, but 20 times more is needed  to carry out the paramount tasks.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: A comic insight on bio-piracy Sir, I would like to share an anecdote on the issues around the protection of pharmaceutical inventions through the Gatt (' 'Bio-piracy' under new fire', November 30). When a child, my two brothers and I were given one penny for each year of our ages to spend on sweets each week. My elder brother also bought a comic with this money, which cost him three of his 10 pence. My younger brother and I were happy with this arrangement, since we spent all our money on sweets and read his comic once he had. This did not seem fair, and my elder brother soon stopped buying a comic - much to our disappointment. Finally, we agreed we would each donate a penny for the shared comic and the problem was solved. The pharmaceutical industries of Canada, Egypt, India and 13 Latin American countries you identified as opposing the obligatory protection of pharmaceutical patents in the Gatt, want us to buy the comic for them to read. The 'comic' is, of course, the investment in research and development which innovative pharmaceutical companies must make to improve health care. If these companies stop buying the comic, they go out of business. The patent system will not stop anybody reading the comic, it will merely make them wait a while, until the innovative pharmaceutical industry has prepared the next issue.

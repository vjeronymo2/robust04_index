			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, Subpart B does not address other dangers in confined spaces. However, the dangers from slips, falls, electricity, machine guarding etc. are not unique to or necessarily intensified in confined spaces. Precautions to guard against general non-atmospheric shipyard hazards should be specified for the entire shipyard (all workplaces). Therefore, it is recommended that Subpart B not be expanded to include general safety hazards; rather, these should be covered elsewhere in 29 CFR 1915 (e.g., Subpart E/Access and Egress, Subpart F/General Working Conditions, and/or Subpart M/Fall Protection).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA does believe that a confined or enclosed space can exacerbate the risk faced by an employee working in a confined space containing serious non-atmospheric hazards. If an employee is injured in a confined space the limited means of access and egress makes emergency medical assistance problematic. For this reason, OSHA adopted language in &sect;1910.146 for general industry so as to define permit-required confined space ``in the broadest possible terms'' so that employers are required to protect affected employees from any serious hazards which may be confronted in a permit space [58 FR 4478&hyph;4479].''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that shipyard employees will be adequately protected under revised Subpart B without incorporating additional requirements directed towards non-atmospheric hazards. As part of the pre-entry test, the competent person is required to make a visual inspection of the confined or enclosed space. At this time, they can alert the employer to non-atmospheric hazards that are addressed by other standards. For further information, see the discussion of visual inspection in the preamble to &sect;1915.12 below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice reopening the record on Subpart B also requested comments on whether or not OSHA should adopt various provisions from proposed &sect;1910.146 that SESAC had recommended for inclusion in revised Subpart B. These provisions included those on training, rescue, and exchanging information between employers. The summary and explanation of &sect;1915.12 discusses comments received on these provisions. Additionally, OSHA requested comments on whether any other requirements from proposed &sect;1910.146 would be appropriate for inclusion in revised Subpart B. No one suggested the adoption of any proposed &sect;1910.146 provisions other than those relating to attendants, permits, and unauthorized entry discussed earlier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) of &sect;1915.11 sets definitions for revised Subpart B. These definitions, derived in large part from NFPA 306, are intended to facilitate compliance with the revised standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previous Subpart B contains no definitions. The few definitions relating to the previous subpart are contained in &sect;1915.4, which defines the following Subpart B related terms: hazardous substance, competent person, confined space, enclosed space, hot work, and cold work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1915.11(b), the NPRM proposed to add definitions specifically applicable to revised Subpart B. This paragraph in the proposed rule included the terms ``competent person'' and ``hot work,'' which as noted previously, are also defined in existing &sect;1915.4. The NPRM also raised issues regarding the definitions of ``inert or inerted atmospheres,'' ``Marine Chemist,'' and ``Not Safe for Workers.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definitions contained in revised Subpart B are discussed in the following summary and explanation of &sect;1915.11(b). This discussion provides a brief explanation of each defined term, justifies any differences between the existing or proposed definitions and those contained in the final rule, and discusses comments received regarding the three terms that were raised as issues in the NPRM (no substantive comments were received on any other terms proposed in &sect;1915.11(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Adjacent spaces'' means spaces bordering another space in all directions. The wording of the definition of this term has been revised editorially from the definition in the proposal for consistency with NFPA 306. Additionally, the final rule defines the term ``adjacent spaces,'' whereas the proposal defined the term ``adjacent compartments or spaces,'' because the final rule does use the term ``adjacent compartments''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule includes a definition of the term ``Assistant Secretary'', which means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health or his or her designated representative. This term is used in revised Subpart B, so OSHA has adopted a definition based on &sect;1910.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has not carried forward into the final rule the proposed definition of ``bulk''. The Agency believes that a definition of this term is not necessary to the meaning of the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Certified Industrial Hygienist'' (CIH) means an industrial hygienist certified by the American Board of Industrial Hygiene. This definition is unchanged from the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A ``Coast Guard authorized person'' is one who meets the U.S. Coast Guard regulations concerning persons designated to perform the functions of a Marine Chemist when a Marine Chemist is not reasonably available. The definition in the final rule is essentially the same as that contained in proposed &sect;1915.11(b); however, substantive requirements proposed in that definition have not been carried forward, as they are inappropriate for use in a definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has not carried forward into the final rule the proposed definition of ``competent person''. As noted earlier, this term is defined in &sect;1915.4, and this definition is appropriate for application to revised Subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

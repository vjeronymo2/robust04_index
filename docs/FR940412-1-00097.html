No zinc material that is wet may be accepted for shipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Zinc material may not be loaded in bulk if its temperature is greater than 11.1 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (20 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) in excess of the ambient temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section apply only when zinc materials are carried by a manned cargo vessel:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Zinc material in bulk must be stowed in a mechanically ventilated hold which_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Is designed for at least one complete air change every 30 minutes based on the empty hold;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Has explosion-proof motors approved for use in Class I, Division 1, Group B atmospheres or equivalent motors approved by the vessel's flag state administration for use in hydrogen atmospheres; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Has nonsparking fans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each hold into which zinc material is to be loaded must be fitted with permanently installed combustible gas detectors capable of measuring hydrogen concentrations of 0 to 4.1% by volume. If the concentration of hydrogen in the space above the cargo exceeds 1% by volume, the ventilation system must be run until the concentration drops below 1% by volume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Thermocouples must be installed approximately 6 inches below the surface of the zinc material or in the space immediately above the zinc material. If an increase in temperature is detected, the mechanical ventilation system required by paragraph (d) of this section must be used until the temperature of the zinc material is below 55  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (131  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the cargo hatches of holds containing zinc material must remain sealed to prevent the entry of seawater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If the concentration of hydrogen is near 4.1% by volume and increasing, despite ventilation, or the temperature of the zinc material reaches 65 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (150 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) and the weather and sea conditions allow, the cargo hatches must be opened, taking care to prevent sparks and minimize the entry of water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart F_Additional Special Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;148.400 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Applicability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY OKS MOSQUE; IMPOSED CONDITIONS STIR GRUMBLING  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Council members approved the San Fernando Valley's first  mosque Tuesday after requiring that the $1.8-million house of worship in  Granada Hills have Spanish-style architecture, forgoing the traditional domes  and minarets.  </P> <P> In a 10-0 vote, the City Council approved the mosque but imposed so many  conditions on its operations and construction that Valley Muslim leaders and  their lobbyist, Robert Wilkinson, an ex-councilman, complained of prejudice.  </P> <P> "I think clearly there is a double standard being applied here," said Salam  Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council.  </P> <P> "I'd have to say there was some prejudice," said Wilkinson, who used to  represent Granada Hills.  </P> <P> But Councilman Hal Bernson, who now represents the area, denied any bias was  shown by the council or the homeowners who opposed the mosque's construction.  "I don't feel this was a matter of harassment or discrimination," Bernson said.  </P> <P> Rather, the main concern was the effect of traffic on the surrounding  neighborhood of single-family homes, he told his council colleagues.  </P> <P> All told, 44 conditions were imposed on the mosque. City officials earlier had  said that it was the highest number of restrictions ever placed on a house of  worship by the city.  </P> <P> Mohammed Mohiuddin, president of the Islamic Center of Northridge, said he was  vexed over the style of architecture required by Bernson's office.  </P> <P> The approved Spanish-style building -- stucco siding with red tile roof -- is  "supposed to blend in with the neighborhood," he said.  </P> <P> "I've seen a Greek church with a big dome, Catholic churches with towers,"  Mohiuddin said. "We don't want a big, elaborate dome, but maybe just a little  one. Something that gives it an Islamic touch. So when you're driving down the  118 (Simi Valley Freeway) you can say: 'That's the mosque.' "  </P> <P> The 18,000-square-foot mosque, minus the towering minarets from which Muslim  followers are traditionally called to worship, will be completed in six months  to a year, officials said.  </P> <P> One of the major limitations bars the mosque from having more than 250 members  during its first year of operation -- a number that could be increased to 400  in the second year after a review by city planners.  </P> <P> The Valley's Muslim community had sought permission for up to 550 members,  Mohiuddin said.  </P> <P> "We are a growing community," Mohiuddin said in an interview. He estimated that  there are about 6,000 Muslims in the Valley. Valley Muslims now worship at a  converted three-bedroom house on Tampa Avenue in Northridge, and recently have  been using a Knights of Columbus hall in Canoga Park to handle the overflow of  worshipers, he said.  </P> <P> Additionally, worshipers are barred from parking on Encino Avenue, the street  in front of the 2 1/2-acre mosque site. They are required to employ a "traffic  control" officer to keep parishioners on Fridays -- the Muslim's holy day --  from making a right turn onto Encino Avenue when leaving the mosque.  </P> <P> But the Granada Hills neighbors were not convinced that the conditions will be  enforced. Nor were they happy with Bernson's vote.  </P> <P> Homeowner Preston Holland said he doubts that city officials will police the  mosque to see that it is living up to the city's conditions and restrictions.  "How do we get a good handle on the number of members of the church," he asked.  "I'm sure I'd get sideways with the religious freedom issue if I try to find  out."  </P> <P> Another neighbor, Don Pardi, said the area already has eight traffic-generating  churches or schools within a one-mile radius, including one church-run school  and an adult school next door to the proposed mosque site.  </P> <P> Urging homeowners to be tolerant, Wilkinson said the heaviest traffic would  occur on Fridays from noon to 2 p.m., periods of normally light traffic in  Granada Hills.  </P> <P> The former councilman noted that the Hillcrest Christian Church, located across  the street from the mosque site, had recently sought to expand the enrollment  of its school and "nobody from this community protested -- not one single  protest."  </P> <P> Despite the tension, Bernson told longtime residents he believed the Muslims  would be good neighbors.  </P> <P> Mohiuddin said, "There are so many damned restrictions. But we need a place to  worship and so we accept them."  </P></p>

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Attack on Russian reformers' monetary policy is misleading Sir, Steve Hanke and Kurt Schuler (Personal View: 'How to halt Russia's rouble charade', August 12) misdirect their fire by accusing Russia's reformers of lacking a strategy to stabilise the rouble. The reformers, led by finance minister Boric Federov, agree with Hanke and Schuler that credit policy should be rule-based and restrictive. They face profound political and institutional obstacles in implementing such a policy. Sometimes the conservatives still hold sway, as with last month's ridiculous currency confiscation. None the less, the reformers have made progress: hyperinflation has been avoided, credit creation has slowed, and the rouble has strengthened in recent weeks. Hanke and Schuler dismiss the reformers' efforts since they fall short of the pristine standard of a currency board, with zero domestic credit creation. Currency boards certainly have their merit, and have proved useful for some small open economies such as Hong Kong and Estonia, though they have been consistently eschewed by large countries for political and economic reasons. A currency board is neither necessary nor sufficient for stabilisation. Hanke's favourite successes are Chile and China, neither of which has a currency board. The vast majority of stabilisations throughout history have been achieved without currency boards, while some countries with currency boards or similar arrangements (such as Liberia and Panama) have none the less succumbed to state bankruptcy. Hanke and Schuler's call for rule-based monetary policy is most welcome, but their attack on Russia's reformers for the failure to implement a particular vision of 100 per cent monetary purity is thoroughly misleading.

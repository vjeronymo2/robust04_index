			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AZERBAIJANIS TRY TO SALVAGE THEIR IMAGE  </P> <P> Black flags of mourning flutter outside the Azerbaijani mission here, and  weary, unshaven officials huddle over their telephones around the clock inside,  caught up in what they describe as a virtual war to save the image of the  Azerbaijani people.  </P> <P> They cannot do much, they say, about their dead countrymen being buried miles  to the south in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital -- people killed when Soviet  troops shot their way into the city early last Saturday.  </P> <P> But on the telephones, they are organizing money and medical supplies to send  to people living under the Kremlin's state of emergency.  </P> <P> Even more important, they say, they are trying to tell the world the  Azerbaijani point of view, which they feel has been lost amid the reports of  violence against Armenians earlier in the month.  </P> <P> Since the latest round of anti-Armenian violence erupted Jan. 13 in Baku and  Soviet troops swept into the city a week later, foreign journalists have been  barred from entering Azerbaijan. They have had to rely on word of mouth,  including wild rumors.  </P> <P> According to official figures, more than 170 Armenians and Azerbaijanis were  killed.  </P> <P> The people at the Azerbaijani mission in Moscow said they think the picture has  been painted with strokes too broad, coloring all Azerbaijanis -- predominantly  Shiite Muslims -- as bloodthirsty criminals and showing their nationalism as  ethnic bias rather than pride.  </P> <P> "What happened to the Armenians in Baku is horrible," Zaur P. Rustam-Zade, the  deputy head of mission, told a reporter, "and those responsible should be found  and punished. Many Azerbaijanis helped their Armenian neighbors, and the whole  nation should not be damned."  </P> <P> Zakhrab Shamkhalov, chief of the Moscow branch of the nationalist Azerbaijani  Popular Front, noted: "We've called for organizing a commission to investigate  and find out who is responsible. But nothing justifies the violence the Soviet  army carried out against Baku and its innocent citizens."  </P> <P> So far, 139 Azerbaijanis have been arrested and charged with attacking  Armenians, hurling some from balconies and burning others alive. More than  13,000 Armenians were evacuated from Baku in mid-January, according to official  figures.  </P> <P> It is the Azerbaijani refugees who left Armenia in February, 1988, after the  first wave of violence over the Azerbaijani-controlled enclave of  Nagorno-Karabakh, who are thought to bear the primary blame for this month's  outbreak of violence against Armenians.  </P> <P> After 32 Armenians were killed in 1988 in a clash over the future of  Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150,000 Azerbaijanis living in Armenia, fearful of  retribution, moved to Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> Armenia and Azerbaijan both stake a historical claim to Nagorno-Karabakh, an  autonomous region within Azerbaijan. And the territorial dispute combined with  religious differences -- Armenians are mostly Christian -- has led to the  bloodiest of the many ethnic conflicts among the more than 100 nationalities of  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "The republic's government never did enough for those Azerbaijani refugees,"  Rustam-Zade said. "About 90,000 of them live in Baku in terrible conditions,  many in huts and without good jobs. They are bitter and, without doubt, some  are so angry they are ready to commit crimes."  </P> <P> Rustam-Zade, whose mother and brother live in Baku, said some stories told by  fleeing Armenians have made it appear that the 1.8 million people living in  Baku are all animals.  </P> <P> "That's causing trouble for everyone," he said. "The latest rumor, spread by  the Soviet military commander of Baku, is that Russian people are not safe  there. So we are getting dozens of telephone calls from Moscow and Leningrad,  with Russians threatening the safety of Azerbaijanis in those cities."  </P> <P> About 45,000 Azerbaijanis live in Leningrad and about 40,000 in Moscow.  Rustam-Zade said his people have been told that "if anything happens to a  single Russian in Azerbaijan," Azerbaijanis living in Moscow and Leningrad will  be punished.  </P> <P> The fear among Russians in Baku for their personal safety has given rise to  fresh panic among that city's Azerbaijanis, who are already emotionally  exhausted by events of the last two weeks, Rustam-Zade said.  </P> <P> "They think if the Russians are afraid to stay, maybe it is because the troops  are going to launch another bloody attack," he said.  </P> <P> Nationalism, long a factor in Azerbaijan, has burst into the open only in the  last couple of years, accompanied by a resurgence of religious passion.  </P> <P> After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Azerbaijan was an independent republic  until 1920, when Baku, riven by political dissension, fell without a shot to  Soviet troops.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's first step was to try to discourage or repress outright the  practice of Islam, and it had some success.  </P> <P> As the overt practice of Islam withered away in the 1930s, nationalist problems  declined as well. But there is evidence that many people, including young  people, have continued to quietly practice Islam.  </P> <P> All this created a situation that remained quietly unstable for years, coming  to the fore only with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rise to power in Moscow.  Gorbachev, in calling for greater tolerance, inadvertently helped bring on the  growth of Islamic power in Azerbaijan -- and the growth of nationalism.  </P> <P> Also during this time, Islamic fundamentalism was receiving a boost under the  leadership of radical Shiite Muslim leaders in Iran.  </P> <P> Azerbaijani leaders here say it is too late to try to crush the nationalism,  that it would only backfire.  </P> <P> "The Soviet army made a mistake," Shamkhalov said. "The Azerbaijani people will  no longer be forced into submission."  </P></p>

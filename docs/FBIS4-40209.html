			<p>BFN     [Text] A conference of heads of state structures,  concerned with CIS matters in presidential and governmental  apparatuses as well as in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and  Defense of CIS countries, is being held in Minsk. This is the  first meeting at such a high level, organized for the purpose of  working out the methods for improving CIS activities and the  furthering integration of CIS countries.    The conference participants, in particular, considered the  possibility of creating an economic union and a mechanism for  implementing this union. They also discussed the proposal of  Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev to create the  Euroasiatic Union which, as specific to the CIS, would enable  integration of the CIS countries into a closer economic and  political union, that is, to perform those functions which  formerly were attributed to the CIS. Commenting on this, CIS  Executive Secretary Ivan Karatchenya told our correspondent that  "the CIS, as an intergovernmental organization, could not prove  its value. Initially, the CIS played a huge part in disuniting  the single empire. A civilized "divorce" without blood and war  has been accomplished, and this gives credit to the CIS and its  bodies. However, many people, having felt that economically  this leads to a deadlock, began discussing the need for a union  on a new basis. In the first place -- an economic union, in the  second -- possibly, a political or military union, or some other  type of union. The point is whether the current politicians and  all of us are able to realize that we need to live together on  one-sixth of the dry land. Regarding Nazarbayev's initiative --  the creation of closer integration with the CIS through a  creation of supranational structures -- many people doubt  whether state heads will concede to it. At least, in the near  future. Regarding the reasons why many agreements within the  CIS framework do not work or work rather feebly, they are of an  objective nature: First, every country lives according to its  own laws. Second, many agreements have been signed only by some  CIS members. Finally, third, there are difficulties with the  ratification of adopted documents by the parliaments of CIS  countries. Not to mention other reasons, even Russia has not  yet ratified the agreement on the economic union; this agreement  is currently being discussed by the Federation Council and the  Duma, and there is no single opinion on this issue."</p>

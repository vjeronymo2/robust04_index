			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading PROFIT-TAKING after an early advance caused a sharp retreat in stock index futures and the March contract on the FT-SE 100 surrendered most of Monday's impressive gain, writes Joel Kibazo. The enthusiastic overnight performance on Wall Street seemed set to carry through into London when the March FT-SE contract opened at 2,985, some 12 points above Monday's strong finish. This positive mood, however, only lasted a short while before heavy selling drove the contract down. Profit-taking, together with some uncertainty following the UK government's setback over the Maastricht bill, seemed to be the main reason, although the weakness in the fixed interest rate markets also served to dampen sentiment. By 11am the contract was trading at 2,966 and, but for a brief rally over the lunchtime period, sellers continued to have the upper hand, a factor which also helped to pull the underlying cash market down. The day's low point of 2,950 was seen shortly after the New York opening. After a brief bout of short-covering, March ended at 2,959, down 14 from its previous close and around 8 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of minus 2. Turnover was 10,592 contracts. It was a dull day in traded options and volume was only 29,080 lots. The Euro FT-SE saw business of 3,049 and Marks and Spencer 3,065.</p>

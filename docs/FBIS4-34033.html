			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Teresa Valdez from the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] We must always consider the conditions for  committing a crime when deciding whether to bring someone to  trial. Take the case of a robbery at the enterprise supplying  sugarcane harvesters that was reviewed by the Fourth Havana  Provincial Court. The chief custodian testified that he realized  only on Sunday morning that the storehouse had been robbed of  merchandise in high demand, including ballpoints, brake fluid,  battery acid, work boots, and work clothes for the sugarcane  workers. The defendant testified that he had found the key to  the storehouse, opened it, entered, and took all he could. The  custodian who testified said he had trouble seeing what was  going on because he was at the other station, 200 meters away.  The stolen material was listed at the trial, and everything was  recovered.    Meanwhile, authorities at the same storehouse have come up  17,000 pesos short of goods during their inventory. The  investigating authorities are trying to pinpoint what is missing.    It is important to note that while the robbery led to the  defendant's appearance before the judge even though the stolen  merchandise was recovered, the shortage involving thousands of  pesos is merely being investigated.    I mention this because today's TRABAJADORES editorial  insists  that our country's so-called undergound economy thrives on  state-owned merchandise and that the stolen merchandise ends up  on the black market. The two situations violate the law in the  same way. Yet, which do you consider more important to society,  if we recall that life is the law and the law is life?</p>

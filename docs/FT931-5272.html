			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: On the high wire It is a sign of the times that the London market still wants to go up despite the bad news from Barclays. The most obvious reason is the accommodating stance taken by the Bundesbank. That not only raises the prospect that the UK will also soon be able to cut interest rates again. A stronger pound, coupled with the realisation that the UK could have the strongest economic performance in Europe this year, is pulling foreign buyers into British equities. Still, there are risks in these assumptions. The market seems to have brushed aside earlier worries on dividend growth. Barclays cut its payout this week. Results next week from the likes of Rolls-Royce and Willis Corroon may show it is not alone. Cookson demonstrated yesterday that the flow of rights issues is not necessarily over. The market's present level could look stretched if, as has often happened in the past, London is jumping to conclusions about the Bundesbank. Yesterday's quarter point cut in German money market rates makes a cut in the official rates almost inevitable. But the Bundesbank has also indicated that it will move cautiously, not least because of its fear that the D-Mark will weaken too much against the dollar. It may now be cutting the salami in thicker slices, but it is not yet disposed to hack it off in chunks. That puts Mr Norman Lamont in a quandary. The next Bundesbank council meeting is on March 18, two days after the Budget. If he is planning to sweeten any tax increases with a further rate cut, he will have to take a risk on matching action from the Bundesbank. Otherwise sterling would again look uncomfortably exposed.</p>

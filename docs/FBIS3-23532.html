Marshal of the  Soviet Union V. G. Kulikov, General of the Army V. I.  Varennikov, men who served with Nikolay Vasilyevich in the Great  Patriotic War, and representatives of veteran and public  organizations bade a fond farewell to the decedent at his  funeral in Novodevichye Cemetery. Marshal N. V. Ogarkov's  funeral was organized by the Ministry of Defense fully in  accordance with accepted ritual, established procedure, and  honors. Nonetheless we cannot shake a feeling of anger and  insult in connection with, mildly speaking, the strange  inattention to the decedent on the part of other official  agencies and the mass media. Thus, only KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carried  a notice of the death of Marshal N. V. Ogarkov, in an obituary  undersigned by the leadership of the Ministry of Defense. All  other publications, television and radio (except for the "Mayak"  program) remained silent as if nothing had happened. For this  reason thousands of citizens, including many war veterans, did  not have the opportunity to part with the decedent, and to see  him off on his final journey.    On 27 January only SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA and  VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA carried information on the funeral. Once  again the other publications were silent. Not a single  television program devoted a single minute to this funereal  event on the day of the funeral and on subsequent days. And yet,  on 26 January television viewers were shown, time and time  again, the harmless attack by some madman with a starting pistol  on England's Prince Charles, a lengthy interview with the  bankrupted former ministers and shock therapists Gaydar and  Fedorov, and other unimportant stories. But no time or room  could be found on the airwaves for a broadcast or even a brief  televised news report on the state--we emphasize the  state--funeral of a Marshal of the Soviet Union, veteran of the  Great Patriotic War and Hero of the Soviet Union. In the Sunday,  30 January "Itogi" program the anchorman uttered not a single  word about the death and funeral of Marshal N. V. Ogarkov.    We feel certain that this is not simply the professional  neglect of persons in positions of leadership in the mass media,  and not only a deliberate demonstration of their attitude toward  the decedent through the method of silence. This is but one  manifestation and a logical continuation of the discreditation  of the armed forces, of merited military chiefs, and of veterans  of the Great Patriotic War who saved the world from fascism,  begun back in the years of "perestroyka" by certain circles and  strata of our society, and still going on practically without  end.    As far as Marshal N. V. Ogarkov's funeral is concerned,  Ogarkov apparently simply cannot be forgotten by some of our  "reformers" working in government corridors of power and the  mass media for the fundamental position he took in the years of  "perestroyka." Everyone remembers his prophetic statement at the  Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union immediately  following the events of August 1991, in which Nikolay Vasilyvich  warned of the danger of the impending disintegration of the  Soviet Union, in which he turned out to be absolutely correct.  Nor can they forget N. V. Orgakov for his leadership of the  Union of War and Labor Veterans, the members of which supported,  in their overwhelming majority, the attempt by the lawful  leadership of the Soviet Union in August 1991 to avert the  trouble into which the country was steadily slipping. Nor could  the ill-wishers forget Nikolay Vasilyevich for his stern,  principled protests as inspector general of the armed forces  against the unjustified "treaties" hastily concluded by  Gorbachev to reduce, and for practical purposes to disarm the  army and navy, the division of our mighty Armed Forces of the  Soviet Union into "sovereign" chunks following the Belovezhskaya  agreement, and the distribution of military equipment and  armament, together with personnel, among the new so-called  "independent" states that appeared suddenly in place of our  former union republics.    We are outraged by the fact that such an insulting attitude  toward merited military chiefs departing from this life, and  through them toward the Armed Forces, is being planted in  Russia. We demand cessation of such a practice, and payment of  worthy honor to glorious Soviet military chiefs.    [Signed] V. Varennikov, General of the Army, Hero of the  Soviet Union; I.

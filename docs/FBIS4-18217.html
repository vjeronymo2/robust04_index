			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams by Jon Snow; </F> Adams in Belfast, Snow in London; from the "Channel Four News"  program; Adams words spoken by an actor -- recorded]    [Text] [Snow] What was the minimum condition required to  extend next week's 72-hour [IRA] cease-fire?    [Adams] Well, I don't think we should judge this in terms of  the time frame involved. I think we need to see it in terms of  the significance, in the potential, that it opens up. So  therefore, in my view, the opportunity provided should best be  utilized by the British Government dealing directly with Sinn  Fein on terms, not of negotiation or even of other matters, but  only in terms of clarification, and then all of the other  potentials open up. The whole potential for demilitarization,  because none of us are really interested in short stoppages by  one known group -- I mean the Loyalists are going crazy here at  the moment, the British Army is here in very large numbers.  What we need to do is to get the whole process moved away  beyond this stalemate, and that's the significance of this  initiative, that it provides the potential to break the  stalemate, to move us out of this critical phase of the peace  process into a more productive phase.    [Snow] What do you say to Douglas Hurd who says this is a  cynical exercise, your merely saying to people we're not going  to kill you now, we'll start killing you next Friday?    [Adams] Well, I could say the same of Mr. Hurd. I mean Mr.  Hurd's troops have been in my country for a very long time and  the last time I met Mr. Hurd we discussed this matter, and  unfortunately we're still stuck in the same situation. So what  I want to do -- and remember the British Government wouldn't  even be focused on this issue of Ireland if it wasn't for  initiatives coming from Ireland itself -- so what I want to do  is to utilize, to make the best of, to seize the potential to  move forward, because we have to move forward sooner rather than  later.    [Snow] Could you distill for me, very briefly, precisely  what  you want clarified?    [Adams] Three areas -- tactical matters and the declaration  itself, conflicting interpretations of the declaration, and the  processes envisaged in it; the three areas need clarification.    [Snow] How long would that clarification take?    [Adams] As long as it requires me or my colleagues to put to  someone authorized by Mr. Major those questions, and for them to  provide us with the answers.    [Adams] John Hume has said it could take an hour?    [Adams] Well, it may take even less than an hour, it might  take more, but the point is that the clarifications are required  and we wouldn't seek to protract. We don't want to see some  public climb-down, or by the British Government. One of the  ironies, one of the paradoxes of this situation is that all of  this comes at a time when the British prime minister is in a  weakened position, and you know, if I could turn an old, almost  cliche on it's head, in this case it may be that Ireland's  disadvantage could be England's or John Major's opportunity. So  we seek simply to get this clarification issue behind us and to  move into a new phase.    [Snow] Do the mechanics exist for the British Government,  the  Irish Government, to talk to you discreetly?    [Adams] Well, the Dublin Government has seen fit to quite  rightly provide us with clarification, and that has been  satisfactory, and I think they should be commended, and if the  London government had the same position on 15 December we would  now be far beyond the current critical stage. So the mechanisms  certainly do exist.</p>

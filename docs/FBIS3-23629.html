			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI Military Commentator </F> Aleksandr Zhilin, under the rubric: "Army": "A Yellow Trident on  Rusty Armor"]    [Text] The hope that the CIS States would be able to  preserve the common armed forces died at that moment when  Ukraine announced its intention to build its own army. "Having  nationalized" the troops located on its territory, Kiev  destroyed the once unified defense complex but it didn't manage  to properly utilize what it obtained as an inheritance. Today,  the Ukrainian National Army (UNA) is that same mirage that it  was two years ago.    Ukraine always played a key role in the Union's defense  system. The Soviet General Staff proceeded from the concept that  the primary threat to the country's security emanates from the  West and therefore Moscow did not begrudge the resources to  strengthen the western borders. The newest military equipment  and the most effective weapons were first and foremost supplied  to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany and also to the  Carpathian and Odessa military districts. Ukrainian  military-industrial complex enterprises, which composed  30% of  the USSR's defense potential, received enormous investments from  the center.    Ukraine obtained a truly luxurious inheritance from the  Soviet Armed Forces. Besides 176 RS-18 (SS-19) and RS-22 (SS-24)  intercontinental ballistic missiles, 1,280 warheads and more  than 40 Tu-95MS and Tu-160 strategic bombers with 600 air-based  cruise missiles, Ukraine "privatized" second strategic echelon  regiments and divisions -- the most combat capable military  units. This is 20 motorized-rifle and tank divisions, coastal  defense forces, several airborne assault formations, three  high-powered artillery divisions, and hundreds of special  purpose units and subunits. Add to that four air armies armed  with 230 fighter aviation aircraft and 620 ground attack  aircraft. And, furthermore, Ukraine obtained 330 strike  helicopters; units and formations of an independent PVO [air  defense] army; missile attack warning system, intelligence, and  communications facilities and so on. Taking into account the  personnel of all military structures, the strength of the units  and formations totaled approximately 700,000 men.    This enormous quantity of troops had a powerful technical  base at that time. Its inventory consisted of new T-64 and T-72  tanks; BMP-1, BMP-2, BTR-70, BTR-80, and BRM-1K armored  vehicles; 2A65, 2S19, BM-21, and 9P140 -- artillery and missile  systems; "Tochka" tactical missile systems; S-200 and S-300 air  defense missile systems; Mi-6, Mi-8, Mi-9 and Mi-24 helicopters;  and, MiG-25, MiG-29, Su-24, Su-25 and Su-27 aircraft.    However, in the final analysis this mighty military  potential  did a disservice to Ukraine, having hung heavy weights on its  economy and budget.    According to the experts, when it began creating its own  army, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense initially permitted  several elementary errors. First of all, it did not assess the  actual expenditures associated with the maintenance and storage  of weapons. Second, it did not resolve a fundamental issue: What  is reasonable sufficiency of military equipment and personnel,  taking into account the capabilities of the economy and the  state budget. Third, it did not become involved with the  immediate sale of excess equipment to the national economy and  excess weapons and military vehicles -- abroad. As a result,  today all of the military equipment is in such a deplorable  state that it can be sold only for scrap.  <H6>  Reform According to Morozov </H6>   In 1992, Ukrainian Minister of Defense General Morozov  announced that he was beginning a four-stage military reform.  The mechanisms for command and control of the troops would be  established in the first stage (1992-1993), a strategic plan for  the employment of the armed forces would be developed in the  second stage (1993-1994) and, a mobilized deployment and reserve  training system would be developed in the third (1995). By that  time, they assumed the strength of the Ukrainian National Army  would be reduced to 400,000-450,000 servicemen and to  200,000-250,000 servicemen by the year 2000 (the fourth stage).    At that time, it was announced that the Ukrainian armed  forces would consist of three types of troops -- ground troops,  the air force and the navy. They proposed creating two  operational commands -- Western and Southern -- based upon the  military districts.    In Morozov's words, 1993 was to have become the key year,  during the course of which they would have to "resolve the  primary group of issues associated with the qualitative  transformations of the army". Alas, this year turned out to be  "key" only for the minister of defense who was forced into  retirement.    General Vitaliy Radetskiy, who replaced Morozov, openly  announced at an 18 January press conference that "the armed  forces still do not have a unified command and control system  and mastery of military terminology is an important problem". In  other words, the new minister of defense admitted that he will  have to begin military reform practically from the beginning.    According to observers, the fact that the former minister of  defense was too dependent on the political situation was the  primary reason for the failure of "reform according to Morozov".  This may have been explained in part by the fact that the  "Russian general" at the head of the military department was  immediately perceived by certain circles as a potential "traitor  of Ukrainian national interests". Therefore, from the first day  in the minister's post, Morozov was compelled to be less  involved with the organizational development of the army and  more involved with maneuvering among the president, parliament,  the government, nationalists, communists, and Democrats...    The aspiration to immediately please all political forces  did  not leave any chances to achieve any definite concept of  military reform. And essentially all innovations were reduced to  the fact that the commanders began to appoint those who had  "Ukrainian" written on their military identity cards and  knowledge of the Ukrainian language became the main criterion of  professional training.    "A regimental commander told us frankly: Henceforth the main  thing for us is not to fly well but to issue commands and to  conduct radio exchanges in the Ukrainian language", says  Military Pilot Aleksandr Serdyuk. "As they say, we got the  message and began to master Ukrainian. And no one really knows  military terms, other terms simply do not exist in the Ukrainian  language, and therefore we communicate primarily in obscene  international slang..."    "The most horrible thing is that from the beginning the  Ukrainian Army began to be built on the most loathsome Soviet  principles," says former Ukrainian Ministry of Defense Central  Staff Associate Colonel Vasiliy Osipenko. "Total window  dressing, eye wash, corruption and absolute indifference to the  actual state of combat readiness of units and subunits. The  chain reaction of deception began with Morozov's optimistic  reports to the president in which it was argued that the  difficulties in the army were temporary."    Characterizing the state of the army, one highly-placed  Ukrainian Ministry of Defense bureaucrat pointed out that the  level of combat readiness had been reduced by more than  70%. In  his words, pilots who do not at all know how to fly as a pilot  in command are being graduated from military flying schools.  "Taking into account the extremely unfavorable situation with  nuclear weapons storage and the critical social tension in the  troops, the Ukrainian armed forces are dangerous first and  foremost for their own country."    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The Deployment of the USSR Armed Forces in the Republics                  |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Republic      |Divisions     |Aircraft      |Intercontinen-|Heavy Bombers |  |              |              |              |tal Missiles  |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia        |71            |2,380         |1,035         |70            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ukraine       |20            |850           |176           |43            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belarus       |10            |470           |72            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kazakhstan    |4             |340           |104           |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Uzbekistan    |1             |290           |--            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Turkmeniya    |4             |160           |--            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kyrgyzstan    |1             |--            |--            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Armenia       |3             |--            |--            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Azerbaijan    |4             |130           |--            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Georgia       |4             |240           |--            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moldova       |1             |--            |--            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Estonia       |1             |110           |--            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Latvia        |1             |180           |--            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lithuania     |4             |70            |--            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Numerical Composition of the Strategic Forces on the Territories of Be-|  |larus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |       |Intercontinent-|SLBM's [submar-|Heavy bombers  |Total          |  |       |al missiles    |ine-launched b-|               |               |  |       |               |allistic missi-|               |               |  |       |               |les]           |               |               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Countr-|Platfo-|Warhea-|Platfo-|Warhea-|Platfo-|Warhea-|Platfo-|Warhea-|  |ies    |rms    |ds     |rms    |ds     |rms    |ds     |rms    |ds     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belarus|81     |81     |--     |--     |--     |--     |81     |81     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kazakh-|98     |980    |--     |--     |40     |240    |138    |1,220  |  |stan   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia |912    |3,970  |788    |2,652  |79     |271    |1,779  |6,893  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ukraine|176    |1,240  |--     |--     |43     |372    |219    |1,612  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total  |1,267  |6,271  |788    |2,652  |162    |883    |2,217  |9,806  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H6>  An Army of Turncoats? </H6>   Having an inadequate number of its own skilled command  cadres, Ukraine at one time attempted to entice them from the  CIS countries. Already in 1991, the Ukrainian Cabinet of  Ministers adopted a decree on increasing staff salaries by a  factor of 2.5 and rank salaries by a factor of 1.5. At that  time, officer salaries in Ukraine significantly exceeded the  salaries of their colleagues in the near abroad. The widely  advertised law "On Pension Support of Servicemen and Command and  Rank and File Individuals of the Internal Affairs Organs" played  its role. Officers, army and naval warrant officers, and  extended service military personnel who agreed to take the  Ukrainian oath were promised: For 20 years service, a pension --  50 percent of the salary and, those released due to illness --  55 percent plus three percent of that sum for each year of  service over 20 years.    Currently, all of these benefits have worked out so that the  salary of the Ukrainian minister of defense in coupons is  equivalent to the salary of a Russian major in rubles. But at  that time many officers were bought by the generous promises and  rushed to be transferred to serve in Ukraine.    Today, the situation has drastically changed; of ten  military  academy students, only one agrees to go serve in the Ukrainian  National Army. But then again, the reverse process is gaining  momentum before our very eyes.    "Recently, officers are running from Ukraine to Russia  nearly  in entire subunits," asserts Reserve Colonel of Justice Sergey  Borisenko. "Previously, it was as if they sought a plausible  pretext to change their duty location. Now they drive to Moscow  without notice and knock on every door of the Russian Ministry  of Defense."    This is the sad result of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense  leaders' reliance on officer-turncoats. This is entirely  legitimate since a serviceman who has once betrayed the oath for  the sake of a higher salary is entirely capable of betraying it  ten more times for that same reason.    Noting the decline of morale and the moral potential of the  Ukrainian Army, psychologists think that the enormous gap  between the promised material benefits and the beggarly (in real  life) state is the reason for that. The situation is worsened by  the fact that the officers and generals who took the Ukrainian  oath in exchange for the promised material welfare (and they are  63% of the Ukrainian National Army) are least of all  concerned  about Ukraine's national interests or the ideology of national  revival. They were prepared to serve here for good money. But  there is no money and there is no obligation. Those are the  rules of the game that the Ukrainian authorities themselves set.  <H6>  The Half-Life </H6>   The fact that the military equipment that the Ukrainian  National Army obtained is rusting and being destroyed is not so  terrible. The moral "corrosion" of the personnel is far more  terrible.    "If I lived on the salary that I earn in the army, I would  have long ago lived by begging," says Military Pilot Senior  Lieutenant Yaroslav Fedoseyev. "All the more so that they delay  payment of the paltry sum of this salary to us for 2-3 months.  Therefore, I run a business in my off-duty time (and we "serve"  from 0900 to 1300 -- there's nothing to fly in). Previously, my  wife and I rushed to Poland to buy things. Today, I am involved  in smuggling gasoline from Russia."    And here is the revelation of Junior Aircraft Technician  Senior Lieutenant A.R.: "The most widespread business among  junior officers is narcotics trafficking. All officer  dormitories are overflowing with "grass". Commanders prefer to  sell materiel, fuel, and construction materials. Everything that  enjoys the slightest demand is being sold. Our regimental  commander contrived to purchase two automobiles and to build  three garages during the three summer months."    The pilots of an air base in the city of Artsiz told us  about  a noteworthy incident. In the middle of the night, they reported  to the unit duty officer that the entire guard detail was drunk.  While the officer went up to the guard room on foot, the drunken  soldiers grabbed assault rifles and cartridges and left in a  motor vehicle to go see some girls. The duty officer and several  other officers rushed off in pursuit in their Zhigulis (there  were no other serviceable vehicles in the regiment). They caught  up with the soldiers. And... the situation drastically changed.  Now the already armed soldiers began to pursue the officers.  Rushing back to the garrison, the duty officer and his  assistants barricaded themselves in the duty office. The  soldiers attempted to take the building by storm but they  couldn't pull it off because of their drunken state. Then they  shot up the Zhigulis. This emergency situation ended with the  punishment of the duty officer for... having driven to work in  his own vehicle.    Of course, there are enough similar stories in the Russian  Army. The shortage of soldiers is worsening the situation both  in Russia and in Ukraine. In a recent interview in SHCHIT I MECH  newspaper, Military Procurator Major-General of Justice Vasiliy  Melnichuk said: "No more than 12 out of every 100 young men are  serving in Ukraine... The number of evasions of service in the  army is 35% of all military crimes in the western region  of the  republic."    Military analysts think that only urgent military reform can  stop the decline of the Ukrainian Army that has not yet been  born. But it must take into account not only the aspiration for  independence but also the state of the economy. Otherwise, the  question will arise already tomorrow, who will die earlier: The  army or the economy?</p>

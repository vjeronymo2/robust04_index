			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Unit trust sales decline sharply Sales of unit trusts fell sharply last month, reversing the strong sales pattern of the first half of the year. Net sales fell to Pounds 646.4m in July from June's record Pounds 1.1bn. It was the weakest sales figure since January. Last month's figure was also down by almost one-third from net sales of Pounds 954.6m in July last year. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Trusts, which released the figures, said that the falls were dominated by lower net sales through private-client and pension-fund channels. It said this might reflect a switch by discretionary managers into direct holdings of UK equities at the expense of unit trusts - which are pooled investments - with unit trusts used for overseas holdings. Mr Philip Warland, the association's director-general, said the fall in sales looked worse than it actually was because June's figures had been inflated. He said: 'One member switched all their direct equity Personal Equity Plans (a tax-free savings vehicle) into unit trust Peps which gave a boost to the retail side.' He said that this was not enough to explain the lower volume of net sales across all distribution channels, but suggested that more people could be holding cash. The Building Societies Association has reported a rise in savings inflows for July, with net receipts of Pounds 286m. It has had net outflows for four of the past seven months. Unit trusts attracted a record Pounds 9bn last year, in a climate of low interest rates. They have pulled in Pounds 5.98bn in net sales so far this year against Pounds 5.3bn in the same period last year. The value of unit trust funds in July was Pounds 97.7bn.</p>

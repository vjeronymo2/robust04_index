			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Vallance urges telecoms market reforms in Japan Japan needs to open its telecommunications market to international competition and remove the barrier between domestic and international businesses if it is to meet the changing telecommunications needs of users, Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, said in Tokyo yesterday, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. As a result of tight regulation of its telecoms market, it was a struggle for international telecommunications operators such as BT to provide end-to-end services for customers in the region. The British telecommunications company has been seeking to provide voice telephony to corporate customers in Japan but has been hindered by regulations, Sir Iain said. At the same time, NTT, the Japanese domestic telecoms operator, is not allowed to provide international services, preventing a direct link-up with BT. Instead, BT had linked up with an NTT subsidiary to provide global communications services. The high degree of regulation was also denying Japanese users the full benefits of new services and competitive pricing, Sir Iain warned. The Japanese government may decide next year whether to break up NTT and encourage competition.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST BACKS REFORMS IN EAST BLOC;  </P> <P> SUMMIT PLEDGES JOINT ACTION ON POLAND, HUNGARY  </P> <P> President Bush and the other leaders at the annual summit meeting of seven  major industrial democracies agreed Saturday to take concerted action in  support of economic reforms that have been launched in Poland and Hungary.  </P> <P> But apart from promising to funnel surplus food to Poland through the European  Community, the summit leaders did not pledge any specific sum of financial aid  to the two East European countries. Instead, they said officials of nations  interested in supporting Poland and Hungary would hold a meeting within the  next few weeks.  </P> <P> Meeting on the 35th floor of the stark, angular Arche de la Defense, an  arch-shaped office building in a Paris suburb, the leaders declared: "We  welcome the process of reform under way in Poland and Hungary. We recognize  that the political changes taking place in these countries will be difficult to  sustain without economic progress."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unexpected Proposal  </P> <P> Simultaneously, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose economic and  political reforms in the Soviet Union have made possible the changes in Poland  and Hungary, sent a letter to the leaders meeting in Paris in which he urged  closer economic relations between the Soviet Union and the summit nations.  </P> <P> The summit leaders, in addition to their pledge of support for Poland and  Hungary, took a variety of actions in the first of two working days in the 15th  annual economic summit. They:  </P> <P>  -- Issued a brief declaration condemning political repression in China and  agreeing that the World Bank should postpone new loans to that country.  </P> <P>  -- Spent an unusual amount of time discussing international environmental  issues but came to few agreements on specific measures that the summit nations  should take.  </P> <P>  -- Planned measures to combat international drug trafficking.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Most Harmonious' Summit  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who attended the previous eight summits  as an official of the Ronald Reagan Administration, described the 1989 edition  as "the most harmonious" of all.  </P> <P> So harmonious was it that the summit leaders decided to end their summit today  after lunch, canceling a dinner that French President Francois Mitterrand had  planned for them at the Elysee Palace.  </P> <P> Bush, who came directly here from a four-day visit to Poland and Hungary, urged  the other summit leaders -- from France, Britain, Italy, West Germany, Canada  and Japan -- to endorse the concerted approach to aiding the two countries'  reform movements.  </P> <P> During his East European visit, Bush announced a modest aid package for both  countries, including aid of $100 million for Poland and $25 million for Hungary  to help develop private enterprise. He said he would like to see other summit  nations make similar contributions.  </P> <P> Although the summit nations' "Declaration on East-West Relations" included no  specific financial aid, Baker told reporters that Bush got what he wanted "in  the form of a commitment for concerted support" and quick action in  rescheduling Poland's foreign debt. And some of the summit countries, Baker  said, "are going to be making specific economic incentives available" to Poland  and Hungary.  </P> <P> The summit leaders announced that the representatives of "all interested  countries" will meet "in the next few weeks" to discuss specific forms of  support for Poland and Hungary. "We underline, for Poland, the urgent need for  food in present circumstances."  </P> <P> West German officials said their chancellor, Helmut Kohl, had proposed that  surplus food from Western countries be channeled to Poland through the Economic  Community. Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski had asked Mitterrand, as the  summit's host, for credits to buy food, but the summit nations rejected that  approach because Poland is already deep in debt to the West.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Support for Poland Pushed  </P> <P> Baker said Bush was eager to follow up on support for reform in Poland and  Hungary "as expeditiously" as possible, "and, in fact, had written the heads of  state prior to coming to the summit requesting that this action be taken."  </P> <P> The East-West declaration also:  </P> <P>  -- Favors early conclusion of negotiations between Poland and the  International Monetary Fund as part of Poland's debt rescheduling strategy.  </P> <P>  -- Applauds leaders in Eastern Europe who are working with reform movements to  bring about greater political and economic freedom, but "strongly" condemns  others who "are still endeavoring to resist this movement by taking repressive  measures."  </P> <P>  -- Calls upon the Soviet government to "translate its new policies and  pronouncements into further concrete action at home and abroad."  </P> <P> In a day devoted to foreign policy, the summit nations also turned their  attention to China. In a written declaration, they "condemned the violent  repression in China in defiance of human rights" and urged authorities there  "to cease action against those who have done no more than claim their  legitimate rights to democracy and liberty."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bush's Steps Supported  </P> <P> The steps endorsed at the summit reflect many of those taken by the Bush  Administration. Many, including suspension of high-level contacts with Chinese  authorities, have already been taken by the other six nations.  </P> <P> The declaration made a special reference to "the grave concern felt by the  people of Hong Kong" after the massacre in Beijing last month of pro-democracy  demonstrators.  </P> <P> The question of Hong Kong, now a crown colony of Britain, came up during a  breakfast meeting between Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  The British have agreed to turn the colony over to China on July 1, 1997.  </P> <P> Apart from that breakfast, held at the American ambassador's residence, and an  evening meeting at the Louvre, Bush spent most of the day in the meeting room  at the Arche de la Defense.  </P> <P> On other matters, the summit partners commited themselves "to uphold  international standards of human rights" and renewed their commitment to make  "no concessions to terrorists or their sponsors."  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Dissatisfaction  </P> <P> While the issue of terrorism rarely divides the seven summit nations, the  United States has been dissatisfied with what it views as West Germany's less  than ardent law enforcement measures against terrorists and France's  inclination to swap terrorists for French hostages.  </P> <P> The declaration on terrorism also said that the summit nations agreed to give  priority to preventing such attacks as the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over  Scotland last December, an act that caused 270 deaths.  </P> <P> The summit members devoted more time than in the past to environmental issues,  which William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,  said are "beginning to move from the margins to the mainstream of concern."  Reilly credited Bush for this, but growing environmental concerns have become  increasingly important politically in the six other summit nations.  </P> <P> Reilly, the first EPA administrator to travel to an international economic  summit conference, said there is an emerging consensus that "these issues are  significant, are important, are worthy of concern at the very highest levels of  government."  </P> <P> However, the summit leaders, in the final communique they issue today, appeared  unlikely to recommend specific action regarding such international  environmental issues as deforestation, oceanic oil spills and  chlorofluorocarbon emissions. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney hoped  merely to gain support for an international summit conference on environmental  matters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus on Environment  </P> <P> A Canadian official said the summit leaders focused on the environment during  their one-hour evening session at the I. M. Pei-designed pyramid that serves as  the new entrance to the Louvre. "It's clear that the world is moving to some  kind of a law of the atmosphere," the official said, suggesting as a precedent  the international maritime laws.  </P> <P> American environmentalists who converged on Paris declared themselves  unimpressed by the summit. "Rhetoric is terrific, discussions are great, but we  feel it's time for specific commitments," said Rafe Pomerance of the World  Resources Institute.  </P> <P> On the issue of the international narcotics trade, which Canadian Finance  Minister Michael H. Wilson called "an important part of the summit," the  leaders made plans for a study and a meeting.  </P> <P> The study, an American initiative, will be of the laundering of drug money to  obscure its source. "There is a common thread that goes through drugs, and  that's money," said a senior Administration official who asked not to be  identified.  </P> <P> The meeting, sought by Thatcher, will examine ways the industrial nations can  cut down on demand for drugs. It will be held next summer in Britain.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Art Pine and Rone Tempest contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BUSH'S SCHEDULE  </P> <P> 8:45 a.m. today. Arrives at American Cathedral of Paris to attend Sunday  services.  </P> <P> 9:45 a.m. -- Arrives at Arch de la Defense for plenary session, followed by  working luncheon.  </P> <P> 6:05 p.m. -- Arrives at Meridien Hotel for press conference.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS /GEORGE L. PERRY: A MESSAGE FOR S&amp;L LOBBY,  CONGRESS  </P> <P> As you may have noticed from the business pages, savings and loan institutions  -- thrifts, for short -- have been going bankrupt at an alarming rate during  the past few years. Because the deposits at these institutions are insured  against loss by a federal government agency, the Federal Savings and Loan  Insurance Corp., depositors' money is not at risk.  </P> <P> But the record number of bankruptcies long ago exhausted the FSLIC's reserves,  so the government must provide funds to make good on the deposit insurance.  Doing so is the first objective of legislation before Congress, and it is  generally agreed that, if the problem does not worsen, it will cost $100  billion to $150 billion.  </P> <P> The second objective of the legislation is to change the rules governing  thrifts to avoid repeating the present crisis in the future or having the  present crisis spread much further and cost much more than is now projected.  </P> <P> One might have thought that, in a demonstrable crisis that already is costing  taxpayers megabucks, business in Washington as usual might be suspended. Yet  the lobby for the thrift industry continues on its narrowly self-serving way,  and many in Congress, despite all that has happened, seem unwilling to resist  that pressure. Unless it changes direction soon, Congress will have weakened  the legislation originally offered by the Administration and so will have  increased the likelihood of a renewed thrift crisis in the future and increased  the cost that taxpayers will eventually bear.  </P> <P> Mutual Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Pasadena recently reacted to all this in a  refreshing way. The institution, controlled by the fabled investor Warren E.  Buffett and chaired by Charles T. Munger, resigned in disgust from the U.S.  League of Savings Institutions, the industry's main lobbying group.  </P> <P> In pulling out of the league, Munger offered a remarkably salty assessment of  its actions to date. "The league responds to the savings and loan mess as Exxon  would have responded to the oil spill from the Valdez if it had insisted  thereafter on liberal use of whiskey by tanker captains," he said. For good  measure, he added, "It is not unfair to liken the situation now facing Congress  to cancer and to liken the league to a significant carcinogenic agent."  </P> <P> We can applaud Buffet and Munger for calling attention to the harm being done  by the S&amp;L lobby. But they should have directed some of their attention to  Congress itself, whose members should understand the problem and the harm they  can do.  </P> <P> Underlying the problems of the thrift industry and the risk of huge additional  costs to taxpayers from future insolvencies is the perverse incentive structure  that exists for insured depository institutions. Because deposits are insured,  depositors have little concern for how safely management invests their money.  Depositors mainly go where they get the highest interest rate. A thrift can  take exceptional risks, and its depositors are unlikely to know -- let alone  care. If the big risk succeeds, the thrift makes a lot of money. If it fails,  the depositors are insured.  </P> <P> Of course, there are still losses to the owners if the thrift fails. But the  amount of owners' capital at risk is very small relative to the total of  deposits and investments, so any major gains accrue to the owners, while any  major losses are borne mainly by the insurance system. This asymmetry between  possible gain and loss can and has been used to advantage by unscrupulous  owners.  </P> <P> But even honorably run institutions can be driven to take excessive risk if  doing so offers a chance to save the institution from insolvency. If an  institution initially gets into trouble because economic conditions turn some  of its loans and investments sour, losses can erode its capital to the point at  which it amounts to, say, less than 1% of its assets. The owners have little or  nothing left to lose. Yet taking risks with the assets offers the chance for  profits that could rescue the institution from insolvency. In effect, the owner  is invited to gamble -- with a chance of winning big and with the insurance  fund's money available to cover losses.  </P> <P> It is evident that the insurance system needs some greater discipline to  neutralize the incentives for excessive risk taking that otherwise exist. One  kind of proposal would tighten restrictions on what investments an institution  is allowed to make. The usual proposal would restrict thrifts more closely to  mortgage lending, which historically was their main activity. However, the net  effect of such restrictions is uncertain because a more diversified portfolio  should reduce the risk associated with economic fluctuations.  </P> <P> That leaves stiffer capital requirements, which would put more of the owners'  money at risk, as the main discipline that is available and that is widely  agreed to be necessary. The Administration had proposed gradually bringing the  capital requirements of thrifts up to the 6% capital requirement of banks.  </P> <P> The powerful thrift lobby has been pressuring Congress not only to settle for a  capital requirement only half that large but to allow "good will" -- the value  of a company in excess of its tangible assets -- to count as capital for  purposes of meeting the requirement. The Congress might remember that  taxpayers, who will have to pick up the tab for thrift failures, cannot meet  their tax obligations with "good will."  </P></p>

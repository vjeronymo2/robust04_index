			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Top marks for polymer pencils It takes about 30 manufacturing operations to transform graphite, wood, glue and paint into pencils. But where wood is in short supply, polymer pencils could be an attractive alternative. That is the view of Krupp Bellaform, a German manufacturer of extrusion lines, which has developed a process for the continuous production of pencils made of graphite, polymer compound and paint. About 7,000 pencils 168mm long and 7.5mm in diameter can be produced an hour using the new process - which is simpler than that for wood pencils - leading to reduced production costs. But it also opens up lucrative market opportunities, says Krupp, because the polymer casing can be formed into all manner of shapes - grooved, serrated, heart-shaped.

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Central Capital wins protection from creditors CENTRAL Capital, the Canadian financial services group which includes the country's fourth-largest trust company, has been granted court protection from 39 senior unsecured creditors, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. An Ontario court froze all other claims against Central Capital under the federal Companies Creditors Arrangement Act and appointed Peat Marwick Thorne as administrator. The 39 creditors, led by the Royal Bank of Canada which is owed CDollars 550m (USDollars 462m), will ask for a supervised restructuring of Central Capital, transferring its mortgage insurance and general insurance arms to the creditors. Central Capital owes a total of about CDollars 1.7bn. Its 80 per cent-owned trust subsidiary is in the process of being sold. Mr Bill Woloshyn, a lawyer for Royal Bank of Canada, said the creditors wanted to secure maximum recovery and ensure that a restructured Central Capital can survive.</p>

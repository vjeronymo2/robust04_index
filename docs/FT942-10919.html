			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Books: A great chain of changing vision - Fiction A WAY IN THE WORLD by VS Naipaul Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 369 pages It has to be said at once that VS Naipaul's new book is not a 'novel' in the usual sense of the word. His publisher bravely claims that A Way in the World is 'unconfined by the conventional novel form, but in a classical story-telling tradition'. So what is it, this so-called first novel for seven years from one of today's half-dozen most esteemed writers in the English language? The answer lies in Sir Vidia's own (I assume) sub-title - A Sequence. It is a collection of nine self-contained but inter-linked episodes drawing on the writer's autobiographical memories of Trinidad and the adjacent South American coast, and adding a number of extended versions of scenes from the history of that region. It becomes, I suggest, a Meditation on a number of themes - on the Caribbean's historical legacy, on the relationship between Indian and African, on the clash between Spanish and British imperialism, on colonialism itself. The format is so unusual that it needs description. We start with a brief youthful memory of Leonard Side, Trinidadian mortician and cake decorator, who possesses 'an idea of beauty', an inheritance whose origins must remain a mystery. We continue with another fragment of autobiography, still in Trinidad, which begins to develop the wider theme of the book - the unknowable sequence of the island from aboriginal settlement to 18th century Spanish settlement to English marauding, and then colonial rule, up to more recent immigrations. Then we have a 'story' based on a modern-day up-country expedition, with the first (and mystifying) sighting of a doublet from Tudor times, relic of an old betrayal, later to be explained. And so back to Naipaul's early years in London, where he discovers his metier and begins to understand 'the great chain of changing outside vision' of the Caribbean, starting with John Hawkins and Sir Walter Raleigh. From here, after a portrait of the Trinidad-Panamian communist 'Lebrun' and his role in the writer's development, we are ready for extended chapters on Raleigh and Francisco Miranda, the Venezuelan revolutionary, precursor of Bolivar, who, like Raleigh two centuries before, ended an adventurous life in a prison cell. Naipaul's fascination with Miranda is palpable and his chapter 'In the Gulf of Desperation' is brilliantly done, stimulating some of his persistent themes. Initially, writes Naipaul, 'I saw him as a very early colonial, someone with a feeling of incompleteness, with very little at home to fall back on, with an idea of a great world out there, someone who, when he was out in this world, had to re-invent himself. I saw in him some of my own early promptings . . . But Miranda was also, right through, from the time he left home, something of a confidence man . . .' Naipaul is reminding us here not so much of his Caribbean fiction as of his wonderful history of the area, The Middle Passage. He finishes with a brief chapter that takes us back to his two East Africa masterpieces, In A Free State and A Bend in the River. This chapter is autobiography again, taken from his teaching days at Makerere in Uganda. We have come full circle: Blair, the Trinidadian colleague we have earlier met in pre-student days, has become an international civil servant; he visits, is murdered. He will be buried in the funeral parlour that features in chapter one. Naipaul celebrates him. So what is this? Not a novel. A Sequence. A meditation by a fine writer who no longer needs the formulas, no longer cares for the demands, and perhaps the limitations, of traditional fiction.</p>

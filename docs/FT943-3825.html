			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Long-term US bond yields open this week within a whisker of their highest level since the US interest rate cycle turned, and it will take some encouraging consumer price figures on Tuesday to prevent them breaking higher still. The unexpectedly strong rise in core producer prices in August pushed the yield on the long bond up by 14 basis point on Friday. At 7.7 per cent, the yield ended the week just two basis points short of its July peak. The yield on two-year Treasury notes, meanwhile, climbed to a new high of 6.32 per cent as the market anticipated an acceleration in the Federal Reserve Board's programme for tightening interest rates. The chances of the Fed delaying until the November 15 meeting of its policy-making committee seemed to recede. Whether bonds lose further ground this week will depend largely on the August consumer price index. The general view is that higher petrol prices will push the index up by 0.4 per cent, the biggest monthly jump since early 1993. Excluding food and energy, the index is expected to show a rise of 0.3 per cent compared with July. Among other figures for August due this week, the bond market will have an eye on retail sales, due on Wednesday, and industrial production, on Friday.</p>

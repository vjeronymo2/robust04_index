			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATOR'S AIDE TAKES A CRACK AT A CODE  </P> <P> Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) says there might be merit in the work of an aide  who thought he discovered a code word by playing Administration officials'  Persian Gulf speeches backward.  </P> <P> But Pell, who is seeking a sixth term, said aide C. B. Scott Jones, who is paid  to study paranormal phenomena, did not have permission to write Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney questioning whether "Simone" was a code word.  </P> <P> Jones' Oct. 3 letter on Senate stationery, which was sent anonymously to  several Rhode Island news outlets this week, said the word appeared when  speeches by President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Cheney  were played backward.  </P> <P> "I mention this situation in case it is a code word that would not be in the  national interest to be known," the letter said. "If the word means nothing  special to you, this is a non-event, just another mystery in a new technology  we are developing."  </P> <P> Pell's long-standing interest in the paranormal brings periodic snickers from  his Capitol Hill colleagues. Jones, 62, a six-year veteran of Pell's staff who  earns about $50,000 annually, is assigned to study developments in paranormal  phenomena.  </P> <P> Pell is seeking reelection against Rep. Claudine Schneider. He said the timing  of the letter "certainly isn't helpful."  </P> <P> Jones was reprimanded for his actions, said Pell's chief of staff, Thomas G.  Hughes Jr. Pell said he had not known about the letter until reporters  questioned him about it.  </P> <P> Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the Providence  Journal-Bulletin that the reverse speech theory "sounds wacky, (but) there may  be some merit to it" because he trusts Jones.  </P> <P> The senator said he thought Jones was concerned that the alleged code word was  accessible and that the letter was "motivated by patriotic reasons."  </P> <P> Jones said the reverse speech theory, which is relatively new to him, holds  that audio tapes played backward can disclose the hidden codes or thoughts  behind normal, forward speech. Someone alerted him to the "Simone" theory, and  he decided to alert Cheney, a longtime friend of his, he said.  </P></p>

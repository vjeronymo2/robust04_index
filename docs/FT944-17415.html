			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Rail company switches to buses One of the newly created train operating companies is to use buses for some services on one of its branch lines because of a shortage of guards. North London Railways said the shortage was not the result of the break-up of British Rail. But its move has strengthened fears that small privatised railway companies will face operating difficulties because they are unable to call on resources from other parts of the railway network. The train company initially announced plans to replace all services on its Bedford to Bletchley branch line with buses so that it could assign staff to the main Northampton-London Euston services. But yesterday it said it had reached an agreement for some guards to work 12-hour shifts instead of the more normal eight hours, maintaining a train service on the line for most of the day. North London was caught out when 25 of the 97 guards at its Bletchley depot were successful in their applications to move to other depots. Guards sometimes wait years for the depot of their choice to come up. If a guard is successful in his application he is allowed to move with-in eight weeks, although it can take 13 weeks to train a new guard from scratch. The shortage of guards has led to an increase in the number of train cancellations. North London said it had decided to concentrate guards on its main line, carrying 30,000 passengers a day, and to reduce its service on the branch line, which carries only 800 passengers. North London said that even under BR it would have taken time to retrain guards from other routes. But Mr Alan Francis, transport spokesman for the Green party, blamed the reduced service on privatisation, saying BR managers could pool staff in times of shortage. BR said service reductions because of staff shortages were unusual, and the last time this happened was six or seven years ago. North London said its temporary timetable involving buses would last until November 21, when it would resume a full train service. It said 43 new guards had been recruited or were being trained.</p>

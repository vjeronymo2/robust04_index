			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcement by the Foreign Ministry spokesman in Tirana on </F> 27 May -- recorded]    [Text] Mr. Khristodhoulos Tsalikis, ambassador of the  Greek Republic in Tirana, was summoned to a meeting at the  Foreign Ministry today. He was notified of a complaint in the  name of the Albanian Foreign Ministry regarding completely  unfounded claims on the alleged new arrests of Albanian citizens  of Greek origin.    Mr. Tsalikis was also told that if the Greek side is not  interested in misinforming its own public, as well as the  international public, by spreading lies, then the Greek side  should contact the proper Albanian organs to be informed  correctly.    Mr. Tsalikis was further told that the dissemination of  false  information and the threatening tones of members of the Greek  Government causes one to think that they are an expression of a  lack of will on the Greek side to overcome the present  difficulties in relations between the two countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rafah, 12 May (MENA) -- A new batch of Palestinian  police entered Gaza via the Rafah crossing point today. For the  first time they were accompanied by a doctor.    Brigadier Ahmad Hasan Mifrid, commander of the Palestinian  police coming from Yemen, has stated his group comprises 450  officers, noncommissioned officers, and privates, adding that  the remaining forces will arrive in Egypt from Yemen later.  There, they will assemble before entering Gaza and Jericho.    Major General 'Abd-al-Raziq al-Majayrah, commander of the  camp where Palestinian troops assemble in Egypt, has stated that  approximately 200 personnel are scheduled to enter [Gaza]  tomorrow, Friday, and a similar number on Saturday, pending the  approval of the Israeli side. He noted that preparations are  under way to assemble the remaining troops coming from Sudan,  Algeria, and Libya. He added that the troops will take over  their posts and deploy immediately upon their entry into the  territories. The total number of security men coming from  abroad via Egypt and Jordan will be approximately 7,000, he  added.    Meanwhile, approximately 200 security men are scheduled to  cross the Allenby Bridge from Jordan on their way to Jericho  tomorrow. For the second time, Israel yesterday refused entry to  seven Palestinian policemen and turned them back to Egypt,  claiming that their names were wrong.    North Sinai Governor Munir Shash has decided to exempt the  Palestinian police forces from paying the 16-pound exit fee paid  by travelers using the Rafah border point.</p>

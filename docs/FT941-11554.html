			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Beijing's long-awaited global bond lifts quiet sector China's long-awaited global bond was the focus of a lacklustre day in the Eurobond market, where activity was subdued ahead of today's meeting of the Bundesbank council. The People's Republic of China issued Dollars 1bn of 10-year bonds, priced to yield 85 basis points over the corresponding US Treasury bond, with Merrill Lynch as lead manager. Dealers reported strong demand for the issue from Asian and European accounts. The pricing of the bond was brought forward by a day and syndicate is due to break today. The issue yesterday was assigned a triple-B rating by Standard &amp; Poor's, two notches below Moody's A-3 rating for China's foreign currency debt. However, Standard &amp; Poor's stressed its positive rating outlook for China which 'reflects the likelihood that political and macroeconomic developments in China will support progressive, albeit uneven, implementation of the economic reform programme which over time should strengthen policy-makers' ability to manage future inflation and external payments pressures'. In the Eurosterling market, the Royal Bank of Scotland issued Pounds 500m of 10-year bonds via S. G. Warburg, UBS and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The bonds were priced to yield 40 basis points above the 6 3/4 per cent gilt due 2004. After the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened slightly, traders said. While one of the lead managers reported strong continental European and Asian demand for the issue, other dealers said placement was likely to be slow. 'It was too big and a bit too tight for current market conditions,' said one trader. After the recent slew of issues by financial institutions, he said investors were more interested in high-quality corporate paper. However, traders said more financial institutions were queueing up to tap the sterling market, especially in the undated sector. Elsewhere, General Electric Capital Corporation issued Dollars 250m of two-year bonds via CS First Boston. Yielding two basis points over Treasuries at the re-offer price, the deal was deemed to be tightly priced. However, the lead manager said the spread was largely irrelevant as the paper would be placed with European retail investors who were keen on short-dated dollar bonds from a top-notch borrower. He pointed out that most GECC bonds traded at yields well below Treasuries. The European Investment Bank is said to be preparing the launch of the first Greek drachma Eurobond. Market sources are talking of bonds with a coupon of no more than 18 per cent and a five-year maturity, to be issued in the next two weeks. The HSBC Group and a Greek bank are tipped as lead managers. The Republic of Iceland made its debut in the Yankee bond market, issuing Dollars 200m of 10-year notes via J. P. Morgan Securities. The 6 1/8 per cent notes were priced to 57 basis point over the relevant US benchmark.</p>

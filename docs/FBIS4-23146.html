			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lourenco Jossias: "Problem of Arithmetic"] </F>   [Text] With only five months remaining before holding  elections in the country, the Supervision and Control Commission  [CSC], the main body supervising the Mozambican peace process,  has been facing another crisis over the past two weeks. The  main signatories of the General Peace Accord, the government and  the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], are engaged in a  hot dispute. The government is accused of having "hidden"  14,480 troops who were supposed to be confined in assemby areas.    The government is being asked to reveal where it has hidden  these men. In defense, the government says these are soldiers  who "do not exist".    It is a problem of arithmetic. The UN Operations in  Mozambique [Unomoz] agrees that "there are serious discrepancies  in early figures presented to the Unomoz Technical Unit by the  government."    Manfredo di Cameranca, Italian ambassador to Mozambique and  CSC member, says that the issue is not serious and that it is  only a misunderstanding resulting from the fact that the initial  figures presented by the government in 1992 were just estimated.  The ambassador said: "They made wrong calculations. You  cannot hide 14,000 soldiers without being discovered." He  advised people not to dramatize the situation.    Aldo Ajello examined the peace process at a CSC meeting held  on 22 April this year. He pointed out the existing problems and  recommended solutions.    Cease-Fire Commission Chairman Colonel Pier Segala from  Italy  also read his report at the meeting. He presented the latest  figures on troop confinement and demobilization. He said the  government had confined 55 percent of its troops, that is 34,145  troops out of a total of 61,638 initially declared. Segala said  the government used 56 percent of its capacity in assembly areas  and demobilized 22.3 percent of its 13,745 men. [figure as  published]    Noting that all troops joining the Mozambique Defense Armed  Forces [FADM] must be confined first, Segala revealed that a  total of 1,875 government troops have already been selected to  join the FADM forces.    Segala said that, according to the Unomoz Technical Unit  figures, Renamo has already confined 81 percent of its forces,  that is 15,517 troops, out of a total of 19,140. In centers for  nonconfined troops, Renamo has 4,000 men and it has used 119  percent of assembly areas' capacity. With regard to  demobilization, Renamo has already demobilized 561 men and  selected 1,891 men to join the new army.    The Unomoz official said in comparative terms "the  government  is behind in troop confinement," while "Renamo is behind in  troop demobilization".    Segala was the first official to bring to light the issue of  discrepancies in the number of government troops initially  declared. The history is complicated, but he said that all  figures produced by the Unomoz Technical Unit were based on the  assumption that the government would confine and register 61,638  troops in assembly areas and register 14,767 troops in centers  for nonconfined .    "The new figures supplied by the government show only 49,630  troops are to be confined in assembly centers instead of  61,638." 14,480 troops are to be registered in centers for  nonconfined troops.    Thus, according to the new figures, the government has a  total number of 64,110 troops instead of 76,405.    Segala says in its report: "These new figures need a  political scrutiny and the old percentages must be calculated  again." With regard to Renamo, Segala said the situation is  different because it did not present all the information on  centers for nonconfined troops.    Col. Pier Segala said that by 21 April, a total of 22,106  weapons had been collected from paramilitary troops, out of an  expected 49,806. He said weapons collection are behind schedule  in Nampula and Tete and have not yet begun in Inhambane. In the  north of the country, only 8,646 weapons had been collected, out  of an expected 14,801. In the center of the country, only 8,873  weapons have been collected, out of an expected 15,634. In the  south, 4,587 weapons have been collected out of an expected  19,371.    The weapons collection are also under way in assembly areas.  A total of 48,818 weapons has been collected in all the 49  assembly areas by 21 April this year. Of this number, 35,599  weapons were collected in government areas, while 13,219 were  collected from Renamo areas. Of this number, 36,993 weapons  have already been transported to regional depots.    Col. Segala also said that obsolete weapons are being  destroyed. Funds resulting from the sale of melted obsolete  military equipment will go to FADM forces, according to a mutual  agreement between the parties involved in the peace process.    Col. Segala also referred to problems and incidents in  assembly areas. He said the causes for these incidents are  mainly the long period troops remain assembly areas (five months  in some cases). On the government side, incidents were observed  in Massinga, Namialo, Marrupa, Lichinga and Rio Save; while on  Renamo's side, incidents were observed in Chiramba, Mohia,  Magunde, Mavago and Lurio. In some areas there is a shortage of  water and in other areas a shortage of food.    Segala spoke of the need to respect the timetable of the  peace process until elections are held.    He said "the process is now irreversible" and added: "There  is no more time to waste in examining and speaking about the  situation. There has been enough time for that. Now is the time  to act and implement the agreements."    CSC Chairman Aldo Ajello confirmed the figures contained in  the report, notably the figures under dispute. He also briefed  the meeting on a number of issues, including the existing  relationship between the Unomoz Police and the Police of the  Republic of Mozambique, an issue which has been referred to on  many occasions, FADM's formation, and other issues.  <H5>  It is a Question of Arithmetic, not a Political Issue </H5>   Apparently, the government delegation did not view kindly  the  stand adopted by Ajello and Segala at the 22 April meeting,  particularly the astonishing assessment of the peace process.    After several foiled attempts to hold a meeting, the CSC  finally met on 5 May to examine Ajello's report. Teodato  Hunguana, head of the government delegation, in the absence of  Armando Guebuza, read a document disproving the issues raised by  Ajello at the previous meeting.    Hunguana said: "It is our firm conviction that there will  henceforth be a fundamental difference between the method of  "briefings" or news conferences and the method followed at CSC  sessions".    Examining point by point the issues raised in the report  presented by Ajello and Segala, Teodato Hunguana referred to the  main issue of troop confinement and demobilization, notably the  "alleged discrepancies between figures so far produced by the  Unomoz Technical Unit and the figures produced by the  government. The government says 49,638 its troops are to be  confined in 29 assembly areas, not 61,638. It also says that it  has 14,480 troops in centers for nonconfined troops.    Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana said the discrepancy results  from the fact that the Unomoz Technical Unit based its work on  the "assumption" that the government had to confine and register  61,638 troops in 29 assembly areas and register 14,480 in  centers for nonconfined troops. "It was just an assumption,"  Hunguana said.    The head of the government delegation recalled that after  the  signing of the peace accord, there was a need to urgently  present to Unomoz a list of troops to be confined. In view of  this urgency, the two sides presentation of lists was made on  the assumption that they contained estimated figures that could  be corrected as the process went on. The adjustments are  provided for in Protocol VI of the General Peace Accord.    Hunguana said on 9 November 1992 the government delegation  informed the CSC that the government would confine 61,638 troops  in its 29 areas. It also said that it would inform the CSC  about troops' figures in centers for nonconfined troops.    The figure of 61,638 was used by the government in various  meetings of the Cease-Fire Commission and it was this same  figure that was presented at the donors' conference in Rome in  December 1992.    Teodato Hunguana said the government has carried out work  aimed at presenting the correct number of its troops. He said  this work was complex, characterized by organizational  difficulties, because of the war.    After the work was carried out, the government supplied the  figure of 64,118 as being the most up to date figure of  government troops. It also gave the figure of 14,480 as the  number of its troops in centers for nonconfined troops.    Hunguana said the figure of 14,480 is part of the 64,118  government troops. He said the CSC thought it was an additional  figure and added it to the figure of 61,638 presented by the  government in 1992, thus concluding that there was a shortage of  12,000 troops. [figure as published]    Teodato Hunguana said: "It is just a question of clear  discrepancy of figures which does not correspond to reality.  Thus, there is no political problem which requires a political  scrutiny. It is just a question of arithmetic."    The minister also spoke about the proposals to reduce FADM  forces by 50 percent.    The labor minister said: "If 30,000 troops for FADM was  already a ridiculous figure... their reduction by 50 percent is  tantamount to saying that this country does not need or deserve  an effective Armed Forces, but just a make-believe force."  <H5>  Government's Explanation Does Not Convince Renamo </H5>   Raul Domingos, head of Renamo's delegation to the CSC, says  the government explanation about the alleged discrepancy in  figures "neither convinces nor mollifies. It is a matter of  14,000 people that cannot be accounted for and there can be no  error in estimating such a large number. It is an army that is  in hiding and the government will have to tell us where those  men are whose names have disappeared from the lists all of a  sudden."    Like Hunguana at the CSC meeting, Domingos read a document  commenting on Ajello's report.    Basically he agrees with Segala's report that Renamo has  confined more men (81 percent of all its personnel) and says the  slow demobilization of his movement's troops is due to technical  problems. (He also told SAVANA that Renamo still had to confine  19,140 troops. Of these, 15,000 are for the new army and 4,140  will be demobilized. Right now, Unomoz has a list of 2,900 men  to be demobilized -- that is, more than half.)    Renamo has doubts about the discrepancy in the government's  figures. It feels there are political problems and not merely  an "underestimation of figures." Raul Domingos added: After  all, for a long time now, "we have been complaining that the  government was transferring soldiers to the police and has taken  many men from Snasp [People's National Security Service] to the  police. The police have been creating instability."    According to Domingos, the number "the government now says  refers to its troops differs from the figure of 26,480 soldiers  the CCF submitted to Unomoz."    Renamo thinks that between 14,480 and 10,480 soldiers could  have been "put aside" for the formation of a private army.    Commenting on the disbanding of paramilitary forces, Renamo  noted that a deadline had been set for December 1993. In line  with the timetable, that would have coincided with the start of  the confinement of troops from both sides.    The Renamo document says logistical reasons prevented it  from  supplying in due time the figures about centers that would  harbor troops not earmarked for confinement. Those reasons  include lack of transportation, communications, and office  equipment.  <H5>  Let Us Not Dramatize Things -- Manfredo di Camerana </H5>   Manfredo di Camerana, Italian ambassador to Mozambique, who  has for a long time now been linked to the peace process, says  the "numerical discrepancy" has been looked into in an  exaggerated manner.    He said: "We are coming under pressure as October  approaches, and the psychological factor is very important."    According to Di Camerana, all sides have great expectations  about the conclusion of the process. "There is a great deal of  pressure in terms of time and that does not permit a clear and  calm assessment of situations."    He pointed out to SAVANA that a precise number of government  and Renamo troops was never discussed in Rome.    "We have always asked for an estimate, and the final figure  was clearly 30,000 for the single army."    The ambassador said the mediators and the observers had  always realized that the sides would have difficulties in making  estimates and that the real figures would come up as the  confinement and demobilization of troops began. In fact,  everybody started counting as of the start of those processes.    He recalled that the initial figure given by the government  was 61,638 troops that would report to assembly areas, and  14,480 that did not need to be confined to assembly areas. That  was in 1992.    Since then until 20 April 1994, the figures have been  checked  and updated.    The ambassador commented: "I do not think there has been any  government attempt to hide such a large number of soldiers." He  added: "It was indeed an underestimation. It is ridiculous to  think there are troops hidden from both sides."    Di Camerana advised people to be calm and carefully consider  things. "We cannot dramatize things. Let us not create a  controversy about it because that could cause irreparable damage  to the country."    The Italian diplomat has always said he thought the process  would be difficult and demand patience from all of us. That is  why we "have always said disputes cannot be settled outside the  mechanisms provided for by the accord. No unilateral decisions  ought to be taken."    The government's attitude in suspending the demobilization  of  troops has been criticized by both di Camerana and the CSC. The  ambassador, who is represented at the CSC, commented: "That  does not help the process in the least, and then... it is the  government that will have extra work to do with its troops."    He said that during his last visit to Rome, Dhlakama was  advised that it served no purpose to dramatize the issue of  "numerical discrepancy."    "We asked for moderation because there could be errors in  the  Defense Ministry's financial or bureaucratic sectors, but not  14,000 men in hiding."    By criticizing Renamo for dramatizing things, and the  government for making unilateral decisions, Di Camerana said  there is a danger of the whole process coming to a halt if calm  does not prevail over radical positions.    The biggest difficulties he foresees, and which he feels  should be of concern to all, are of a technical and logistical  nature, regarding the formation of the FADM and the elections.    "The barracks are not up to standards and troops cannot  agree  to go to a training center to eat badly, to sleep on the floor  or on a floor mat." Likewise, there is still a lot to do about  the electoral process.    Di Camerana has other worries: How to make the giants of  Mozambican politics (government and Renamo) embark on politics  and on a campaign without talking about the past, without  accusing each other about past problems, but by only debating  the programs for the country's future?    He asked: "Where are their programs and why do they not  trade accusations about them?"</p>

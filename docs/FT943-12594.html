			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: Epic whimsy gives festival flair - Karen Fricker finds the offerings at Chicago's theatre festival a mix of the bizarre and boring Chicago seems a natural choice as host city to the only regularly scheduled festival devoted solely to international theatre in the US. Its bustling theatre community provides an ample assortment of stages, and its audiences are eager for new experience. The eight-year-old International Theatre Festival of Chicago is still finding its legs. There was a sense of caution this year but the greatest risk - commissioning an outdoor theatrical extravaganza from the punky Dutch ensemble Dogtroep - produced the most festive results. In its evocative venue, a tented amphitheatre on Navy Pier on Lake Michigan, Dogtroep created Camel Gossip III, a work of epic whimsy that is fresher and more entertaining than that of comparable new-age circuses - neither as twee as Cirque du Soleil nor as gratuitously violent as La Fura dels Baus nor as archly self-conscious as Archaos. Not much plot here, just a series of images and vignettes: a lumpen, hard-hatted fellow unexpectedly disgorges a shapely woman from his coveralls, who proceeds to destroy his shanty house and build a tower from the wreckage. A dozen white-wigged harpies dangle over the stage in brightly painted cabinets, then troll the audience sporting bizarre head-dresses, which amplify their breathing. They then joyride through the audience on old-fashioned bicycles, a combination rock and oom-pah-pah band serenading in the background. Most astoundingly, throughout the proceedings it rains on stage, a gushing downpour that makes the tempest in An Inspector Calls look like an April shower. How do they do it? That is just the point; Camel Gossip III is an exercise in wonder, an enormous and baffling jumpstart to the imagination. Providing the festival's mainstream bookends were the Gate Theatre of Dublin's well-travelled production of Juno and the Paycock (which I left too early to see) and Alan Ayckbourn's latest farce, Communicating Doors, fresh from its Scarborough premiere. In theory, it is an enlightened idea to include the work of England's contemporary comic master in its programme (the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Renaissance Theatre Company and the National Theatre have been featured in previous festivals), but a shame that Communicating Doors finds Ayckbourn so far off form. A bedroom farce cum murder mystery cum Back to the Future-type time-travel tale, Communicating Doors links three women from different decades in a plan to save themselves from a sleazy man - husband to two of the women - who plans to kill them all. The action takes place in a very posh hotel room whose inside door serves as a time portal. Though the first act is at once silly and confusing, the play transforms into something richer and more satisfying in the second act, as the women's manipulations of time turn a growing bond between two of them into a blood knot. This uneven muddle is made worse by a sluggish production directed by the playwright himself. The Attis Theatre Company, a young Greek group, insisted that their two productions not be translated into English so as not to detract from the viewing experience. This ended up, in the case of their production of Aeschylus' The Persians, to be self-defeating. Virtually actionless, the play consists of long descriptive speeches, as the Persians, waiting for news of a battle between their troops and the Greeks, learn that their nation has been brutally defeated, and mourn. There is an interesting dialogue between classic and contemporary time periods at play in Theodoros Terzopolous' production. The translation, we are told in the programme, mixes ancient and modern Greek; the performers' black gowns make reference to ancient and current styles; and at one point the performers brandish photographs, perhaps of Gulf War victims but we never find out. Though the company's work reflects a great seriousness and physical rigour, without sufficient interpretation of what the words actually mean, the audience is slighted of a full theatrical ex-perience. Attis' second production, a contemporary play called The Kanon by Vassilis Vassikehaylglou, was reportedly more visual and active. Audiences and critics alike were impressed with the young Mexican ensemble Taller del Sotano (Basement Workshop), which presented two works in Spanish with English translation. Robert Lepage's Needles and Opium was another favourite. The festival stinted on American offerings - the only entry being two funny but theatrically slight one-woman shows by the Latina lesbian comedienne Marga Gomez - but local productions provided a more-than-ample unofficial fringe to make up for this.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Bonn urged to promote exports more vigorously MR Matthias Wissman, Germany's recently appointed transport minister, has called for a more aggressive government policy of trade promotion, in the wake of Siemens' failure to win a big contract for its ICE high-speed train in South Korea. He flew to the US last week to support a promotion for the train, which is now running for three months on an Amtrak test track between Washington and New York. He believes a significant factor in the loss of the Dollars 2.4bn Korean contract - which was won by the Anglo-French GEC-Alsthom consortium with the French TGV - was the lower level of German government support for the project. Mr Wissman called for 'aggressive supporting measures' to back up German industrial projects, particularly high technology projects such as the Intercity Express (ICE). He said all government departments should be involved in working out joint marketing strategies with German industry, using all possible support measures in German embassies, trade missions, chambers of commerce and information offices, to promote high-profile German products. The campaign would not involve direct subsidies to industry; nor should it include deals on export quotas or reciprocal trade accords, which would only result in trade distortion, he said. Germany's failure to win the Korean railway contract was seen as a blow to German technological prowess, but the French were praised in Germany for a more effective marketing effort. This included visits to Seoul by senior French ministers, such as Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, and the prospective visit by President Francois Mitterrand to coincide with signing the contract. The French embassy also had a special attache dealing exclusively with railway matters. Mr Wissman is determined that efforts to break into the US high-speed train market should not fail for want of official support. He flew to the opening in Washington of the first test run on the Amtrak line to New York. Siemens, in partnership with General Motors, GEC Alsthom and Sweden's ABB are all competing for contracts with Amtrak, expected to be awarded next spring, for about 26 high-speed trains. A key part of the deal will be award of significant volumes of sub-contracting to US suppliers.</p>

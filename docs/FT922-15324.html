			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Politics restricts response from Bush IN PONDERING his response to the changes in the former Soviet Union, President George Bush's habitual caution has been reinforced by a powerful political force: the fear that foreign aid of any kind would prove politically unpopular in an election year dominated by domestic concerns. In recent weeks, however, the Bush administration has come in for a steady barrage of criticism from those who charge that it is botching an epochal opportunity to shape the world for the better. Criticism from Germany, which has complained that the US has not borne its fair share, may have little impact in domestic terms. But the efforts of a group of senior congressmen from both parties, led by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, won an extra edge when former president Richard Nixon criticised the US's 'pathetically inadequate response'. There has been a serious debate in the US over whether financial aid to the former Soviet republics should come from government or from the private sector; over the balance between helping Russia and helping the other republics; and over the likelihood that money poured into the former Soviet Union at this uncertain moment will simply disappear, leaving no lasting trace. Mr Nixon's intervention, however, appears to have played a critical role in refocusing the debate onto the adequacy of President Bush's leadership. President Bush sought to meet the challenge yesterday by announcing a package of measures designed to help Russia and the other former Soviet republics. But the crucial test of his leadership, at what he yesterday called 'a defining moment in history', will come in the follow-through. The administration has repeatedly sent legislation to Congress on several of the measures Mr Bush announced, notably on the US's Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.9bn) contribution to the International Monetary Fund's capital increase. It has been criticised, however, for its limp efforts to ensure passage.</p>

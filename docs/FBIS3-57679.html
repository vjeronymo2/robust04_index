According to the parliamentary speaker, such a development  of  events is possible if parliamentary elections in Moldova  scheduled for February 27, will be won by the parties coming out  in favor of the unification with Romania.    "If the parliament adopts the decision on the unification  with Romania, then the Dniester region and Gagauzia will secede  from Moldova, and hotbeds of tension will arise in Chisinau and  Beltsy (city in the north of Moldova), as well as in some  northern areas with concentrated population of national  minorities," Petru Luchinskiy stressed.    The chairman of the parliament believes that strengthening  of  state independence of Moldova is now the only possibility to  evade bloodshed in the republic where almost one third of the  population is represented by other nationalities. "Moldova is  supported in this by the world community which is interested in  the preservation of peace and stability on the Balkans where the  war is raging," the speaker pointed out.    Petru Luchinskiy believes that a crisis situation is forming  in the left bank districts of Moldova. Commander of the 14th  Russian Army, General Lebed, accused the Tiraspol leaders of  corruption but in response to this the Tiraspol leaders imposed  a special state in the region "seeking to isolate themselves  from the outer world."    At the same time, the head of the Parliament of Moldova is  convinced that the crisis in the Dniester region may be settled  in the near future.</p>

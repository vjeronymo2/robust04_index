			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATTS NEW?;  </P> <P> REOPENING OF HISTORIC RED CAR STATION AS MUSEUM AND DWP OFFICE SEEN AS SYMBOL  OF HOPE, RENEWAL  </P> <P> Eighty-five years after it was constructed, the once-deteriorating Watts train  station was reborn Thursday.  </P> <P> More than 100 people gathered at 103rd Street and Grandee Avenue to celebrate  the grand reopening of the wood-frame structure, which will operate as a  Department of Water and Power customer service office and a mini-museum of  Watts history.  </P> <P> Although the station will no longer serve as a passenger platform or ticket  booth, city officials and Watts residents hope that the newly restored national  historic landmark will serve as a symbol of continuity, hope and renewal for a  neighborhood that has seen more than its share of hard times.  </P> <P> The station, once a main junction for the city's famed Red Cars, is located  about 90 feet from the Los Angeles-to-Long Beach light-rail line that is  scheduled to open next year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A New Era'  </P> <P> "It's more than an historical occasion -- it is a magical occasion," said the  Rev. Thomas Kilgore, a Community Redevelopment Agency commissioner. "If you  listen closely, you can almost hear the rumbling of the Red Cars. The railroad  served as a catalyst for staking a community here . . . and this will herald a  new era for Watts."  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley waxed nostalgic about the days five decades ago when he  boarded the train at the Watts station, sometimes sneaking on without the  15-cent fare.  </P> <P> "All of us are going to be able to relive those days when we rode the old Red  Cars -- some of us free," he said to loud laughter. "I won't expose you; the  statute of limitations has run out, so you can fully confess it to your  next-door neighbors.  </P> <P> "Those were great days. Those days of glory are going to return, and we are  going to be at the heart of the action right here at the Watts train station,"  the mayor said.  </P> <P> After the ceremony, at a reception at which croissants and kiwis were served,  Bradley explained that he was not advocating that riders sneak onto the new  train without paying.  </P> <P> "In those days, there were some of us who didn't have the 15 cents to ride the  Red Car," he said. "I think that those who need to travel from their work to  their home (these days) will be able to afford the fare."  </P> <P> The brown, single-story station, restored to its original exterior design by  the CRA for $700,000, was built in an era when farmers harvested cabbage down  the block and the ethnically mixed neighborhood was known as a place where a  working man could buy a home for $1 down and $1 a week.  </P> <P> Sixty years later, the train station was the only structure that remained  intact when stores along 103rd Street burned during the Watts riots.  </P> <P> In the years since, a shopping center, a health center and 458 units of  affordable housing have been constructed in the neighborhood with the  assistance of $32 million in redevelopment funds. But the historic station has  been largely vacant and run down since the demise of the Red Cars, the electric  rail system that carried commuters and tourists around the Los Angeles Basin  until it was taken out of service almost 30 years ago.  </P> <P> At Thursday's ceremony, city officials paid tribute to 70-year Watts resident  Freita Shaw Johnson, who spearheaded a two-decade community effort to restore  the station.  </P> <P> Johnson, a retired music director, said she hoped that the refurbished station  and the adjacent transit line will lead to "economic growth and jobs and . . .  give a better picture of our area."  </P> <P> Officials, who also called the rail line a stimulus for commerce, stressed  during the ceremony that the gated complex that will contain the old station, a  new light-rail platform and parking will be brightly lit and monitored by  closed-circuit cameras to provide safety for rail riders.  </P> <P> However, several area residents interviewed Thursday cautioned that 24-hour  security service will be necessary to avert problems.  </P> <P> "If they get enough security it might work," said Angelo Machicote, 22. "But  just like security has guns, the gang-bangers have guns."  </P></p>

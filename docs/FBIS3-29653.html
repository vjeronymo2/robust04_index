This visit attracts people's attention because  it is to be made before the third round of high-level U.S.-North  Korea talks, which are expected to be held around mid-March.    A diplomatic source in Washington on 19 February said that  Assistant Secretary Galluci, senior delegate to the high-level  talks; and Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard, delegate to the  New York working-level contact, revealed their plan to visit the  ROK to ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu when Minister Han  visited Washington on 17 February.    The source noted that the third round of talks will include  important negotiations in which pending issues such as: special  inspection, improvement of relations and establishment of  diplomatic relations, and economic assistance. They will be  comprehensively discussed and a package settlement will be  sought. Therefore, the United States seems to believe that a  prior grasp and understanding of the atmosphere and position of  the ROK and final-stage discussions with the ROK Government are  necessary.</p>

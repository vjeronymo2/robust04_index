			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> UCLA;  </P> <P> ALERT PLAY COULD HAVE BACKFIRED  </P> <P> UCLA kicker Brad Daluiso's extra point try was blocked in the fourth quarter of  Saturday's 32-31 victory over Stanford after quarterback Tommy Maddox, the  holder, fumbled the snap. Maddox alertly picked up the ball and passed to tight  end Rick Daly for a two-point conversion and a 29-28 lead.  </P> <P> However, if a Cardinal player had retrieved the ball and carried it to the  other end zone, Stanford would have scored two points under a rule that was  enacted last year.  </P> <P> Asked if he thought of that possibility at the time, UCLA Coach Terry Donahue  said: "I knew about the rule, but it wasn't on my mind at the time. I'm not  going to talk about what was on my mind."  </P> <P> USC  </P> <P> First Start Nothing to Sneeze At  </P> <P> As the high school football player of the year in Arizona two years ago, Mike  Salmon was hampered by bronchitis and pollen allergies, although he said it is  not true, as is written in the USC media guide, that he carried an inhaler in  his sock during games.  </P> <P> But on the eve of his first start for the Trojans Saturday against Penn State,  it was the freshman cornerback's stomach that troubled him most. He couldn't  keep food down.  </P> <P> "Probably nerves," said Bobby April, who coaches the Trojans' secondary.  </P> <P> A converted split end who was moved to safety last spring, Salmon was moved  again to cornerback about a week before the season, when doctors advised  sophomore DeChon Burns to quit the team because of a congenital spinal defect.  </P> <P> Bothered by his allergies only rarely since his move to California, Salmon said  he prefers free safety to cornerback. "I feel more comfortable there," he said,  "but whatever it takes to get on the field . . . "  </P> <P> Washington Coach Don James called on Husky fans to yell themselves hoarse  Saturday when Washington plays fifth-ranked USC at Husky Stadium. "We need  their help," James told reporters in Seattle. "I say that because I was looking  at the tape (Sunday) night and (USC) had a real critical goal-line stand  (against Penn State) and the scoreboard in the Coliseum said, 'More Noise.'  They were calling for it.  </P> <P> "It wouldn't bother me if Todd Marinovich didn't hear a cadence all day long."  </P> <P> Marinovich, on his sprained left wrist: "It feels like somebody pounded on it  last night with a bat."  </P> <P> AROUND THE NATION  </P> <P> Colorado Drops to 20th in Poll  </P> <P> Notre Dame remained No. 1 in the Associated Press poll Monday after its  season-opening victory over Michigan, while Colorado dropped out of the top 10  after losing to Illinois.  </P> <P> Colorado fell from ninth to 20th -- its lowest ranking since last year's  preseason poll -- after losing, 23-22. Illinois rose six spots to No. 15.  </P> <P> The Fighting Irish, who rallied to beat the Wolverines, 28-24, Saturday night,  received 44 first-place votes and 1,480 points from a nationwide panel of  sportswriters and broadcasters.  </P> <P> Florida State got 10 first-place votes and moved past Auburn into second after  beating Georgia Southern, 48-6. Auburn, which beat Mississippi, 24-10, received  four first-place votes.  </P> <P> Brigham Young rose one spot to No. 4 after overcoming a 22-point halftime  deficit to beat Washington State, 50-36. Also moving up a notch were USC, to  No. 5, and Tennessee, to No. 6. (USC dropped from No. 4 to No. 5 in the United  Press International poll of coaches.)  </P> <P> Michigan fell from No. 4 to No. 7. Nebraska, which had the week off, remained  No. 8, ahead of No. 9 Miami and No. 10 Virginia.  </P></p>

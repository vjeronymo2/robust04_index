Here  is a comment by Nora Ananieva, chairman of the parliamentary  group of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] and its coalition:    [Ananieva] The prime minister's viewpoint was realistic, in  the sense that stability, our authority, continuing the reform  without interruption, and developing our international contacts  all depend on the budget being passed.    [Announcer] Professor Lyuben Berov's address provoked a  quick reaction from the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces]  coalition. Here is what Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the SDS  National Coordinating Council, had to say:    [Dimitrov] We have long considered that the only reasonable  alternative to the chaos that reigns in the country's economy  and the drama that is developing on the streets of Bulgarian  towns is to hold new elections. Accordingly, in making his  statement, the prime minister hardly discovered America. As  regards the issue of the budget, in his statement the prime  minister made a fetish, as it were, of the act of adopting a  law, but disregarded its contents.    [Announcer] The parliamentary group of the Rights and  Freedoms Movement [DPS] will support the initiative calling for  a special plenary session of parliament on the state budget  bill, but the DPS deputies do not consider that 16 February is a  realistic deadline for adopting the budget. Here is a comment  from DPS parliamentary representative Osman Oktay on the prime  minister's statement:    [Oktay] I would describe the prime minister's statement on  the budget as somewhat overhasty. We have assured him -- we  have given an assurance in the proper place -- that we will do  everything possible to speed up the submission of the budget to  a plenary session of the National Assembly.    [Announcer] DPS deputies expressed their disquiet over the  delays in the examination of the budget by certain parliamentary  commissions. According to them, the early submission of the  budget bill to the full parliament is of importance primarily in  connection with our commitments under the agreement with the  international financial institutions. According to Deputy  Oktay, the president will probably meet with the DPS leader  [Ahmed Dogan] next week. According to DPS Deputy Serife Mustafa,  this meeting may take place tomorrow.</p>

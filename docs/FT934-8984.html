			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Royal hits Pounds 113m at nine months - Composite provides further evidence of insurance market recovery ROYAL INSURANCE yester-day provided further evidence of the recovery in the insurance market when it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 113m for the first nine months of 1993, compared with a loss of Pounds 83m during the same period of last year. Earnings per share were 19.2p compared with 5.3p. After disposals profits amounted to Pounds 116m compared with Pounds 9m last time. The strength of the investment markets has also helped restore the group's balance sheet. Capital and reserves amounted to Pounds 2.15bn (Pounds 1.48bn) at September 30, and the solvency ratio - which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income - amounted to 59 per cent. The 'significant recovery in results' reflected 'the overall insurance environment' and the impact of moves to increase efficiency and improve skills, said Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive. Much of the improvement was concentrated in the UK where premium income grew by 7 per cent to reach Pounds 1.23bn (Pounds 1.15bn). Premium rate increases were especially strong in commercial lines business with average increases of 31 per cent for employers' liability, 22 per cent for product liability and 35 per cent for marine. Despite indications of rate competition in the personal motor market, Royal said its own motor rates were 13 per cent higher than last year. Premium growth was particularly impressive at The Insurance Service, the Bristol-based direct insurer, where premium income rose by 40 per cent. In the UK the group's operating ratio (claims and expenses as a percentage of premiums) in the UK fell to 99.8 per cent, compared with 118.4 per cent last year. Higher weather losses were partially responsible for a deficit of Pounds 7m (profit Pounds 12m) in the US. But profits at Royal Canada and Royal Insurance Global, which handles the insurance accounts of international clients, increased. However, some analysts are concerned about the pace of growth. Mr Tom Bennett, analyst with Paribas Capital Markets, said UK results were 'excellent' but said the group as a whole 'is still in convalescent mode.' Worldwide general business premiums increased to Pounds 2.79bn (Pounds 2.54bn). Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 285m (Pounds 435m) while investment income rose to Pounds 388m (Pounds 345m). Income from associated undertakings rose to Pounds 20m (Pounds 17m). Estate agency losses amounted to Pounds 7m (Pounds 11m) and losses from long-term insurance amounted to Pounds 8m (Pounds 12m). Pre-tax profits at Royal Life fell to Pounds 37m (Pounds 38m). Loan interest at the level of the holding group amounted to Pounds 29m (Pounds 25m). See Lex</p>

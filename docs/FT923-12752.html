			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Leading Article: From fraud to farce THE COURT of Appeal's decision yesterday to clear the four corporate financiers who were convicted for lying about the outcome of the Blue Arrow rights issue in 1987 can only be construed as a serious blow to the credibility of Britain's system of criminal justice in its handling of wrongdoing in the City. That much is clear, even before the detailed explanation of the Appeal Court's reasoning emerges in public. In the wake of the hopelessly unsatisfactory outcome of the Guinness trials and a whole series of setbacks for the Serious Fraud Office, it is legitimate to ask whether such farcical proceedings should not be dispensed with. At the very least, some radical reconsideration of the way the law applies to the City is called for. For all its many merits, the 1986 Roskill Committee report tended to divert the argument about fraud trials on to the question of jury competence in technical financial matters. Yet the Blue Arrow defendants' case in the Appeal Court was directed more at the competence of the judge and prosecuting counsel. In essence, it asserted that the trial was unfair because of the weight and complexity of the case that the prosecution chose to put before the jury, and because the judge had instructed the jurors to ignore 75 per cent of the evidence they had heard - this, incidentally, in the course of one of the longest and most expensive trials in history. Better ways It was not, admittedly, reassuring that the jury's verdict in the Blue Arrow trial appeared to fly in the face of the summing up of Mr Justice McKinnon. But nor does it follow from this that the jury failed to grasp the issues. In the final analysis, all fraud trials require the jury to make a judgment about whether people are telling the truth. There may be better ways of eliciting the truth than those that prevail in British courts; but there are good grounds for thinking that Roskill's proposal to hand the job to a judge, supported by expert lay assessors, would be worse. The most likely people to fill the role of expert assessors would be lawyers, accountants and City practitioners of one kind or another. They would be less than human if they did not identify more closely with City people in the dock than a jury would be inclined to do. They might well weigh, consciously or subconsciously, the implications of convicting a City figure for their wider business interests. The Roskill solution would simply be a retreat back towards the club ethic under a legal guise. Obvious victims The more fundamental question concerns the appropriateness of criminal proceedings in dealing with the City's particular forms of white-collar crime. Clearly where there are obvious victims, as in the case of the Maxwell pensioners, jury trial is the correct answer. In less clear-cut cases it has been suggested that civil rather than criminal proceedings might be more appropriate. Yet civil remedies inevitably raise difficulties where, as in insider dealing scandals, the losses may be difficult to establish. So, too, in cases where markets have been rigged, although it is not always impossible: injured parties have successfully sought redress over Guinness's takeover of Distillers and the Blue Arrow rights issue. The more important question is whether crimes in which there are no immediate victims with quantifiable losses merit a jail sentence at all. The chief damage at Guinness and Blue Arrow, apart from the financial losses for which people successfully sought redress through civil proceedings, was potentially to the employers of the individuals who stood in the dock and to the integrity of London markets. There is room for debate whether heavy fines and disqualification procedures which deprive wrongdoers of their former livelihoods may not be sufficient deterrent against such activity. Either way, effective justice is most unlikely to emerge from trials that take place years after the event and in which the charges are both excessive and absurdly complex. Speed must be the essence of whatever system is put in the place of the absurdly expensive and arbitrary circus that now dictates the fate of those involved in City and business scandals. The government should put the job in hand.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO UN envoy Nasir al-Qudwah, in </F> New York, by Salah Salamah, in the studio, date not given; from  "The Event" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Salamah] Thank you for being with us on "The  Event" program.    [Al-Qudwah] Thank you.    [Salamah] You have been following daily developments in New  York in your official capacity. How do you explain the  footdragging in passing a resolution?    [Al-Qudwah] The reasons are numerous. One of these is that  there are real differences between the Americans and ourselves  on the wording with respect to Jerusalem as an integral part of  the occupied territories, the protection of the Palestinian  people, and the role of the sponsors of the peace process on the  ground. Also, the United States wants to advance certain  objectives in return for going along with a UN Security Council  resolution. In any case, we believe we have not compromised any  of the components of our position.    [Salamah] What seems to be the sticking point? Is it the  text of the resolution, or is it the international presence or  guarantees?    [Al-Qudwah] Personally, I think the text of the resolution  has been settled, and that the United States may seek some way  to get around its opposition to certain parts, specifically the  one to do with Jerusalem. The United States may seek a separate  vote on each item of the resolution. What remains to be sorted  out is the wording of the part dealing with a general Middle  East settlement.    [Salamah] According to one report, there has been a  suggestion that passage of the resolution will be linked to a  resumption of the talks. How do you react to this report?    [Al-Qudwah] We are against such linkage. At the same time,  we have made it plain that we are not boycotting the peace  process. Neither are any of the parties involved in the peace  process. Our position is clear. Our return to the negotiating  process and its success clearly hinge on creating new facts in  the occupied territory, whereby the Palestinian people are  afforded protection through a direct international presence and  a package of measures that must be instituted by the Israeli  Government. This includes disarming settlers, dismantling, at  any rate, some of these settlements, and expediting negotiations  over their final status within the framework of the agreement  concluded with Israel. We want this resolution to create new  facts that may facilitate a return to the negotiating table.    [Salamah] You have spoken of the implementation of the  resolution which you are expecting from the UN Security Council.  What guarantees are you demanding to implement this resolution  after your past experience with the previous resolutions, which  remained mere ink on paper?    [Al-Qudwah] Exactly. In fact, I have said the same thing  many ties over the past few days. We said clearly that the main  thing in this respect is not necessarily adopting the  resolution. The main thing is implementing this resolution. No  doubt, adopting the resolution will be an important step  forward, but this is not enough. We want to move to the  implementation immediately after the adoption. We have bitter  experience in terms of adopting resolutions that are not  applied. Therefore, we must transfer the weight of the  political moves toward the implementation process directly after  the adoption of the resolution.    [Salamah] Mr. Nasir al-Qudwah, my colleague Joseph Samahah  would like to ask you a question.    [Samahah] Hello, Mr. Nasir.    [Al-Qudwah] You are welcome.    [Samahah] The question is if the resolution is agreed on  without the issue of Jerusalem. [sentence as heard] Has there  been agreement on the nature of the international presence, its  type, tasks, and points of reference, the areas of deployment,  and if this means intervention by the UN Security Council or  merely an implementation of the PLO-Israel bilateral agreement,  because this was also a bone of contention. How was it thrashed  out?    [Al-Qudwah] Brother Joseph, no doubt simply dealing with a  general issue related to the Middle East and the Palestinian  question is in itself an achievement and a change from the  previous situation. We must remember that the UN Security  Council has not discussed this question since the beginning of  the Madrid process, except on two occasions. The issue in both  cases was only the issue of deportation. At other times, the  council was practically prevented from tackling this issue.    Therefore, in principle there is an important change. As for  the contents of the resolution, as I have said, the United  States has a problem with regard to Jerusalem. We vehemently  insisted that no change should be introduced in this regard.  For them, the solution could be, as I said, demanding separate  voting on paragraphs and abstaining from voting on this  particular paragraph. This procedural solution will not change  the final result, which is adopting the resolution by consensus  [al-tawafuq] as is agreed so far, including, of course, the  paragraphs that deal with our definite demands, particularly  providing protection for the Palestinian people.    [Samahah] But you have not answered my question on the  international presence, its type, tasks, and points of  reference, the areas of deployment. Is it in Gaza and Jericho,  or in the entire West Bank and Gaza? Is it in accordance with  the Declaration of Principles, or will it transcend it, being a  Security Council resolution, or is it in implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement? The question is still there.    [Salamah] Has this issue been thrashed out or not?    [Al-Qudwah] This is clear from the wordage. The text reads  that the UN Security Council demands measures to provide  protection for the Palestinian people in all the occupied  territory. These are the words.    [Salamah] And it will be adopted in this form?    [Al-Qudwah] Yes.    [Salamah] And there is U.S. approval?    [Al-Qudwah] In English, it says: "throughout the occupied  territory" [preceding four words in English]. The singular form  is used, which means territorial unity of these areas.    [Salamah] Last question: How do you evaluate the other  states' attitude toward the draft resolution?    [Al-Qudwah] The vast majority of the other states were  extremely responsive. This horrible massacre undoubtedly  engendered general international sympathy toward the Palestinian  cause and the just demands we presented to the council. There  were really no problems with any state among the UN Security  Council member states. Our negotiations were, in fact, with the  U.S. delegation in the presence -- but not with the effective  participation -- of the Russian Federation delegation.    [Salamah] Thank you, Mr. Nasir al-Qudwah.    [Al-Qudwah] Thank you, my dear brother.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: A Swiss maverick exercises its muscles - BZ Bank's rise to become the country's fourth most profitable Mr Martin Ebner's eight-year-old securities house, BZ Bank. BZ has just published its 1992 results, showing net profits of SFr59.5m (Dollars 40m), more than double 1991's SFr25.1m. That makes BZ Switzerland's fourth-largest bank in terms of profits, exceeded only by the big three universal banks, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse. (In assets, BZ is still a minnow, with a total of only SFr607.2m, but it has no desire to be a lending bank.) The buoyant result also shows that the maverick BZ was not just a meteoric product of the frenzied financial environment of the late 1980s. Few other banks did as well in last year's volatile securities markets and depressed economic environment. BZ has been the biggest player in the Zurich stock market for some time, with a share of about 20 per cent. It dominates the Swiss covered warrants market, and its two quoted investment trusts, BK Vision and Pharma Vision, have massive shareholdings in some of the country's biggest companies. BK Vision last month showed its willingness to flex its muscles by challenging the decision of UBS, in which it is the largest shareholder, to dump from their board Mr Christoph Blocher, the anti-European Community politician and industrialist and a close associate of Mr Ebner. Power is what BZ has been all about ever since its beginnings in 1985. Mr Ebner had been head of research at Bank J. Vontobel, the venerable Zurich private bank. He wanted the bank to reduce its emphasis on its slow-moving private client business and instead specialise on research and block trading for a small number of large institutional clients. Vontobel refused and he left. Two large institutions that he had got to know while at Vontobel, Sweden's Carnegie Fondkommission and the Swiss commodities trading house Gebruder Volkart, backed him in setting up BZ, but they have since sold out. The BZ group, with consolidated equity of about SFr1bn and SFr10bn in funds under management, is now majority owned and controlled by its management. As for Mr Ebner, he figures in a recent list among the 100 wealthiest Swiss, with a fortune estimated at between SFr300m and SFr400m. The group cultivates a modest image. The bank itself has a staff of only 20 who work in a sparsely- furnished open-plan office above a department store in a nondescript corner of downtown Zurich. It claims to have only a dozen regular clients, but they include some of Switzerland's largest pension funds and insurance companies and a couple of UK merchant banks. From its beginnings, BZ was one of the most active players on the Zurich bourse, and one of the most successful. Other brokers soon began to watch it carefully, and often blindly followed its moves. This has given the bank extra power, and its persistent opposition to the development of a national electronic exchange, an issue over which Mr Ebner resigned from the board of the bourse three years ago, illustrates how reluctant he is to lose it. BZ's first and most successful innovation, in 1986, was convincing Swiss institutions to write options on their registered shares of Swiss companies. At the time, most companies refused to register shares held by foreigners. It foresaw that these restrictions would gradually be removed as foreign pressure forced Swiss companies to fall into line with international practice. This would cause the shares to rise in value to the level of the companies' other securities, and the options gave all investors, including foreign ones, the opportunity to participate in these movements. The restrictions have now been largely removed, but the warrants continue to be popular as a tax avoidance device, and BZ leads in both issuing and dealing in them. The bank gained wider prominence in 1988 when it launched an audacious, but ultimately thwarted, bid for Bank Leu, then the country's fifth-largest. BZ's most controversial move has been into investment trusts. In July 1991, the group, together with Mr Blocher, bought a controlling stake in Pharma Vision. It was then a sleepy trust with large holdings in the big Swiss pharmaceutical companies, Ciba-Geigy, Roche and Sandoz, as well as some US shares and Ems Chemie, the Swiss speciality chemical company controlled by Mr Blocher. Three months later, a similar trust, BK Vision, was formed to hold stakes in banks. BK got off to a strong start, as some of BZ's powerful clients exchanged their bank shares for its shares, and already has assets of SFr1.2bn. Mr Ebner and Mr Blocher portray these ventures as the leading edge in shareholder power in Switzerland. As Mr Blocher, chairman of Pharma Vision, said shortly after the takeover: 'Pharma Vision focuses on a small number of promising holdings. This facilitates communication with the management of the respective companies. Thus Pharma Vision assumes a role which cannot be played by the individual shareholder in an increasingly anonymous and fragmented shareholder community.' That is a laudable aim, even if it makes company directors uncomfortable. But critics claim that in a small market like Switzerland's, and one in which disclosure requirements are still primitive, BZ's concentration on large blocks of shares of a very few companies offers opportunities for manipulation that would not be available in more transparent markets. Mr Ebner makes no apologies for the group's policy of focusing on only a few Swiss shares, saying he prefers to stick with what he knows best. Also, the group concentrates on blue-chip issues, where liquidity and transparency are high. He acknowledges that BZ has some power over the companies in which it holds large blocks of shares, but he insists he uses it responsibly. He is not interested, for example, in insider information that might move the market in the short term. Rather, he wants to support managers who he believes will make their companies perform well in the longer term. That may be all there is to it. But it is intriguing that the directors of UBS have chosen - by sacking Mr Blocher - to invite a confrontation with BK Vision and Mr Ebner now. They, like Mr Ebner, cherish power, too.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL-STAR GAME;  </P> <P> TELEVISION / LARRY STEWART;  </P> <P> REAGAN CAN'T HANDLE EASY PITCH FOR NBC  </P> <P> Dutch Reagan, the oldtime Iowa sportscaster, made a comeback Tuesday night at  the All-Star game.  </P> <P> Well, sort of.  </P> <P> Working the first inning with play-by-play announcer Vin Scully for NBC, Reagan  showed he's a little rusty.  </P> <P> He had said before the game that he was worried he might say the obvious.  </P> <P> He did.  </P> <P> When the game's first hitter, Ozzie Smith, was tagged out trying steal second,  Scully dully noted, "They've got him."  </P> <P> Reagan added: "And he's out."  </P> <P> Then Reagan seemed to get a little lost when he asked: "That's Tony Gwynn?"  </P> <P> "Yeah, at the plate," Scully said.  </P> <P> After Scully noted that Kevin Mitchell knocked in the game's first run, Reagan  added, "It's a run batted in."  </P> <P> Thanks, Ronnie.  </P> <P> Well, at least you have to appreciate that Reagan agreed to make the guest  appearance in the first place.  </P> <P> Surely, he had to realize what he was getting into.  </P> <P> TV sports critics generally are only slightly less vicious than political  columnists.  </P> <P> A week and a half ago, Reagan was bucked off a horse in Mexico. "I didn't fall  off, I got thrown off," he told viewers Tuesday night. "I'm all black and blue  under these clothes."  </P> <P> The going was pretty rough Tuesday night as well.  </P> <P> To his credit, Reagan seemed to realize it. Before giving way to Tom Seaver in  the second inning, he said he was self-conscious and apologized for being  "uptight."  </P> <P> Apparently, this assignment was tougher than a presidential press conference  with Sam Donaldson sitting in the front row.  </P> <P> However, Dick Ebersol, the new NBC Sports president, seemed pleased.  </P> <P> "He'll be back for the opening game in 1994 after baseball returns to NBC where  it belongs," quipped Ebersol.  </P> <P> CBS' three-year contract with major league baseball begins next season.  </P> <P> It was Ebersol's idea to invite Reagan to work an inning. "I called his main  spokesman, Mark Weinburg, my second day on the job," Ebersol said.  </P> <P> "At first, Weinburg said, 'No way,' but eventually we talked him into it."  </P> <P> Reagan came prepared. He had read the press guides and drawn up diagrams and  notecards for himself, Eberbol said.  </P> <P> He informed viewers that Gwynn was the only player in the National League to  play in every game last season.  </P> <P> Not a bad stat.  </P> <P> He told of how Mitchell was a former gang member in San Diego and that his  brother was killed, a well-known story but worth repeating.  </P> <P> Yes, Reagan made the effort. But he was obviously nervous, which is  interesting. We're not talking about someone who has never had to face a camera  and microphone before.  </P> <P> Making matters worse was that there were four runs scored and back-to-back home  runs during the 25-minute inning Reagan was on stage.  </P> <P> The hitters weren't having problems with the shadows. It was the former  president who struck out.  </P> <P> Otherwise, it was a fine night for NBC.  </P></p>

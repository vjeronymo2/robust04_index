			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 180,000 SOVIET BUREAUCRATS GIVEN NEW JOBS  </P> <P> More than 180,000 bureaucrats of the Russian Republic, the largest of the  Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics, have been shifted to other jobs in the  past six months, the official Tass news agency said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Tass did not say where the 180,000 are now employed.  </P> <P> The reductions are part of a move to decentralize the Soviet economy, where  bureaucrats have long determined everything from prices to the number of nails  sold in Moscow stores.  </P> <P> Initial results of the plan were discussed at a meeting of the Presidium of the  republic's Council of Ministers on Monday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> IT'S ST. BERNARD OVER ST. ANTHONY AT BUZZER, 59-58  </P> <P> After lealding by as many as 10 points in the first half, St. Bernard High held  on in a tight second half to beat visiting St. Anthony High, 59-58, in a Camino  Real League game Saturday night as a 16-foot jump shot by the Saints' Damaine  Powell bounced off the back rim at the buzzer.  </P> <P> The Vikings (12-10, 7-5), who had four players score in double figures, were  paced by Wyking Jones' 15 points.  </P> <P> Terry Sullivan (12 points) hit two free throws with 35 seconds left to close  the scoring.  </P> <P> "He's been a clutch player for us," St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune said of  Sullivan. "So I wasn't surprised. I thought he would (hit the free throw)."  </P> <P> The second-place Saints (13-5, 9-3) were led by Oscar Encinas, who scored 23  points.  </P> <P> With 1:42 left in the game, Powell found backcourt mate Mike Smith open for a  layup that gave St. Anthony a 56-53 lead.  </P> <P> Ten seconds later Chris Keldorf (12 points) was fouled making a three-point  basket and converted to give St. Bernard a 57-56 lead.  </P> <P> Encinas missed on the Saints' next possession, but Smith scored after making a  steal to give them a one-point lead with 39 seconds left.  </P> <P> A backcourt foul by Powell four seconds later sent Sullivan to the line, where  he provided the margin of victory.  </P></p>

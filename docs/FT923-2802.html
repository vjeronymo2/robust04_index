			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Papers on BCCI 'priced at Pounds 200,000' AN ACCOUNTANT expected a solicitor to pay Pounds 200,000 for documents uncovered during the investigation into the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, an Old Bailey jury was told yesterday. Mr Tim Langdale QC, prosecuting, said Mr Bernard Lynch had acted as 'go-between' in a plot with Mr Mark Braley, an accountant who was part of the Serious Fraud Office's investigation into BCCI. He said Mr Lynch tried to sell files to Mr Michael Barratt, a solicitor for Mr Syed Ziauddin Ali Akbar, a former BCCI official who is awaiting the outcome of extradition proceedings in France. The jury heard that Mr Braley told detectives after his arrest that - according to Mr Lynch - Mr Barratt had brought Pounds 200,000 from France. If Mr Braley was prepared to take 'certain risks' and supply inside material, most of the money would go to him. Mr Lynch, who was not involved in the SFO inquiry, had asked Mr Braley to keep a file of 'juicy' documents. The jury has already heard that Mr Barratt exposed the plan to police and was equipped with secret recording equipment to trap Mr Lynch and Mr Braley. Mr Lynch, of Forest Hill, south London, and Mr Braley, of Hayes, west London, deny conspiring to pervert the course of justice. The jury has heard that both admit conspiring corruptly to obtain a consideration from Mr Barratt between the same dates, and that Mr Braley alone admits the theft of four share certificates from HM Customs. Mr Langdale said Mr Braley told detectives he had 'foolishly' given Mr Lynch a copy of a sensitive document which was later leaked to The Times. He had become suspicious of Mr Lynch's motives and had not realised until his arrest what was going on. Mr Barratt said Lynch claimed to be friendly with police officers in the SFO who were willing to supply information. 'He made it clear his contacts were prepared to sell information to me,' said Mr Barratt. 'I had taken advice about this from a solicitor friend and I told him I was interested.' In fact, Mr Langdale said, Mr Braley had been Mr Lynch's sole contact in the SFO. Mr Neil Bennett, banking correspondent of The Times, said Mr Lynch handed to him in a pub a document setting out the state of the investigation into an investment firm associated with BCCI. 'I was stunned with what I saw,' Mr Bennett told the jury. The case continues.</p>

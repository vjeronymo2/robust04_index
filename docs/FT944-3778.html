			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Algerian Moslem rebels shot Algerian security forces yesterday shot dead six Moslem rebels during a search operation in the western town of Oued Berkeche, the Algerian news agency APS reported. Three of those killed in Oued Berkeche, 280 miles west of Algiers, were from the neighbouring town of Sidi-Bel-Abbes and were suspected of involvement in several murders, said APS, quoting a statement by security officials. More than 400 Moslem militants have been killed by security forces since the begining of November, according to official statements. Between 10,000 and 20,000 people have been killed in Algeria's political violence since authorities cancelled in January 1992 a general election which Islamists were poised to win.</p>

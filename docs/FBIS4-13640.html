			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "With the Events" program] </F>   [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, a new round of talks concluded  in Cairo today without reaching agreement on all outstanding  issues. Meanwhile, some progress has been made by the Civilian  Affairs Committee. Our colleague 'Umar Zaydani sums up the  outcome of this round of talks:    [Begin recording] [Zaydani] Another round of negotiations  was  concluded between Israeli and PLO representatives in Cairo this  afternoon. This round of talks registered great progress on  several topics listed on the agenda, according to Major General  Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the talks. The  topics negotiated by the Civilian Affairs Committee have almost  been settled. However, some issues, such as the Palestinians'  demand to have an international telephone zone number, as well  as issues pertaining to stamps and passports, are yet to be  decided. They will be decided later, that is, after the  agreement is signed.    [Shahaq, in Hebrew, with superimposed translation into  Arabic] There is also the issue pertaining to the economic talks  currently under way in Paris. An agreement has to be reached in  this regard. We have to know what is happening there in order to  incorporate the economic agreement into the overall agreement.  There are hurdles facing the Security Committee and the Legal  Affairs Committee, although some progress has been made. Some  points on which agreement has been reached have been initialed.  With respect to the issues that are still under consideration,  they concern setting a timetable for the release of Palestinian  prisoners and detainees. The outstanding issues within these  committees will be discussed early next week. If things continue  to proceed as they are doing right now, that is, if progress  continues to be made, we will soon finalize what needs to  finalized.    [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Another week of negotiations  between Israel and the PLO has ended. You seem to be close to  an agreement. What are the outstanding issues at present?    [Sha'th] As is well known, we have completed the agreement  on  the complete transfer of civilian authorities, including tough  issues such as water, electronics, radio communications, air  traffic, etc. Likewise, we have completed the larger part of  the overall agreement. Nonetheless, agreement is yet to be  reached on four or five sentences. Some security issues whose  discussion was postponed until next week will have to be  decided. An overall deal, also known as a package deal  [preceding two words in English] will have to be reached on  them. With regard to the issue of jurisdiction [preceding word  in English] over territory, the population, and functions, a  solution to this issue has been reached. Nonetheless, this  solution needs to be drafted and agreed upon in detail next week.    With respect to the issue of the Palestinian deportees, I  would like to reaffirm that there has been a definite agreement  to release 5,000 prisoners. However, we want to set up a  framework for the release of the remaining prisoners next week.  Such a framework must, at least, establish the bases for  setting specific timetables for the release of prisoners. I  believe both sides can agree on this issue next week. Next  week, we will announce a date for the final signing of the  agreement. I hope the agreement will be signed during the  period 2-5 May.    [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: With regard to the Palestinian  prisoners, this issue is of great importance to the residents of  the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Will all Palestinian prisoners be  released? Or does Israel have any reservations on the release  of some prisoners?    [Sha'th] Israel has made public its reservations about the  release of Hamas prisoners and detainees. These reservations  were the outcome of the two recent operations carried out in  'Afula and Hadera. However, I believe this Israeli opposition  to releasing Hamas prisoners is connected to the outcome and  impact of these two operations. However, the principle we seek  to entrench is that of a general amnesty. Moreover, the  Declaration of Principles provides for a general amnesty. We  want all parties to be covered by this amnesty. This means we  should not leave in jail those who resisted or fought during the  period that preceded the signing of the agreement. This  requires the setting of timetables. To the best of my  knowledge, Israeli law stipulates that some categories of  prisoners cannot be released, but can be handed over to another  authority. When the Palestinian leadership takes over authority  in Gaza and Jericho, this law will apply to all residents of  Gaza and Jericho. When we take over authority in the West Bank,  this law will also apply to the residents of the West Bank. The  issue has to be governed by both principles and timetables.    [Zaydani] Have the talks been promoted by the fact that  Abu-Mazin [PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas] is  currently in Cairo, not to mention the meeting held between  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat in Bucharest?    [Sha'th] Undoubtedly, these two developments have had a  positive effect. The fact that brother Abu-Mazin is around  enables us to meet with him two or three times a day. He  received us and the Israeli delegation, that is, the chief  Israeli negotiators, once. I believe this had a positive  effect. It goes without saying that the high-level meetings  held with President 'Arafat can expedite the rapid attainment of  an agreement.    [Zaydani] What about the civil aviation agreements?    [Sha'th] We reached an agreement in principle in this regard  this week. The arrangements or modalities [preceding three  words in English] for this agreement are yet to be agreed upon.  I believe the agreement reached in principle in this regard is  good. It provides for the opening of airports in Gaza and  Jericho. It also provides for operating commercial and civilian  planes between Gaza and Jericho, and also between them and  neighboring capitals; at least, the capitals that are are  currently bound by ties in the context of peace. In the future,  when peace prevails in the region, this network of  communications will spread. That is why we said that the first  international air route that will be launched will be between  Gaza airport and Cairo International Airport.    [Zaydani] One last question. It seems that the agreement  will be signed, although some other differences regarding  passports and stamps are yet to be resolved.    [Sha'th] With regard to Palestinian passports, Palestinian  stamps, the size of the Jericho area, and the presence of  Palestinian soldiers at the Allenby Bridge will be left to be  decided by President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin when the  two meet.    [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Thank you very much.    [Sha'th] You are welcome. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Blue-chip groups join forces on voice network Five leading international telecommunications operators are to be invited to bid against each other for one of the largest service contracts ever awarded in Europe. Eighteen blue-chip companies have formed an association to handle the contract, which is to supply a private 'voice' network linking the west European offices of the participating companies. The five operators to be approached are British Telecommunications; AT&amp;T of the US; Sprint, a rival US carrier; Eunetcom, an alliance of the French and German state operators; and Unisource, an alliance of the Swedish, Dutch and Swiss state operators. According to the FT's Telecoms Markets newsletter, companies in the user association include Rank Xerox, ICI, Du Pont, Philips and Shell. It is expected to expand to more than 30 companies by 1994. Most of the companies already have private networks linking their offices. They expect the new arrangement will allow them to make large savings by creating a single network, which will be paid for on a usage basis. Laws protecting the monopolies of continental operators mean the companies will not be able to use the new network to communicate with each other. All 'voice' telecoms contact between them will have to use the public networks until the European Union's liberalisation programme extends competition to basic 'voice' services. This will not be until 1998 on the existing timetable. However, the contract reflects the degree of competition already permitted, and the readiness of multinationals to exploit it fully. It will also intensify competition between rival alliances of telecoms operators formed to bid for such contracts.</p>

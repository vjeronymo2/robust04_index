			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Arts: Glasgow 'Flute' in London - Opera The new Covent Garden Zauberflote is on loan from Scottish Opera. It was first given in Glasgow a year ago, hugely enjoyed and widely praised (by, among others, Richard Fairman on this page), and then snapped up to fill a hole in the Royal Opera's planning schedule. This, alas, is where the problems start. The transfer of an opera-staging from one company to another, more common than ever in the economically straitened 1990s, is fraught with danger - these are fragile plants, organically grown, and all too often fail to blossom, or even survive, in alien soil. As seen and heard at Covent Garden on Monday, this Flute is not exactly withered, just rather etiolated; disappointingly, its success in reproducing those qualities originally so much admired is considerably qualified. Martin Duncan's sparky production, in the chic, up-to-the-minute designs of Ken Lee, has both a saucy freshness and a keenly intelligent command of the original text (a great deal more of the opera's symbolic arcana is taken on board, or at least hinted at, than in most current Flute productions). Bright poster-paint colours - yellow and violet are the show's trademark - do not render impossible the opera's acts of ritual but do exclude unwanted portentousness. The costumes, which make sly reference to children's book illustrations, high fashion, 1950s film musicals, and also longstanding Mozart tradition, are a particular delight. But it all fails to fill out the Royal Opera space; and so what was doubtless a triumph of imaginative modern opera-design in the Glasgow Theatre Royal starts to look insubstantial in the wrong way on the broader, deeper Covent Garden stage. The cunningly economical use of drop-screens and trollies does not disguise the sense of inapt foreshortening that here takes hold. After a while Duncan's habit of moving his characters in group dance sequence in time to the music begins to irritate. Details remain witty. The larger whole, not always accurately lit, lacks resonance. Other reasons for the shortfall suggest themselves. In Glasgow the production had the benefit of Jeremy Sams's frisky translation - just what it needs. In London, the original language, though generally more punchily spoken and sung than it sometimes is in this theatre (by Kurt Streit's Tamino and Robert Lloyd's Sarastro especially), sits oddly on an almost entirely anglophone ensemble and an English-speaking audience; as ever in operatic comedy, the surtitles simply cannot make up the difference. The cast, of decent standard, seems slotted into the staging, not essential to the germination of its theatricality - this is a familiar by-product of production-loans. But to my mind easily the most powerful reason is the choice of Andrew Parrott as conductor. Parrott is a pioneering concert-hall exponent of Early Music and 'period' practice; his theatre experience is limited, and his command of Die Zauberflote even more so, as he reveals in almost every bar of the score. The concern to produce a quasi-'period' orchestral balance with the ROH's modern-instrument band leads in practice to acres of dry, flat, unluminous texture; the obsession with style-conscious fast tempos to a hectic, short-breathed rattling-along which serves the singers badly and the growth of dramatic momentum very little. So the musical pleasures, such as they are, are momentary, not regular, and confined to the most experienced and confidently communicative members of the cast. This means above all Mr Streit's boyishly athletic, vocally expert hero, equally good in phrases of reverie and decision, Lloyd's admirable leader-priest (an interestingly disturbing figure), and Sumi Jo's matchlessly pure, pearly-voiced Queen. Gordon Hawkins's Speaker makes a notably warm yet muscular impression; the Three Ladies (Lynda Russell, Leah-Marian Jones, Catherine Wyn-Rogers) are well matched, the three Boys (young girls, actually) likewise. Amanda Roocroft continues to develop her Pamina: she is now much surer on stage than when last encountered in this theatre, and spins out long lines with touchingly true musicianship. I wish I liked the actual sound of her lower and middle registers more. Papageno - make-or-break factor of any Flute - seems to me miscast: Peter Coleman-Wright, the ENO's aquiline Giovanni, noble Billy Budd and sinisterly handsome Tarquin, works hard at the production's birdman routines but looks and sounds temperamentally and physically ill-suited to distilling from them the authentic, house-warming vocal and personal charm. Royal Opera, Covent Garden: in repertory until December 11</p>

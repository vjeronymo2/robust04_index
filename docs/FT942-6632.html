			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Outdoors: Beetles on the menu - Country View I was sitting in the kitchen reading the paper one evening last week. Almost unnoticed it had become dark outside and I had the light on although the curtains were still open. Suddenly there was a loud clonk on the glass. For a moment I was taken by surprise but then I realised that it must have been a May bug or cockchafer beetle. These are scarab beetles, relatives of the dung beetles, but are plant eaters. While the May bug does a good job in keeping the countryside clean, chafers can be harmful. The cockchafer grub is that white plump larva sometimes dug up in the soil when gardening. These grubs feed on the roots of grasses, cereals and soft fruit and, as they live underground for three years, they can eat many roots in that time. A good summer for cockchafers, when the female successfully lays many eggs, can mean problems for farmers and market gardeners for several years. Rooks are very fond of the grubs and do a good job of finding them in the soil. In fact the cockchafer grub's nickname is 'rookworm' and rooks probably do a great deal more good than harm in the fields. The larvae finally turn into new chafers in the autumn but the beetles remain underground until the following spring when, in May or early June, they emerge from the soil and can be seen flying around the countryside. They are large and heavy insects with thick brown wing cases which are held open and clear of the wings when the beetle is in flight. Although they make a loud and alarming buzzing sound and frequently crash noisily into objects when flying around, these beetles are harmless to humans. As adults they eat only a small amount of vegetable food, the foliage of deciduous trees, and do far less harm than their offspring. In fact cockchafers are a very important food source for several mammals. Badgers eat large numbers of the larvae and, if they find an area where these are prolific, they will turn over the grass and bore down through the turf in their efforts to obtain them. The damage to the grassland looks dreadful but they are doing a great deal of good in the long term. It is rarely possible, however, to convince green keepers and lawn lovers of this at the time of the damage. Greater horseshoe bats specialise in eating cockchafers in the spring. And, for a bat needing to eat half its own bodyweight every day, they must be a valuable source of nutrition. The bats probably capture cockchafers on the ground as they do beetles. Both species make a loud buzz immediately before take-off and this will attract the bat which then pounces, picking the beetle up and carrying it off. The bat only eats the soft parts and even a bat as large as the greater horseshoe will often have to hang up to deal with an insect as big as the cockchafer so that remains of wing cases and other hard bits collect underneath a favourite perch. Without bats to control cockchafer numbers, there could be many more grubs feeding on many more roots. Consider for a moment, when you next eat strawberries in the summer sunshine, that you may have bats to thank for them.</p>

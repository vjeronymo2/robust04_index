The squeeze on corporate earnings will end only after  consumption at the household level picks up, Susumu Taketomi,  chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan, told reporters  at the Japan National Press Club.    Completion of corporate inventory adjustment, the first  stage  of economic recovery in the usual economic cycle, cannot take  place in the absence of a recovery in personal spending,  Taketomi added.    Proposed income tax cuts are expected to expand the  purchasing power of consumers, he said.    Taketomi said the Japanese economy is in a crisis  unprecedented since the end of World War II. It is suffering  "three kinds of stagnancy" -- slack corporate capital spending,  falling profits and near-zero real economic growth, he said.    The current slump is different from past ones, which were  overcome by cyclical economic forces, he said. "The current  economy has been stalled in a big industrial adjustment wave  under the heavy weight of excessive manpower and investment," he  said.    "The economy has been trapped in the Bermuda triangle, an  area where many shipwrecks are said to have taken place due to a  water level difference between the Pacific and the Atlantic."    "Taking a great leap over this cross-section is necessary  for  Japan's economy to smoothly shift from high growth to stable  growth," Taketomi said, noting the need not only for additional  fiscal measures by the government but for more corporate efforts  for industrial innovation.    Taketomi said personal consumption could pick up in Japan if  pent-up demand is stimulated, for example, by the launch of new  products tailored to the varying needs of consumers.    Despite the domestic recession, Japan's imports have risen  recently because consumers are going for overseas products which  are discounted heavily but still have a qualitative appeal.    Demand could also emerge at any time because of the need to  replace major durable goods like cars and televisions, he said.    Taketomi refrained from guessing when Japan's economy will  hit bottom.    He limited himself to saying that recovery in  nonmanufacturing sectors such as nonbank moneylenders and real  estate will only come after that of makers and is unlikely to  take place in 1994.    Low productivity may stand out in nonmanufacturers when they  are exposed to price-cutting competition under ongoing  deregulation, he said.</p>

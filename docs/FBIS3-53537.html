			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Lost Opportunity"] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has wasted a valuable  and unique opportunity to restore confidence in the role of the  United States and to reaffirm that it is qualified to lead the  world toward a new international order. He did this when he  failed to wrench an approval from his partners in NATO on a  proposal for concentrated air strikes on Bosnia that would end  the continuous Serb attacks on Muslims. When we recall that the  United States itself presented this proposal last August, we  realize that the U.S. President's weakness, which was clearly  manifested at the Brussels summit, is a result of a state of  reluctance and confusion that prevails in the decisions and  stands of the U.S. Administration. This U.S. Administration is  wasting a great inheritance of military and political glory  created by [former] President George Bush's administration when  it stood against the Iraqi aggression on Kuwait with a sincere  will, a brave stand, and a daring decision that put an end to  treacherous belligerence and gave the United States the prestige  and respect that qualifies it to lead the world after it became  the last superpower on earth.    It seemed clear that during the Brussels summit, the U.S.  President was unable to take hold of the necessary reins to make  a strategic decision that would reinforce the credibility of the  "president of the world" as is being touted in political  terminology!! It is no surprise that the U.S. President has  become a target of derision for Zhirinovskiy, the leader of  Russian fascism, and disdain for Milosevic, the leader of the  Serbs. The former proposed to extend a helping hand to the  "weak" United States. The latter responded to the proposal to  deal air strikes by intensifying the malicious fire on Sarajevo!?    This American retreat, which is due to tactical calculations  and favoring regional interests at the expense of the global  responsibilities of the last superpower, is considered  submission to tyrants and encouragement for aggression. This  will create new facts in the international arena. These facts  will contribute to rekindling the fire from beneath the ashes of  the cold war!    This disgraceful retreat from the decision to deter the  aggressor, coupled with the unfair decision that equates the  heavily armed Serb and the Muslim deprived of the right to own a  means of self-defense, renders those who abstain from making a  deterrent decision partners in an international conspiracy  against Bosnia-Herzegovina and partakers in the aggression  carried out by the criminals of the barbarian war launched by  the Serbs in the name of old crusades and new fascism.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lyudmila Yermakova, ITAR-TASS parliamentary </F> correspondent]    [Text] Moscow, 7 April -- The Russian president's decree,  "On introducing a state of emergency in parts of the Republic of  North Ossetia and the Ingush Republic," which extends the state  of emergency for two more months, was approved by the Federation  Council today.    The situation in the zone of conflict was discussed behind  closed doors for four hours, however, the issue remained open  and the problem will be further discussed tomorrow. Vasiliy  Tarasenko, chairman of the committee for federation affairs and  regional policy, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that attempts  had been made to block the approval of the decree on various  pretexts. In his view, "It is not as much a result of the  conflict between the two republics as a way to influence  relations between power structures in general." Unfortunately,  "Politics and the stirring up of the conflict at the expense of  people's sufferings interfere" in the problem of approving the  presidential decree, he remarked.</p>

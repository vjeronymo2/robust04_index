			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Continuation funding will be awarded to an ongoing evaluation study entitled ``Development of Manuals for ACYF to Use in Evaluating Demonstration Projects'' (FY 1993&hyph;present). This project is developing general and specific manuals to assist ACYF grantees in the design and implementation of their internal program evaluations. One of the specific manuals will be designed for FYSB grantees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> F. Eligible Applicants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The legislation authorizing the runaway and homeless youth programs addressed in this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcement identifies ``eligible applicants'' differently. Accordingly, the definition appropriate to each individual program is found in Part III of this announcement as a part of each priority area description. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organizations that have current Basic Center and/or Drug Abuse Prevention Program grants with project periods ending in FY 1994 and all remaining eligible applicants may apply for new grants for either or both of these two programs. Basic Center and DAPP grantees with one or two years remaining on their current awards and the expectation of continuation funding in FY 1994 may not apply for new grants under that particular grant program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organizations that have current Transitional Living Program grants with project periods ending in FY 1994 and all remaining eligible applicants may apply for new Transitional Living Program grants. Transitional Living Program grantees with one or two years remaining on their current awards and the expectation of continuation funding in FY 1994 may not apply for new grants under that particular grant program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statewide and Regional nonprofit organizations, and/or combinations of such organizations, with demonstrated experience in providing services to runaway and homeless youth service providers are eligible to apply for T&amp;TA grants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants may refer to Part VI, Appendix D for a listing of current grantees that are ineligible to apply for one or more of these grant programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Non-profit applicants which have not previously received financial support from the Administration on Children, Youth and Families must submit proof of their non-profit status with their grant application. This can be done either by making reference to the applicant's listing in the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt organizations or by submitting a copy of its letter from the IRS (IRS Code, sections 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(6)). Non-profit applicants cannot be funded without acceptable proof of this status. Failure to provide proof of nonprofit status will result in rejection of the application. Such applications will receive no further consideration from ACF. For-profit entities may participate as grantees under Priority Area A, Runaway and Homeless Youth Basic Center Programs, but may participate only as sub-grantees for any other priority areas in this announcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Availability of Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administration on Children, Youth and Families expects to award approximately 600 new and continuation grants to serve runaway and homeless youth in FY 1994. Dollar amounts to be awarded by fiscal year and program are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Basic Center Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administration on Children, Youth and Families expects to award $32,499,000 in Basic Center Program grants in FY 1994. Of this total, $18,377,159 will be awarded in the form of non-competitive continuations to current grantees, and the remaining $14,121,841 will be available for competitive, new-start awards. In accordance with the RHY Act, the funds will be divided among the States in proportion to their respective populations under the age of 18. We recognize that the RHY Act also conditionally requires that the amounts allotted to each State (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) be at least $100,000, and the amounts allotted to the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Palau), and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands be at least $45,000 each. However, to apply these minimum allocations in FY 1994 would result in 23 of the remaining States receiving less than they received in FY 1992. Under these conditions, section 311(b)(3) of the Act becomes operable, which directs that the ongoing State minimum of $75,000 and the ongoing Territorial minimum of $30,000 continue as the basic award levels in FY 1994. The amount of funds available for both continuations and new starts in each of the States and Territories is listed in the Table of Allocations by State (Part VI, Appendix E) which reflects the FY 1994 allocations for each State. In this Table, the amounts shown in the column labeled New Starts are the amounts available for competition in the respective States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current Basic Center Program grantees having one or two years remaining in their project periods will receive instructions from their respective ACF Regional Offices on the procedures for applying for these continuation grants and should not respond to this announcement. These grantees are listed in Part VI, Appendix D.1, have project expiration dates in FY 1995 and 1996, and are not eligible to apply for new Basic Center grants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

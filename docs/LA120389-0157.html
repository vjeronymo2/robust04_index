			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> A New York boxing official overruled a split decision in Friday's fight that  had Dennis Milton upsetting Michael Olajide.  </P> <P> The controversy arose when referee Ken Zimmer stepped in with three seconds  left in the 10th and final round of the bout between Milton and Olajide at the  Empire State Convention Center.  </P> <P> Zimmer wrapped his arms around Olajide and waved off both fighters, apparently  stopping the fight and giving Olajide the victory.  </P> <P> But Zimmer later said he thought he had heard the bell and was actually  signaling the end of the fight.  </P> <P> The fight then became a judges' decision and Milton was declared the winner by  scores of 94-90 and 94-91. A third card had Olajide, ranked No. 4 by the World  Boxing Council, winning 94-92.  </P> <P> But Randy Gordon, state boxing chairman, reviewed a videotape of the fight and  overruled the decision pending a meeting of the New York State Athletic  Commission.  </P></p>

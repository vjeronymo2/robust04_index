			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pacific sales help Linx edge ahead A DRAMATIC sales increase in the Pacific region helped Linx Printing Technologies, the maker of continuous ink jet printers, edge ahead in its first six months as a quoted company. The group suffered a significant loss of gross margin, mainly due to launch costs of the 6000 series printer and its delayed introduction in the US. Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 763,000 on sales of Pounds 5.75m in the six months to December 31. Earnings per share fell from 3.88p to 3.7p, reflecting the increased number of shares in issue following the flotation. A first interim dividend of 0.35p is declared. The 6000 printer is expected to produce a 15 per cent increase in gross margin over the 5000 series and should account for 50 per cent of sales in the second half. The group finished the period with net cash, but has not excluded the possibility of gearing up. Sales in Europe, including the UK, rose 4 per cent to Pounds 3.97m, with strong growth in France and Italy and slower progress in Germany and the UK. North American sales increased 9 per cent to Pounds 612,000, but the rest of the world jumped to Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 541,000) with Japan particularly strong. Sales to Germany and Japan now each account for about 20 per cent of the total and the US accounts for about 10 per cent, without the benefit of any significant sales of the 6000 series printer. Mr Derek Harris, chairman, said there would also be scope for increasing margin with the production of ink from Linx own plant and the introduction of environment friendly ink COMMENT Linx provided few deviations from expectations. Falls in margin are explainable and should be more than reversed with the introduction the 6000 series printer. On the plus side, fears of an over-dependence on Germany should subside as rapid growth in the Pacific region reduces dependence on Europe. Earnings should grow 20 per cent a year for the next two years and there is scope for more growth in market share, particularly as US General Electric's Videojet is now at a relative currency disadvantage. That said, Linx is probably fully valued. Pre-tax profits should be Pounds 2.2m for the year, giving 10.2p of earnings and a prospective multiple of about 18 that is at the correct premium to the market.</p>

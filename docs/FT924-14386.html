			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: Pirelli's Dutch unit shares dip SHARES IN Pirelli Tyre Holding (PTH), the Amsterdam-quoted tyres subsidiary of Italy's Pirelli tyres and cables group, fell sharply yesterday on news of a plan to double its share capital. PTH, which is 79 per cent of owned by its italian parent, intends to double its equity by raising Fl 465m (Dollars 292.4m) in a one-for-one rights issue, priced at the stock's nominal value of Fl 10 a share. Shares in PTH were originally sold at Fl 54 when the company was floated in June 1989. Shares in PTH, fell Fl 9.60 to Fl 11.50 from Thursday's closing price of Fl 21.10, amid highly critical comments by Dutch analysts. 'It's like a gun being pointed at the heads of (outside) shareholders,' said Mr Richard Brakenhoff, at Pierson, Heldring and Pierson, the Dutch merchant bank. Pirelli in Milan justified the deal on the grounds that recapitalising PTH would raise much-needed cash to cut debts and interest charges. Additional funds would also be required to finance investment in new products and more efficient plant. Subscribing to the new shares in full will cost outside shareholders Fl 96.7m. However, Pirelli made clear it would underwrite the entire issue if necessary. The Italian parent last month announced a return to profit with first-half group net earnings of L77bn (Dollars 62.2m). PTH reported a first-half loss of Fl 76.5m and expects further losses for the rest of the year.</p>

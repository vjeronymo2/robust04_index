			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Applicants request that any order also apply to any open-end investment company advised by the Adviser or any entity controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser, or for which the Distributor or any entity controlled by or under common control with the Distributor serves as principal underwriter and that (a) hereafter becomes part of the same ``group of investment companies,'' as defined in rule 11a&hyph;3, and (b) issues classes of shares that are identical in all material respects to the classes described in this application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants seek an order to permit each of the Funds to offer multiple classes of shares (the ``Multiple Class System''). The Funds initially will issue four classes of shares. The requested order also will permit each Fund to assess a CDSC on redemptions of certain classes of shares, and waive the CDSC under certain circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Class A shares generally will be offered at net asset value plus a front-end sales charge. Class A shares will be sold without a front-end sales charge, however, but rather will be subject to a CDSC if they were purchased (a) in an amount greater than a specified amount (currently expected to be $1 million) or (b) with the proceeds from the redemption or sale of shares of another investment company (which redemption did not result in the payment by the investor of a CDSC). The CDSC for such Class A shares will be at an expected rate of up to 1% if they are redeemed within four years after purchase. In addition, all Class A shares will be subject to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing fee of up to .25% of the average daily net assets of the class annually.. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Class B shares will be offered without a front-end sales charge, but will be subject to a CDSC at an expected rate of up to 1% on redemptions within the first year after purchase. In addition, the shares will bear rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fees of up to .75% (.50% in the case of some Funds) and a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing fee of up to .25% of the average daily net assets of the class annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Class C shares will be subject to a variable rate CDSC (declining over time) for a period of several years after purchase. Applicants currently expect that the percentage of the CDSC generally will vary from 6% for redemptions made during the first year from initial purchase to 1% for redemptions made during the sixth year from purchase. In addition, Class C shares will bear rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fees of up to .75%, and a non-rule  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing expense of up to .25%, of the average daily net assets of the class annually. Class C will automatically convert into Class A shares after a specified period (currently expected to be six years) from the date of purchase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Class D shares will be offered without any sales charges or rule 12b&hyph;1 fees. Class D shares will be offered only to certain qualified institutional investors that wish to make very large investments. Investors eligible to purchase Class D shares will include tax-qualified employee benefit plans, endowment funds, foundations, and other tax-exempt organizations and certain insurance company separate accounts. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The minimum initial investment amount will be $25,000 or less for Class A, Class B and Class C shares and $1,000,000 for Class D shares. These amounts may be changed from time to time, but it is anticipated that, even if the specific amounts change, the Class A, Class B, and Class C shares would continue to have a low minimum investment, while Class D shares would have a much higher minimum investment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. The net asset value of all outstanding shares of all classes of a Fund will be computed by allocating gross income and expenses to each class based on the net assets attributable to each class, except for rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, shareholder servicing expenses, and ``Class Expenses,'' as defined in condition 1 below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Class C shares will automatically convert into Class A shares or shares of classes created in the future which are identical in all material respects to the Class A shares after a specified period (not to exceed six years) following the purchase date. Class C shares acquired by exchange from Class C shares of another Fund will convert into Class A shares based on the time of the initial purchase. Class C shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class C shares will convert into Class A shares at the same time as the shares with respect to which they were purchased are converted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Applicants expect that shares of each Fund may be exchanged for shares of the same respective class in any other fund, without payment of an additional sales charge. All exchange privileges applicable to each class will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

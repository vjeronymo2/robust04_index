Applicability of Public Involvement Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Equitable public participation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agency believes that affected members of the community should have an equal opportunity to participate in the permitting process. EPA considers the community to be all residents in the vicinity of the facility who might be most affected by the facility's operations. The Agency recognizes that local communities may be composed of a diverse group of people who may not share English as a primary language. Therefore, for a notice to be effective, the Agency is requiring under proposed &sect;124.30 that both the facility and the permitting authority make all reasonable efforts to communicate with the various segments within the community. Multilingual public notices and fact sheets may be necessary for some communities, for example, communities that contain a significant non-English speaking population. Likewise, interpreters may need to be provided at public meetings and hearings. EPA understands that developing multilingual notices and fact sheets, and providing translators, could be difficult to implement depending on the size, composition, and diversity of the community. Also, resource constraints could be a factor when determining what is a ``reasonable effort'' to communicate effectively with the public. EPA would like to solicit comments on how the requirements proposed in &sect;124.30 could be implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.1. Agency activities dealing with environmental justice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is placing heavy emphasis on environmental justice issues across all environmental programs. The Agency has stated repeatedly that environmental justice is one of EPA's top priorities; all offices should consider environmental justice issues during decision-making.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In December 1993, the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) established an Environmental Justice Task Force to broaden discussion of these issues and formulate short and long-term recommendations for how OSWER can integrate the Agency's environmental justice goals and objectives into all of OSWER's programs and activities. Specifically, the task force has examined ways that OSWER can better address the concerns of minority populations and low-income populations that are affected by OSWER-regulated facilities and may face disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects. The task force has included representatives from all OSWER program and administrative offices, as well as other offices throughout the Agency that have an interest in OSWER's programs and activities. The task force has met with representatives from citizen groups, industry, Congress, and state and local governments to ensure that stakeholders have an opportunity to influence OSWER's environmental justice strategy. The draft recommendations emerging from OSWER's Environmental Justice Task Force are consistent with and supportive of the Agency's environmental justice goals and objectives, as well as the President's Executive Order on Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that this rule presents significant opportunities to be responsive to environmental justice concerns in relation to specific OSWER-regulated facilities. The measures recommended in this proposed rule would help enhance the level of public participation in the permitting process and thereby provide minority populations and low-income populations with a greater voice in decision-making and a stronger opportunity to influence permit decisions early in the process. In today's proposal, the Agency would like to solicit comments on ways to incorporate environmental justice concerns into the RCRA public participation process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to public participation, some of the key environmental justice issues for the RCRA permitting program include: (1) The siting of hazardous waste facilities; (2) the manner in which EPA should respond when confronted with a challenge to a RCRA permit based on environmental justice issues; and (3) environmental justice concerns in corrective action cleanups. The Agency requests comments on these aspects of the RCRA program in order to help identify the need for additional rulemaking or policy guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has also begun to focus on how EPA's programs can take account of the ``cumulative risk'' and ``cumulative effects'' associated with human exposure to multiple sources of pollution. Although the Agency does not expect to address these issues in this rulemaking, EPA would like to solicit comment on suggested methodologies and procedures for undertaking this type of analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the siting of a RCRA facility, EPA has in the past focused on geological factors to be considered when siting a facility, but has not undertaken a concerted effort to address environmental justice issues associated with the siting of a hazardous waste facility. The draft final report of the OSWER Environmental Justice Task Force recommends that the Agency compile a national summary of existing State, tribal, and local government requirements for siting with regard to environmental justice. The draft report also recommends that the Agency develop guidance for State, tribal, and local governments on how to best site a hazardous waste facility in the light of environmental justice concerns. In developing this guidance, the Agency would look to existing State and local requirements and would consult with a wide range of public and private stakeholders. EPA has placed the OSWER Environmental Justice Task Force Draft Final Report, April 25, 1994, into the docket for this proposed rule. The Agency is soliciting comments on the recommendations in the draft final report, as well as on any additional steps that the Agency might wish to consider in order to respond to environmental justice concerns associated with the siting of RCRA facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also interested in exploring appropriate responses when confronted with a challenge to a RCRA permit based on environmental justice concerns. This issue has arisen in the context of recent challenges under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act alleging that federal grants allocated to States to support State RCRA permit programs are being administered in a discriminatory manner. The draft report of the OSWER Environmental Justice Task Force recommends that the Agency first seek to mediate appropriate resolutions among affected citizens, the State, and the permittee. Where necessary and prudent, the task force also proposes that the Agency explore ways of using risk and/or health assessments to determine whether the affected community would face unacceptable human health or environmental effects if the permit were issued. EPA requests comment on these recommendations as well as on the relationship of Title VI to RCRA permitting and EPA's administration of state grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

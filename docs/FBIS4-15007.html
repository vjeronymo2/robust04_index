			<p>BFN     [Text] Every possible effort to prevent a tragedy like the  October events in Moscow should for any politician of Russia be  the paramount aim, the main requirement both of himself and of  his comrades-in-arms. Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated  this in an interview to the INTERFAX agency.    There should be only one road to achieving one's political  aims -- elections, the president noted. In his view, we are  assimilating the lesson of the October tragedy, albeit with  difficulty. Boris Yeltsin named as evidence of this the  drafting of an agreement on civil peace. which an ever broader  circle of parties and organizations are voicing the wish to join.    Yet another lesson of those dark days is the vital necessity  for the strengthening of the state, the president declared.  Nobody should be allowed to destroy state buildings, mount  assaults upon television, and form armed detachments.    In the words of Boris Yeltsin, there is now the necessary  minimum for strengthening the state. The Constitution has been  adopted by the vote of all the people. The president noted that  the new basic law had put an end to dual power and opened up a  peaceful, civilized road to the resolution of contradictions.</p>

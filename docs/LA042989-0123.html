			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> NEW HEAD OF BUILDING ASSOCIATION QUITS TO JOIN HOPKINS DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> John Withers, recently named to succeed John Erskine as executive director of  the Building Industry Assn. of Orange County, is instead resigning from the  trade association to join a developer.  </P> <P> Withers, director of governmental affairs for 2 years, will head a new  residential development unit at Hopkins Development Co. in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> The trade association is searching for a new executive director. Erskine,  director for 7 years, is leaving May 15 to practice law.  </P> <P> The BIA is the lobby for home builders and related businesses.  </P> <P> Hopkins, known primarily as a developer of retail properties, will build both  houses and condominiums and will concentrate on filling in already developed  areas rather than building new suburbs, Withers said.  </P> <P> The resignations come during a lull in an ongoing battle between the county's  powerful real estate industry and slow-growth advocates.  </P> <P> One of the biggest issues likely to face the new executive director is drumming  up public support for a half-cent sales tax increase to fund construction of  new roads. That will probably go before the county's voters next year.  </P></p>

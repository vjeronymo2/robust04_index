			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama" newscast] </F>   [Text] The government of Mexico City and the Assembly of  Representatives have issued a joint statement condemning the  acts of violence and attempts of sabotage during recent days in  Mexico City and around Mexico State. The communique by the  local government and representatives of the people came a few  hours after Mexico City Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez and assembly  members held a closed-door meeting at the central department's  headquarters, where security measures have been increased via  careful searches of citizens at the building's main access  points. During the meeting, which was preceded over by a  meeting attended by Protection and Highways Secretary Rene  Monterrubio and chiefs of that group, the government of Mexico  City and the representatives agreed on the following measures:    1. The Federal District Department will hold periodic  meetings with the Assembly of Representatives to keep the  assembly members abreast of the situation in the city.    2. The meetings of the Precinct Councils for Public Security  and Civil Protection will be increased, and the regulations on  the matter issued by the assembly will be strictly enforced.    3. A representative of the local government will be named to  establish a timetable of periodic meetings with the  representatives, mainly with the members of the Public Security  and Justice Committees.    4. All of the city's police units, including the Bengala  Group, will continue to perform strictly preventive functions,  as has been reaffirmed. The Mexico City Attorney General's  Office--which is headed temporarily by Rene Gonzalez de la Vega  starting today--will be in charge of investigations.    5. The public is urged again to report to city police units  vehicle thefts and the presence of abandoned cars or armed  individuals in the streets, in addition to filing the  appropriate complaints.    6. The appropriate measures will be expedited to install  this week the 08 police hotline number to the remainder of the  city's areas; this system was extended on 10 January to the  Precincts of Alvaro Obregon, Tlalpan, and Magdalena Contreras.    7. The need was established for all of the patrols of the  General Secretariat of Protection and Highways, including  backups, to have the numbers and identification badges assigned  to them in each of the city's political entities.    8. A timetable of meetings between Mexico City  representatives and the business and commercial sector was  established so that the latter may expand their own security  systems in the areas where their buildings are located.    9. A surveillance operation will be established to punish  those who paint graffiti on private buildings or government  offices during demonstrations of support, which may not be  linked necessarily to the armed movement, as established by the  government's rules on civilian justice. At the end of the  meeting, Amalia Garcia, chairwoman of the Public Security  Committee of the Assembly of Representatives, said that in  addition to this agreement, Aguilera pledged before the  representatives to act at all times within the framework of the  law and with strict adherence to the people's human, political,  and civil rights.    [Begin Garcia recording] There would never be any  justification to violate the human and civil rights of Mexico  City residents; that would be unacceptable. We have also stated  that the constitutional guarantee to assemble, demonstrate, and  express one's opinion have to be respected. [end recording]</p>

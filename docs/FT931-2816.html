			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Democrat leaders defend budget plan THE US Congress began debating President Bill Clinton's budget proposals yesterday amid a last-minute struggle by Democratic leaders to preserve the plan against pressure for more cuts in spending. The leadership appeared confident of winning passage, in votes expected today, of a budget resolution that would cut the deficit by a total of Dollars 510bn (Pounds 359bn) over the next five years through a combination of spending cuts and tax rises. 'There is a substantial majority within the caucus to enact the package,' said Mr Thomas Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives. Some party leaders were concerned, however, about pressure from conservative Democrats, especially in the Senate, for cuts in the Dollars 16.3bn short-term stimulus package that Mr Clinton proposes as an accompanying measure. The budget resolution, which does not get into the details of which programmes would be cut, has already been considerably modified from the initial plan laid out last month. Echoing public enthusiasm for a serious attempt to tackle the federal budget deficit, members insisted on Dollars 63bn of additional spending cuts over five years. The resulting plan is expected to cut the budget deficit to Dollars 183.6bn in 1997, compared with a target of Dollars 206bn in the Clinton plan and a forecast of Dollars 322bn if policies remained unchanged. But details of the spending cuts would have to be debated in a later budget reconciliation bill, when support might start to coalesce behind individual spending programmes now pencilled in for cuts. The House is expected to debate one or two substitute budget resolutions offered by the Republican minority, as well as an alternative proposed by the congressional Black Caucus, which would make deeper cuts in defence to pay for increased spending in areas such as education. It remained unclear yesterday morning, however, how many amendments the powerful rules committee would allow to be brought up.</p>

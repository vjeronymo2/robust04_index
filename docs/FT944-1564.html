			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / French contract 'cartel' inquiry France's Council on Competition is expected to rule next spring on a preliminary report that the country's main public contractors have systematically rigged bids on highways, bridges and high-speed TGV rail track contracts over the past few years. According to the preliminary report, which has been leaked to the Canard Enchaine investigative weekly, the Council on Competition has uncovered 27 alleged cases of market and price rigging by some 50 companies, including Bouygues, Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux. The companies now have two months to respond to the allegations, before the Council prepares its final report, which could recommend sizeable fines.</p>

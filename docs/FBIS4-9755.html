			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has announced that  he has sent confirmations to a majority of the people invited to  the conference entitled The Nation and the Emigre Community,  which is to be held in Havana during the second half of April.  After adding that there will be no extremist parties at the  meeting with representatives of the Cuban community abroad,  Robaina stressed that the goal of the meeting is not to discuss  Cuba's political future but mainly to discuss emigration  policies to improve the emigres' ties with their homeland.  Robaina added that the meeting will probably devote many hours  to the emigration issues and Cuban democracy as well as  intellectual, artistic, and academic exchanges.    Robaina went on to say that Cuba's economic situation is  beginning to improve and that the worst is over. He added that  after bottoming out, Cuba's economy has begun a process of  recovery, and that, in comparison with those of 1993, this  year's results are different and somewhat encouraging.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sharip Asuyev] </F>   [Text] Groznyy April 17 TASS -- Chechnya praised the  Russian leadership for seeking a peaceful solution to the social  and political crisis in the North Caucasian republic. Chechen  President Dzhokhar Dudayev told TASS on Sunday that his analysts  were thoroughly studying the decree by Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, which instructs the Russian Government to hold  necessary consultations with the Chechen side. The republic's  government will gather in an extraordinary meeting tonight to  make an official return statement by the Chechen leadership.    The analysis of the current situation in Chechnya gives  shows  that the republican authorities are likely to search for a  mutually acceptable solution to the Chechen problem [sentence as  received]. Talks may stumble over demands that Chechnya  recognize itself a subject of the Russian Federation, as well as  over Russia's repeated appeals to forces in opposition to  President Dudayev.</p>

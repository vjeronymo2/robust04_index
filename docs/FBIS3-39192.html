			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mia Doornaert commentary: "Heavy NATO Artillery"] </F>   [Text] The unknown person who fired off the murderous shell  at Sarajevo on Saturday [5 February] has contributed to the  first credible stand now being taken against the aggressors in  Bosnia. The wave of outrage about the bloodbath put political  leaders under pressure. Foreign Minister Willy Claes also  appeared to have suddenly been won over in favor of air strikes.    But it is not so that it was just a wave of emotion which  brought NATO to a decision which means that the Alliance could  make its first armed intervention in the 44 years of its  existence.    The ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw in 10 days  from the area surrounding Sarajevo and the threat of immediate  air strikes if they again shell the Bosnian capital came under  Franco-U.S. leadership. It was realized in the framework of a  joint diplomatic approach which had been ripening for some time.    It is clear that the patience is running out of the  countries  which are making the main contribution to the UN peacekeeping  force in the former Yugoslavia, particularly France and the  United Kingdom. The perspective that new offensives were likely  in Bosnia after the winter also led to a more muscular approach  which is intended to put new force behind a political agreement.    The combative profile of the new UN commanders in Bosnia and  the NATO decision both indicate that from now on the aggressors  will be able to go about their business with less impunity.    The increased military pressure, which received the blessing  of UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, is intended to  bring a political solution closer. The United States and the  European partners are now on the same wavelength about the  solution.    The European countries do not want the pressure on the Serbs  to encourage the Muslims to try to win back with weapons what  they have not received at the negotiating table.    The United States, which up to now was very critical of the  proposed territorial division, is now ready to also put pressure  on the Muslims. "If you are not ready to deploy troops, then  you must not delude the Muslims that they have any interest in  continuing a war where our UN troops are involved," was roughly  the tenor of the French arguments which won over Washington.    Therefore now the Serbs are under pressure from the NATO  threat, while the Muslims have been warned that they cannot  continue to count on the presence of UN troops if they do not  give in.    The NATO decision, which fits in with efforts to reach a  quick political agreement, also involves many risks. If air  strikes should be carried out, and/or there are Serbian  reprisals against UN troops, then the political leaders must not  suddenly change course when faced with new emotional reactions  in their public opinion.    In addition, the opening up and protection of Sarajevo is  still a long way from achieving peace in Bosnia. It will  require concerted, determined diplomacy in the coming months to  achieve a workable agreement in Bosnia. If Russia starts to act  disruptively in the Security Council then it will be even more  difficult.    And afterwards a UN peacekeeping force will be necessary in  Bosnia for some time to monitor the implementation of the  agreement. So it is not to be hoped that even in that optimistic  scenario, the UN peacekeeping mission can wave farewell to  Bosnia once the hard winter months are past.    Then there is still the question of whether it is not high  time, in order to ensure that NATO and the UN's "heavy  artillery" have the best chances of success, to change the  international negotiators. Particularly Lord Owen, who has  already made so many zigzags. Now he has bitterly little credit  and authority, which does not aid the peace process.</p>

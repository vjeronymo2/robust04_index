			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / School finance practices are questioned THE 'GREEN shoots' of impropriety have appeared in locally managed schools in England and Wales, says a report published today by the Audit Commission. The report includes examples of questionable financial practice. Most schools have taken well to managing their own finances, it says, but problems were found with both grant-maintained schools and those still under local education authority control. Locally managed schools are those with budgets devolved from local education authorities and grant-maintained schools that have opted-out. All the schools surveyed had increased their levels of administrative staff. However, there were wide variations in the amount of time and money spent on administration. For example, one primary school with 183 pupils paid for 646 administrator's hours in one year, while another with 198 pupils paid for 2,886 hours. Examples of questionable practice included the husband of a member of a school's staff who was given repair work even though his quote was Pounds 2,500 above the lowest, and a head teacher who employed her daughter on 'much higher' than normal wages without telling the governors. In one case, a contract for repair work was given to a company owned by a friend of a governor even though there was a lower bid. Mr Bob Chilton, a director of the Audit Commission, pointed out that grant-maintained schools were 'almost unique' among public-sector bodies in being allowed to appoint their own external auditors. He said: 'There's a danger of fear and favour becoming involved.' The report also revealed a trend for pupil-teacher ratios to rise after schools took control of their own management. It attributed this to rising salary demands from staff, and added: 'In order to keep expenditure within means, schools have not increased teacher numbers commensurately with an increase in pupil numbers.' The commission visited 100 schools which had had devolved budgets for at least two years. Adding up the Sums: Schools' Management of their Finances. HMSO. Pounds 8.00.</p>

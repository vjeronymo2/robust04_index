			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / US, Israel edge towards pact: Bush-Rabin meeting raises hopes of progress in Mideast talks A distinct improvement in relations between the US and Israel will be marked today when President George Bush and prime minister Yitzhak Rabin hold the first of two meetings. Although preparations for the talks, at Mr Bush's holiday home in Kennebunkport, Maine, have been overshadowed by the crisis in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the two leaders are expected to reach broad agreement on the provision of US loan guarantees and on the next stage of Middle East peace talks, scheduled to resume in Washington in two weeks. Prospects for progress at the talks received a boost yesterday when Israel proposed legalising contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, firmly viewed as a terrorist organisation by the government of former premier Yitzhak Shamir. Mr Bush and Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, made no secret of their wish for Mr Rabin to lead the Labour party to victory in June's elections. Under Mr Shamir, relations between Israel and the US had fallen to their lowest level since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and siege of Beirut in 1982. Mr Shamir's refusal to contemplate relinquishing control over the Arab territories occupied by Israel in 1967 in defiance of UN resolutions came to be seen in the US as the main obstacle on the path towards a Middle East peace agreement. The US response to Mr Shamir's commitment to retain the territories was to refuse the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in loan guarantees Israel needed to house Soviet immigrants, unless Israel first stopped building new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. The refusal represented the most serious setback suffered by Israel in Washington for many years and Mr Rabin has moved quickly to ban most new settlement building in the occupied territories. The loan guarantees, however, are unlikely to be provided without some further debate. Suggestions have been made that the US would like some offset arrangement included which would allow American companies to take part in the building programme. Mr Rabin is also expected to outline to Mr Bush the proposals that Israeli negotiators will put on the table when peace talks resume in Washington. He is looking for agreement by early next year on some form of interim Palestinian self-governing authority which would administer the territories prior to an eventual conference to decide their final status. With Mr Rabin keen to demonstrate early achievements in the face of hostility from the right-wing and settlers' organisations at home and Mr Bush trailing far behind Governor Bill Clinton in the US presidential election race, both men have powerful reasons for wanting the talks to succeed. A successful resumption of Middle East peace negotiations might also allow Mr Bush to deflect some of the political damage done to his Gulf war triumph by the fresh challenges to UN ceasefire agreements being made by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Travel: Loch Lomond through the mist of time IN DENSE fog I stepped ashore at Greenock, caught a train to Glasgow and a bus to Drymen, hitched a lift to Balmaha with an army despatch-rider, and walked up the lochside road. It was my first time in Scotland and so far I had had hardly a glimpse of it. Six of us sat down to supper in the white-painted inn beside the ferry slip. Four were beautiful young girls from Glasgow. Their delicate white skins were as new to me as their extrovert innocence. I had never encountered such wide-eyed morale-building attention, such a genuine interest in the life of a sailor. The other guest was a portly, overbearing individual, also from Glasgow - a 'bailie', as he kept telling us. Throughout the meal he quizzed the English novice on words like tattiebogle and whigmaleerie. I might have done better if I had made head or tail of his impenetrable accent. I decided that if all the men were like him I was not going to enjoy Scotland very much. One the other hand, if all the women were like these . . . After supper he disappeared into the bar. The rest of us sat round an upright piano. One girl, an amazing redhead, sang the songs of Burns and Allan Ramsay. I was taught the words of Mary Morison, Auld Robin Gray and the Lass o' Ballochmyle. Across the years I still hear those sweet voices. In bed I listened to the lap of the loch against the shore and the scrape of a boat on the shingle. They seemed to convey a vague idea of Scotland's rough magic. Next morning the girls and I took sandwiches and tackled the ascent of Ben Lomond. Mist blotted out the hills, the loch and even the path to the top. I took a short cut, floundered up a gully through a mat of saturated heather and felt the wind in my face. It was the summit. After a while I heard the girls approaching, singing. The breeze dissolved the mist. As we ate our sandwiches, curtains of fog drew back. Like a stage set, Loch Lomond and its backdrop of mountains were revealed. Everything became clear, including the chaos of glens and crags to the south-west. We could not see the shipping at the Tail o' the Bank, but we could make out the configuration of the Clyde. Had I heard of Para Handy the puffer skipper, I was asked. I had not even heard of a puffer. A small Clyde coasting vessel, the girls told me. Para Handy (Highland jargon for Peter Andrew) was Neil Munro's comic fictional character. Neil Who? It seemed I had a lot to learn about Scotland. At least I could trade quotations from The Lady of the Lake and debate the wanderings of Bonnie Prince Charlie through the western Highlands. Our viewpoint covered most of the territory up to Lochaber and Morven. Sunshine flooded the loch. No boat ruffled the surface or disturbed the silence. Nothing moved on the lochside road. I had not at that time visited Japan, otherwise I would have seen Loch Lomond as a Zen garden, an oasis of serenity, carefully raked and dotted with coloured stones. This year I returned to Loch Lomond. The bonnie banks were in the news. Environmentalists were complaining that tourism was destroying their quiet splendour. A leading article in the newspaper I picked up in Glasgow called for the introduction of a tough management regime for the loch. Ben Lomond was overrun with climbers and its situation was described as fragile. Sure enough, many walkers pushed past me on the narrow path. I was taking the ascent quietly, for the mountain seemed to have increased its height. As for trying short cuts, the way I did before, who in his right mind would risk a fall of rock, a twisted ankle, pneumonia from wet heather and maybe a bite from an adder. We were young, that other time. The disagreeable possibilities simply did not occur to us. I stumbled on to the summit. Crisp packets drifted and lager cans rolled about in the same old breeze. I leaned against a litter bin until the dizzy spell has passed. The landscape, through my bleary eyes, had worn rather better than I. Far-off peaks and gorges still produced a sensation of something mystical, desirable, remote, a glamour no longer attainable. Here the day and gone yesterday, as Para Handy would have put it. Unlike me, the emerald isles of the loch had preserved their shapes. There was Bucinch, where Robert the Bruce planted yew trees in the hope of producing an archery corps d'elite like England's longbowmen. There was Ceardoch. Was that where the ruined nunnery stood, or was it the burial ground of the MacGregor chiefs? I had forgotten. The islets of the loch just sit there, anchored for eternity, while fast motorboats draw concentric circles around them. Speedboats and jet-skis jostle for elbow-room as they carve up Loch Lomond. My newspaper reported another fatality and six injured in a collision. The friends of Loch Lomond have mounted a campaign to have boat traffic rationed and regulated. A mountain biker told me that the path I walked down was due for widening, possibly surfacing with tarmac. The lochside road has congestion problems, too. It was bumper-to-bumper. At the old white-painted inn a good many people had come to watch football on TV. There was no sign of the upright piano. Customers were good-humoured and talkative in the manner of Glaswegians. I could see no one to remind me of the girls of long ago. I walked off my stiffness on the lochside road. People were picking blackberries, ordinary ones, not the luscious fruits of memory, big as golf balls. I did miss those girls. I suppose they are all great-grandmothers now.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (7): Snowball rolls on RANK XEROX has just announced that it has chosen Grenoble for its European research centre, to open in the second half of this year. 'It has all the elements we are looking for, with its university, research centres, computer industry and small dynamic companies,' says Mr Herve Gallaire, the group's European research director. Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French industry minister, greeted the move as an example of 'the snowball effect' which has been created by the presence of Grenoble's multitude of laboratories and research bodies. Rank Xerox plans to employ 150 researchers on an annual budget of Ecu15m by the time the centre is up to full steam, towards 1996. Grenoble won the Rank Xerox investment in competition against rival offers from Italy, Spain, and Germany - and southern France, from the Sophia Antipolis high tech business park near Nice. The French government and local authorities will cover about 10 per cent of the initial investment during the first two years, in line with aid available from the rival sites. However, the deciding factor was Grenoble's pool of skilled research workers - including the fact that it produces 20 per cent of all French PhD students in information technology. The centre will study automatic translation and assisted translation of computer documents. The aim is to design products to reduce the 8 per cent of total spending that the average company spends on creating and handling documents, says Mr Gallaire. The group also hopes to pass development contracts to some high technology companies grouped around Grenoble.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A 'SHOCKED' GOLDING SAYS HER HUSBAND IS INNOCENT  </P> <P> San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, in her first public comments on her  husband's arrest in connection with an alleged money-laundering scheme, said  Sunday that she found the news of the charges so unbelievable that she  initially assumed it was a joke.  </P> <P> "It took quite a few minutes to realize that they weren't kidding," Golding  said, recounting how she learned of the charges by telephone while in New  Jersey following the death of her mother. "It was totally and completely  shocking, and still is. . . . This is something that you read in a novel, not  something that happens in real life."  </P> <P> Golding, in comments at a brief La Jolla news conference and subsequent  interview, declared what she characterized as her unequivocal belief in the  innocence of her husband, Richard T. Silberman, the millionaire businessman and  longtime Democratic Party power broker who was arrested Friday.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt in my mind that when all the facts come out in a court of  law, my husband will be exonerated," Golding said. "He is innocent. . . . My  husband is an honest, loving and caring man, and he's been that way all his  life, and that doesn't change in a few months."  </P> <P> At the press conference, Golding seemed controlled and in command, said Dan  McAllister, a longtime political associate who helped organize the event. Her  voice cracked at times during a subsequent telephone interview.  </P> <P> While declining to discuss the specific charges against her husband, Golding,  one of San Diego's rising political stars, expressed her belief that much of  the allegations released to date have been designed to cast Silberman in the  worst possible light.  </P> <P> "It's very clear that only a portion of a certain number of facts are being  told," she said, "and they are being told by someone who would like to  prosecute someone."  </P> <P> Silberman, 59, a co-founder of the Jack in the Box fast-food chain and a major  figure in state and area politics for more than a decade, was freed after  posting bail Saturday evening, following one night in the federal Metropolitan  Correctional Center in downtown San Diego. He was arrested Friday at a San  Diego hotel while allegedly negotiating to assist in the concealing, or  laundering, of some $1.1 million in purported drug proceeds, according to the  FBI. The person making the alleged arrangement with Silberman turned out to be  an undercover FBI agent who had earlier arranged some $300,000 in  money-laundering operations with Silberman, the agency said.  </P> <P> Silberman is to be arraigned in U. S. District Court today.  </P> <P> Also arrested was Chris Poulos, 62, of San Diego, commonly known as Chris  Petti, who authorities say has been linked to the Chicago-area La Cosa Nostra,  the organized-crime organization. The crime group's activities in Southern  California and Nevada triggered the investigation, which has been going on for  2 1/2 years, the FBI said.  </P> <P> In announcing Silberman's arrest, federal authorities said Golding apparently  had no knowledge of the money scheme. She said Sunday that she had no inkling  of the investigation of her husband until she learned of his arrest Friday.  Authorities have said the money schemes involving Silberman date back some five  months.  </P> <P> Silberman has been home since Saturday evening, said Golding, who added that  she and her husband have been discussing the case intensely, along with various  lawyers. She refrained on commenting to the media until now, she said, so she  might be better versed in the facts of the case. No decision had been made on a  lawyer to represent Silberman, Golding said, although she added that the family  had spoken with a number of prominent area counsels, including Milton Silverman  and Louis Katz.  </P> <P> There has been much speculation about what impact the charges could have on  Golding's career. The 43-year-old chairwoman of the County Board of Supervisors  and a leading area Republican is considered one of San Diego's pre-eminent  politicians, and she is known to have ambitions for statewide office. Whatever  the outcome of the criminal case, political observers say her husband's  involvement in the case will likely tarnish her star. On Sunday, however,  Golding declined to discuss the issue.  </P> <P> "What about my political future?" Golding herself asked. "The only person whose  future I've thought about is my husband's. . . . The best thing I can do for my  husband now is stand by him and support him, which I intend to do."  </P> <P> The support from others has been widespread, said Golding, who described her  husband's spirits as shaken -- "He's in shock" -- but added that the couple is  determined to fight the allegations. "I was most afraid that people would  desert him, people he's known for years, but that hasn't happened," Golding  said. "We've literally gotten call after call from people who worked with him,  from friends, all offering support."  </P> <P> As for her job, Golding said it might be necessary for her to cut down perhaps  20 hours a week in her work schedule, which she said usually entails 80 to 90  hours of work each week. She canceled a trip to Washington this week to spend  more time with her husband, she said. But Golding said she has no intention of  stepping down from elected office. She vowed she will continue to give as much  as she can to her job.  </P> <P> "I'll say this: My husband comes first, and my family comes first," she said.  </P> <P> Golding and Silberman were married in July, 1984, in the midst of her campaign  for county supervisor. The two had previously had a well-known relationship,  despite their affiliations with different political parties.  </P> <P> Silberman has three grown children from a former marriage. Golding's two  children, also from a former marriage, live with the couple in San Diego.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with outgoing Interior Minister Ed van Thijn by </F> Jan Hoedeman; place and date not given: "Ed van Thijn Predicts  Heavy Weather"]    [Text] Ed Van Thijn, the outgoing PvdA [Labor Party]  interior minister, is the ultimate specialist on how to form a  governmen. He is the author of Dagboek van een  onderhandelaar [Diary of a Negotiator] in which he  describes how the Social Democrats won the 1977 elections but  lost when it came to forming the government. In the informal  hierarchy of the PvdA, Van Thijn (59) is the number two after  Wim Kok.    [Hoedeman] Have you started a new diary?    [van Thijn] Since I have been back in The Hague I have  started scribbling again. If this formation does not work out  for the PvdA, I will have the time for a new book. But if it  works out well, I will not have the time and I hope to be  interior minister again.    [Hoedeman] What do you think the voter was trying to say  with  this dramatic result?    [van Thijn] The government has taken a beating because it  meddled with the social security system without a basis of  support. The three principal winners are the VVD [People's Party  for Freedom and Democracy], the D66 [Democrats 66] and the  elderly people's parties. It makes me think back to the 1960's.  The parents of those days have now rebelled.    [Hoedeman] In the seventies you predicted the end of  Christian Democracy. Were you right?    [van Thijn] No. Not if it takes 20 years to be proved right.  Van Agt achieved a somewhat better result, and Lubbers achieved  two good results after that. Perhaps in four years time we will  be fully satisfied if the CDA [Christian Democrat Party] again  becomes the biggest party. The fact that the CDA scored as well  as it did is thanks above all to Lubbers who plunged into the  campaign at the last moment. The CDA has in any event become a  party just like any other, a party which has to win its seats  through sound arguments.    [Hoedeman] In 1977, the PvdA won the elections but lost when  it came to negotiating a government. The Pvda has now suffered  an electoral defeat, how is it now going to score a success in  forming a government?    [van Thijn] We must not be so arrogant as then. And with  this defeat, there is certainly no reason to be. And there is  no danger of that with Kok, who is anything but a tyrant. The  PvdA and the D66 must stick together. No government is possible  without the D66.    [Hoedeman] Wim Kok has lost the seventh election in a row.  In the past, you discussed the matter of resignation with  Vondeling and Den Uyl. Have you discussed the defeat with Kok?    [van Thijn] Not yet. But I know many socialists who reached  great heights after a series of defeats. Willy Brandt suffered  several. Mitterrand was defeated 10 times. There is no  question of raising the matter of a leadership change with Wim  Kok.    [Hoedeman] The voter has had enough of present government  policy. Is it really in the interests of political credibility  for the PvdA and the CDA to continue in government?    [van Thijn] It would be very strange if the present  coalition  emerged as winners from the formation process. It is likely  that one of the two will leave government.    [Hoedeman] The CDA itself stated in its electoral campaign  that there would be a "purple" coalition if the CDA vote was not  high enough.    [van Thijn] Conducting an electoral campaign in this way  brings a "purple" coalition of the PvdA, the VVD and the D66  closer than ever. The CDA created an atmosphere in a way which  left you totally cold. They have monopolized values and  standards.    [Hoedeman] Will Wim Kok have to form the government and at  the same time be prime minister?    [van Thijn] I expect first somebody charged with  investigating whether a proposed government will succeed to  consider all possibilities. There are three reasons why Kok  must be prime minister. It is usual for the leader of the  biggest party to be prime minister. The voters have expressed  their confidence in Kok as prime minister. Also, Kok has more  experience than any of the other four party leaders. Kok is the  strongest candidate for the prime ministership.    [Hoedeman] How long before we have a new government?    [van Thijn] Not long. It is not going to be settled  overnight, but it will not last longer than two months. Today's  political leaders operate on a business-like basis, they are  people who like to get things done.    [Hoedeman] Is there any place for Brinkman in a center-left  government of the PvdA, the CDA and the D66?    [van Thijn] Brinkman's participation in a progressive  majority government is not evident.    [Hoedeman] What coalition would you prefer to see?    [van Thijn] A coalition which is able to bring a large  measure of political renewal to the government pact. Perhaps  the D66 can exert pressure on the VVD in this respect. I would  only find a coalition of the PvdA, the D66 and the VVD  acceptable if it was able to reform the political system.    [Hoedeman] This result is certainly not a maximizing of the  PvdA vote. What needs to be done?    [van Thijn] I believe we are on the right path. The polls  gave us 22 seats, and we won 37. We are learning. We have made  major changes in the party. Kok conducted an excellent campaign.    [Hoedeman] What name should be given to the new government?    [van Thijn] It must be the government of social decency. We  have some heavy weather before us. Whatever coalition we have,  some hard measures will have to taken. But there must be a  basis of support for these measures. Kok has come out into the  open, but he must not withdraw if he becomes prime minister.  Kok must remain communicative. It has been demonstrated that  you cannot announce stringent measures at a press conference.  If we govern with the D66, we must adopt something of the new  style of government. People have rights, they must not always  be frightened out of their wits, we must engage them in  discussion. We must be very careful in how we approach the  social structure, but we cannot shrink back from the task.</p>

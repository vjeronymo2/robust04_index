			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL 'MARSHALL PLAN' PROPOSED TO COMBAT POLLUTION  </P> <P> An international group of legislators called for immediate action to curb  "greenhouse" pollutants Wednesday and recommended enacting a "global Marshall  plan" to help emerging countries cope with environmental problems.  </P> <P> At the end of a three-day conference on the environment, the delegates from 42  countries urged that nations commit themselves without delay to reducing  pollutants that they said could cause climatic temperatures to rise 50% in the  next 20 years.  </P> <P> The Interparliamentary Conference on the Global Environment could offer little  more than suggestions for an environmental game plan. Its recommendations are  not binding on any country, but many delegates to the conference, sponsored by  the U.S. Congress, said they would push for legislative action at home.  </P> <P> The aggressive strategies on global warming suggested were not in line with the  approach favored by President Bush and senior White House officials. Bush two  weeks ago told an international environmental conference at the White House  that further research must come before any commitment to specific  anti-pollution measures.  </P> <P> The more than 200 lawmakers at the conference agreed to a broad range of  actions aimed at protecting the atmospheric ozone layer, reversing the loss of  forests and committing greater resources to population control.  </P> <P> The proposed "global Marshall plan for sustainable development and the  environment" would be patterned after the U.S. economic assistance effort that  helped Europe recover from World War II, conference officials said.  </P></p>

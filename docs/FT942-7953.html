			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pru issues sales staff statement Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, has said that Lautro, the life industry's self-regulatory body, had found training and competence of its 9,000 sales staff 'generally satisfactory'. The company said that it was still considering a detailed report based on a Lautro audit, but that any recommendations for change were 'minor'. Prudential cited from a letter from the regulator to Mr Mick Newmarch, the chief executive, that Lautro's findings would not have 'any serious effect' on its sales operation. The company went to the unusual length of issuing a statement to the Stock Exchange on Friday after its share price fell on rumours that its sales staff had been suspended, following a suspension by Norwich Union staff in March.</p>

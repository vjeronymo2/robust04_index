			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Observer: Home at last Another gamekeeper savours the delights of poaching. Word is that the ubiquitous John Wriglesworth, the media-friendly housing analyst at UBS, is set to join one of Britain's largest building societies, the Bradford &amp; Bingley, to hunt for suitable mergers and plan its strategy. Though Wriglesworth's knowledge of the sector is encyclopaedic, he may have to fine-tune some of his more forthright views. After all, the B &amp; B is the largest society to act as an independent financial adviser and only last year Wriglesworth was dismissing IFA status as an inferior option for a society. Much better to be a sexy 'bancassurer' and devise your own financial services products, or link with a single life insurance company, opined Wriglesworth. The Yorkshire building society is proud of its independent status, and young Wriglesworth may have to swallow his words if he wants a seat on the board. He won't be the first ex-stockbroking analyst to do so.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT OF LAKER TRADE FOR CENTER DENIED BY WEST  </P> <P> Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager, denied a report that the club is  considering trading forward Orlando Woolridge, or other players or draft picks,  to the Indiana Pacers for center Herb Williams.  </P> <P> "That's ridiculous," West said Wednesday. "I haven't even talked with (Indiana  officials) about that. Donnie Walsh, Indiana's general manager, and George  Irvine, another Pacer executive, have followed the Lakers the last 2 games.  They had attempted to hire Laker assistant coach Randy Pfund as new Pacer coach  Dick Versace's top assistant. Pfund turned down the offer.  </P> <P> Williams, 30, averaging 12.6 points and 8.7 rebounds a game going into  Wednesday night's Pacer game at Boston, is earning $983,000 this season, part  of a long-term contract. Woolridge reportedly is making $500,000, meaning that  the Lakers would face salary-cap problems if they went after Williams. SAM  McMANIS  </P></p>

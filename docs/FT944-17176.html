			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Arts (Openings): New York An exhibition of jewel-like Indian miniature paintings opens at the Brooklyn Museum on Friday. Entitled 'Realms of Heroism', the show illustrates the heroic ideal in a South Asian context - as warrior, adventurer, Hindu deity, secular ruler and lover. A wide variety of historical portraits, from the 15th to the 19th century, reveals the sometimes subtle means by which Indian rulers asserted their power and achievement.</p>

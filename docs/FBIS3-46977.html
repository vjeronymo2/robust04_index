It is clearly a reversal of  Japan's previous stance towards the idea and this is certainly  welcome news for the six- member ASEAN.    Japan's change of mind apparently comes as a result of the  establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement or  NAFTA which came into effect last weekend. Previously Japan had  been non-committal towards the caucus idea for fear of hurting  its largest trading partner, the United States. The U.S., under  George Bush, had been vehemently opposed to the establishment of  the EAEC because it knew that it would left out of the EAEC.    However, the present U.S. Administration under President  Bill  Clinton had been more receptive to the EAEC concept. So, Japan  naturally has come to terms with the caucus as a means of  achieving a diplomatic balance in the Pacific Rim region in the  way from the expansion of economic ties between the U.S., Canada  and Mexico.    The historic summit of the heads of state of the Asia  Pacific  Economic Cooperation in Seattle last November clearly showed  that the U.S. was pushing for leadership of the 17-member body.  Now, we have the European Economic Union or EEU and NAFTA  looming large to become exclusive trading blocs. How then will  East Asia fend for itself? The EAEC seems to be the right  answer. The idea of the caucus, mooted by Malaysian Prime  Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed three years ago, came about after  the Uruguay Round of GATT talks had failed to produce the result  as was scheduled in 1990. Japan had previously thought that the  EAEC idea would jeorpadize the global trade talks. Now that the  Uruguay Round has been successfully completed, Japan is in a  position to reverse to its previous stance towards the EAEC.    The EAEC, as have been repeatedly pointed out by ASEAN  leaders, is certainly not aimed at being an exclusive trading  bloc. It is aimed at being a loose consultative forum where  member countries can discuss economic issues of common concern  and cooperate with each other for their mutual benefit. ASEAN  countries have already commited themselves to an (?indifferent)  free global trading system. Any of its member countries is free  into bilateral trade with any other country of its choice.    Malaysia and ASEAN welcome the Tokyo report that Japan has  declared its support for the EAEC concept. The caucus will  become even more meaningful and fruitful if more East Asian  countries like China, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong declare  their support and join the EAEC to make the region the most  dynamic in the world.</p>

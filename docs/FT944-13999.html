			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: DSC Communications buys NKT Elektronik DSC Communications Corporation, a fast-growing Dallas-based telecommunications equipment supplier, has agreed to acquire NKT Elektronik, a Danish manufacturer of fibre-optic transmission equipment. The consideration is Dollars 145m to be paid in cash. The deal, signed last week, is subject to due diligence on the part of DSC. Mr James Donald, DSC chairman, said the purchase was evidence of DSC's commitment to being a leader in the world-wide telecommunications market. 'The acquired technology, products and employee knowledge will be complementary to DSC's existing market position in areas of switching, access systems and transmission systems,' he said. NKTE's technological expertise is respected in the telecommunications industry. It is a leader in a form of optical transmission called synchronous digital hierarchy, which offers high gross profit margins. Publicly quoted DSC is a 20-year-old company which specialises in high-growth, high added-value areas of the telecommunications systems market. It turned over about Dollars 750m last year and is expected to have sales of just under Dollars 1bn this year. Last year it made profits before tax of Dollars 109m. It has 4,500 employees in the US and currently about 250 in Europe. The NKTE acquisition will bring DSC's European workforce up to just under 1,000. It sells to all the leading telecommunications carriers. It is working, for example, with British Telecommunication on a wireless system to replace traditional copper wires in rural areas. NKTE is a subsidiary of NKT, a manufacturer of electro-technical equipment and industrial vacuum cleaners which is quoted on the Copenhagen stock exchange. NKT Elektronik last year had sales of DKr700m (Dollars 119m) and made pre-tax profits of DKr37m. DCS said yesterday that NKTE would become the centre for the company's European optical transmission business and a bridgehead for the company's expansion in other European markets. Following the disposal of NKTE, NKT's main activities will be in cables and the Nilfisk industrial vacuum cleaning company, which earlier this year concluded a DKr650m deal to buy one of its main US competitors, Advanced Machine Company of Minnesota.</p>

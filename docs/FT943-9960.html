			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BAe to cut executives' contracts to two years British Aerospace is set to cut the length of its executive directors' service contracts from three to two years following talks with fund management institutions. The move follows mounting frustration among institutional shareholders over large pay-outs to directors who have been forced to resign. Mr John Cahill, BAe's former chairman, received a Pounds 3.1m pay-off when he resigned earlier this year. BAe said the payment was 'for all compensation due to him under his service contract.' In June, PosTel, the Pounds 25bn investment management group, announced it would be voting against the election and re-election of directors with rolling employment contracts of longer than two years. Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, PosTel's chief executive, wants to end pay-outs of up to three times basic salary to directors on three-year rolling contracts. BAe mentioned Postel as 'not the only people we have been talking to,' and added: 'it's a topic which has been coming up in meetings with large investors.' Two recently appointed BAe directors - Mr John Weston and Mr Mike Turner - have two-year rolling contracts and the company's compensation committee is expected to decide upon a one-year reduction in the length of the other executive directors' contracts. In particular, the committee is likely to change the contracts of Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, and Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director. Several other companies have also recently cut the length of their directors' contracts. At National Westminster Bank the three-year rolling contracts of six executive directors will end in two years' time, to be replaced by one-year rolling contracts. And at last month's annual meeting of Argyll Group, the UK's third largest food retailer, the group announced that it was also cutting the length of its directors' service contracts from three to two years.</p>

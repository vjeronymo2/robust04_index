			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raima Rondon from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez disagrees with  the tax exemption for house rentals, slated to go up to 5  million bolivares [Bs], as specified by the Special Powers Act.    The executive branch has requested that tax exemptions be  established on the basis of Bs750,000. However, the Special  Powers Act cites exemptions for school, medical, and dental  expenses, as well as for mortgage interest on principal  residences, also to the tune of Bs5 million.    Both Congress and the finance minister agree with the latter  exemptions.    [Begin Sosa recording] They have established tax exemptions  of up to 5,000 tax units, which means Bs5 million on interest  for principal residences. I agree with this. They have also  established a tax exemption for house rentals that I believe is  exaggerated as it amounts to Bs5 million. This will eventually  have to be included in a law. But we will have to obey the terms  of the Special Powers Act. I do believe that Congress could  modify this in the future, preferably before the year ends,  because a Bs5 million per annum tax exemption for house rentals  seems exaggerated to me. [end recording]    Minister Sosa added that he was at Miraflores to attend a  meeting of the economic cabinet with President Rafael Caldera  that would establish a schedule for implementing the Special  Powers Act.</p>

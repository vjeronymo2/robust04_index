			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New talks on the future of Northern Ireland would go  ahead, with or without Sinn Fein, Irish Premier Albert Reynolds  said today.    Speaking after Saturday's [19 February] 90-minute meeting in  London with Mr. Major, the Taoiseach [prime minister] warned the  IRA and Sinn Fein they would not have a better opportunity to  enter the political process. He denied setting a deadline of  March 17 for a Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street peace  declaration. Both he and Mr. Major had made it clear the door  to peace would not be closed, said Mr. Reynolds.    "We are not closing the door to peace, we are not going to  lock that door and throw away the key." But he added: "I do not  think the overwhelming support of the Irish people can be  ignored. This is a new opportunity, there is never going to be  a better offer on the table and I cannot see what justification  there would be for the continuation of violence or the taking of  one more innocent life."    During their meeting at Downing Street on Saturday both  leaders agreed to resume the three-strand Northern Ireland talks  process.    Mr. Reynolds told Irish radio the talks would be based on  the  principles enshrined in the declaration. "The new starting  point will be the peace declaration. That has not been clear up  to now, we finally agreed it on Saturday. We also agreed that  it is a three-stranded process and not an internal settlement as  some people were suggesting."    Mr. Reynolds said it was helpful that Mr. Major had  reaffirmed his commitment to the declaration. "It was important  that the British prime minister said it because I think there  were people who were suspecting that maybe the British  Government in some way or another were not behind the  declaration."    Mr. Reynolds quashed hopes that the Sinn Fein annual  conference next weekend would deliver a response to the Downing  St. declaration, saying: "I never expected that forum to be the  forum at which the response would be put together." But he  hoped sufficient people would recognise that the road to peace  was "a better road to choose to pursue their political  objectives rather than the road to violence which in the last 25  years has been carried on by paramilitaries on both sides.  There will be no military victories."    Mr. Reynolds said: "We want people to sit back, study  exactly  where they have come from, where they are at and which road has  the best chance of advancing the cause of nationalism. We  believe the peace process is the only road."    Earlier, Mr. Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's The World This  Weekend that progress was likely within a month.    "Saturday's meeting cleared the air and we have now agreed  on  the basis for the new talks, which is that the peace declaration  will form the basis for the resumption of talks. That will be  the new starting point," he said.    And Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew told the  same programme that no party, including the Rev. Ian Paisley's  hardline Democratic Unionists, could be allowed to veto progress  of the peace talks.    Meanwhile, Irish Deputy Premier Dick Spring called on the  IRA  and Sinn Fein to show "leadership and courage" and accept the  Downing Street peace declaration.    But speaking on BBC1's Breakfast With Frost programme he  conceded that the IRA and Sinn Fein might never respond to the  peace initiative.    John Hume, the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party] leader,  said he did not agree with the view that the Declaration was  unacceptable to Sinn Fein.    He told the London Weekend Television Walden programme: "My  reading is that they are still giving it detailed study, which  is what I expected, given the nature of that organisation.    "Their immediate reaction is suspicion and that is what I  expect. But they have not rejected the Declaration. They have  asked for clarification."    Mr. Hume said that peace in Ireland was above party  politics. "I am putting it above party politics myself in the  dialogue that I have been engaged in, so I would feel that what  the British Government should do now is to directly clarify to  them whatever they want clarified."</p>

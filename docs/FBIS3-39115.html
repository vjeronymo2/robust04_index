All of our efforts in the field of  foreign policy are directed toward living up to this  responsibility. We Germans have an unfortunate tendency to  worry about ourselves first and foremost. But be sure that we  are reminding ourselves the whole time that we now have this  special responsibility."    This is how German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel explains  the  difference between the new Germany's past and present, between  self-repression and newly found self-confidence, using a formula  that typically enough also aims at reassuring its neighbors,  which include Denmark.    In everything that he does Klaus Kinkel must the whole time  bring in this element of reassurance.    Its neighbors look critically and closely at the enlarged  Germany at the heart of Europe with its 80 million inhabitants  and enormous economic power.    In a meeting with a group of foreign correspondents,  including BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's, in Bonn yesterday Kinkel took a  grand tour through a number of today's major foreign policy  questions.    The thread running through his remarks is that Germany is  not  what it was, but that at the same time there will always be  limits to what it can become. No one should think that Germany  wants to play the role of a world power.    "Today we are able to take on a responsibility which we  could  not only a few years ago. We are contributing to the UN  peacekeeping forces in several countries. But there are still  remnants of the conditions which used to prevail. Our  constitution forbids us to take part in NATO's out-of-area  actions and there will always be historically determined  restrictions. For example, German troops will never be able to  take part in either peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions in  the former Yugoslavia.    "Germany will never become a world power. This is also true  in the financial field. Many people take the view that Germany  should give extra economic support to the world's crisis  regions. Let me remind you that Germany is the third largest  contributor to the United Nations. Germany meets 26.5 percent  of the EU's [European Union] budget. We have signed up for 60  percent of the aid to the former Soviet republics. There is a  limit and we have reached it. We cannot be the whole world's  banker," Kinkel said.    He puts the integration into Europe of the states of Eastern  and central Europe high on his agenda.    "You are hardly likely to find a West European foreign  minister who pleads these countries' case so unambiguously. I  can understand that they think that things are moving too slowly  in relation to NATO and the EU; that they are not satisfied. On  the other hand new walls must not be built in Europe. We must  also take the former Soviet republics into consideration. This  is a peculiar balancing act for Germany. We are being subjected  to particularly great pressure, because people think that we  have a particular duty. I would say to all parties: Things  cannot move more quickly than they are doing at present."    Kinkel said that he is following developments in Moscow with  a certain amount of concern. In particular Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, who by turns has threatened Germany with nuclear  war and promised the return of East Prussia, is giving cause for  concern.    "He has made a series of fairly unusual statements. We  think that the reformist forces in Moscow should take him on  politically themselves. This is an internal Russian problem. I  as foreign minister am responsible for the fact that Mr  Zhirinovskiy cannot get an entry visa for Germany. And I stand  by this decision."    Germany's view of the war in the former Yugoslavia was given  great prominence. The Bonn government's traditionally good  relations with Croatia are often criticized; even by NATO  partners such as France and Britain. However, Kinkel made it  clear that Germany's policy toward the Balkans is being  reformulated:    "It is correct that we saw Serbia as the driving force  behind  the incomprehensible tragedy that is taking place. But little  by little it has become more difficult to differentiate."    Kinkel is unwilling as yet to comment on reports that  Croatian government forces are taking part in the fighting in  Bosnia.    He was unwilling to say whether, if this is true, Germany  will be involved in introducing economic sanctions against  Croatia.    He was also reluctant to call for bomb attacks on Serbian  positions or UN intervention:    "We Germans cannot allow ourselves to hand out too many  pieces of good advice. We cannot after all take part in such  actions. My basic view is that without a desire for peace on  the part of the parties involved it is impossible for others to  create a lasting peace."    Kinkel stressed European policy as the nucleus of Germany's  overall foreign policy. He could not even bring himself to  comment on the suggestion that the signals have been somewhat  confused recently as a result of Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund  Stoiber's tough attacks on Brussels. Germany's place is in  Europe and the Union. We will never see Germany going it alone  again, he said.    "Germany takes over the EU presidency in the latter half of  the year. At the moment the most crucial thing is to get the  four applicant countries (Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria)  into the Union. I am optimistic. There are special problems in  the case of all four. But just think how nervous people were  prior to the referendums in France and Denmark. But things  turned out well! On 1 January 1995 these four countries will be  members of the EU. I am sure of it. For none of them can allow  itself to remain outside. And we on our side have a clear  interest in their joining. But we must also be allowed to say  that the four countries themselves must have a desire to join."    Kinkel made the following comment on the particularly  Danish,  slightly foot-dragging behavior in EU cooperation:    "It was clear to me the whole time that Denmark really could  not allow itself to remain outside Union cooperation.  Particularly not when it became apparent that the other  Scandinavian countries were standing in line to join."    According to his own diagnosis, Kinkel is a clear friend of  the Nordic area.    "I feel very at home in the Nordic countries. In this  respect I as a southern German am fairly northern European. I  often take vacations there. The fact that I attach so much  importance to this region's joining the EU is due to  considerations of internal balance in the EU. The Union will  benefit from being properly balanced because of the Nordic  countries' membership."    Kinkel rejected categorically the suggestion that German  reunification could drive a wedge between Germany and the United  States, because Germany's interests can be said to have shifted  to the east.    "German-U.S. relations are so good that they will be able to  withstand all disturbances. Personally I still remember how,  immediately after the last war, American trucks rolled into the  school yard and distributed food. That's how I got my first  football. We will never forget the Berlin airlift (in 1948 --  editorial note) or the unreserved U.S. support for reunification.    "The United States is the world's only remaining superpower.  It is true that after the Cold War both the United States and  Europe are seeking their roles more in domestic policy. But  this does not mean that we are disconnecting ourselves from each  other. There will also be increased economic competition --  think of GATT, for example. But this will not put a political  burden on transatlantic ties. The United States and Europe, the  United States and Germany belong together."</p>

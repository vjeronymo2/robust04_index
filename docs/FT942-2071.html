			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Aer Lingus flies into fresh turbulence Aer Lingus, Ireland's state airline, is again running into turbulence as 2,000 staff at Team, its aircraft maintenance subsidiary, yesterday rejected new proposals on pay and working practices. Also 750 cabin crew are threatening industrial action over new rostering arrangements. The disputes come exactly six months after the European Commission approved a IPounds 175m (Pounds 172m) equity injection by the Irish government into the airline, to finance a restructuring package to return it to commercial viability. Some IPounds 56m has been used on redundancies, while the remainder is being used to cut debt. After a year of tense negotiations and repeated threats of strike action, last November the airline's 5,500 workforce finally agreed to 800 redundancies and significant changes in work practices, the overall effect of which has been to strip some IPounds 50m out of annual operating costs. However, trade union representatives for the cabin crews and the aircraft maintenance staff say that the Aer Lingus management is now seeking further pay cuts and new rostering arrangements which break last November's agreement. A transatlantic Boeing 747 flight was cancelled at the weekend following a crew dispute, causing disruption for some 900 passengers who had to be accommodated in hotels in Boston, Dublin and Shannon. The cabin crews have voted by nine-to-one in favour of industrial action, which will begin in two weeks' time unless agreement can be reached in the interim, and will affect all Aer Lingus flights. Mr Paul O'Sullivan, the union negotiator for the cabin crew said: 'The strength of feeling can be gauged from the fact that cabin crews have never in the past voted in favour of going it alone on industrial action.' Management at Team have warned that unless the workforce accepts proposals now before it, 850 compulsory redundancies will have to be made beginning this week. Such a move would trigger strike action by the union. It is thought this would rapidly spread throughout the Aer Lingus group. Analysts believe that Team's financial problems will be compounded by the airline's decision to replace its ageing Boeing 747s with European Airbus A330s, the first of which recently entered service. Team is tooled up to work on Boeing aircraft only.</p>

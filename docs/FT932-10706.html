			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Sunday trading OPPONENTS of unrestricted Sunday shop opening will doubtless seek vindication in the forecast this week by a study for the Home Office that such a move would create 19,000 job losses. But their claim does not withstand serious scrutiny. Like much of the special pleading and posturing which has so far dominated debate on Sunday trading, it can only frustrate the search for a tidy solution. Much of the running has been made by trades unions, church groups and larger retailers unwilling to open on Sundays. Many want legislation to tighten existing curbs. Justifying this position on religious grounds cannot conceal its objectionably coercive nature. The minority of regular church goers is vastly outnumbered by those saying they want freedom to shop on Sundays. In any case, if any day is to be declared 'special', for Britain's Moslem and Jewish communities it would certainly not be Sunday. The more substantive issues concern social welfare, economics and the consumer interest. Advocates of continued restrictions advance three main arguments. First, that shopworkers must be protected from a requirement to work on Sundays. There may be a case for preventing employers from arbitrarily changing the contracts of existing full-time staff. But there is no reason why shopworkers should be exempted en bloc from a seven-day work week when the practice is common in other sectors, including public transport and the media. The argument that widespread Sunday trading would reduce competition by forcing small local shops out of business is equally misconceived. Not only would deregulation enhance consumer choice and convenience by permitting more retailers to operate; but the number of small independent shops has long been in remorseless decline due to shifting social patterns and retailing costs. The process appears set to continue, whatever happens to Sunday trading regulations. If it threatens to produce an unhealthy concentration in the hands of a few large chains, the remedy lies not in restricting opening hours, but with competition policy. The third argument, that Sunday trading creates unemployment, is more complex. The Home Office study suggests that, so far, the reverse may have been true. It calculates that 45,000 shopworkers now work only or mainly on Sundays - and would be prime casualties of any tightening of restrictions. But it also forecasts that full deregulation would result in fewer jobs in the longer term. Calculating a precise figure is inevitably a speculative exercise. As the study points out, retailing is in the grip of sweeping structural and technological changes which are increasing pressures for productivity growth and shaking out inefficient capacity. Some job losses are bound to result. Curbs on Sunday trading will not reverse this trend. But they could thwart it temporarily - at the cost of inefficiency which must inevitably be paid for in higher retail prices. While some of the study's contentions are debatable, its most powerful point is that protecting or restricting any business sector imposes costs on the rest of the economy. There are cases when that may be justified. That this is not one of them is clear from the fact that the most vocal arguments against freer Sunday trading spring from sectional concerns, not from a genuine attempt to define the wider public interest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Experiments" rubric: </F> "Investments Are Easier To Get With Gaydar's Approval.  Yaroslavl Oblast Conducts Examination of Investment Projects"]    [Text] The Institute for a Transitional Period Economy  [ITPE], headed by Yegor Gaydar, and the Yaroslavl Oblast  administration have extended their cooperation in 1994 whose  result is a program of selective policy [selektivnaya politika]  for the oblast's enterprises. The Yaroslavl authorities have  decided to support the initiative of their Nizhniy Novgorod  neighbors and to invite the prominent economist from Moscow to  carry out a local reform.    The absence of a broad-based promotion for the project in  Russia is explained by the fact that it is almost completely  geared to Western investors. Thus, unlike Nizhniy Novgorod,  Yaroslavl is only interested in money rather than in an image of  economic well-being: Yegor Gaydar is not going to "build  capitalism in a separate oblast." The Gaydar institute has  examined all investment applications and turned down some of  them, in particular an international airport project.    Generally, the "selective policy" a la Gaydar in Yaroslavl  Oblast is fully free of territorial and sectoral constraints.  The ITPE has elaborated criteria for the projects of  enterprises that are in need of investments. The main criterion  should naturally be returns on investments. This applies not  only to projects in the social sphere. The oblast's budget,  too, has undergone ITPE examination and, in Mr. Gaydar's words,  has been considerable altered. One result of these alterations,  the project's authors think, is a "relative socioeconomic  stability" in the region. The only serious problem the oblast  faces is the "inordinately high unemployment level" attributed  to the fact that concentrated in the region is a labor-intensive  light industry that is going through a crisis in the absence of  consumer demand. That sharply reduces the number of jobs.    Yegor Gaydar has named among the most promising projects the  development of the tourism and services spheres. He has not  shared the governor's enthusiasm for the production of  agricultural equipment, however, because he thinks it is not  going to find consumer demand.    The administration is most unlikely to receive money from  Western partners without Gaydar's positive findings. This is  perhaps why his cooperation has been sought -- the trust in  Gaydar's name in the West will make it possible for Yaroslavl  resident to attract the necessary investments.</p>

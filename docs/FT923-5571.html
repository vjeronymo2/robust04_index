			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions CONCERN about the prospect of a rise in UK base rates has kept all but the most determined of directors from dealing in the stock markets. Christopher Gent of Vodafone has sold 20,000 shares at 323p. Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman of Vodafone, sold 580,000 shares in December last year at 355p and was buying heavily in Racal Electronics, at the time as the abortive bid by Williams Holdings. That switching has proved well timed. Of all the shares in the stores sector, Burton seems best supported by its board members. There has been consistent buying by a variety of directors since February this year. The latest purchase of 30,000 shares at 32.5p was by G Powell, who joined the board recently. Shares in Hartstone Group, the leather and hosiery distributor, have underperformed the market sharply over the last three months. Stephen Barker, chairman, and John Padovan bought 50,000 and 5,000 shares at 130p and 125p respectively. Barker remains the largest shareholder on the board with more than 2.1m shares. Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP Group, purchased 100,000 shares in the company at 39p per share. The debt-laden marketing services company recently finalised arrangements for a capital reconstruction which will convert a large portion of the bank's debt into equity.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          No of Company                     Sector   Shares    Value  directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Acal                         Elec     28,728     64       1 British Land (Bnds)          Prop  1,000,000    790       1 Hogg Robinson                BuSe      6,000     11       1 Learmonth &amp; Burchett         Elec     10,000     10       2 Smaller Comp's IT            InvT     19,000     13       1 Vodafone                     Tele     20,000     65       1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- African Lakes                BuSe     40,000     15       1 Argos                        Stor      7,250     16       2 Beverley Group               EngG  1,544,117     97       4 British Land                 Prop    500,000    810       1 Burton                       Stor     30,000     10       1 Daily Mail                    Med      8,000    486       1 Expamet                      OthI    138,327     60       4 Fairway Group                Misc    150,000     68       1 Great Portland               Prop     10,000     13       1 Hartstone                    Misc     55,000     71       2 RHM                          FdMa     18,000     30       1 Sedgwick                     InsB     48,100     54       5 Telegraph                    NewI      5,000     14       1 Transatlantic CPref          InsL    750,000    506       1 WPP Group                     Med    100,000     39       1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

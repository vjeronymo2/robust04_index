			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Management: The transnational's identity crisis POWERFUL new management concepts tend to go through a natural but unfortunate cycle. At first they are applied with care by an informed minority. But then, as word spreads, they are seized upon with abandon and taken to extremes, often becoming distorted. So if the progenitors of a concept want to stop their brainchild getting a bad name, they need to take corrective action rapidly. With its famous but overworked 'cash cow' portfolio planning matrix in the 1970s, the Boston Consulting Group acted several years too late. But in the mid-1980s, with his gospel of the 'globalisation of markets' and products still freshly minted, Harvard's Theodore Levitt was much quicker to correct the exaggeration of his disciples - including the Saatchi brothers - about the 'homogenisation' of everything. Now nearly as rapid remedial action has been taken by one of the fathers of the most powerful current concept of global organisation: that of the 'transnational' company, otherwise known as the 'globally integrated network' or, more loosely, the 'global web'. All three names are equally ungainly. But the concept has caught hold rapidly. Companies as different as Unilever, IBM, Monsanto, SKF and - more tentatively, Sony and Honda - have started to embrace it as superior both to the sort of centralised 'global' structure of most Japanese and some American enterprises, and to the much looser 'multinational' typified in the past by many European companies - including Unilever. Far-sighted government advisers have also seized upon the 'transnational' as the most likely form of international company with which they will have to negotiate in the 21st century. The trouble is that other companies and some academics - notably Robert Reich, an influential Harvard economics professor who is now a member of President Clinton's cabinet - have taken the concept too far, claiming that it is becoming the only way for every large international company to organise itself in the future, irrespective of its industrial or market context. Put simply - though the whole point of such organisations is that they need to be far from simple - a 'transnational' is a company which shares internal power between its units around the world, instead of continuing to hog it all to its home country. Like many companies these days, a transnational implements the fashionable process of 'global localisation': it disperses around the world not only its local sales and distribution, and some manufacturing, but also a degree of research, design and development. But it goes much further than that. It neither controls all these activities rigidly from its home country, as 'global' companies do, nor does it allow each national or regional operation virtual independence, as in a traditional European 'multinational'. Instead, it disperses some of the global control over these activities. This is usually done for individual product divisions - as with Monsanto's shift of its global resins headquarters from Missouri to Belgium, or IBM's move of its network systems business to Britain. But some companies, such as ABB, also operate part of their group head office in this fashion. Within transnationals, almost no two divisions are organised in the same way; thus Unilever's detergents business is now much more centralised than foods. The purpose of such a highly differentiated structure is for each division and product line to gain the best of two worlds: the economies of scale to be achieved through what academics call 'global integration'; and the apparently contrary pressures for maximum responsiveness to differences in national markets. The ideal balance between these pressures varies between industries, divisions and even between product lines in one division. The complexity of this concept is its advantage, in other words. But it is also its drawback, especially when managers or academics try to apply it to companies operating in less complex industries and markets than the likes of Unilever and Monsanto. Robert Reich is a prime offender; his mistaken advocacy of the 'global web' as a universal panacea has fuelled criticism of the whole idea. Hence a thorough corrective in the latest Sloan Management Review* from Sumantra Ghoshal, a professor at Insead in France who created the 'transnational' concept with Christopher Bartlett, a Harvard professor. Far from advocating the transnational structure as a universal solution, says Ghoshal, they have argued repeatedly that it should be used only by companies operating in highly complex business environments, where 'global', 'multinational' and 'local' structures are inappropriate. Transnationals tend to be best suited to industries such as computers, telecommunications, cars and pharmaceuticals and photographic equipment, he suggests. They are least suitable in metals, textiles, printing and publishing. Just as one company can suffer from too simple an organisation if it is in a complex and turbulent environment, another 'can pay an efficiency penalty for adopting an organisation too complex for its environmental demands', continues Ghoshal. Organisational complexity is costly and difficult to manage, he admits and companies must simplify wherever they can. The article gives plenty of practical advice on this. With a myriad of matrices and circle diagrams, it is not an easy read. But nor is the 'transnational' the simple, all-purpose animal which some powerful people seem to think. * Horses for Courses.

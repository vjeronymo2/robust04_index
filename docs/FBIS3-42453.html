Shapkin, candidate of  technical sciences and docent, and Major V. Gladkov]    [Text] This method makes it possible to estimate the volume  and effectiveness of camouflage measures.    Calculation of the labor intensity of engineer camouflage  measures, taking into account the specific conditions and the  tactical situation at hand, is done by the formula:    W=W[.sup]m[/]x(1-K[.sup]nc[/])-W[.sup]tsc[/], (1)    where W[.sup]m[/] is the labor input (volume) of  camouflage measures, in man-hours;    K[.sup]nc[/] is the extent natural camouflage is used  for concealing objects;    W[.sup]tsc[/] is the volume of tasks carried out in the  interests of the large unit (unit) by forces and assets of the  senior chief, in man-hours.    The extent of natural camouflage is used for concealing  objects is determined by assessing the concealing properties of  the terrain of the corresponding area according to a  topographical map and calculating by the formula:  K[.sup]nc[/]=N[.sup]obc[/]xK[.sup]cp[/]/N[.sup]tu[/],  (2)    where N[.sup]obc[/] is the number of objects concealed by  natural camouflage;    N[.sup]tu[/] is the total number of objects in the  large unit (unit);    K[.sup]cp[/] is the indicator of the concealment  properties of the natural camouflage (Table 7.1).    Table 7.1. Indicator of Concealment Properties of Natural Camouflage, K[.sup]cp[/]   Type of       Months  Forest   1             2       3       4      5      6       7      8      9      10      11     12   Coniferous    1.0     1.0     1.0    1.0    1.0     1.0    1.0    1.0    1.0     1.0    1.0    1.0   Deciduous     0.5     0.5     0.6    0.8    0.9     1.0    1.0    1.0    0.9     0.8    0.8    0.5   Mixed         0.75    0.75    0.9    0.9    0.95    1.0    1.0    1.0    0.95    0.9    0.9    0.75      The number of forces involved in carrying out the engineer  camouflage and simulation measures is:    N[.sup]f[/]=W/T[.sup]ct[/], (3)    where W is the labor intensity of the tasks to be performed,  in man-hours;    T[.sup]ct[/] is the time for performing the camouflage  tasks, in hours.    After making the calculations, the chief of the engineer  service of the large unit (unit) must assess the effectiveness  of the planned camouflage measures.    The following are considered the basic criteria of  effectiveness: Probability of detection of single and group  objects; survivability of troops (objects).    A tank, infantry fighting vehicle [BMP], gun, and so forth  are considered single objects.    One method of determining the quantitative probability of  detection of single objects is according to a nomograph (Figure  7.1). The probability of detection of an object by aerial  reconnaissance is determined depending on the type and  conditions of conducting reconnaissance and the camouflage  technique.    <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-006C-26A>           Figure 7.1. Nomograph for determining </FIG>      Example. Determine the probability of  detection of a tank in a pit camouflaged by local means on the  terrain with a degree of cover of K[.sup]ct[/]=15 percent  (determined according to a map) by aerial and photo  reconnaissance from medium altitude.    The course of accomplishing the task is shown in the  nomograph by a broken line. As a result, the probability of  detection is P[.sup]o[/]=0.65.    Group objects such as a subunit, unit, or large unit usually  become the targets of reconnaissance and destruction.    For these objects, it is important to assess the  effectiveness of engineer camouflage measures not only according  to the probability of detection but also according to  survivability.    According to the nomograph (Figure 7.2.), the probability of  detection and the survivability of a group object over time are  determined depending on the time of the year, degree of cover of  the terrain, and the nature of measures conducted for camouflage  and fortification.    <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-006C-27A>           Figure 7.2. Nomograph for determining </FIG>      Example. A motorized rifle unit occupied an  assembly area that was prepared with fortifications. It was  summer. The degree of cover of the terrain was  K[.sup]ct[/]=20 percent. The equipment had been camouflaged  with natural camouflage and standard screens; personnel were in  dugout shelters.    Determine the probability of detection (P[.sup]o[/])  and survivability (q) of the unit 10 hours after occupying the  area.    The course of solving the task is shown in the nomograph by  the broken line. As a result, the probability of detection is  P[.sup]o[/]=0.56, and q=0.8.    After determining the method (technique) of camouflage and  simulation, the chief of the engineer service makes the decision  to involve units (subunits) to perform engineer camouflage and  simulation measures. Subsequently, as part of the monitoring  group he determines the completeness and quality of the tasks  performed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant secretary </F> general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, YSP, by AL-DUSTUR  correspondent Salih al-Qallab, in Aden -- date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Al-Qallab] If some delay  takes place in implementing the accord document after it is  signed, will the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], which controls  the largest part of Yemen, unilaterally implement it?    [Muhammad] Extensive and important discussions are being  held  at our leadership and cadres level and with the other parties to  reach a clear answer to the question of what to do vis-a-vis  this document.    It is very difficult to answer your question. We cannot say  now that we will unilaterally implement the document if our  partners in the coalition refuse to implement it. However, with  respect to issues that need no constitutional amendments, that  do not conflict with laws in force which are adopted by the  legitimate authorities, I say that we have the right to  implement them in areas where it is possible to do so. [passage  omitted]    We will avoid everything that violates the Constitution,  harms unity and could be interpreted as being part of the  establishment of a second state. We will continue dialogue with  all the parties concerned to achieve what one can call a white  revolution.    [Al-Qallab] It is obvious that the YSP is inclined to sign  this document outside Yemen while others believe the signing  should take place on Yemeni soil. Why are you prefer to sign it  abroad?    [Muhammad] We, in the YSP, prefer that the document be  signed  in Jordan for three reasons:    The first is that the brothers in Jordan had suggested at  the  start of the crisis that a meeting between the president and his  vice president take place in Amman. Brothers 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and Salim al-Bid agreed to this. [passage omitted]    The second reason is that, this time, we want witnesses. We  want an Arab presence, other than the Jordanian brothers. We  proposed that the anticipated Amman meeting be attended by  neighboring countries. There is a direct connection, for  example, between the issue and the brothers in Oman, in Saudi  Arabia, and in Eritrea, not to mention Egypt, Syria, the PLO,  and the Arab League.    We want these fraternal countries to be represented at a  high  level. Also, there are some foreign countries which from the  beginning have shown an interest in the need to seek a solution  for the Yemeni crisis and to safeguard Yemeni unity. These  countries should be invited to the Amman meeting, particularly  France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.    The third reason is that I believe that the Yemeni crisis is  still acute, particularly concerning its military and security  dimension. While we take the first steps, during the signing  ceremony, we do not want to see any security breaches that might  inflame the situation and destroy all the achievements that have  been attained.    In other words, if the signing ceremony takes place in a  Yemeni area or city, every party or group attending the meeting  will be escorted by huge security forces. In such a case, it is  not far-fetched that, intentionally or not, a misunderstanding  could take place between this or that person. This would lead  to a catstrophe because the situation and atmophere are very  tense. Huge efforts, including those of the Jordanian brothers,  have been made to prevent this.    We believe that the signing of the document in fraternal  Jordan will guarantee the safety of all, including the brothers  and friends who will be invited to attend. [passage omitted]    [Al-Qallab] We have noticed that all the YSP leaders,  including the vice president and the prime minister have moved  from Sanaa to Aden. Is this some kind of a strong protest  against a specific situation, for security reasons, or to avoid  an eruption of the situation, particularly at this stage?    [Muhammad] There are two reasons: Security in Sanaa,  regrettably, is not available, particularly for the leaders and  members of our party. This is substantiated by the fact that  many of our houses have been attacked, and we have lost several  of our leaders and cadres in broad daylight. [passage omitted]    [Al-Qallab] When will you return to Sanaa?    [Muhammad] We decided to have our brothers in the House of  Representatives return and assume their duties. But, with  respect to some leaders, the causes which forced them to leave  Sanaa should first be remedied.    [Al-Qallab] We have heard that 'Ali Nasir Muhammad might  return to Aden. Have matters been definitively settled with  that wing of the YSP?    [Muhamma] Yes. This issue has been closed for more than two  years now. With respect to brother 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, we have  no objection to his return to Aden. We welcome him.    We have settled all differences and have closed the January  incidents file on the basis of dialogue and alliance, and the  formation of a broad front of all the forces, parties, and  figures to complete the unity project.</p>

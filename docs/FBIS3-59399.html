In December last year, after a Beijing newspaper revealed  that several thousand teachers in Yilong County in Sichuan had  not been paid for seven months and were forced to subsist on  credit, the news poured in of many other places where rural  teachers were suffering due to varying degrees of defaulted  wages. The descriptions of their desperate situations proved  without doubt that this late news story was not just a fable of  one winter.    The problem of defaulted teachers' salaries did not just  begin recently. During all of the 1980's, many locally hired  teachers dependent on wages paid by local villagers in large,  still poverty-stricken areas at times experienced the anxiety of  not receiving compensation. Because this occured in  impoverished areas where all the people lived in difficulty and  because the extent of the problem was limited, it did not  attract appropriate attention. As of approximately last year,  defaults on salaries for government-hired teachers occured in  some counties. The salaries of government-hired teachers are  allocated in the government budget. The salaries were allocated,  so why were they not received by the teachers? Unfortunately,  the relevant agencies did not pay attention to this strange  phenomenon and thus, this type of default was not curtailed in  the early stages but allowed to spread to all the provinces and  autonomous regions. Due to technical reasons (only counting  recorded salaries without all the supplements) and a lack of  understanding (fear of affecting one's career), the amounts of  salaries in default reported by each locality were clearly far  lower than the actual amounts in default. Even so, the figures  collected by the State Education Commission indicate that as of  the end of May of this year, the total amount of rural teachers'  salaries in default had already reached the magnitude of 1.43  billion yuan.    This large-scale default in teachers' salaries has become a  social problem which cannot be ignored.    In addition to Beijing, Ningxia and Tibet, the areas  affected  by this default include all the provinces and autonomous  regions. In Sichuan, Guangxi, Henan, Hebei, Hubei, and Liaoning,  teachers salaries are in default in over half of the counties  and, in some cases, over 70 percent of the counties. In  duration, the defaults are as short as a few months and as long  as three years. Under the repeated exhortations by the central  government to settle these debts, many areas first pay up and  then default again or pay and default at the same time. For  example, before Spring Festival this year Liaoning Province  settled debts and reduced the total of defaulted salaries from  79.81 million yuan to 50.88 million yuan but by the middle of  May, the amount had risen again to 78.51 million yuan. Only a  few provinces such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Qinghai are in  default for only several hundred thousand yuan. Over ten  provinces and autonomous regions, including Liaoning, Hebei,  Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi,  are in default for 60 to 80 million yuan and those with the  greatest debt are Henan, Hubei, Sichuan and Heilongjiang, which  all owe over 100 million in arrears.    There is a wide variety of forms of default in teachers'  salaries, including total default, partial default and other  forms. Long-term total default is common in most areas with  default. At a teachers' forum held in Dunhua city, Jilin  Province, in November last year,the entire audience sobbed as a  middle-aged husband and wife, both elementary school teachers,  described how they had not been paid for four months and, with  no food to cook, their children suffered from hunger. There is  no lack of examples in some areas of default on supplements  mandated by the central government or by local governments. The  long-term default of nine counties in Hainan of teachers'  locality supplements, inflation supplements, and homeroom  teacher incentive pay currently totals over three million yuan.  Some areas even took it upon themselves to eliminate wages for  teachers during winter and summer vacations, saying "They don't  teach during vacations, so what wages are there to pay? If they  want wages they should go find some themselves." Some vilages  and townships dictated strict income generation targets for  schools and those schools which did not meet the targets  received no wages at all. All of the teachers of a central  elementary school in a certain township in Gansu told news  reporters in the early summer of this year that the township  wanted to build a factory but was denied a loan from the bank  due to the lack of a feasibility study. The local government  then collected 1,000 yuan from each teacher and issued a  regulation that those who did not contribute funds would not  receive any more wages so that the teachers suffered in silence.    One can say that during the 1980s, some teachers did not  receive prompt compensation for their labor but this occured  mainly in impoverished areas. Thus, in the 1990s, the extent of  default in teachers' salaries is not necessarily linked to the  level of economic development. In Henan, which is relatively  less well off financially, 16 out of 17 prefectures and  municipalities are in default for a total of 150 million yuan.  Six places, including Xinyang, Zhumadian, Zhoukou, Nanyang,  Pingdingshan, and Kaifeng, owe over 10 million yuan. In even  more financially strapped Guizhou Province, however, even though  their total revenue to date has only met half of the plan, the  entire province only owes 4 million yuan in partial defaults on  teachers' salaries. In economically developed Guangdong and  Zhejiang Provinces, only a few prefectures owe 500,000 or  700,000 in teacher supplements. But in Liaoning, which takes in  over 15 billion yuan in annual revenue, the default has impacted  nearly 80,000 teachers in 465 villages and townships located in  over 55 percent of the counties. In Sichuan Province, the "land  of plenty," the situation is severe, with over 70 percent of the  counties in complete default to teachers for over 100 million  yuan. Some education specialists believe that those provinces  and autonomous regions in default reflect a serious neglect of  duty on the part of all levels of government in those places.    Seventy percent of the 8.5 million elementary and secondary  school teachers in China are in the villages. One investigation  indicated that among the salaried classes in society, rural  school teachers have the weakest economic endurance. Currently,  the general living standard of this group is at best right at  the poverty line, with quite a few people very impoverished. For  example, 52.5 percent of rural school teachers in Rongcheng and  two other counties in Hebei live below the average local living  standard. With salaries which are already so meager that after  supporting a low-standard of consumption there is seldom any  left for savings, as soon as they lose that minimal material  guarantee, it is even more difficult for them to maintain normal  life. When the teachers in Baimiao Village of Bazhong County,  Sichuan, were not able to draw their salaries, they were forced  to go from place to place to find meals on credit, to the extent  that one after the other of the village's canteens and  restaurants were eaten into bankruptcy. Therefore, as an ever  increasing number of the several million rural teachers with  defaulted salaries became indebted and impoverished households,  the foundation of rural education was severely shaken.    The default in salaries has been emotionally damaging to the  teachers. The daily life hardships created by the defaulted  salaries has caused teachers to lose emotional stability. Many  types of social facts entered their field of vision and served  to make them even more uneasy. Some provinces and autonomous  regions invest in real estate, buy imported sedans, and  construct world class hotels, spending hundreds of thousands of  yuan at every turn, but they still cannot resolve the problem of  default in rural teachers' salaries. According to the "China  Youth" newspaper, the amount of funds approved during the first  half of this year for the purchase of cars by government  administrative units at the county level or above nationwide  reached 14.5 billion yuan. In Sichuan, it was possible to give a  villa worth a million yuan to a movie actor while more than 100  million yuan was still owed in defaulted teachers' salaries.  Liaoning Province spent as much as 1.3 billion yuan to purchase  automobiles last year but paid off teachers' salaries only to go  into default again. Several townships and counties which have  defaulted on teachers' salaries were quite extravagant in the  purchase of cars. The teachers have quite normally asked for  explanations of this. Exactly what happened to the money  allocated by the government for teachers' salaries? Will the  government pursue the individuals who diverted those funds? Who  will handle this?    The default in salaries has exacerbated attrition among the  ranks of teachers. Any place which has defaulted on teachers'  salaries has teachers who are forced to give up teaching to stay  alive. Among those are many who deeply love the teaching  profession and are reluctant to leave it but ultimately change  professions just to be able to eat. According to statistics of  relevant agencies, those prefectures with teacher attrition  rates above the national average last year were concentrated in  provinces and autonomous regions with severe defaults in  teachers' salaries. Fengbei village of Xiong county in Hebei  lost 42 out of 153 teachers. One hundred-eighteen teachers  retired early in Lezhi County in Sichuan. In Cangwu and two  other counties in Guangxi, over 150 teachers "jumped into the  sea" [left their jobs]. Four hundred teachers in Huaihua  prefecture in Hunan changed professions, twice as many as the  previous year. The number of class-one teachers and senior  teachers among rural teachers between 26 and 45 years old in  Hebei was reduced by 4,878 (16.7 percent). When a district  education office in Tianjin municipality conducted a  questionnaire survey of 1,000 elementary and secondary school  teachers this year, 70 percent of the teachers indicated "if  there were an opportunity to choose a profession over again, I  would not be a teacher." Defaulting on teachers' salaries has  scared away teachers already working and has scared away future  teachers. In Sichuan's Yilong county, with its severe default on  teachers' salaries, teaching college students view the teaching  profession with trepidation. Out of 151 graduates sent to the  villages last year only seven reported for duty. Even in the  Beijing area, which has not defaulted on teachers' salaries,  only one student listed a teaching university as first choice on  the college preference section of the college entrance exam.    The default in teachers' salaries has increased the  resurgence in the school drop out rate. In 1988, after 850  teachers in Ningde prefecture in Fujian Province gave up  teaching, 148 schools were closed for a time. Since last year,  this type of situation has not been uncommon in provinces and  autonomous regions with severe defaults in teachers' salaries.  Frequently, teachers who have not given up teaching adopt the  desperate approach of taking leave in turns to work elsewhere  and scrape together some money. Many teachers, exhausted from  working desperately to stay alive, have no time to prepare their  lessons and no time to grade papers after class. Quite a few  schools have had to turn class time into study hall or simply  end school early due to a lack of teachers to hold classes.  There are many instances of classes put on hold because  teachers were unable to return to school after school started.  Particularly in remote areas where each school has only one  teacher, a teacher's departure means the loss of a school. In  this situation, an increase in the dropout rate is unavoidable.  Hebei Province predicts that the number of junior high school  dropouts this year will increase by 55,000 and the drop out rate  will increase by three percentage points to 8.72 percent. The  large-scale attrition from junior high schools will not only  seriously prevent the implementation of nine years' compulsory  education in rural areas but will also increase the shrinkage of  ordinary high schools and vocational high schools in rural  areas. As one education specialist said, defaulting on teachers'  salaries is no different from killing a chicken to get the eggs.  In setting their sights on the economic arena, some local  government officials have demonstrated zeal for quick success  and instant benefit, not only proving their own ignorance but  even depriving their descendents of the right to those benefits.  In a place with a low quality of education, modernization is an  empty phrase. In many places, however, defaulting on teachers'  salaries is ruining education, creating new illiterates and  holding back the next generation. [passage omitted]    Why did this strange phenomenon of default on teachers'  salaries occur? Why would this strange phenomenon spread so  quickly? All levels of education offices and education labor  unions are searching for answers. Based on the aspects  understood thus far, primarily the following factors created  this situation.    Ever since the establishment of the new country, the policy  followed on the payment of rural teachers' salaries has been  unified payment by county finance departments. Impoverished  counties which could not pay government-hired teachers out of  their own finances (nearly 1,000 in the entire country) received  assistance from the prefectural or provincial finance  departments. This guaranteed that salaries for government-hired  teachers reached the teachers.    Around 1991, finance system reform allocating finance  responsibility to all levels of government in the entire country  (with responsibility down to the village and township level)  combined with education management responsibility divided among  different levels of government brought change. On the one hand,  county level governments delegated too many of the rights and  responsibility for education to the village and township level.  Villages became responsible for managing and supervising  elementary schools. Townships managed and supervised junior high  schools. Some government-managed junior high schools were even  placed under the supervision and management of townships. On the  other hand, as finance systems were established at the township  level, the province, prefecture and county level finance offices  gradually relinquished the planning and regulation of  educational funding in their areas. As the townships implemented  the finance responsibility system on their own, many could not  handle the township educational expenditure. Some used  educational funding to supplement gaps in township finances or  diverted the funds to other uses. Some counties even tied  township education funds to the submission of township revenue  contributions. If the township did not submit the complete  required revenue contribution, the education funds were to be  held and not disbursed and used to compensate for the required  revenue contribution. The counties thus guaranteed that each  township would make its required revenue quota and the townships  were pleased to have compensation funds which saved them part of  their revenue obligation. What about salaries for teachers? One  approach is default, bringing misfortune for the teachers;  another approach is to apportion out the obligation in the name  of education, thus increasing the burden of the peasants. In  both cases, the people lose out.    After Comrade Deng Xioapeng made a speaking tour of the  South  in 1992, the economic pace in the entire country clearly  increased. All levels of government jumped to increase economic  investment. Some places were not realistic in their approach,  blindly setting up businesses, and taking over educational funds  when funds were very tight. When educational funds were taken to  do other things, educational funds of course could no longer be  disbursed monthly. The supplement base set for impoverished  areas (unchanged for many years) became lower than the ever  increasing demand. Three prefectures in the eastern foothills of  the Taihang mountains, Lingshou, Fuping, and Tangxian, for a  period this year owed an accumulated debt of over 10 million  yuan in teachers' salaries. This was because government  allocated educational funds were not disbursed on time for quite  a long period.    Funds for supplements to locally hired teachers are partly  from supplemental educational funds. Since 1986, it has been a  special funding item with revenue collected locally by  townships. But because on the one hand, collection was slack and  on the other hand it was not well managed, these funds have  often not been collected, or if collected, were diverted to  other uses. After the State Council asked that the people's  burdens be decreased, some provinces and autonomous regions even  deemed this an excessive burden on the peasants and issued  decrees temporarily ceasing this collection. For example, in  Baoding prefecture in Hebei, the 20 counties there should  collect 73.8 million yuan but as of now have only collected 20  percent. Without these funds, where will the supplement for  locally hired teachers come from?    The faulty work, bureaucratism, and even violation of laws  and discipline of some local governments are also factors which  have contributed to creating or exacerbating the default and  cannot be ignored. In terms of faulty work, some counties with  good revenues decreased educational funds to start economic  projects, creating a major policy deviation. Revenues for 1992  in Jing County in Hebei were 11 percent greater than those from  the previous year but educational expenditures decreased by 18.5  percent. This was in violation of the central government's  regulation on educational funds that "both will increase." Some  counties have left the position of vice county head in charge of  culture and education vacant for a long time, thus losing an  opportunity to resolve the default problem. Some county leaders  lack a sense of urgency and responsibility towards clearing the  debts, making outstanding defaults worsen daily. In terms of  violating laws and and discipline, some counties have taken  revenge on those who have honestly reported on the default  situation. Some townships have diverted educational funds and  educational supplements allocated by the government to setting  up factories. Some townships have taken advantage of the time  lag after educational funds have been disbursed from higher  levels to loan out the money and reap large profits. The  government of one county in Sichuan even issued a `red-topped  document' stipulating that each teacher must donate 300 yuan to  revive the local tobacco factory. The method used was to "chop"  it all at once directly out of a teacher salary disbursement  from the finance department. Based on information from teachers  in many places, at the same time that local governments were  defaulting on teachers' salaries, they were constructing many  buildings of all types, buying many fancy cars, and spending  money with abandon on travel in China and abroad. If part of  that money had been used on education, the problem of defaults  on teachers' salaries would never have developed to this point.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Arts: A Don without redemption - London Ballet men have been decorated on the battlefield for less - and I remain as disenchanted by its components, and aghast at its inadequacies, as I was after the first night. I can find no redeeming feature in it: each element - of design, production, performance, style, even orchestration - undermines the real merits of a ballet which, for all its inconsistencies, has lasted for more than a hundred happy years in the Russian repertory. Mistrust and misinterpretation have taken a horrid toll on this Don Quixote and its interpreters. I do not recall the Royal Ballet looking more uncertain or more provincial, its artists battling with choreography they plainly do not understand and have not been taught to appreciate. The standards of classical and character dancing are unworthy. The choice of the text was wrong-headed: Baryshnikov's pruning of the Kirov version is ungenerous in scale, hustled in dramatics. Far better to have used the Kirov original, which is joyous, crammed with varied dances, and stylistically coherent. It enshrines a way of performing this classic-Spanish romp which could be exhilarating and challenging for our dancers. It is also charming to look at, since the designs made by Golovin in 1902 are beautifully preserved, and beautifully effective. The unrelenting blare of Mark Thompson's decoration, which extinguishes the dancers, and his lugubrious costuming (dancers as mortuary attendants), blight any gaiety. The character playing has a routine air, except for the inexplicable and scene-stealing drunk who haunts the edges of the stage throughout the first act; though I wonder what the priest with Red Riding Hood's basket is offering to the locals as he patrols the plaza - saucy postcards? Indulgences? Escape plans? In St Petersburg the score is a tuneful mish-mash, but it exactly suits the zip and crackle of the dances, with their occasional yearning or classically serious moments. Covent Garden's gim-crack version betrays its hand as soon as we hear the honky-tonk piano playing for the inapt front cloth scene that begins the evening. Nothing good can come of such a view of Minkus, and nothing does. And no one on stage - save Irek Mukhamedov, who realised he had fallen on hard times - has any idea of how to deal with the stylistic demands of such a piece. We have seen great performers in this ballet, from Plisetskaya (who was a miracle of joyous bravura) to Maximova and Vasiliev (who were sun bursts), and I treasure memories of Galina Samsova and Lucette Aldous, of Semenyaka, of Terekhova, as marvellous heroines. They each brought a sense of ebullient happiness, of high spirits and higher jumps, of witty playing and wittiest feet in the variations. The Kitris I have seen thus far - Viviana Durante, Cynthia Harvey, Fiona Chadwick and Leanne Benjamin - have been cramped by staging and design, and looked understandably desperate. If the role of Basilio can defeat Mukhamedov (on the first night he tried to kick-start this dismal affair, with no success), then lesser artists are simply its prisoners. Zoltan Solymosi, Stuart Cassidy, Jose Manuel Carreno (making a debut with the Royal Ballet) deserve more than the strait-jacket of such charmless routines. The rest of the cast are baffled from curtain rise. I record with no pleasure that six toreadors (in costumes that make them look like neckless wonders with bulging hips) seem unhappy with their one difficult step; that in the vision scene (where the dryads have only one step to perform, interminably) the luscious variation for the Dryad Queen has been made stiffly polite; that the playing of Mercedes and Espada would be more likely in Bude than Barcelona. Only Nicola Roberts as Amour has shown the pretty, nuanced dancing than can make the choreography sparkle as it should. Elsewhere, tambourines, handclaps and manic vivacity turn Don Quixote into a totentanz. Audiences have been grossly misled by a staging which ranks among the worst things the Royal Ballet has shown us in half a century.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Spain Socialists see support fall SUPPORT for Spain's governing Socialist party has fallen sharply, and is now only marginally ahead of that for the opposition conservatives, according to an opinion poll published yesterday. The survey suggests that a hung parliament will be returned when general elections are held later this year, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The poll of 10,000 voters in the newspaper El Pais indicated that the Socialists would hold just 146 seats of the 175 they won in October 1989 and that the centre-right Partido Popular (PP) would increase its presence in the 350-member congress from 107 seats to 143. The Socialist share of the vote has slipped from 39.6 per cent of the vote at the last elections to 33.9 per cent and the PP's has grown from 25.8 per cent to 36.3 per cent.</p>

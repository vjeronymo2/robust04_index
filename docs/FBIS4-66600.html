			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 22--In a development of  extraordinary significance, the implications of which should not  be lost on Pakistan and the United States, the two Houses of  Parliament on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution which  expressed national determination to resist all attempts to  destabilise India in respect of Kashmir.    The "Hands-off-Kashmir" resolution was adopted 24 hours  after  the President, Dr Shankar Dayal Sharma, in his address to the  joint session of the two Houses of Parliament had warned that  "any attempt to destabilise India either from across the border  or from any other quarter would be foiled." Consistent with  reiterating that Jammu and Kashmir "has been, is, and shall  remain" an integral part of India, asserted that India had the  will and capacity to firmly counter all designs against its  unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.    The motion, read out by the presiding officers of both  Houses, was passed without any discussion to the thumping of  desks, showing that all the political parties were with the  government on this issue.    The two-page resolution demanded that Pakistan vacate areas  of the Indian State, which they have occupied through aggression  and regretted the pitiable conditions and violations of human  rights and denial of democratic rights and freedom to the people  in the area.    The strongly-worded resolution charged Pakistan with  abetting  terrorism in the Indian State through imparting training to  terrorists in camps located in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied  Kashmir (PoK), supply of weapons and funds and assistance to the  terrorists infiltrating into the Valley with the avowed purpose  of creating disorder, disharmony and subversion.    The resolution called upon Islamabad to put an end to these  activities forthwith. These activities were in violation of the  Shimla agreement, the internationally accepted norms of  inter-State conduct and the Geneva declaration to which Pakistan  is a signatory. Stating that this was the root cause of tension  between the two countries, the resolution declared that the  Indian political and democratic structures and the Constitution  provided for firm guarantees for the promotion and protection of  human rights of all its citizens.    There had been much concern in political circles at the  recent attempts by Pakistan to internationalise the Kashmir  issue. The concern was voiced at the two rounds of meetings the  Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr V.C. Shukla, held with  leaders of different political parties in Parliament last week.  The main Opposition party in Parliament, the Bharatiya Janata  Party (BJP), which first broached the subject, had informed the  minister of its proposal to move a resolution in this regard.  Following expression of similar sentiments from other parties,  it was felt that they should all be part to a single resolution  so as to send the proper signals across the border.    Differences, however, cropped up about the wording of the  resolution, with the National Front and Left parties insisting  that the United States be identified by name for its role in the  matter of terrorism in Kashmir. Unanimity also eluded the  leaders on the question of adopting the resolution without a  discussion in the event of it being a government-sponsored one.  It was then decided that the resolution be moved by the Speaker  in the Lok Sabha and the Chairman in the Rajya Sabha. The  resolution, which incorporates the views and feelings of all the  parties, does not, however, identify the United States by name.    Following is the text of the resolution:    This House notes with deep concern Pakistan's role in  imparting training to the terrorists in camps located in  Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), the supply of  weapons and funds, assistance in infiltration of trained  terrorists, including foreign mercenaries into Jammu and Kashmir  with the avowed purpose of creating disorder, disharmony and  subversion:    --reiterates that the terrorists trained in Pakistan are  indulging in murder, loot and other heinous crimes against the  people taking them hostage and creating an atmosphere of terror;    --condemns strongly the continued abetment and encouragement  Pakistan is extending to subversive and terrorist activities in  the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir;    --calls upon Pakistan to stop forthwith its support to  terrorism, which is in violation of the Shimla agreement, the  internationally accepted norms of inter-State conduct and the  Geneva declaration to which Pakistan is a signatory. This is in  fact the root cause of tension between the two countries;    --reiterates that the Indian political and democratic  structures and the Constitution provide for firm guarantees for  the promotion and protection of human rights of all its citizens;    --regards Pakistan's anti-India campaign of calumny and  falsehood as unacceptable and deplorable;    --notes with deep concern the highly provocative statements  emanating from Pakistan and urges Pakistan to refrain from  making statements which vitiate the atmosphere;    --expresses regret and concern at the pitiable conditions  and  violations of human rights and denial of democratic rights and  freedom of the people in those areas of the Indian State of  Jammu and Kashmir, which are under the illegal occupation of  Pakistan;    --firmly reiterates, on behalf of the people of India, that:  (a) The State of Jammu and Kashmir has been, is, and shall be an  integral part of India and any attempts to separate it from the  rest of the country will be resisted by India by all necessary  means; (b) India has the will and capacity to firmly counter all  designs against its unity, sovereignty and territorial  integrity; (c) Pakistan should vacate the areas of the Indian  State of Jammu and Kashmir, which they have occupied through  aggression; (d) Any attempt from any quarter to interfere in the  internal affairs of India will be met resolutely.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ASSAILED FOR OPPOSING OZONE AID PACT  </P> <P> Key allies of the United States warned Wednesday that the Bush Administration's  opposition to a new aid package that would help Third World countries switch to  ozone-friendly chemicals could jeopardize efforts to repair the widening hole  in the Earth's ozone layer.  </P> <P> At a meeting in Geneva sponsored by the United Nations to amend an accord on  the ozone problem, delegates from Japan, Australia and European countries  roundly criticized American opposition to the proposed $100-million aid  program.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Ambassador Richard Smith officially  announced its opposition to a proposal to help Third World countries pay the  higher cost of switching to substitutes for ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs) when they become available.  </P> <P> But delegates to the conference said that unless financially pressed developing  countries such as China and India are persuaded to join an international accord  to limit use and production of CFCs, planned cutbacks by industrialized  countries will be futile.  </P> <P> Neither India nor China has ratified the accord, known as the Montreal  Protocol, and both are committed to raising their standards of living by making  refrigeration widely available to their burgeoning populations. CFCs are used  as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners. Although substitutes are  being developed that are less harmful to the Earth's ozone layer, they will be  more expensive.  </P> <P> Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said in Washington on  Wednesday that the Bush Administration sees no need for additional funding to  deal with the problem.  </P> <P> "At this time the resources are sufficient," he said. "We do not feel it is  sensible to set up new financial mechanisms with new rules, regulations and  procedures. . . ."  </P> <P> The position reportedly was formulated by White House Chief of Staff John H.  Sununu and Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget,  over the objections of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief William K.  Reilly.  </P> <P> An official observer at the meeting said from Geneva on Wednesday that the U.S.  position also would place the Administration against tough new restrictions on  ozone-destroying chemicals.  </P> <P> He explained that the aid program and the new restrictions, which the United  States has supported, are scheduled to be voted on together at a major ozone  accord conference in London next month.  </P> <P> "There's only going to be one vote, up or down, on the entire package of  amendments," said David Doniger, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources  Defense Council.  </P> <P> Doniger said the United States had "isolated" itself, and he quoted a delegate  from Norway as calling the decision "mind-boggling. . . . Not even the Japanese  backed America. The U.S. position amounts to making Third World countries rob  Peter to pay Paul."  </P> <P> Representatives of numerous Third World countries are scheduled to address the  Geneva conference today.  </P> <P> At a separate conference last month in New Delhi, about 20 developing countries  from Asia, Africa and Latin America met to forge a united front before the  London conference and called for the financial aid.  </P> <P> Even before the United States announced its opposition to the package, it had  been accused of acting too slowly on global environmental proposals.  </P> <P> At a conference called by Bush in Washington last month, the President  irritated some European participants by focusing on the scientific  uncertainties of global warming instead of pressing for immediate action.  </P> <P> In Washington on Wednesday, 12 Republican senators led by Sen. John H. Chafee  of Rhode Island urged Bush to rethink the decision. "Our negotiating team has  isolated the U.S. and placed us in an untenable position," the senators said.  They noted that the U.S. share of the fund would be $25 million over three  years.  </P> <P> "For this small amount, the United States is threatening to disrupt the  negotiations to strengthen the protocol. There has rarely been, we believe, a  better example of being penny-wise and pound-foolish."  </P> <P> Criticism also came from several Senate Democrats, including Joseph I.  Lieberman of Connecticut and Albert Gore of Tennessee, who called the position  "shortsighted and just plain outrageous."  </P> <P> Times staff writers James Gerstenzang and William Eaton in Washington  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy deals in Midland THE Midland Bank takeover saga was taken a step further yesterday when Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking was believed to have purchased two large blocks of Midland stock. Dealers said that the two blocks, one of 9m shares and another 7.9m, were recorded on the Seaq ticker as having traded at 420 1/4 p and 422p. James Capel, the leading UK agency broker owned by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking, was said to have bought the shares on behalf of the Hong Kong bank. Hongkong Banking recently said it held a 17.74 per cent stake in Midland. It was said in the market that the 17m shares represented the last of the arbitrageurs, who had bought Midland stock in the hope that the takeover battle between Hongkong Banking and Lloyds developing, selling their stock. There were also hints that the stock had come from the Kuwait Investment Office which sold the major part of a 10.5 per cent stake in Midland at the end of April. Midland shares dipped 6 to 422p, after 420p, after details of the share purchases became known. Turnover in Midland reached 42m. Glaxo setback County NatWest, the securities house, appeared to be largely responsible for a bout of hefty selling pressure on Glaxo shares which fell sharply to close a net 27 off at 711p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 8.2m shares. County's pharmaceuticals team published a research note suggesting that the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines has received a number of adverse drug reaction reports, associating the usage of Imigran, Glaxo's new migraine drug, with chest pain. The County analysts said that even if Imigran was to prove a commercial disappointment, Glaxo's size and flexibility in expenditure growth rate would limit the impact on earnings growth. 'Any marked underperformance from this development could leave the shares at very attractive levels,' County said. Airways firmer The view that the price war between international airlines on some US routes would not hurt British Airways substantially helped the shares buck the market trend. The shares ended 7 up at 275p, having been higher on turnover of 7.8m, after the company was reported to have assured City analysts in a series of phone calls that its most lucrative route, between London and New York, was as yet unaffected by the new transatlantic price war which started earlier this week. The effect on routes where the price war has already started was said to be negligible The shares lost ground earlier in the week as US airlines announced they were cutting the ticket prices on several routes from the US to Europe. But Mr Christopher Will at Lehman Brothers said: 'The important thing is that fares are not being cut between JFK and Heathrow which is the really profitable route.' Welsh Water shares substantially underperformed the rest of the water issues after its preliminary figures revealed disappointing results, especially from the company's diversification away from its core water business. By the close Welsh Water shares were 16 lower at 451p. Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, water company specialist at County NatWest, described the shares as a straight sell and warned of a below average dividend increase for the current year. Bank shares were unsettled by news that Standard &amp; Poor's (S &amp; P) had downgraded its long term debt ratings for Barclays, NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. S &amp; P said it had shifted its ratings because of the prolonged recession and its impact on the banks' balance sheets. Barclays dropped 5 to 349p, NatWest the same amount to 338p and Royal Bank eased a shade to 197p. Smith New Court's excellent figures - profits surged from Pounds 7.6m to Pounds 18.4m on the back of its involvement in numerous big market deals including Hanson's purchase of a 2.8 per cent stake in ICI - saw the shares edge up 2 to 130p. British Land provided some relief for a battered property sector. The shares rose 10 to 214p after the company announced a 7.4 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 33.3m, and a 10.4 per cent higher dividend of 6.35p. Troubled jewellery chain Ratners gained  3/4 to 14 1/4 p, on turnover of 2.4m shares, after announcing the sale of its Watches of Switzerland subsidiary to unlisted securities company Asprey, down 2 at 263p. Fears that lower prices will be required to encourage consumer spending hit some leading high street stores. The CBI's monthly survey of the distributive trades showed sales slowed in May, while there is also concern about the impact of a price war in the DIY sector. Kingfisher, the B&amp;Q holding company, slipped 5 to 515p. Devenish lost 12 to 269p, but according to analysts is still likely to receive a bid from Boddington, unchanged at 181p, when the Northern brewer is free to renew its offer in about a week's time, after last year's failed takeover attempt. Turnover in British Steel soared to 19m following two big trades in the course of the session. A block of 7.4m was done at 70 1/2 p, while another 9m went through at 71.1p. The company's broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew were said to have had a big seller of stock. The shares retreated 3 to 73p. Wednesday's meeting and dinner at Hoare Govett, which was addressed by the new chairman of British Aerospace left investors concerned about the outlook for the company. The main worries centre on the future of the regional aircraft division, which could force the company to make substantial provisions. This led to fears for the company's profits and dividend. The shares responded by falling 13 to 319p, on turnover of 2.7m. Mr Brian Newman at Henderson Crosthwaite said: 'The proposed merger between Fokker and DASA will leave BAe's regional aircraft division loss-making and isolated. This is the major strategic issue which the new management team need to resolve.' Oxford Instruments dropped 25 to 229p following the figures. Blick, on the other hand, jumped 16 to 414p in the wake of the 32 per cent profits improvement. The Kalon bid for Manders saw the latter's shares spiral upwards to close 54 firmer at 291p and the former ease 2 1/2 to 108p. Hints that ECC, formerly English China Clays, had indicated to a number of analysts that their forecasts were too high, prompted a flurry of selling which left the shares 13 weaker at 533p.

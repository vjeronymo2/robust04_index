			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Bectu calls off strike threat Bectu, the main technical union at the BBC, yesterday called off the threat of immediate further industrial action and decided to enter up to eight weeks of detailed talks with the management. The union warned that if the talks did not bring results it would re-ballot its members with the intention of taking further industrial action in the autumn. Yesterday's decision finally removes the threat to coverage of major summer sporting events such as Wimbledon, which began yesterday. The National Union of Journalists decided on Friday to enter the new negotiation process hammered out last week at Acas, the conciliation service. The decision made it likely Bectu would move in a similar direction. The BBC wants to meet the unions at Acas in late August 'to confirm the detail of the whole package on which the trade unions could respond'.</p>

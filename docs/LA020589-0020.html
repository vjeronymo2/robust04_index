			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENS: COMING OUT;  </P> <P> A SNEAK PREVIEW OF THE RECENTLY INTRODUCED -- AND QUITE RARE -- JAPONICA  CAMELLIAS INCLUDES A NEW, ALMOST-YELLOW FLOWER  </P> <P> THESE ARE CAMELLIAS that you have never seen before -- and that you won't see  in very many places. Most nurseries have other fine camellias in bloom now, and  respectable ca mellias also are sold at chain stores at tempt ing prices (last  year, one store offered gallon-sized camellias for less than $3). Nevertheless,  these new camellias, the latest efforts of hybridizers, are available only at a  Southern California camellia (and azalea) specialist, the family-operated  Nuccio's Nurseries in Altadena. Many of these new plants are Nuccio's own  introductions, the results of an active breeding program.  </P> <P> February is considered the middle of the camellia-flowering -- and  camellia-planting -- season. That's one excellent characteristic of camellias:  Unlike bare-root roses and many other flowering shrubs, camellias can be  planted when they are in bloom, or soon afterward, so you get to see exactly  what type of flower you are planting.  </P> <P> The big camellia news a few years ago was the discovery of a small,  yellow-flowered wild camellia in China. Now Nuccio's is selling a hybrid of the  large-flowered japonica type with a touch of yellow in it. This new camellia --  alas, in very short supply -- was bred in Georgia and named Dahlohnega. It is a  slow grower; the plant remains compact, and the flowers are "formal double"  (one of six camellia flower forms).  </P> <P> Dahlohnega flowers usually emerge cream-colored, and only occasionally is there  a pale-yellow flower. "We thought this was going to be the first yellow  camellia," explains Tom Nuccio, one of the owners. However, he says, "it is  definitely not just another white camellia; it is cream. It's a color break."  </P> <P> Another new camellia from Nuccio -- this one in abundance -- sounds promising  for small gardens. An "under-the-window" camellia, as it's described by Nuccio,  it grows only 3 or 4 feet high, so it literally will grow under a typical  window without blocking the view. The foliage is dark, and the plant is  slow-growing, has an upright shape and remains compact. Its name, Prima  Ballerina, very much fits the delicate white flowers that are flared and  ruffled like a ballerina's tutu.  </P> <P> Katie, a Nuccio seedling in good supply, has huge flowers measuring almost 6  inches across. Some plants have variegated flowers (red streaked with white)  and leaves (streaked yellow). The plant is upright in habit and of medium size  (6 feet plus).  </P> <P> Cherries Jubilee is one of the first dark-red camellias with white petals in  the center -- a striking combination. However, Nuccio warns, only about half of  the flowers on any Cherries Jubilee plant will have white centers, a  characteristic that can vary from year to year. A tall grower, Cherries Jubilee  becomes somewhat leggy, so the top should be pruned out to encourage fuller  growth.  </P> <P> Nuccio's Carousel is a refreshing, simple pink. One of the earliest camellias  to flower -- beginning in December -- and longest in bloom, Carousel grows  fast. The foliage is a handsome dark green.  </P> <P> Also in reasonable supply is the prim Spring Formal, which flowers at the  latter part of the camellia season, mostly in March. This plant grows to more  than 6 feet tall. Even when young, Spring Formal produces lots of buds and  flowers.  </P> <P> Royal Velvet is an elegant dark camellia with "flowers that look up at you" --  blooms do not droop or hang down. It is a tall plant, growing more than 6 feet  high, and is fairly narrow in stature.  </P> <P> When photographed last year, Grand Marshal was named simply No. 8209, a large  peony-flowered camellia with medium-green leaves. It is still in limited  supply. A plant of medium height, it will not produce many flowers until it has  been in the ground for a few years.  </P> <P> The smallest flower of the new Nuccio camellias belongs to a species of  camellia that was discovered growing wild in China's Yunnan province. Camellia  collectors bought up all of the Camellia yunnanensis in the fall, but plants  will be available again next year. This new species has a distinct, somewhat  lemony fragrance, something not found in other camellias. Nuccio claims that  the scent can be detected from some distance, although his nose may be more  finely attuned to this delicate scent than most. He recommends Camellia  yunnanensis as a hedge because it grows to 6 feet and has small leaves and  flowers similar to those of a sasanqua. He calls it "White Yuletide," comparing  it to one of the more popular sasanquas that flowers in late December with  Rudolph-red petals.  </P> <P> Camellia fanciers might be put off by the buds of this new camellia, which,  according to Nuccio, are either a wonderful brown "like a Winter Nelis pear" or  look "dry and about to blow away." The buds are quite brown, but they open to  reveal pristine white flowers.  </P> <P> Camellia yunnanensis prefers shade, but as with many other camellias, it will  grow in shade or partial sun. Many plants mentioned here grow at the Altadena  nursery directly in the sun with little in the way of protection -- and even  survive the Santa Ana winds that sweep down from the nearby mountains. Nuccio  suspects C. yunnanensis is one of the more sun-tolerant camellias.  </P> <P> What does the future hold for camellias? So many new species are coming out of  China by way of Japan, Nuccio reports, that almost anything is possible -- the  crossing of species is likely to turn up all sorts of interesting new plants.  Some early crosses have already produced camellias with fragrance, camellias  almost yellow in color, camellias with wavy foliage and some with bell-like  flowers and a form that, according to Nuccio, "looks like a Ficus benjamina  with flowers." He expects to see these species contributing some rather  uncamellialike traits to the next crop of camellias. Nuccio's Nurseries is  located at 3555 Chaney Trail, Altadena; telephone (818) 794-3383.  </P></p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: No public aid for Santana Motor The Spanish government yesterday ruled out taking a shareholding in Santana Motor, following a threat by the company's Japanese parent, Suzuki, to close its main Spanish factory unless it received financial support. The industry ministry said state investment in Santana, which filed for receivership at the weekend, was out of the question. A spokesman said such a move would prompt a rush of similar requests. 'The queue would never end,' he added. The government position echoes the stand it took last year when Volkswagen, of Germany, asked for public money to shore up its Spanish offshoot Seat, now in the throes of a drastic restructuring. The ministry, which began talks with management on Monday, said it had received no official word about the company's intention to close the four-wheel-drive vehicle plant at Linares in southern Spain, which employs 2,400. Santana, 82 per cent owned by Suzuki, told employee representatives and unions it would be 'very difficult' to keep the main manufacturing activities. Santana said it had accumulated losses of Pta21bn (Dollars 149m) in the last three years. Unless 'third parties' met its financial requirements it would be obliged 'to take the measures that the law permits under such circumstances'.</p>

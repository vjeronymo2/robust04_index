			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: It took the Israeli state commission of  enquiry that examined the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre four full  months to reach a forgone conclusion. The commission found the  Israeli military, Government, and settlers not guilty, and held  Baruch Goldstein solely responsible for the carnage. If the not  guilty verdict had been so cut and dried, why did it take the  commission so long to reach its conclusion about an outrage in  which Goldstein was aided and abetted by the Israeli settlers  and military? We could even have guessed the exact wording in  which the verdict was going to be phrased. All the crimes and  massacres committed by the Israelis and their Haganah, Stern,  Aragon, and Kach gangs over more than half a century have either  been whitewashed or blamed on deranged individuals. We need not  recount the massacres in which Israel's history abounds.  Whoever wants to look at Israel's history of terror, on which  Israel was founded, need only refer to UN and Security Council  files. The exoneration of the Israeli Government and military  from responsibility for the Hebron Massacre, all the evidence to  the contrary notwithstanding, is significant in more ways than  one, and carries untold risks to the Palestinian Arab people and  the peace process. The commission's findings, in effect, give  the go-ahead to the settlers and the Israeli military to  perpetrate further atrocities against the Palestinian people.  The findings make of the settlements veritable time bombs and a  permanent threat looming over the Palestinian people and the  entire peace process.    Israeli Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq has said that he cannot  rule out a recurrence of the Hebron massacre. In effect, Baraq  is encouraging settlers to commit further massacres against the  Palestinians and is encouraging the Israeli military to look the  other way or even participate in future outrages, just at it did  in the Ibrahimi Mosque case as shown in evidence ignored by the  Rabin government's report.    The Arabs cannot forget that Israel owes its existence to a  string of massacres committed in Palestinian towns and villages  -- from Dayr Yasin, Qibya, Lod, and Ramlah, to Qafr Qasim and  Sabra and Shatila, to name but a few. Systematic terror has  been state policy for successive Israeli Governments. Attacks  against south Lebanon and acts of piracy on land, at sea, and in  the air, and the abduction of individuals are prime examples.  More ominously, what Israel is doing, under the international  community's very nose, is not being met with the firmness and  resoluteness it deserves. Israel is thus encouraged to persist  in its aggression and terror in broad daylight and to imperil  the peace process and to keep the region as a flash point  threatening world peace and security.    The findings of the Israeli state commission of enquiry  cannot absolve the Rabin government or the Israeli military of  culpability in the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Nor can they cut  any ice with the international community. Even assuming a  segment of the international community is convinced that no  blame should be attached to the Rabin government or the Israeli  Army in the Ibrahimi Mosque episode, it cannot but judge as  terrorism Israel's acts of aggression and abductions in south  Lebanon and its conduct in the Golan Heights and in the occupied  Arab territories and in detention centers.    This makes the international community all the more  responsible for the safety of the population in the occupied  Arab territories and the success of the peace process.</p>

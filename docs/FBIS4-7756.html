			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Milos Sklenka: "COCOM as a Symbol of </F> Confrontation Has Ceased To Exist"]    [Excerpt] The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral  Export Controls, known as COCOM, was dissolved with final  validity yesterday. This happened on the basis of a decision by  all 17 member states of this international institution, made at  The Hague in the Netherlands last November and confirmed in  Amsterdam on Wednesday [30 March].    A new organization to replace COCOM is to be set up in the  very near future. It should no longer be open only to advanced  Western countries but also to many states of Central and East  Europe and the Third World.    "The Czech Republic [CR] is interested in participating  actively in the work of the COCOM successor organization,"  Bretislav Gregr, director of the Special Materials Department  operating under the Licensing Administration of the Ministry of  Industry and Trade of the CR, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday.  As Gregr went on to say, our government is already engaged in a  number of negotiations in this matter. According to Gregr, the  termination of COCOM's existence definitely does not mean the  abolition of [export] control regimes in industrially advanced  countries. It means only the abolition of the existing  institutional structure of this organization. [passage omitted]    The new organization, the establishment of which is foreseen  for the beginning of next year, should associate all the member  countries of the former COCOM, plus Austria, Ireland, New  Zealand, and Switzerland. The admission of additional states,  including Russia, China, the CR, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland,  is planned in the future.    According to representatives of the former COCOM, the speed  of the integration of these states will depend on the progress  of their domestic legislation, which must provide safeguards  against advanced Western technologies being misused. In  contrast to COCOM practices, one no longer counts on the  drafting of lists with embargoed goods or banned export  territories.</p>

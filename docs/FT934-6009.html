			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tay Homes calls for Pounds 10.2m via rights Tay Homes, the Leeds-based housebuilder, is seeking to raise Pounds 10.2m net via a 1-for-3 rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet and provide finance for continued expansion. Up to 7.3m new ordinary shares are to be issued at 145p apiece. The shares slipped 4p to 170p yesterday. Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, together with Mr Norman Stubbs, deputy chairman and chief executive, are subscribing in aggregate for 1.48m new shares, 20.2 per cent of the issue. The balance is underwritten by Kleinwort Benson Securities, who are also brokers to the issue. Tay's last cash call was in 1987. Since then the number of units sold per year has risen from 540 to 1,107. The landbank has grown from plots available for 2,000 units to plots for some 4,950 units. Following an autumn period, which was not significantly different from the previous year, unit sales together with sales reservations by mid-November had increased by more than 10 per cent. The directors said the 1993-94 results 'should be positively affected by a continuation of the current reduction in selling and promotional costs per unit, a lower proportion of sales from slower-selling and low margin sites and the fact that the group will be selling from a larger number of sites.' Profits for 1992-93 fell from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 3.1m pre-tax on sales of Pounds 69.6m (Pounds 72.4m).</p>

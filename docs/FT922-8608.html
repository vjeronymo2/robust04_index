			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Arts: Cher and kd lang - Pop Look on this picture and on this. First we see on stage a woman hiding ostentatiously behind an image. Wigs that would shame Medusa; a succession of costumes all apparently raided from a call girl's wardrobe and designed to show off such indiscretions as posterior tattoos; a set that with its gnarled tree owes something to gothic comics, and, with its hydraulic lift, something to an automated warehouse; a repertoire of other people's standard material sometimes indecipherable beneath the shrill delivery; a band that covers every song with an unmelodic sludge; background singers experiencing advanced delirium tremens and dancers doubtless chosen to show off the slimness of the star's legs. This was Cher at Wembley last week, vainly attempting to hold back 47 years with a show that was all posture and no heart. Now the scene changes to Hammersmith to reveal a demure, androgynous figure, supported by soberly professional musicians, performing, with a piercingly affecting voice, her own songs of wistful longing and unrestrained sensuality, totally at ease in herself and in rapport with her ecstatic audience. This was kd lang, the Canadian country singer who has proved too big and sexually complicated for Nashville to absorb and has now expanded to take over the world. And yet the two pictures are not in complete contrast. Cher's status is ambivalent, too. During one of the incessant breaks, when she hops from thigh-length leather boots into fish-net body-stocking, a screen unfolds to fill with excerpts from her movies. You realise that they are all aimed at women. Her act too is littered with the slang of the male locker room. 'Up Yours', and 'Kiss my ass' she shouts at anonymously inoffensive members of the audience who rightly doubt the authenticity of her hair. Cher is the closet feminist. kd on the other hand is the playful coquette, demurely refusing to admit to Sapphic tendencies, hiding much behind her irritatingly playful lower case name. 'Tonight I'm finally going to come out' she teases in a manner far beyond the sensual capability of Cher. Pause. 'Yes I am a Trini Lopez fan'. Her sense of humour is as beguiling as her songs, she is still a genuine entertainer rather than a showbiz money making machine, but the joke is becoming a bore. Perhaps kd is the closet straight. Cher was at Wembley, kd lang at the Odeon Hammersmith</p>

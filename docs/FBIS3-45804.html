			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Wuhan, January 17 (XINHUA) -- The labor departments  of Hubei Province in central China are improving their service  for the outflow of superfluous laborers and diverting them onto  a correct track.    Hubei, a major agricultural province, has abundant extra  labor. Last year nearly 800,000 rural people left their homes to  hunt for jobs elsewhere.    To enhance labor management, an overall labor export  management network has been set up across the province, with  more than 700 employment service centers which are responsible  for surveys relating to rural labor resources, basic training  and establishing contacts with enterprises short of workers.    So far, the province has set up over 110 training centers  which run short-term training classes covering nearly 100 types  of work.    To reduce the haphazardness of labor exports, the province  has made efforts to improve its information service to supply  appropriate workers to enterprises in the economically vibrant  southern China provinces like Guangdong and Hainan.    In addition, the province has began to arrange for laborers  to go abroad for job opportunities -- chiefly people engaged in  medical, mechanical and manual services.    On the other hand, a lot of experienced laborers are  returning home to start their own businesses.    Provincial government officials said the province is also  reforming its own labor employment by improving its social  security system and fostering a healthy labor market.</p>

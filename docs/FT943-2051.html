			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / New benchmark worries UK pension funds British pension funds are just beginning to face up to the potential upheaval which could result from the forthcoming legislation on pensions. With the imposition for the first time of a statutory minimum solvency standard, funds could be faced with a new effective benchmark which excludes the overseas equities which on average comprise 26 per cent of their portfolios. Moreover the benchmark will often imply a weighting of 50 per cent or more in gilt-edged, against only about 7 per cent at present. Of course, UK pension scheme portfolios are not suddenly going to be emptied of global equities worth Dollars 160bn (Pounds 103bn). Nor are the pension funds going to beg the UK government to create more than Dollars 200bn of extra gilts. But over several years the asset allocation structure of UK pension funds is likely to change substantially. Recent investment strategy has been driven by peer group pressure and high historical equity returns, to the exclusion of liability-matching considerations. Thanks to the influence of me-too median fund performance benchmarks the typical pension fund is now around 80 per cent in equities. In international terms this is anomalous, as has been pointed out by the analysis Global Pension Fund Indicators from UBS Asset Management. The strategy has paid off before - over the past 10 years, the average pension fund annual real return in the UK was 10.8 per cent, the third highest out of 18 countries surveyed. But UBS warns that UK funds are now overexposed to equity risk. In chasing high returns, UK funds have largely ignored their increasing maturity - that is, they have proportionately more liability to pay pensions in the near term, for which gilts provide a safer match than equities. At a Goldman Sachs seminar last week in London an actuarial consultant, Mr Roger Urwin of Watsons, pointed out that in the past few years the asset allocation of UK pension plans has been converging even though their liability structure has been diverging. Now a reassessment looms. True, the actuarial profession has forced a compromise on the solvency test proposed last year by the Goode Committee. Instead of being entirely founded on gilts it will be graduated: it will be based on UK equity returns for liabilities related to younger employees and on mixed gilts and equities for those within 10 years of retirement, while only for current pensioners will the valuation be 100 per cent gilt-based. The standard will thus vary in its impact according to the maturity profiles of individual funds, but on average the equity content will probably be only 40 to 50 per cent. Moreover there will be no accommodation of the particular risks associated with overseas equities or property. Flexibility will not be abolished, however. A well-funded scheme will not be forced to match this new benchmark for risk. Some companies might raise the funding level so that they can pursue performance-driven rather than solvency-driven objectives. But the danger exists of a stampede by the herd from one benchmark to another. There is no early deadline. Pension plans will have until at the earliest the year 2002 to meet the solvency test, and attempts are being made to delay and water down the proposals still further. On the other hand, pension scheme trustees may reason that the later the strategy switch is performed the worse the terms may be. According to Goldman Sachs, sterling bonds will be the biggest beneficiaries, but overseas bonds may have a role for the diversification they can bring. The implications for UK pension fund holdings of overseas equities are very negative, but the change in the UK equity portfolios may not be significant. However, the distinction between domestic and overseas equities is surely becoming blurred. Already a few of the bigger pension plans with mature liabilities, such as the British Rail Pension Scheme, are shifting resources into bond portfolios. Most funds are waiting for a new consensus to develop, but the logic of the new legislation is clear enough: if the short-term security of members' benefits is to be improved the equity risk-tolerance of pension funds will be correspondingly reduced.</p>

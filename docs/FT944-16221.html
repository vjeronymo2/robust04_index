			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fibreglass breakthrough Owens-Corning, America's biggest producer of fibreglass, claims the first big breakthrough in the product for almost 60 years, writes Tony Jackson in New York. Its new Miraflex fibreglass, used for domestic insulation, has a quarter of the bulk of the conventional product and costs less to make. The result of years of research and Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) investment, Miraflex is hedged around by over 30 patent applications. The process fuses two types of glass into a single filament. As it cools it twists randomly, making a soft fleece similar to cotton. This packs into much thinner and lighter rolls, saving space for the retailer and reducing transport costs by 75 per cent. The process dispenses with two elements of conventional manufacture: chemicals to bind the straight fibres and ovens to heat and set the fibre after chemical treatment. This saves on raw materials and cuts the capital cost of the plant by 15-20 per cent, according to Owens-Corning. Owens-Corning Fiberglas US: tel 419 248 8000</p>

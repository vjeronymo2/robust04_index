			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All Arctic grayling in North America belong to a single species,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Thymallus arcticus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (family Salmonidae). Within North America, Arctic grayling are distributed throughout Alaska and across Canada to the Hudson Bay. Additionally, two geographically isolated populations of Arctic grayling occurred outside of Canada and Alaska in the contiguous United States, apparently as glacial relicts (Vincent 1962). One of these populations was found in Michigan and the other in the drainage of the upper Missouri River in Montana and extreme northwestern Wyoming (Scott and Crossman 1973). The upper Missouri River drainage population was the subject of the Service's finding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The validity of subspecific distinctions for Arctic grayling has not been proven (Scott and Crossman 1973). A status review was first initiated for the ``Montana Arctic grayling'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. a. montanus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), as the fluvial Arctic grayling of the upper Missouri River is sometimes known, by a notice of review published December 30, 1982 (47 FR 58454). However, this subspecific designation is not widely accepted (Kaya 1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The native Arctic grayling populations of the upper Missouri River were predominantly fluvial (Vincent 1962). Fluvial fishes are those that are permanently stream-dwelling. Adfluvial (also described as lacustrine) fish are those that spend most of their lives in lakes except that they spawn in streams. The only indigenous adfluvial Arctic grayling in the upper Missouri River basin are thought to be those in Red Rock Lakes and, perhaps, Elk Lake (Vincent 1962, Kaya 1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because fluvial Arctic grayling are adapted to life-long residency in stream environments, they are believed to be behaviorally distinct from adfluvial grayling. The adfluvial Arctic grayling was not under consideration in the Service's finding as it is believed to be a distinct population from the fluvial Arctic grayling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, in the upper Missouri River drainage the fluvial Arctic grayling was widely but irregularly distributed and locally abundant above the Great Falls in Montana. Varley and Schullery (1983) estimate that Arctic grayling of the upper Missouri River drainage presently occur in 8 percent or less of their historic range. Kaya (1992) estimates that the remaining upper Missouri distribution of fluvial Arctic grayling in 80 to 130 km (50 to 80 miles) of the upper Big Hole River may represent 4 to 5 percent of the historic range of fluvial Arctic grayling in Montana. Kaya (1992) arrived at this estimate by using available information to conclude that, historically, grayling may have inhabited approximately 2,000 km (1,250 miles) of streams in the upper Missouri River basin until early in this century. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only confirmed, self-sustaining remnant of the indigenous upper Missouri River fluvial Arctic grayling population exists in the Big Hole River and the lower reaches of its tributaries in Beaverhead, Deer Lodge, and Silver Bow Counties in Montana (Liknes and Gould 1987, Shepard and Oswald 1989, Kaya 1990, Kaya 1992). Fluvial Arctic grayling are concentrated in the upper Big Hole River above the Divide dam, although they have been documented down to the mouth (Liknes and Gould 1987, Shepard and Oswald 1989). The numbers of grayling in the Big Hole River have been in decline; recent estimates for a section of the Big Hole with the highest grayling densities were 69 grayling per km (111 per mile) in 1983, decreasing to 14 per km (22 per mile) in 1989. The population appears to have stabilized in the past 3 years at approximately 20 grayling per km (32 per mile) (Kaya 1990; Byorth 1991, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An additional remnant of the fluvial Arctic grayling population of the upper Missouri River drainage may occur in and around Ennis Reservoir on the Madison River in Madison County, Montana. Until the Service receives conclusive information to the contrary, the Arctic grayling of Ennis Reservoir/Madison River will be considered a remnant of the upper Missouri River fluvial Arctic grayling population. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

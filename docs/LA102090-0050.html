			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST BLOC / COLD WAR SURPLUS;  </P> <P> GETTING A LIFT FROM MOSCOW;  </P> <P> HUNGARY HOPES TO TRANSFORM FORMER SOVIET AIR BASES INTO COMMERCIAL VENTURES,  WITH WESTERN HELP.  </P> <P> Trying to cash in on one of Eastern Europe's few immediate peace dividends,  Hungarian officials are seeking Western partners to transform former Soviet air  bases into regional airports, air freight terminals or aircraft service  centers.  </P> <P> A government call for leasing proposals on seven sites being abandoned by the  Soviets, including one just south of Budapest, signals the start of an  aggressive campaign to make Hungary an important civil aviation crossroad  between East and West.  </P> <P> Air transportation authorities say representatives of major aircraft  manufacturers such as Boeing and Lockheed have expressed keen interest in the  site near Budapest as a potential manufacturing or maintenance center for  jetliners they hope to sell to the emerging East European and Soviet markets.  </P> <P> International air cargo movers are reportedly eyeing the same site, the Tokol  air base on the Danube River, as a major transit center for refrigerated goods.  </P> <P> Detailed descriptions of the sites and facilities still in Soviet hands are to  be made available next month, said Defense Ministry spokesman Gyorgy Keleti.  But the task of identifying exactly what is being offered is proving difficult,  as the Hungarians don't know themselves what the Soviets will leave behind.  </P> <P> During four decades of military occupation, Soviet troops made some substantial  improvements in the Hungarian properties they controlled, including what are  reportedly modern runways and hangars. Moscow has demanded more than $800  million for its "investments" in Hungary, and last month it sent negotiators to  Budapest to press its bid for compensation.  </P> <P> The Hungarians have, in turn, accused the Soviets of grossly polluting the  bases they occupied, spilling fuel into soil and ground water and littering  practice fields with live ammunition.  </P> <P> Both sides agree that Hungary has an uncontested claim to the actual real  estate. But Budapest argues that the environmental damage should even the score  for any structural improvements made by the Soviets.  </P> <P> "Hungary is not willing to pay for those improvements that were of military  significance but have little or no commercial value," such as bunkers, shabby  barracks and surveillance equipment, Keleti said.  </P> <P> Negotiations are continuing, but neither side is sure how soon they will be  able to agree on the compensation issue. There is a June, 1991, deadline for  the Soviet pullout.  </P> <P> The standoff requires some skilled poker-playing on the part of the Hungarians.  Bids to lease the facilities won't be opened until Dec. 4, so the Ministry of  Transportation doesn't yet know details of the projects being proposed.  </P> <P> The Tokol base has runways long enough to handle any aircraft, and its location  on Csepel Island in the Danube River gives it good access to shipping  throughout Central Europe, Keleti said.  </P> <P> Another of the bases, near the eastern city of Debrecen, has already been  turned over by the Soviets and is being used as a regional airport by the  national airline Malev and a new domestic carrier, Danube Air. But vast areas  of the Debrecen base remain unused and open to development.  </P> <P> The bases would need major investment to be brought up to the comfort standards  demanded by international air travelers, so Western airlines are expected to  continue using Budapest's two-terminal Ferihegy Airport for all passenger  traffic.  </P> <P> "We don't want to discourage any offers, but the bases are probably more suited  to manufacturing and cargo handling than passenger service," Keleti said.  </P></p>

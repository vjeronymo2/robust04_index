Among these conditions  is the protection of Palestinian citizens. This letter was  conveyed to the Israeli minister last night by the chairman of  the EU Council of Ministers, who left Tunisia yesterday, and by  the Russian deputy foreign minister, who carried a private  message from President Boris Yeltsin for President Yasir 'Arafat.    The chairman of the EU Council of Ministers had also met  President Yasir 'Arafat. After the meeting, the Israeli foreign  minister said he was ready to discuss any new conditions with  the PLO provided they did not contradict with the Declaration of  Principles. Peres added that some conditions included in the  organization's letter, like the release of prisoners, had been  met and that other conditions were unclear.    Regarding a likely Security Council resolution concerning  foreign presence in Gaza and Jericho, Peres said that was  possible in accordance with what had been stipulated in one of  the Declaration of Principles' clauses, but that presence would  not be an alternative to the Palestinian police force,  increasing the number of which will be discussed by the two  sides.

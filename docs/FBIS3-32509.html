			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" Program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F> and guest Osvaldo Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE magazine -- live  or recorded]    [Roque] Today, Osvaldo Rodriguez will discuss the  suggestions to increase prices as a method of absorbing some of  the excess currency. This is a topic arising from the process at  work centers, the workers parliaments, during which workers have  suggested increasing the prices of regulated products.    [Rodriguez] Yes, I believe these ideas refer not only to  products listed in the industrial-consumption or  food-consumption catalogs, but also to other products such as  gasoline for personal use. There are those who suggest we return  to a parallel market. That would be marvelous.    But how would we establish a parallel market? Resources are  needed to import products, resources, or raw materials in order  to produce things in Cuba, or a combination of these items,  which is how we carried out a parallel market. The parallel  market would be a good solution, but we do not have the  conditions for a parallel market.    [Roque] Nevertheless, there are some products today that are  still being subsidized.    [Rodriguez] Yes, there are basic products for human  consumption that are subsidized, and I believe that for now, we  cannot even think about increasing prices on them. I am talking  about milk. Milk is sold at 25 cents. Nevertheless, the  production cost of a liter of milk in Cuba, the cost not only at  the dairy farm, but at the marketplace as well, is much more.  That is a subsidized product. Obviously, today we are discussing  -- and I tend to believe we should subsidize people, not  products -- whether that is how things should be. I believe they  should. I believe we should subsidize people with lower incomes  so they can purchase that milk at 25 cents.    [Roque] I am referring to products that are not basic, but  other products -- we could say industrial products -- that are  priced very low.    [Rodriguez] Yes, I believe our pricing policy has been a bit  generous in that sense. In the world, raw materials have  increased in value, fuel prices have increased, labor costs have  increased in Cuba. The general salaries reform increased the  cost of labor. Yet, we remain static, with the same prices for  dozens of years.    [Roque] What should we do then?    [Rodriguez] Well, I believe a policy of prices in harmony  with the current situation should be considered. That is the  suggestion many workers have made. The problem is that we lack  products. Today, when you look at the spectrum of what we are  receiving through the official market, rum and cigarettes are  two of those products that we would not call "necessities."    [Roque] "Necessities" in quotation marks.    [Rodriguez] That is right -- in quotation marks. I believe  these could be easy targets, explainable and reasonable, for a  noticeable price increase. Some have even suggested eliminating  the cigarette from the quota because right now cigarettes are  being sold at three different prices: 30 cents for those  regulated by the quota; the other, which they call additional,  for 1.60 pesos; and when sought on the free market, another at 8  pesos.    [Roque] Could all these be joined together?    [Rodriguez] I believe they could. That is the suggestion the  workers have been making in the parliaments.    [Roque] This idea is for cigarettes. People may be able to  understand that, but there are other ideas, about rum, that  people have not been able to accept.    [Rodriguez] The problem is that we are talking about two  different products that should not be lacking in that market.  Yet there is a shortage. Way before cigarettes, I remember there  began to be a shortage of rum. At the time, they claimed that  there was a problem with the bottles.    [Roque] That was the first problem.    [Rodriguez] Yes, the first problem. Nevertheless, since  then,  we have seen other causes. The recent sugar harvest was a small  harvest. A harvest of 4.2 million tonnes, a sugar harvest that  left little molasses. When you have little molasses, you must  decide whether you are going to produce more alcohol or use it  for animal feed. Today, we need to recover our livestock, so the  decision is obvious. Now, when you allot a quantity to the  production of alcohol, you must maintain a level of supply on  the world market because it is a way to generate income. It is a  product that has a market, which we cannot give up. Renato  [Recio] discussed this not too long ago on a program on this  subject.    With a bottle of rum, we could probably buy three packages  of aspirin -- with just one bottle on the world market. We need  that money and the hard currency. At the same time, this goes  against the very production of the domestic market. The domestic  market has suffered, even though the international market has  also suffered because when you distill molasses, you do not  always obtain alcohol at a level of quality for that  international market. Then there are two or three grades. When  one reduces the amount of molasses distilled, one also reduces  the amount of product to be allocated for the foreign market.    [Roque] In view of the fact that there is little production,  there are provinces such as Havana City that maintain  distribution of the regulated rum, and it becomes an obligation  to the consumer having to guarantee that bottle every month.    [Rodriguez] I believe this is a mistake. My personal opinion  is -- and I believe we have come here to speak frankly -- that  this is a mistake. When you regulate, you are obligated. The  same thing happens with cigarettes because when you regulate a  product, you are obliged to maintain a supply per capita. You  give to the person who drinks as well as to the person who does  not drink.    [Roque] This creates a black market for rum and cigarettes.    [Rodriguez] Of course.    [Roque] This is something we discussed a few days ago on  this  program. Nevertheless, I believe we must also seek acceptable  criteria so that the new prices are reasonable, because we  cannot let some drink rum and smoke while others cannot.    [Rodriguez] Well, this thing about being reasonable is a bit  difficult. This topic on prices is very complex. When you think  that your salary is around 150 or 200 pesos and you have to face  a market to satisfy a vice or addiction, as in the case of the  cigarette, you need to buy it at an exorbitant price. This  undoubtedly might irritate smokers. As a matter of fact, there  are many smokers who are so addicted to cigarettes that they  become anxious. Their nervous systems are affected. There are  some who cannot even eat. it It is therefore a very delicate  subject.    I want listeners to understand the suggestion: If the price  of cigarettes would increase -- I am not being specific because  I have no idea of what the state would be willing to place as a  cap, or how much the consumer would be willing to pay -- this  price would effect both sides, the consumer and the seller. In  the case of cigarettes, if the cigarette quota was eliminated,  smokers could still get cigarettes. There would be a supply. The  same could happen with rum. I do not believe there would be an  abundance since there is not enough of the product for  abundance. But, if only those people who wish to drink rum were  to go to the market to buy it, then to some degree we could  solve the problem of demand. Now, I do not believe that  regulating these products by price would be legal or ethical, as  in a market economy, supply and demand. But if prices were to  increase slightly, we might be able to stabilize supply and  demand.    [Roque] Osvaldo, I am not clear on what you said about the  mechanisms of the market economy.    [Rodriguez] Well, I was referring to one thing -- how the  market economy operates. Prices are increased until they  regulate and stabilize the balance between supply and demand.  That is not what I am talking about.    [Roque] That is not the case.    [Rodriguez] I am simply saying that if prices were a bit  higher and regulation of these products was eliminated, we would  be able to achieve the goal of stabilizing supply and demand and  could recover some of the excess currency. If today you consider  the price a person who drinks rum is willing to pay for the  bottle, and the person who smokes for a box of cigarettes, you  would realize that there is undoubtedly a high level of buying  power, or liquidity, as it is commonly called in accounting.    [Roque] Yes, but not everybody has the purchasing power or  the money to buy the rum or cigarettes at the exorbitant prices  being charged.    [Rodriguez] That is why I am saying that they would not be  sold at those prices. The price should not be the black market  price. A bottle of rum should not be sold at 120 or 100 pesos.  That is hyperbole.    [Roque] Because then it would be a privilege to drink rum  and  smoke in this country, and that cannot be.    [Rodriguez] You are right. I agree that it should not be a  privilege. I believe it should be an option, and that everybody  should have access to these products, but at an increased price.    [Roque] Undoubtedly, we are discussing a complex topic  because these are suggestions that are being made at the workers  parliaments. It does not mean that these measures are going to  be adopted immediately. That requires a great deal of analysis.  Furthermore, not everything that is suggested in these  parliaments is going to be implemented. They are suggestions  that arise and are later carefully analyzed to determine at what  point it is convenient to adopt measures.    [Rodriguez] Soon, there is going to be an extraordinary  session of the National Assembly of the People's Government  [ANPP] and that is where policies will be established -- not  measures. Measures cannot be seen separately from the economy.  In other words, you cannot adopt a series of measures for this,  which we call internal finance, and other measures for the other  part of the economy. That is why the workers parliaments today  analyze two basic issues: how to increase efficiency at the work  center, and suggestions for national measures.    [Roque] You mentioned efficiency. If we were capable of  producing some of the products that we give to the population  today, at a higher quality, we could also charge a lot more.  This would be another way of collecting the excess currency that  is circulating on the street. I repeat, these are initiatives  and ideas that need to be analyzed because they are important.  Bread is an example. I would rather pay 40 cents for a loaf of  good bread than 5 cents for a loaf that is not good.    [Rodriguez] Not only that, we need to look at the raw  material that is invested to make that bread. The large  quantities of materials that are wasted or that spoil.    [Roque] Or the materials that are stolen.    [Rodriguez] Yes, the materials that are stolen. That  quantity  is also pretty high. But if they could use all the raw materials  and resources we have, efficiently, we could undoubtedly have  more.    [Roque] Well, we began talking about rum and cigarettes and  we ended up talking about bread. In this program we have  analyzed some suggestions regarding price as a method of  absorbing excess currency.</p>

But Western Contracts Constitute Its Principal  Capital"]    [Text] During recent months the principal events in  cosmonautics have not been occurring in orbit, but in government  offices. Indeed, as never before the fate of cosmonautics is  dependent not so much on successful technical solutions as on  the good will of the politicians.    Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister of Russia, and Albert  Gore, vice president of the United States, in December 1993  signed an executive agreement on joint work on the Alpha orbital  station. Late in March 1994 Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president  of Kazakhstan, and Boris Yeltsin, president of Russia, signed an  agreement on the manner of operation of the Baykonur cosmodrome.  Despite the outward unrelated character of these two agreements,  they are closely linked to one another and in the absence of one  of them the other becomes senseless.    Observers are unanimous that the final protocol of the  agreement with Kazakhstan is advantageous for Russia, which  succeeded in sticking by virtually all its interests. The  military personnel of the Military Space Forces of Russia will  even service the cosmodrome, located in the territory of another  country. The term of the lease, 20 years, with subsequent  renewal for another 10 years, also corresponds to the needs of  Russia. And finally, the lease payment of 115 million dollars  annually, instead of the 150 million asked for by Kazakhstan,  evidently will not be too burdensome for Russia because some of  the money will be recouped in space services.    Why during the prolonged conflict about Baykonur has Russia  held out this way for the cosmodrome, lost in the waterless  steppes, and has more than once placed the good relations with  Kazakhstan in danger? It is not at all due to nostalgic memories  of the glorious past of Soviet cosmonautics, which was  associated with this place. Administration of Baykonur is an  endless headache. Everything there is falling down, everything  needs major repairs. Specialists dissatisfied with their fate  are working there and serious troop mutinies flare up. But  despite all the problems only Baykonur can really ensure the  survival of Russian cosmonautics.    However, Russia also has the Plesetsk cosmodrome in  Arkhangelsk Oblast. Already long ago more satellites were  launched from the nine launch pads at Plesetsk than from  Baykonur. The Soyuz, Molniya, Tsiklon and Cosmos boosters, which  put ten kinds of scientific and economic satellites into orbit,  are launched from there. Most of the military satellites are  launched from Plesetsk. One shortcoming is that Plesetsk today  cannot service large boosters of the Energiya, Proton and Zenit  types. And it is precisely these boosters which constitute the  main hope of the space branch under conditions of a general  economic decline. It is precisely these boosters which are  attracting the attention of the Western partners of Russia and  promise a vitally necessary inflow of contracts and foreign  exchange.    During the last month Russian military people have  insistently advanced the idea of constructing a new cosmodrome,  "Svobodnyy-18," at a base of the former rocket army near  Komsomolsk-na-Amure. This idea has its advantages. First of all,  the geographical location, in latitude close to Baykonur. In the  case of a launch from the northern site at Plesetsk  10-15% more  fuel is expended than in the case of a launch into the same  orbit from Baykonur or from "Svobodnyy." In addition, the  closeness of "Svobodnyy" to the southeastern region, whose  countries have recently expressed increasingly active interest  in their own space research, is attractive. But Russia is faced  with building a new cosmodrome with a near-empty treasury. As a  result of the remoteness of the Russian Far East each stone at  such a cosmodrome, as stated by Boris Ostroumov, deputy director  of the Russian Space Agency, will be more costly than a diamond.    Soviet cosmonautics, however insistently the official  propaganda conveyed the idea that it had exclusively peaceful  purposes, at all times was structurally a component part of the  defense industry. It is precisely this which explains why  cosmonautics in the USSR never experienced difficulties with  funding and all programs invariably were discussed in the  Military-Industrial Commission of the USSR Council of Ministers.  It is not at all surprising that together with the entire  defense establishment cosmonautics also was plunged into a deep  crisis. By 1993 up to 40% of the personnel had departed  from a  branch where elite specialists traditionally worked. It is  impossible to estimate the scales of hidden unemployment; at  many enterprises a shortened work week has been introduced and  specialists are on unpaid leaves for a long time. One can only  guess about budgeted funding because the money is doled out  quarterly and is received with a great delay, already being  devalued. World-level scientists are making both ends meet by  concluding contracts for small household appliances having  nothing in common with science.    On the other side of the ocean the American space program  has  encountered its difficulties. Ten billion dollars have already  been spent on developing the Freedom orbital station, but it has  not been possible to arrive at a final version. Settling down in  the White House, president B. Clinton demanded a sharp reduction  in the funding for this ambitious project. In March 1993 the  idea was first expressed that there should be close cooperation  in space research between Russia and the United States, formerly  steering clear of one another. The swiftness in concluding an  agreement is attributable only to the desperation in which the  leaders of world cosmonautics found themselves.    The agreement, to run for four years, provides for orders  worth 400 million dollars to be placed at Russian space  enterprises. This sum guarantees work for 60-70 thousand  persons. Construction of the Alpha orbital station is to begin  in 1997; it will operate as a minimum up to 2010, which also  will enable Russia to receive advantageous orders in the future.  Provision is made for flights of Russian cosmonauts in the Space  Shuttle and American astronauts in the Mir. The first flight of  the Americans is planned for the spring of 1995 and it will last  for several months. It must be said that the access of the  Americans to the methods used in long-term flights and life  support systems is causing acute arguments among Russian  specialists desiring to keep their first place in this field.    At the same time, an agreement was reached between the NPO  Khrunichev and the Lockheed Corporation, very large enterprises  in their respective countries, on commercial launches of the  world's most reliable Proton booster, and a number of other  contracts of a more local character have been signed. In  concluding an agreement with INMARSAT on the launch of a  communication satellite for 36 million dollars, Russia broke the  monopoly on these services held by the French Ariane Space  Corporation, which demanded 60 million for this launch.    With each passing month it is becoming increasingly evident  that in the multiheaded Russian military-industrial complex,  which is in a state of rapid decline, it is the space branch  which is breathing easiest of all. Among many of the pioneers of  cosmonautics the prospects of the branch being dependent on  Western subsidies is a source of irritation. With an involuntary  sigh it is possible to answer with the words of Yuriy Koptev,  the director of the Russian Space Agency:    "Our dilemma is simple: either bring large-scale space  research to a halt with time or join in with international  cooperation, which, incidentally, the entire civilized world  prefers."</p>

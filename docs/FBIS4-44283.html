			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed JWI: "No Belgian Military Personnel in </F> Zaire Assures Brussels"]    [Text] Brussels, 27 Jun (BELGA) -- No Belgian military  personnel will be sent to Zaire as part of the logistical aid  which Belgium is prepared to give to France for its Operation  Turquoise in Rwanda, said concordant government sources on  Monday [27 June].    On Monday afternoon, the defense minister did not rule out  that "a few dozen men" who are part of a medical unit would be  sent in a few days to western Rwanda. The minister had said in  the morning that Paris had asked Belgium to give it logistical  aid -- more specifically, a medical unit -- for its Operation  Turquoise in Rwanda.    Another government source, however, indicated to BELGA that  it was unlikely that a single Belgian soldier would be sent to  Africa. In this case, Belgian aid will be limited to providing  medical aid, but without any human presence whatsoever.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> DRUNKEN DRIVER PATROL SET FRIDAY  </P> <P> Police warn that a special force of 15 officers will patrol the city Friday  looking for drunken drivers.  </P> <P> The officers will cruise all major streets in the city, including Harbor  Boulevard and Orangethorpe, Commonwealth and Chapman avenues, from 4 p.m. until  3 a.m., according to Sgt. Roger White, coordinator of the special enforcement  detail.  </P> <P> White said drivers who are legally intoxicated -- with a blood-alcohol content  of 0.08% or more -- have two options: They will either be released to the  custody of a sober relative or friend or they will spend the night in jail.  </P> <P> Friday was chosen for the beefed-up patrol because it marks the start of the  holiday week and would be a likely night for office parties and other events,  White said.  </P> <P> Special posters have been distributed to restaurants, bars and businesses.  </P> <P> "The whole goal of this effort is to save lives. That's the bottom line," White  said. "We want people to know where we are going to be and when, because if  that knowledge keeps them from taking that second drink before getting in their  car and driving off, then we will have accomplished our purpose."  </P> <P> Tri-Star Towing will tow the cars of intoxicated drivers to their homes free of  charge. In addition, the Orange-based towing service will continue providing  24-hour-a-day free towing through the end of the month to drivers who feel that  they have had too much to drink and can't drive home.  </P> <P> Drivers can call (714) 771-7111 or (800) 323-8697 and someone will be  dispatched to pick up the car and its driver.

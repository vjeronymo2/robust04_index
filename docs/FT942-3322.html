			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Battle for Scrabble maker reopened The battle for control of JW Spear, the maker of the 'Scrabble' board game, was thrown open again yesterday when a High Court judge released the company's trustees from any obligation to sell their shares to Hasbro, the US toy group. The judge ruled that Mattel, a rival US toy company, had acted properly in announcing an improved offer five minutes before the deadline for the operation of a clause allowing the trustees to be released from an irrevocable undertaking to sell a controlling interest to Hasbro. The court's decision now leaves the Spear trustees - who own 24.9 per cent of the company - free to accept the Mattel bid or any higher one. Hasbro was last night considering its options: to mount an appeal against the ruling, out-bid Mattel, or walk away. The company is certain to reach its decision before Thursday, after which an undertaking given yesterday by the trustees not to sell their shares to anyone else will expire. The dispute arose after the Spear trustees gave irrevocable undertakings on May 27 to accept a Pounds 46.9m bid from Hasbro which, with 26.7 per cent, has been the largest shareholder outside the Spear family for the past four years. However, Mattel responded with a Pounds 52m bid. This was announced at five minutes to midnight on June 2, the final day when the escape clause applied to allow the trustees to accept higher bids. The legal action centred on whether Mattel had fulfilled its obligations to make a public announcement of its offer. Mattel had informed the Stock Exchange and the Takeover Panel in the minutes leading up to the final deadline, but not the national press. Lawyers for Hasbro argued that the offer should also have been announced to at least two national newspapers and two UK wire services. Giving judgment, Mr Justice Chadwick said that when the escape clause was agreed between Hasbro and the trustees, it was likely that their intention was to guarantee the commitment of third-party bidders rather than informing the investing public. Spear, its trustees and Mattel welcomed yesterday's outcome.</p>

The volkstaaters, mostly farmers dressed in khaki uniforms,  gathered in small groups around the town to prepare for a  procession and rally later in the day. Local Afrikaner  Volksfront [National Front--AVF] leader Harry Schutte said the  right-wingers were planning to deliver a letter of demands to  Newcastle's mayor before their public meeting on Tuesday evening.    Their demands included agreement that Newcastle should fall  within a volkstaat and that a local Afrikaner town council be  established. The rally in the evening is expected to be  addressed by Volksfront leaders Ferdi Hartzenberg and Gen Tienie  Groenewald.    Mr Schutte said local right-wingers wanted to begin drafting  the boundaries of their volkstaat at Tuesday's gathering.    Local African National Congress [ANC] Chairman Mandla Cele  said his organisation would consider a consumer boycott of white  businesses should the Town Council act in favour of the  volkstaaters.    Handfuls of right-wingers in lorries and other farm vehicles  bearing slogans such as "we don't want to fight, but we will"  and "this is our volkstaat" gathered at entrances to the town  from midday. Organisers said they expected as many as 4,000  supporters to converge on Newcastle later on Tuesday.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Observer: Polling for May With their customary populist touch, foreign office mandarins are trying to repel efforts to replace May Day bank holiday with Trafalgar Day. Though the majority of those responding to the government's consultation exercise favour a new autumn holiday to coincide with schools' half-term, the FCO is wary of agreeing to October 21 for fear of reminding the French about the battle they lost nearly 200 years ago. Though it could simply be called the Autumn Bank Holiday, that doesn't have quite the ring the government hoped for when it wanted to abolish the 'socialist' May Day. Expect Tory back- benchers to settle for nothing less than 'Nelson day' at the very least.</p>

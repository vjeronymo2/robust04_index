			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> The Amazing Chain Saw Juggler of Venice Beach is working with automobiles these  days.  </P> <P> Selling them, not sawing them.  </P> <P> "You have to grow," explained Robert Gruenberg, 31, proprietor of Uncle Bob's  Park &amp; Sell in Redondo Beach. "You have to move on. . . . Besides, it's  rather hard to juggle chain saws now, with only one hand."  </P> <P> He was only kidding. Actually, Gruenberg felt underpaid during the eight years  he performed his unique act on Venice's boardwalk, depending as he did on  donations from passersby. And while he has appeared on the Johnny Carson show  and still occasionally performs stand-up comedy with his power tools, the fact  is he hasn't, well, cut it in the big time.  </P> <P> He's the headliner, however, at Uncle Bob's. The name is spelled out in neon  alongside a giant cardboard cowboy. Gruenberg rents out spaces to individuals  who want to sell their cars. They leave 'em and he acts as a middleman.  </P> <P> Neighboring used-car dealers are jealous of his low-overhead operation, he  claims.  </P> <P> "They go by and flip me off all the time," Uncle Bob said.  </P> <P> He added: "But that's OK. I got a chain saw."  </P> <P> Gruenberg's retirement has, of course, left a void at Venice Beach. Not to  mention an opening in the lineup of street performers.  </P> <P> It's only a coincidence, however, that police arrested a man over the weekend  after he allegedly broke into a Department of Water and Power building and  pilfered some chain saws.  </P> <P> The suspect was apprehended after he set off a burglar alarm. Police said he  had two chain saws and three power drills in his possession.  </P> <P> And he wasn't juggling any of them.  </P> <P> In our Dueling Signs competition, Justin Fishbein nominates the Bunker Hills  traffic light post at 3rd and Grand, which features a "Danger" notice just  beneath the box that instructs pedestrians to "push button . . . for walk  signal." L.A.'s pedestrians, a brave lot, mostly ignore the bottom sign, which  has been there for weeks.  </P> <P> Latest anti-L.A. salvo comes from monologuist/actor Spalding Gray, who told a  San Francisco audience:  </P> <P> "Health is the new drug in L.A. You go there and everyone is ready, ready,  ready! Nothing is happening, but they're ready!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nothing is happening in L.A.? In the last week alone, police have arrested the  man with chain saws from a DWP yard, another who was speeding on freeways with  a boa constrictor around his neck, and a woman who was standing nude in a  Laundromat and waving a toy pistol.  </P> <P> Like we always say at Only in L.A.:  </P> <P> You give us 2.2 minutes and we'll give you the weird.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> The L.A. River is used as a training ground by prospective RTD drivers, who  practice maneuvering buses on its dry bed.  </P></p>

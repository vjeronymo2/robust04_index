			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Old manual makes for modern management Sir, I found the article on Kaizen most interesting (Management: The Growing Business, January 4). My colleagues and I took particular note of the comment by Pierre Lecocq about 'lost disciplines'. My company in common with many others went through re-organisation during the 1980s and a lot of disciplines deemed to be overheads were removed or reduced. One of these was the work study engineer. This was a discipline which stood back from the day-to-day pressure and therefore was able to see the 'wood from the trees' and advise the management of poor layout, methods and achievement levels. We are now in the process of introducing Kaizen into our standard procedures: and guess where the guidelines can be found? In our 30-year-old work study manuals.

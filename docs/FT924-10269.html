			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Reynolds throws down the gauntlet: The Irish premier has dared his coalition partner to bring down the government WATCHING the crisis being played out in the coalition government in Ireland this week has been like watching two people play Russian roulette. Prime Minister Albert Reynolds this week set the country on course for a pre-Christmas general election by accusing Mr Des O'Malley, his industry minister and leader of the Progressive Democrats, the junior coalition partners, of having been 'dishonest' and of having deliberately misled a parliamentary inquiry into the country's beef industry this year. Mr Reynolds was defending his own record as industry minister in 1987 and 1988, which Mr O'Malley criticised last June, accusing Mr Reynolds of 'grave errors of judgment' in allocating export credit insurance to Irish meat companies for beef exports to Iraq. During three days in the witness box, Mr Reynolds repeated his accusation, saying Mr O'Malley had deliberately exaggerated the potential liability to which this export cover had exposed taxpayers. In effect, the charge accuses Mr O'Malley of having perjured himself. Yesterday however, Mr Reynolds acted as though nothing had changed and told the Dail (parliament) that he would be proceeding with government business as usual. He later told a party meeting: 'I have no difficulty whatever in continuing to work in government with the PD ministers. I want to categorically refute the suggestion that I want a general election or am attempting to bring one about.' The PDs have called upon Mr Reynolds either to withdraw the accusation or to sack Mr O'Malley. A spokesman for Mr Reynolds said yesterday that neither course of action was being contemplated. 'It's a question now as to whether they (the PDs) want to bring the government down.' Mr Reynolds has thus placed the bullet in the revolver, spun the chamber, pointed it at the government's head, and then asked Mr O'Malley to pull the trigger. The PD party was formed in 1985 after Mr O'Malley was expelled from the Fianna Fail party, then in opposition and under the control of Mr Charles Haughey. Mr O'Malley had bitterly opposed Mr Haughey's controversial style, and set out to create a party which would be seen as holding the high ground in political ethics. So it cannot ignore Mr Reynolds' 'dishonesty' charge against Mr O'Malley. A PD spokesman said yesterday party officials would meet party activists around the country at the weekend to discuss whether to continue support for the coalition. Any decision to withdraw would be announced next Tuesday, at the next cabinet meeting. A coalition collapse would be followed quickly by a no-confidence motion in the Dail, and the fall of the government. Elections would then have to be held within 30 days. The most probable date would be December 3, the date of a referendum on abortion. His denials notwithstanding, the events of the past week increasingly appear to have been a calculated move by Mr Reynolds to force the PDs out of the coalition. But why? One answer is that many activists in Mr Reynolds' party have come to view the six PD deputies in the Dail as the tail wagging the Fianna Fail dog, which has 77 seats. When Mr Haughey was prime minister, Mr O'Malley forced successive policy changes on his government by threatening to walking out, and even brought about Mr Haughey's downfall in January following a series of scandals, when a PD ultimatum to Fianna Fail made it clear that either Mr Haughey must go, or the PDs would. Under Mr Reynolds' leadership Fianna Fail is now much stronger in the opinion polls than a year ago, and Mr Reynolds has used that advantage to ignore the PDs on a number of key issues in recent months such as fiscal policy, industrial development strategy, the wording of the coming abortion referendum, and the government's negotiating stance on Northern Ireland. The PDs have swallowed their pride and their principles on each issue, and have grudgingly continued to support Fianna Fail. But the final slap in the face came this week at the beef tribunal. Fianna Fail aspires to become a majority government, an ambition which eluded Mr Haughey during his 12 years as party leader. Mr Reynolds himself has described the coalition 'as a temporary little arrangement'. The latest polls show Fianna Fail support at 50 per cent of the electorate, but when undecided voters are included their support falls to 42 per cent, less than the 44.1 per cent in the 1989 elections. It may be Mr Reynolds' calculation that with unemployment rising, high interest rates possibly continuing well into 1993, and a difficult budget next year, he stands a better chance calling a snap election now, rather than waiting for Mr O'Malley to choose the moment when the economy looks much bleaker. The problem is that if an election fails to secure an absolute majority, no party is now likely to join Fianna Fail to form a government. Fine Gael, the main opposition party, has this week been oiling its electoral machinery and discussing coalition strategy, but the Labour party, with 15 seats, has said it is not interested. Months, rather than weeks, of political instability lie ahead.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Anxiety over economy led to change of tack: Hosokawa has had to take a more pragmatic line For Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, who last month claimed that US-Japan relations had turned into a 'mature relationship' following his rejection of American demands on trade, yesterday's package represented a a return to more pragmatic approach in dealings with the US. Concerns that increased tensions will hurt the Japanese government and also the sluggish economy have overcome initial euphoria among government officials and the media which applauded a Japan that can say No to the US. Foreign ministry officials are worried that increased tensions over trade could harm the overall US-Japan relationship at a time when Japan's importance as an ally to US seems to be declining with the end of the cold war. The economic consequences are also causing anxiety. The sharp rise in the yen following the breakdown of the talks in February is squeezing exporters' profits and threatening an economic recovery expected later this year. Implementation of sanctions by the US would also deprive Japan's export-dependent manufacturers of one of their largest markets. And the increasing trade friction between the two countries is creating a political risk for Mr Hosokawa, whose popularity is waning amid mounting pressure from the opposition Liberal Democratic party to clarify his links with Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking company at the centre of several recent scandals and which provided the prime minister with a Y100m (Pounds 636,900) loan 10 years ago. According to an opinion poll by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, Mr Hosokawa's approval rate this week fell to 47.6 per cent, dropping below 50 per cent for the first time since his appointment last August. He cannot afford to provide the LDP with extra ammunition by failing to resolve the stalemate with the US over trade and jeopardising the relationship. However, the package appears to have failed to persuade the US to reopen the so-called framework talks on trade. Some US officials expressed dissatisfaction at the lack of specific figures for an income tax cut and for levels of government expenditure, which are scheduled to be announced in June in time for the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations. Although yesterday's package included no radical new ideas, US government officials and businessmen did admit that the easing of regulations and increased transparency indicate a move in the right direction. The measures, in opening up the Japanese market to US manufacturers, will in theory aid economic efficiency, which would be of key assistance to a mature economy set for slow growth over the next decade. Japanese government officials had hoped the package would allow them to prove that they can set voluntary trade policies after last month's bilateral framework talks failed to go beyond negotiations over binding import quotas. However, for the US, the programme only to have confirmed old beliefs that foreign pressure is the only way to get results out of Japan. Analysts expect the US to maintain the pressure over trade. 'The yen will remain volatile as it will be used as a policy tool aimed at Japan until the US sees actual results,' said stockbroker Jardine Fleming in Tokyo.</p>

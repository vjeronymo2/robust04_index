			<p>CSO     [Text] In less than one month forces of the Rural Mobile  Patrol Unit (UMOPAR) have found and destroyed in the Chapare  area 62 cocaine laboratories or ponds used for processing coca  leaves into cocaine base.    This information was provided by Mario Soliz, secretary of  social defense. At the same time he pointed out that in view of  this situation the National Directorate of Agricultural  Reconversion (DIRECO) has begun the eradication of illegal  fields of coca leaves in areas near the laboratories.    Soliz said that between 400 and 500 bundles of already  macerated coca leaves had been found, as well as about 40  bundles of leaves which were being macerated. In the same place  were found two wells, acid, permanganate, two containers, and  all of the other equipment normally found in this kind of place.    Soliz emphasized: "According to the report prepared by the  National Directorate of Coca Cultivation, a few meters from the  wells were at least 5 hectares of coca plants." There were 5.1  hectares of illegal coca plants in all, of which 3.7 hectares  were located near Senda Bayer and 1.4 hectares near the  community of Sebastian Pagador.  <H5>  Locations Where Laboratories Were Destroyed </H5>   Furthermore, Soliz explained that the 62 ponds and  laboratories were found and destroyed in 13 communities in the  Chapare area.

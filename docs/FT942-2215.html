			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: KLM to transfer Orlando flights KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday announced that it would transfer its scheduled service to Orlando, Florida, to a joint venture to set up with Martinair, the Dutch charter airline in which it owns a minority stake, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. Martinair will start operating KLM's Orlando flights on October 31, but the two airlines will have joint control over marketing and sales. The Dutch charter airline will also increase the flight frequency to Orlando to four roundtrip flights every week, up from the current three, reflecting a rise in demand by holidaymakers. Martinair, which already serves Fort Lauderdale, Tampa and Miami, has not previously flown to Orlando, which is home to one of the Walt Disney theme parks as well as other tourist attractions. The joint-venture service to Orlando has been made possible by the 'Open Skies' agreement reached by the US and the Netherlands in 1992 with the aim of giving greater access to each other's airlines.</p>

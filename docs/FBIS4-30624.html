			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Ujungpandang, KOMPAS -- The Indonesian Air Force  will soon procure some new 100 and 200 Hawk fighter aircraft as  part of its program to upgrade its weaponry system. The  procurement of the additional new fighter aircraft is to further  strengthen the air force. This is in line with its program,  which anticipates heavier responsibilities in the future during  the second 25-year long-term development program, PJPT II [Roman  two].    Air Marshall Rilo Pembudi, chief of staff of the Indonesian  Air Force, disclosed this on 15 June when he delivered an  address marking the 43d founding anniversary of the Air Force  Operational Command at the Galaktika Apron of the Lanud  Hasanuddin Indonesian Air Force base in Ujungpandang.    Air Marshall Rilo did not disclose the number of aircraft  the  air force will procure. Instead, he urged that necessary  preparations should be made to accomodate the fighter aircraft  when they finally arrive. All the necessary facilities such as  hangars, workshops, operational needs, including the ground  crew, should be maade readily available when the aircraft  arrive. He said: "Apart from this, the air force will continue  with its program to fully utilize all the existing weaponry and  equipment to their maximum operational capability." [Passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Observer: Hot stuff There are some privileges in running a television channel. Alan Yentob, boss of BBC2, was one of the first-night audience at Covent Garden last week which cheered to the echo of the first British professional production of Verdi's 'lost' opera, Stiffelio. Yentob was so enraptured by the performance of Jose Carreras in the title role that he is clearing his planned schedule this Saturday and transmitting nearly three hours of Stiffelio live instead. Wisely, Covent Garden Pioneer, the company set up last summer to video productions at the Opera House, and Yentob's hosts at the premiere, had been planning to film the opera this week, with a planned BBC transmission around Christmas time. This unprecedented speed is wonderful pr for the Opera House which has been criticised in the past for elitism. Not many more than 10,000 people will see Carreras live in his five performances as Stiffelio; now millions can join in Covent Garden's hottest production for years.</p>

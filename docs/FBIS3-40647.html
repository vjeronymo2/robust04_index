Members of both benches trooped into the well of the house  and created unruly scenes, compelling the speaker, Mr Gulam  Sarwar, to adjourn the house for the post-lunch session.    While the opposition members, mainly the Congress, rushed to  the well of the house, shouting slogans to press for the  introduction of the Jharkhand development council bill in the  current session, the ruling party members also followed suit and  vociferously demanded discussions on the Dunkel draft.    Significantly, the chief minister, Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav,  was  seen encouraging members of the treasury bench to join the  agitation in the well of the house for such a discussion and  press for a resolution, censuring the Centre for signing an  agreement on the Dunkel draft.    They accused the Centre of ruining the economic structure of  the country by accepting the draft under pressure from the  United States, the IMF and the World Bank.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Kings fall out over Jerusalem shrine IN ONE of those arcane and highly personalised disputes that swirl about the Arab world, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and King Hussein of Jordan find themselves in potentially bitter competition over renovations to Islam's third holiest shrine after Mecca and Medina. It is not clear who will emerge with the privilege of paying for repairs to the Al Aqsa mosque and other holy places in Jerusalem, but the Saudi monarch, whose personal wealth is put at Dollars 18bn, certainly has the wherewithal. The contest of the custodians of Islam's holiest shrines - the dispute owes more to past rivalries than present differences - began earlier this year when Unesco appealed for help to restore Al Aqsa's distinctive gold dome and marble facade on the site where the Prophet Mohammed, according to Moslem belief, ascended to heaven. King Fahd responded swiftly, offering Dollars 70m for renovations to all Islamic sites in Arab East Jerusalem. King Hussein, whose Ministry of Religious Endowments is still responsible for Jerusalem's Islamic holy places, felt obliged to try to match the Saudi monarch's largesse where Al Aqsa is concerned. He offered Dollars 8.25m, and battle was joined. Not that the two men are likely to be consulting each other. King Fahd has not spoken to his Jordanian counterpart since King Hussein expressed sympathy for Iraq's position early in the Gulf crisis. And worse from Jordan's point of view, Saudi Arabia has cut off aid that had helped to keep the impoverished Hashemite kingdom afloat. Behind the battle of the dollars lies a complex story of family rivalries that date back to early this century when Abdul-Aziz Ibn Saud, the warrior-founder of the House of Saud, drove the Hashemites from their strongholds in the Hejaz along the west coast of what is now Saudi Arabia, including Mecca and Medina. King Hussein re-opened wounds during the Gulf crisis when he asked subjects to refer to him as Sharif Hussein in memory of his great-grandfather, Sherif of Mecca, who helped inspire the Arab revolt against Ottoman Turks in 1916. The dispute among Arab royalty has been further complicated by Egyptian intervention, and more recently by the Palestinians in the person of Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation who is risking an unholy row with King Hussein over his apparent endorsement of the Fahd offer. Egypt's press reported this week that Egyptian engineers, working under the auspices of Saudi Arabia, were being despatched to Jerusalem to examine the Islamic sites. Jordan, which controlled East Jerusalem and the West Bank until the 1967 war, was not amused, and strong criticism was voiced in its press. Enter, at this point, Mr Arafat, who expressed his deep gratitude this week to King Fahd. 'In the name of our struggling Palestinian people. . . we would like to express our many thanks and brotherly gratitude for your wise decision,' he said in a message to the Saudi monarch. Cynical observers might suggest Mr Arafat was trying to curry favour with wealthy Saudis whose anger at PLO support for Iraq in the Gulf crisis knew almost no bounds.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Revenue loses Pounds 9m case over Nissan UK AN ALLEGATION that Mr Frank Shannon, former finance director of Nissan UK, and two of the company's advisers conspired to cheat the Inland Revenue of Pounds 9m was thrown out by a magistrate at Worthing, West Sussex, yesterday. After a 2 1/2 -day hearing, Miss Daphne Wickham, a stipendiary magistrate appointed by the Lord Chancellor's Department to deal with the case, decided that the Revenue had produced insufficient evidence to justify committing Mr Shannon and his co-defendants for trial at a crown court. The three defendants were: Mr Shannon, 58, of Brighton, East Sussex; Mr Brian Laventure, 52, of Haslemere, Surrey, a partner in Grant Thornton; and Mr Gerald Compton, 46, of Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, a partner in Kidsons Impey. The Revenue alleged they had conspired to cheat it over stock-relief claims. After reviewing the evidence the magistrate discharged the three men and awarded them their costs out of central funds. Reporting restrictions were not lifted. After the hearing Mr Shannon declined to comment, but his solicitor, Mr David Kirk of Stephenson Harwood said: 'We are delighted.' Last month Mr Shannon and Mr Michael Hunt, 58, of Hove, East Sussex, assistant managing director and deputy chairman of the former importer and distributor of Nissan vehicles, were sent by the Worthing court for trial at the Old Bailey charged with cheating the Revenue of Pounds 170m. In that case it is alleged that the money found its way to Mr Shannon and Mr Hunt after false invoices were filed for freight payments. Mr Shannon is on bail of Pounds 225,000 and Mr Hunt of Pounds 200,000.</p>

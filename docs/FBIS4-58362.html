			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received a report saying that a  military source in Sanaa has stated that northern Yemeni forces  deployed in the southern parts of the country have downed a  southern military aircraft. The source told REUTER that the  MiG-21 was downed by ground fire last night when a number of  southern aircraft tried to fly provocative sorties over the  northerners' 2d Armored Brigade in Lahij in south Yemen.</p>

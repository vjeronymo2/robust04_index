			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Letter: How ITV companies missed out Sir, The ITV companies are fearful of being taken over by other Europeans once the takeover rules are relaxed. It is worth noting that not a single British broadcasting company owns an interest in any continental European television network. The ITV network was founded in the mid-1950s. Commercial television did not arrive elsewhere in Europe until 30 years later. With almost arrogant disdain, British broadcasters have ignored the opportunity to invest in what have subsequently become very valuable franchises in Germany, France, Spain and the rest of northern Europe. Other European TV companies, such as Luxembourg's CLT, Germany's Kirch Group, Italy's Fininvest and France's Canal+ have all successfully invested outside their domestic territories. Granada did buy 3 per cent of Canal+ in 1987 but sold it a year later. Canal+'s share price has subsequently more than doubled.

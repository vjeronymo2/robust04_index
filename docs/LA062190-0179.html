			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NIGHT LIFE;  </P> <P> THE CLUB SCENE;  </P> <P> MUSICAL MISSION;  </P> <P> REGGAE PERFORMER PATO BANTON IS ON A QUEST TO SAVE THE WORLD WITH HIS UPBEAT  SONGS AND MESSAGE.  </P> <P> "Tell the people I'm bringing them lots of love," said budding reggae star Pato  Banton in a recent interview. This guy is so upbeat, he makes Mr. Rogers seem  like a brownshirt or Jack LaLanne a pessimist. Banton will bring his happy feet  to the Ventura Theatre Thursday night.  </P> <P> Banton, born Patrick Murray to Jamaican immigrants, grew up in the ghettos of  Birmingham, England. He found his escape through music, first as a toaster --  sort of a reggae rapper that has nothing to do with breakfast.  </P> <P> He appeared on a classic English Beat album, "Special Beat Service," with his  buddy, Ranking Roger, on the song "Pato And Roger A Go Talk." Then Banton put  together a band and began performing with some of his other musical friends,  Steel Pulse and UB40. He has five albums to his credit now; the new one, on  I.R.S. is "Wize Up!"  </P> <P> Banton is a man with a mission -- call it mission impossible if you will -- but  he wants to save the world. Hey, someone's got to do it. The title tune on the  new album is an impassioned plea for disarmament.  </P> <P> "I'm just a human being that believes in God," Banton said. "I believe that  music can definitely change the world -- positive music, that is. Negative  music, we don't need -- like all this heavy metal. This is devil worship music  and this rap music that's always putting women down -- we don't need that. We  need peace and love. The problem with the world today is all this man-made  stuff, this Star Wars -- everyone's saying 'I want power.' We don't need power;  we need peace and love. Only those who cannot comprehend peace and love put it  down."  </P> <P> Banton describes his music as "conscious reggae. Most reggae begins as  conscious reggae at its first stage but then the artists get all mixed up and  start doing things for publicity and lose their way.  </P> <P> "A lot of reggae has gotten electronic -- people are trying a lot of things to  get noticed by the media. Also, there's a lot of rudeness in reggae today, the  lyrical content has gone astray. If you want to get sexy, it should be left in  the bedroom. The original aim of reggae was to enlighten the youth and show  people a better life."  </P> <P> The Drug Abuse Resistance Education people would love Banton, well, up to a  point. One of his new songs is called "All Drugs Out." On this one, Banton  bashes cocaine, crack, LSD, heroin and also, cigarettes and alcohol. Part of  the chorus says: "Drug pushers in every area selling dope on the street corner  to even the young toddler -- these people should be charged with murder."  </P></p>

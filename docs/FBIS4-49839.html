			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Communist Party  leaders must combine theoretical study with practice and use it  to solve practical problems, a senior Communist Party official  said here today.    Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the  Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  China (CPC) and president of the Central Party School, made  these remarks at a seminar which started here today.    He told those provincial and ministerial leaders attending  the theoretical seminar on study of the Third Volume of  The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping that while they  are studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, they should make concentrated efforts  on two issues -- to master the theoretical systems of Deng and  to use the theory to solve existing practical problems.    "Only when one has grasped the scientific world outlook and  methodology can one judge the situation in a correct way and...  brush aside difficulties, and promote the reform and open policy  and the socialist modernization cause to a further degree," he  said.    He noted that while the general situation is good, there are  still certain problems and difficulties in China's social and  economic lives. Party leaders should have a clear idea about  that situation and seek a scientific way out through reform and  development.    He pointed out that party leaders should take bold steps in  probing for solutions to the existing problems under the  guidance of scientific theories.    "If we want to do all tasks well, and consolidate and  enhance  the existing good situation, we must upgrade our theoretical  level so that we can better take leading responsibility," he  stressed.    The present basic task for the whole party in further  studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics is to grasp the whole theoretical system  and use it to solve existing leading problems through profound  study and investigations, he told those leaders attending the  opening ceremony.    At present, the party should take effective measures to  solve  problems unfavorable to further reform, development and  stability as China's economy will keep growing at a rapid speed  and in a healthy way this year through a series of reforms,  aiming to build a socialist market mechanism.    He called on the leaders to build the Communist Party better  in terms of ideology, politics, party organization and style so  that the party will be more united, attractive and forceful.    Ding Guangen, member of the Politburo of the CPC Central  Committee and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central  Committee, hosted today's meeting. Ren Jianxin, also member of  the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, attended today's  meeting.</p>

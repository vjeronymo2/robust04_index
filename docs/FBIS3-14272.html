			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "New at Ten" program] </F>   [Excerpts] His majesty the king returned home today after  visits to Oman and Qatar and talks with Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id  and Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani. [passage omitted]    His majesty expressed satisfaction at his visits and told  the  "News at Ten" that everything was back to normal.    [Begin recording] [Husayn] It was excellent. I really had an  opportunity to have a very frank and open discussion with all my  brethren whom I met during these last few days in Oman, where we  have had excellent relations throughout our history. And in  Qatar, they were established many years ago on a very solid  foundation of confidence and trust. I think everything is back  to normal and our views are, I believe, much the same, as we  face problems and challenges throughout this region and in this  life.    [Reporter] Do you care to say anything about what happened  yesterday [23 March] in Hebron?    [Husayn] I was shocked to hear what happened on the news.  And obviously, we'll be seeing what details emerge. Right now,  not much details are available here.    [Reporter] Your Majesty, where do you see the future of  Jerusalem, especially with the latest events?    [Husayn] That's a very difficult question to respond to  immediately now. What I have felt over a long period of time is  that the holy places in Jerusalem -- important to all of us --  should revert to only the sovereignty of God over them.  Important to all believers. Beyond that, as far as the Muslim  holy places are concerned, we have called, as you know, for a  body that would represent all the different schools within our  Islamic world to share in addressing the problem. We are the  custodians of these holy places, hopefully, in the future. And  we've also encouraged interfaith dialogue between the followers  of the three great religions. [end recording]    His majesty also told Jordan Television that Jordan was  seeking clarification on the American position regarding the  status of Jerusalem. He added that Jordan is also seeking  assurances that nothing has changed with regards to Jerusalem as  an occupied Arab land. The king stressed that Jordan recognizes  no sovereignty over the holy city except that of God almighty.</p>

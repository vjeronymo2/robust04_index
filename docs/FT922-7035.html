			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Battle to keep Bonn in new fighter project: Daimler-Benz chief warns against pull-out THE GERMAN defence and aero-space industries launched a furious last-ditch defence yesterday to save their participation in the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), which is being developed with Britain, Italy and Spain. Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial group and chief contractor for the EFA through its Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary, warned that a decision to pull out would damage the entire German economy. 'The issues concern technologies which were developed at great expense and with great effort and have become key factors in an entire economy,' he said. The national federation for defence and aerospace industries sent an urgent plea to the key decision-makers not to withdraw from the project, less than two weeks before Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, is due to make his final recommendation to the three parties in the government coalition. The Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, the smallest partner in the ruling coalition, has demanded top-level talks with Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, to head off the expected negative decision. The party leadership has made it clear that the decision over EFA, which will be built mainly in Bavaria, is a fundamental one for the coalition, and must be agreed by all three parties. Mr Reuter, in a barely disguised attack on Mr Ruhe and his colleague, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, denounced 'short-sightedness, aggravated by rose-coloured, populist spectacles'. Mr Mollemann is a public opponent of the aircraft, and Mr Ruhe is widely reported to have made up his mind to pull out. If Germany quit the EFA project, and also cut its support for the two European manned space projects, the Hermes space shuttle and Columbus space platform, it would 'risk shaking the foundations of an entire industry . . . because of relatively small gaps in the federal budget,' Mr Reuter said at a press conference. The appeal to all the members of Germany's parliamentary budget and defence committees, to Mr Ruhe and Mr Mollemann, was sent by Mr Karl Dersch, president of the Federation of the German Aerospace and Defence Industry (BDLI). He said it was agreed in all the leading political parties that Germany needed a new fighter to ensure its air security, and fulfil its political contribution to Nato. It was not a question about whether to buy an aircraft, but about which aircraft to buy. He quoted a price for the aircraft including equipment, and value added tax, of DM98m (Pounds 33m), based on a 'fly-away' price of DM68m. If all the tax revenues due to the government from the manufacturing process in Germany were deducted, he said, the real 'net' price to the state budget was only DM29m. Every foreign competitor would be at least twice as expensive. The BDLI has calculated that 20,000 jobs in Germany would be at stake if the government pulls out of the EFA project. There would be a 'massive' threat to the very survival of many medium-sized defence industry suppliers, Mr Dersch said. Daimler results, Page 26</p>

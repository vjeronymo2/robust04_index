			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with German Foreign Minister Klaus </F> Kinkel by correspondent Bujar Muharremi in Tirana on 14 April --  recorded]    [Text] Dr. Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and deputy  chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, arrived at 1300  GMT today for an official and friendly visit to our country.  The chief of German diplomacy, who arrived in our country on  board a special German Air Force plane, was received by his  counterpart Alfred Serreqi and high-level Foreign Ministry  officials.    Upon arriving at Rinas airport, Kinkel gave a short  interview  for Albanian television:    [Muharremi] Dr. Kinkel, can you tell us something about the  goal of your visit to Albania?    [Kinkel, in German fading into Albanian translation] I have  never been to your country; this is my first visit at the  invitation of Mr. Serreqi. This is actually a return visit,  following the visit that your foreign minister paid to Germany  last year. I would consider my arrival here as an effort to  assist your country and an indication of further friendly  relations between our two countries.    [Muharremi] Will you discuss the crisis in former Yugoslavia  and the present situation in the Balkans?    [Kinkel] Of course, it is understandable that we will  discuss the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. This problem was  discussed in the German parliament yesterday. We have also  talked with the UN secretary general, who was on a visit to  Germany. It is clear that upon arriving in Albania, we will  discuss the situation in the region, since three-fourths of  Albania's boundaries border the former Yugoslavia. We will also  discuss the role that Albania plays in the framework of this  crisis.    [Muharremi] What is Germany's foreign policy regarding the  future of Kosova?    [Kinkel] We think the situation in Kosova, which is  characterized by oppression, should end as soon as possible. We  have also made it clear that a peaceful solution in Kosova is  necessary. This is what we will focus on during our talks with  high-level Albanian officials.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ex-Harland Simon chief faces charge - DTI appoints inspectors to investigate company's collapse THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry has issued a summons against Mr Roy Ashman, former chairman of Harland Simon, the control systems company which went into receivership last year. Mr Ashman is due to appear at Milton Keynes Magistrates Court on April 2 to face one charge of acting contrary to section 47(1)b of the Financial Services Act 1986. The charge alleges that on February 10 last year Mr Ashman made a statement or forecast to Mr Nigel Stephen Savage, an employee of John Govett, which was 'misleading, false or deceptive' and designed to induce him or any other person to enter into an investment agreement. It is understood that Mr Ashman met with Mr Savage on the day before Harland issued a profits warning. After the meeting, Govett bought 170,000 Harland shares for more than Pounds 700,000. The DTI has also appointed inspectors under section 447 of the Companies Act to look into the collapse of Harland Simon. The inspectors, from accountancy firm Robson Rhodes, are thought to be looking into a number of questions, first raised by the Financial Times, concerning the way Harland was run. Harland's relationship with its one-time subsidiary, Perfect Information Limited, is also under scrut-iny. A team of accountants from Robson Rhodes has been interviewing individuals involved in the collapse, and has taken away a number of sets of documents and transcripts of telephone conversations from the offices of PIL, which no longer has any relation to Harland. Section 447 inquiries are confidential and neither the DTI nor Robson Rhodes was able to comment. This type of inquiry is designed to be a fast track assessment of events. If sufficient evidence of wrongdoing is uncovered, the DTI can decide to proceed with a wider ranging inquiry, usually under section 432. Harland went into receivership in October following a collapse in profits and the withdrawal of part of the company's working capital by its main banker, Barclays. However, most of its operating subsidiaries were saved, and sold off by receiver Touche Ross.</p>

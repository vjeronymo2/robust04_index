			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun has called on the Greek  Cypriot administration to return to the negotiating table and  put an end to its policy of enmity. Atun noted that, as  stressed by the UN secretary general in his report, the  negotiations should be continued with patience for the problems  to be solved. He added that the Greek Cypriots should respond  in kind to the goodwill shown by the Turkish Cypriots, regarding  the confidence-building measures [CBM's].    Assessing the report submitted by UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali to the Security Council, Atun said that certain  points in the report displayed a realistic approach while others  manifested an unacceptable one. He described as a realistic  approach the inclusion of the Turkish Cypriot concerns and the  pronouncement that the negotiations will continue despite Greek  Cypriot announcements to the contrary. Atun added, however,  that accepting the "nondocument" of 21 March as a basis despite  all the Turkish Cypriot warnings and objections is unacceptable.  He stated that the United Nations should renounce this  erroneous stand which encourages the rigid and intransigent  attitude of the Greek Cypriot side, which actually never  accepted the CBM's, and which enables it to run away from the  negotiating table. Pointing out that the United Nations should  quit insisting that the "nondocument", which tears the CBM's  apart, be the basis of an agreement, Atun further asked the  United Nations to take into consideration the hostile activities  of the Greek Cypriot administration, which exacerbate the lack  of trust between the two communities, its armament efforts,  provocations, and negative statements regarding the CBM's. He  said that excluding from the report negative stands that  contradict the spirit of the CBM's was a deficiency. Atun  further stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side is insistent on  continuing the talks and remaining at the negotiating table  despite all these facts.</p>

In his words, the sides discussed aspects of foreign policy  and partnership with Western Europe and the United States, and  revealed similarity and peculiarities in their approaches to  partnership with other states. They agreed that partnership  should have an equal mutually beneficial basis and include  neither tutors nor pupils.    The sides agreed that Russian and Romanian development has  much in common. The Romanian state head said he favors closer  cooperation with Russia, is looking forward to a meeting with  Boris Yeltsin and hopes the meeting will be held this year.    Russia is also striving to consolidate comprehensive  relations with Romania which, unfortunately, have been somewhat  suspended, said Grachev.    Today's meeting of the Russian defence minister and Romanian  Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu stressed the importance for  boosted bilateral relations. The resumption and expansion of  bilateral relations and the use of years-long experience under  new conditions corresponds to the interests of both states, said  the Romanian premier.    In his turn, Grachev voiced the need for boosted relations  in  all spheres and praised the signed agreement on military  cooperation, which provides for Russian training of Romanian  officers, joint military exercises and exchange of specialists.  The planned interaction in the defence industry, especially  conversion, is of much interest as well.    The Russian delegation has left for the area of Ploiesti to  attend tactical drill of a mechanized armed unit and visit the  Peles King palace in the Carpathian town of Sinaia.</p>

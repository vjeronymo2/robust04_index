			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ana Maria Vintan: "General Mobilization in the </F> PDSR -- Adrian Nastase Is Preparing for War"]    [Text] Adrian Nastase, executive president of the  government party, is a person who, as a diplomat, is worth as  much as an army of generals. One can observe his dexterity in  keeping everyone satisfied and avoiding any scandal. However,  for some time, the unchallenged president of the Chamber of  Deputies has been going through difficult times.    He is being forced to change his tune. The first sign that  should have warned him was his mini-conflict with Ion Iliescu at  the Crans-Montana forum. The suspicions of some observers who,  at the time, risked declaring that the "punch" Ion Iliescu gave  his favorite was directed by other persons in the background  have now been confirmed. Well-informed sources from the  Cotroceni Palace admitted that, during that period, the  president was poorly advised by his advisers. The most  frequently repeated advice was: "It is too dangerous for you to  propel Nastase forward so much." At that time, Nastase was  supposed to mediate in the 'Arafat-Perez dialogue. Iliescu only  sacrificed his pupil for something for which Ceausescu would  have sacrificed his own right hand. What Iliescu did not know,  but his advisers suspected, was that Adrian Nastase would react  so violently. Once the ground was prepared, the rest was  child's play. Convinced that the executive chairman had to be  taught a lesson for his impertinence, Iliescu gave his advisers  and their men in the party the green light.    Shortly after that, reports on Adrian Nastase's houses  appeared in ADEVARUL. The file was urgently taken over by "jack  of all trades" Ioan Gavra, secretary of the Investigation  Committee. Initially disappointed by this attack which,  according to persons in his entourage, he suspected would come,  but did not believe would be "so mean," Adrian Nastase declared  a general mobilization in the party. According to people in the  know, the pacifist and mild chairman proves to be extremely  rude. However, his enemies have a great advantage, namely they  are one step ahead of him and they also enjoy Ion Iliescu's  support. In addition, they have been preparing for this  confrontation for a long time. All recent speculations about  reformers and conservatives in the PDSR [Social Democracy Party  of Romania] proved to be more than empty words, and the latest  compromise actions of Adrian Nastase are the best proof for  this. But, as we know, communists do not forgive, no matter how  much proof of loyalty one gives them. Their greatest fear is  that Ion Iliescu might change his mind. He recently gave some  signs in this direction, and caused panic among his advisers,  who urgently warned their party colleagues. Dan Martian [former  president of the Chamber of Deputies], who wants to regain his  position of president of the Chamber of Deputies, and Ioan  Solcanu, who dreams to become the party chairman, have  accelerated the pace and it seems that they have just arrived at  the last 100 meters.    A very well informed person told us that the recent changes  of direction in the PD(FSN) [Democratic Party (National  Salvation Front]) are actually the aftershocks caused by the  upheaval in the PDSR. Apart from a few loyal men in the party,  Adrian Nastase seems to have no one else. He must form  alliances. And whom could the former foreign minister think  about first if not his former colleagues in the cabinet. The  latest developments in the PD(FSN) are the extension of those in  the PDSR. The following statement of the man who told us all  this, naturally interested, is much too audacious to be ignored:  "There is only one small step from here to an alliance between  PD(FSN) and a possible faction of the PDSR." In any case, what  seems to be certain is that we will have a series of surprises  during the parliamentary vacation.    The first surprise will emerge at the PDSR National Council  that will begin deliberations as early as next week.</p>

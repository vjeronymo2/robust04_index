			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong It is easy to make out a bear case for Hong Kong equities. The market has finally begun to register disquiet over political developments: witness yesterday's 3 per cent drop after China objected to plans for a new container terminal. That is not all. Sino-US trade relations may be even more strained under the Clinton administration and any increase in US interest rates as that economy recovered would have to be matched in Hong Kong. These are all reasons to expect a pause in the upsurge that has seen the Hang Seng almost triple since its low after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. But it may be wrong to assume the market has reached a turning point. After all, US interest rates would have to move sharply higher before Hong Kong rates ceased to be negative in real terms. China may object to Mr Chris Patten's democracy proposals, but its post-Tiananmen interference with the airport project did little to thwart the regional economic development on which Hong Kong's prosperity increasingly depends. So long as the democracy quarrel rages, the main risk to equities may well be on the downside, making HSBC look particularly canny to have timed its recent offering to coincide with the peak of the market in early November. Investors with anything more than a short-term horizon may perceive a buying opportunity - providing the regional economy does not race ahead so fast that China is forced to slam on the brakes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 18, BNS -- Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas wished "many good relations" to foreign  diplomats accredited to Lithuania and thanked Western countries  for their support in the process of the Russian troop withdrawal  from Lithuania.    The president's annual meeting with foreign diplomats in  Vilnius Monday [17 January] was attended by 29 ambassadors and  charges d'affaires residing both in Lithuania and other  countries.    Commenting on Lithuania's steps toward European political,  economic and cultural systems, Brazauskas said his country does  not want a borderline to be drawn between blocs either "to the  east or to the west of Lithuania." He said Lithuania's official  request to be admitted to NATO does not mean that the present  state of relations with Russia and other Eastern countries would  be altered.    The president said "some things were done to improve  relations with Russia" last year, but a number of problems still  await solutions.    Brazauskas said he categorically opposes suggestions to  review the decisions made at the Potsdam conference, especially  those concerning the Kaliningrad region. As regards the region,  Lithuanian-Russian relations are good, he said, but added that  Kaliningrad must be demilitarized by "that country" (Russia).    Discussing Lithuania's domestic policy, Brazauskas expressed  hope that a stable government will be preserved because there  have been no serious arguments for holding early parliamentary  elections. In his opinion, the country's economy has stabilized  and some success has been achieved in the struggle against crime.    During his discussion with Reinhard Kraus, German ambassador  to Lithuania, the president mentioned his intention to visit  Germany this year.    Brazauskas also announced his intention to invite the  Ukrainian president to Lithuania and to visit Minsk himself.    A letter from the Italian president was presented to  Brazauskas by Franco Tempesta, Italian ambassador to Lithuania,  but the Lithuanian president's press service was unable to say  anything about its contents.</p>

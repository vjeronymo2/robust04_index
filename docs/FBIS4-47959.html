			<p>BFN     [Text] Since the beginning of May, Rwandans who had taken  refuge in Tanzania have been returning to their country.  Already 500 of them have been recorded arriving from Tanzania,  and their number is increasing daily. Today at around 1100,  more than 50 people crossed the border to return to the RPF  [Rwandan Patriotic Front]-controlled zone. They indicated that  others were on their way home.    All these returning refugees say they had fled the massacres  in Rwanda. They said that living conditions in Tanzania were  not good, due notably to a lack of food. This flow of Rwandan  refugees returning home to the RPF-controlled zone from Tanzania  might intensify over the next few days. Indeed, some of them  are afraid that they might again face the Interahamwe  [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development  militias], who are reportedly still occupying their houses, but  they should know that, in the RPF-controlled zone, returnees are  enjoying security. It would certainly be better for those who  have already returned to their properties to reassure the others  who are still afraid of the Interahamwe.    The RPF will also launch an appeal for them to return to  their country and properties, an appeal which is valid as their  security is guaranteed in the RPF-controlled prefecture.</p>

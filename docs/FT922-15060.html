			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Have printer, will travel The archetypal travelling salesman on the road with a portable computer often requires printing facilities, but all too often portability results in lower quality and reduced convenience. Now Kodak has launched the Diconix 701, a lightweight ink-jet printer which it claims offers high flexibility for anyone needing a printer on the run. The 701 weighs less than 6lbs, operates from battery or mains and is priced at Pounds 429 plus VAT. Kodak: UK, 0442 61122.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Augusto Pinochet, commander in chief </F> of the Chilean Army, by Maria Eugenia Oyarzun in his office in  Santiago "24 hours" after returning from the Czech Republic]    [Excerpts] [Oyarzun] How was your tour?    [Pinochet] Fine!    [Oyarzun] Was it an official tour?    [Pinochet] It was a private tour of a professional and  technical nature. I was invited by the Czech arms company  Omnipol.    [Oyarzun] Did you travel on a diplomatic passport?    [Pinochet] Yes. I was surprised to hear someone say I was  traveling on a false passport. How could I have done that if I  was carrying a diplomatic passport, and everyone knows me  wherever I go; some for better, others for worse?    [Oyarzun] It has been reported that you were harassed in  some  cities by people who were against your visit. Is this true?    [Pinochet] No, Maria Eugenia! No one confronted me anywhere.  [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] There were reports of demonstrations in Amsterdam.  Is this true?    [Pinochet] I did not see anyone. Later, one general told me  that five people -- just five -- were waving placards. Yet, the  networks of socialist and communist reporters around the world  disseminated some fabricated, magnified, or distorted reports.    [Oyarzun] Were those five people shouting at you?    [Pinochet] I was told that they were shouting, but no one  paid any attention to them.    [Oyarzun] I know you like history. What was your impression  of the new Czech Republic at this new stage without Marxism?    [Pinochet] One cannot say they are all democratic; there are  still some communists there.    [Oyarzun] Are there many?    [Pinochet] One cannot say how many, but I believe not  everyone supports democracy there. You must remember that the  process in the Czech Republic is still at an early stage because  the Czech and Slovak states were only created in 1990 following  different processes of change. Only since the "Velvet  Revolution" have they started to move toward democracy. The  cultural factor greatly influenced this process because the  Czech people, especially the ruling class, are highly educated  and well informed.    [Oyarzun] Tell me, what did you see there?    [Pinochet] I will explain. I talked with people who informed  me that before they had fixed salaries, homes, food, education,  and health care, while now they have to work hard to get all  this.    [Oyarzun] What did it mean to you who fought the communist  system to arrive in a country that was behind the Iron Curtain?    [Pinochet] It confirmed that I was right when I rejected the  communist system in Chile. [Communist Party Leader] Luis  Corvalan is wrong in his book when he says the leaders and the  corrupt are to blame, because the communist system is good. It  has been proven that it is not the best system and that is why  the situation is dramatic in socialist countries.    [Oyarzun] What do you think about the military factories you  visited in the Czech Republic?    [Pinochet] I visited factories that manufacture war  materiel.  It was very interesting.    [Oyarzun] Is it better or worse than ours?    [Pinochet] I was not there to purchase anything. These short  visits do not allow time for comparisons. Now is the time to  make assessments and to analyze.    [Oyarzun] Did you visit a firing range?    [Pinochet] Not in the Czech Republic, but in Switzerland. I  saw armored materiel and considered its main characteristics. I  saw that new technology has been incorporated. In principle,  however, I do not believe it will be of any use to us because we  must consider the economic as well as the strategic, geographic,  and technological aspects before making any decisions.    I visited Austerlitz, on the outskirts of Prague; the  battlefield is there. It was very interesting. One has in mind  the battles that took place there but it is different when one  observes the exact location. A view of the terrain changes the  images in ones mind. I will study these battles once again.  [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] People said you went to purchase guns. Did you?    [Pinochet] What ever makes you think that! I did not  purchase a single rifle or bullet. Purchasing guns is no easy  process. It is not like buying a shirt or a hat. I have to  discuss the issue with the different experts on materiel,  technology, and new systems to see if they are compatible with  our existing systems. We must thoroughly assess the situation  before making any decision.    [Oyarzun] Are we behind in technology?    [Pinochet] Yes. Regarding ammunition, for example, they use  metal alloy cartridges which are much better than the ones we  use.    We also visited the factory that manufactures the 30-ton  Tatra trucks that are used to transport materiel, personnel, and  supplies. Maybe we will buy a couple to try out. Nothing can be  bought without testing. [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] Do you think your visits to weapons factories in  the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and in England may awaken  suspicion as some Argentine politicians have stated?    [Pinochet] But I did not purchase anything! Does this mean  every time a delegation travels to inspect new aircraft engines  it will awaken suspicions?    [Oyarzun] In other words, your trip should awaken no  suspicion among Argentines?    [Pinochet] There are no reason for suspicion, I did not  purchase anything, I only assessed and evaluated.    [Oyarzun] Did you meet Czech or Russian military officers?    [Pinochet] No. My meeting were at an industrial level, with  representatives of trucks, ammunition, and pistol factories. As  you known, local enterprises sometimes act as sales agents. For  example, Famae [Army Ordnance] could act as the sales agent for  the C2 pistol for the entire hemisphere.    [Oyarzun] Are the weapons you saw similar to the ones  smuggled into Chile through Carrizal Bajo?    [Pinochet] No. The weapons found in Carrizal Bajo were  U.S.-made weapons with the serial numbers erased.    [Oyarzun] What do you think about the return to Chile of  terrorist Sergio Buschmann, one of the terrorists who smuggled  the weapons into Chile?    [Pinochet] Mr. Buschmann has a pending case with the court,  that is all. He will undoubtedly try to act well but the truth  is that he is a very poor actor.    [Oyarzun] Is he good enough for a secondary role?    [Pinochet] Not even for a third rate role...    [Oyarzun] Do you consider your treatment in Europe correct  in  your capacity as commander in chief of the Army?    [Pinochet] The treatment I received everywhere was  excellent.  I was treated very well. It was an incident-free working visit.    [Oyarzun] Did you meet politicians or military officers?    [Pinochet] I did not meet with just anyone who wanted to  talk  to me, less still did I agree to be interviewed by the media.    [Oyarzun] Why not?    [Pinochet] Because they publish things that are not true. I  did not grant any foreign sector of the media an interview.    [Oyarzun] Why did you not go to Russia?    [Pinochet] I never considered going to Russia, although I  have an invitation to do so. I was unable to extend my trip to  include Russia because I was running short of time. You must  remember that these trips are very tiring because one goes to  work and not to have fun. This folder contains the preliminary  report of my visit.    [Oyarzun] Have you given it to the defense minister?    [Pinochet] Yes, of course.    [Oyarzun] Would you say the trip was positive?    [Pinochet] The trip was very positive.    [Oyarzun] Did you see the British missile launchers?    [Pinochet] Yes. I wanted to see if it could be used to  transport our Lightning rocket.    [Oyarzun] Has it been decided that Famae and a British  enterprise will jointly build the Lightning rocket?    [Pinochet] No agreement has been reached yet.    [Oyarzun] Why not?    [Pinochet] We are talking, discussing the details...    [Oyarzun] What materiel do they produce in Switzerland?    [Pinochet] Contrary to what most people imagine, Switzerland  has very important war materiel factories. They manufacture  anti-aircraft machine guns, anti-aircraft cannons, radar, and  small weapons of very good quality. [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] Deputy Seguel has said that he would reduce rather  than increase Carabineros' salaries. Can the salaries of the  Armed Forces and Carabineros be reduced at all?    [Pinochet] Officers and military personnel do wonders to  survive! I try to improve their situation with social benefits,  with provisions, but their salaries are extremely tight and are  really not enough.    [Oyarzun] How much does a newly enrolled corporal earn.    [Pinochet] Some 80,000 pesos per month, but from this amount  they have deductions.    [Oyarzun] Is the situation the same for the Carabineros?    [Pinochet] It is the same system. All Armed Forces personnel  are on the same salary scale, they all have the same guarantees.  In other words, the situation is very difficult. [passage  omitted]    [Oyarzun] Are you and Defense Minister Edmundo Perez still  on  "honeymoon"?    [Pinochet] I have a good relationship with Minister Perez. I  was a friend of his father and have great respect for the  minister. I was commander of the Santiago Garrison when VOP  [People's Organized Vanguard] extremists killed Mr. Perez  Zujovic; I chased these men for five days until I found them at  the Chile racetrack. Troops surrounded them, while members of  the Investigative Police arrested them. We are not on  "honeymoon." You know honeymoons end and the difficulties  begin. I have a good relationship with the defense minister and  believe we will continue to do so.    [Oyarzun] Is your relationship with War Under Secretary  Jorge  Burgos also good?    [Pinochet] Yes, I think he is very pleasant and efficient.  [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] How is the modernization of the Army going? I know  you are determined to complete it.    [Pinochet] My trip was related to that process. I think we  made progress. You will hear what I have to say about it during  my conference on the subject in August.    [Oyarzun] Are you bothered about all the attacks and  criticisms on you?    [Pinochet] It is like a disease. If it appears on the hand,  for example, the body generates antibodies to get rid of it. I  am immune to these attacks. Some people like to talk, and as it  sells newspapers, they take advantage of it. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Citicorp spins off venture side CITICORP, the US banking group, has spun off its European venture capital activities into an independent company, CVC Capital Partners. CVC will be wholly owned by Citicorp's existing European management team. This move will free the venture capital operations from US banking regulations which have in the past limited the scale of their activities. As a first move, CVC intends to raise at least Dollars 150m (Pounds 100m) of new finance on top of the Dollars 550m already available. The bank has specialised in financing medium-sized and large management buy-outs, often involving businesses with activities in several countries. Citicorp has signed a long-term agreement to provide funds to CVC, said Mr Michael Smith, managing director of venture capital operations. He declined to disclose exact figures but the Dollars 550m package available comprises this Citicorp commitment, the existing venture capital portfolio and Dollars 150m of funds raised two years ago. The creation of a separate venture capital management company will allow 'some enhancement' of the earnings of the management team, said Mr Smith. Bank-owned venture capital companies frequently have difficulty matching the remuneration packages of independent funds though Citicorp had a competitive earnings package, he said. Nine of Citicorp's 36 European venture capital executives will become shareholders in the new company. Mr Peter Burnim, managing director of corporate finance at Citicorp, said the new arrangement brought its venture capital business into line with common industry practice.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JACKSON DRIVE EXTENSION STIRS DEBATE  </P> <P> Deer, coyote, bobcats and endangered birds roam freely in the 5,700-acre  Mission Trails Regional Park on the eastern boundary of San Diego. It's a  pocket of wildlife covered by the rare coastal sage scrub where hikers and bird  watchers can enjoy the serenity of the pristine mountain park.  </P> <P> City officials have proposed a 2.4-mile extension of Jackson Drive through that  wilderness parkland, and amateur naturalist Gary Suttle believes that the  proposed four-lane road could jeopardize what is now considered the nation's  largest expanse of natural open space within city limits.  </P> <P> "When you walk in there, it's a whole different world. It's as if you're not in  the sixth-largest city anymore," said Suttle, who lives southwest of the park  in Allied Gardens.  </P> <P> But many neighbors of the park said they have had enough of the traffic  congestion on residential streets in the Allied Gardens area from commuters  racing to find faster ways to busy Mission Gorge Road and Interstate 8 and from  there north on Interstate 15. Those who favor the road say the extension will  provide some relief, as well as provide greater access to the interior of the  park.  </P> <P> Jim Madaffer, chairman of the Tierrasanta Community Council, which favors the  extension, said the road provides a vital north-south link for the city. "Many  of the concerns from the opposition are from the emotional aspect. They aren't  looking at a San Diego in the future," he said.  </P> <P> San Diego Councilwoman Judy McCarty, who represents that area, is pushing to  begin construction on the extension, which cuts through the western part of the  park, by the end of next year. She said it will relieve traffic congestion and  provide commuters in that area a direct link to California 52, once it is  extended eastward to Santee.  </P> <P> "This road will also lead into the interior of the park. It will open up the  park for everyone, not just for the local residents and Sierra Club," McCarty  said.  </P> <P> Sierra Club members and some residents living in the communities that wrap  around the park are concerned over the project's high price tag and the  environmental damage it may do to the park.  </P> <P> The project is estimated to cost nearly $71 million, including the cost of the  debt service, said Robert Radlow, chairman of the grass-roots organization  Citizens Against Jackson Drive Extension.  </P> <P> He said he also doubts that the extension will do much to relieve the area's  traffic congestion during peak hours. The extension of Jackson Drive, which now  dead-ends at Mission Gorge Road, would only divert 4,000 cars from Mission  Gorge Road, which now carries 37,000 to 46,000 cars a day. Radlow said the road  will also bring pollution and noise to the park.  </P> <P> "You can't have peace and tranquility with all that air and noise pollution.  Who wants to hike with a four-lane highway above you?" Radlow asked.  </P> <P> McCarty said the extension would carry about 20,000 cars a day, since it will  be the only northern connection east of Interstate 15.  </P> <P> Radlow and other opponents of the extension point to a 1988 study conducted by  the San Diego Assn. of Governments when they talk of the extension proposal.  Sandag said the proposed Jackson Drive extension is by far the least effective  solution to the traffic problems, said Janet Esser, Radlow's wife and a newly  elected member to the San Carlos Area Council. The San Carlos council formally  opposes the project.  </P> <P> McCarty said plans for the extension have been a part of the city's General  Plan since 1960, and the recent uproar against the project has come as a  surprise to her. "I've kept the people informed, and they told me they wanted  this road," she said. A petition drive has already gathered 500 signatures of  people favoring the extension, she said.  </P> <P> The extension will serve as a northern connection for the Navajo communities,  which include Grantville, San Carlos, Allied Gardens and Del Cerro, McCarty  said.  </P> <P> Barbara Massey, who sits on the San Carlos council and Navajo Community  Planners, said the road will be a massive "cut-and-fill" project. "The road  will not blend in. It has not been designed to curve naturally through the  valley," she said.  </P> <P> "Canyons will be filled in and hilltops whacked off," she said, noting that the  project will remove 2 million cubic yards of earth and require 1-million cubic  yards of dirt for fill.  </P> <P> Included in the project is a bridge that would rise 250 feet and span 1,600  feet over the San Diego River, which cuts through the park.  </P> <P> Allied Gardens resident John Todd said he supports the extension because  streets in his community, such as Waring Road, Princess View Drive, Twain  Avenue and Zion Avenue, which were never intended to carry heavy traffic, are  being used by commuters as access streets to Interstate 8.  </P> <P> "If Jackson Drive is opened up, those people won't use our residential roads  anymore," Todd said. He said the congested roads have also posed a safety  problem, especially for area schools.  </P> <P> Todd and other supporters of the extension are also using the park as a  rallying point, saying the road will open the interior of the park to all  citizens. A visitor information center and campground will be built near  Hollins Lake in the northeastern corner of the park, McCarty said, and should  open within the next year.  </P> <P> Before construction crews can begin to break ground on the road, an  environmental impact report, which was supposed to be released in December,  must be certified by the City Council, which must then vote to adopt the route,  McCarty said.  </P> <P> Opponents of the road hope the environmental report will block the project,  noting that the park is a setting for riparian, or stream-side, vegetation,  such as willows, cottonwood and sycamore. It is also home to birds like the  endangered least Bell's vireo and the threatened yellow-throat, Suttle said. He  said the coastal sage scrub contains aromatic shrubs such as the California  sagebrush and laurel sumac, which turn emerald green after winter rains.  </P> <P> "The land was purchased by the city with bond money for a park, not to put in a  transportation corridor," said Linda Michael of the San Diego Sierra Club.  "These plants and animals are treasures that we have. We must protect them."  </P> <P> April Boling is a member of the Navajo Planners and said the group is waiting  for the environmental report to be released before it announces its position on  the debate, although she said she would like to see the park preserved.  </P> <P> But, she is wary of the report because it is being conducted by the same group  that is designing the extension, P&amp;D Technologies. Lou Ann Holmes,  assistant to McCarty, said it is standard for the "designers to coordinate the  environmental impact report to make sure the most environmentally sound design  is used for the road."  </P> <P> The road extension will be funded by a lion's share of a half-cent sales tax  that voters approved in 1987 for a list of road improvements.  </P> <P> Radlow said the costly extension is unnecessary because, 2 miles east on  Mission Gorge Road, at Mast Boulevard, construction is under way to join  California 52 and California 125, serving the same function as the extension.  McCarty said that project will take 10 years to complete, and commuters need a  direct access road as soon as possible.  </P></p>

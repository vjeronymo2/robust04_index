			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Keating's opponents overhaul policies AUSTRALIA'S conservative opposition parties launched their campaign for the next federal election yesterday by publishing a radical overhaul of their proposed economic and social policies. The announcement followed a dramatic recovery of popularity by the ruling Labor government, which leads the conservatives by about 12 points in the polls, compared to a deficit of 12 points in October. Mr John Hewson, the conservative leader, acknowledged that he had been unable to win widespread public support for the opposition's Fightback manifesto, launched in November last year. The revised version retains original proposals for a goods and services tax (GST), tariff cuts, labour market deregulation and cuts in public spending to balance the budget. However, the opposition has responded to criticism by church and social welfare groups by exempting basic foodstuffs and child-care from the GST, dropping plans to cut unemployment benefits, raising family allowances, and deferring cuts to job creation programmes. The revised package also includes cuts in personal income taxes, ADollars 3bn (Pounds 1.3bn) for public spending on infrastructure projects, and a streamlined depreciation regime - swiftly welcomed by business organisations. The increased spending would be financed by bringing forward the proposed privatisation of Australia and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, the government-owned carrier, which analysts say could raise ADollars 20bn. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, dismissed the revisions as a desperate gamble. He said the spending and revenue estimates did not add up, and claimed the Australian capital markets would be unable to digest the proposed privatisation programme. Mr Keating is believed to be working on an economic statement to be delivered early next year, possibly as a curtain-raiser to an election in February or March. He said he would not try to match the tax cuts offered by the conservatives.</p>

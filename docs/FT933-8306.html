			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Japanese face rice shortfall JAPAN'S unseasonally wet summer could mean a rice shortage, necessitating imports for the first time in 10 years, industry analysts said yesterday, Reuter reports from Tokyo. They forecast a shortfall of 50,000-250,000 tonnes and warn that Japan may need to import that amount by the end of the year. However, an Agriculture Ministry official in charge of state-controlled food imports said there was no plan to import rice. The analysts expect only about 250,000 tonnes to be rolled over from 1992 stocks, which in turn have been depleted by a series of typhoons. Japan has not imported rice since the government allowed in 150,000 tonnes of South Korean rice in 1984. Tokyo bans commercial imports of rice to protect local farmers and to ensure national self-sufficiency in the staple food. The government argues that self-sufficiency is vital for national security and has rejected a Gatt proposal to remove the barrier. This has been one of the obstacles to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, which started in 1986.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEN. CRANSTON  </P> <P> The right wing is certainly out to get Sen. Cranston.  </P> <P> Sure (Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan President Charles), Keating contributed to  Cranston's election campaign.  </P> <P> Keating gave to both parties. He gave to Republican Gov. George Deukmejian.  Wasn't there a state official to check on savings and loans? If so, where was  he?  </P> <P> What about M. Danny Wall, appointed by President Reagan to keep an eye on  federal savings and loans? Obviously he didn't. And he didn't need campaign  money. He was appointed.  </P> <P> Senators need campaign money. It's the American way -- the only way senators  and presidents ever get elected.  </P> <P> Wall probably knew that President Reagan was against government checking up on  business.  </P> <P> DICK WORSFOLD  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

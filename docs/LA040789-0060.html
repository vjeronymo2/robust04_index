			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBERTI WILL SPONSOR CITIZEN ACTIVIST'S FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE BILL  </P> <P> Ralph Morrell, the self-styled citizen activist who for a decade has pestered  the Legislature to correct abuses and excesses, on Thursday recruited Senate  President Pro Tem David A. Roberti for his crusade.  </P> <P> Appearing a bit self-conscious at a press conference where he sat shoulder to  shoulder with Morrell, Roberti (D-Los Angeles) announced that he has agreed to  sponsor legislation to more fully disclose how much of the taxpayers' money the  lawmakers spend on themselves.  </P> <P> Roberti acknowledged the single-minded "tenacity" of Morrell and said he and  his erstwhile adversary had reached a "consensus" that provided "some  concessions to citizen concerns about openness."  </P> <P> "We have a duty . . . to recognize that the Legislature is not the legislators'  thing but the citizens' thing," Roberti said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pressure on Legislature  </P> <P> Although Roberti did not mention it, his authorship of the Morrell bill comes  as the Legislature is under pressure to take substantive steps to improve its  image and credibility in the wake of a 3-year-old FBI investigation into  alleged political corruption.  </P> <P> Morrell, 71, is a retired U.S. Navy warrant officer turned citizen activist who  patrols the hallways of the Capitol, striking out at what he sees as abuses. He  has sued the Legislature on occasion and has even launched some quixotic ballot  initiative efforts.  </P> <P> Although he has not won every fight, he has scored some impressive victories.  It was Morrell in the early 1980s who pressured the Assembly to abolish its  practice of "ghost" voting and vote switching.  </P> <P> In ghost voting, an Assembly member would activate the electronic voting button  of an absent colleague. Vote switching allowed an Assembly member to switch his  vote in the official Assembly minutes to "yes" or "no" after the outcome was  announced, provided the switch did not change the outcome.  </P> <P> At another point, Morrell pressured the Assembly to quit providing free ice  cream bars and other treats to its members.  </P> <P> But it was the Legislature's own expenditures and the lack of specifics  provided to the public on how the money was spent that angered Morrell the  most. He has deplored the Legislature's budget as a "slush fund" and denounced  the lawmakers as "scoundrels."  </P> <P> Historically, the Legislature has jealously guarded its own expenditures, which  this year total $160 million and are expected to reach $171.7 million next  year.  </P> <P> Although the Senate and Assembly make the spending reports public, they are  usually generalized in broad categories without breaking out individual items,  such as meals or first-class travel. Also, there is no deadline for disclosing  the audits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Informal Audits  </P> <P> Legislative spending is not required to be audited by the state controller, the  keeper of the state's checkbook and the official who is authorized to reject  payment of expenses he believes to be unnecessary or improper.  </P> <P> Roberti indicated that the state controller already conducts informal audits of  the Legislature's spending. Under the bill, the controller will be required to  make an official audit of legislative spending and make a public report no  later than Nov. 30 of the next year. When reporters noted that the spending  reports would be about 2 years old when released, Roberti said he would  "consider" making them more timely.  </P> <P> In addition, the reports would detail many of the issues Morrell has complained  about for so long -- taxpayer-financed meals, expenses incurred in attending  ceremonies, first-class travel and the costs of frequent office remodeling.  </P> <P> Morrell congratulated Roberti on his "statesmanship and leadership," saying the  Senate leader has the "ability to say no as well as the ability to say yes."  </P> <P> Roberti conceded to reporters that some features of the bill will face  opposition from some legislators, if for no other reason than that Morrell  wrote them.  </P></p>

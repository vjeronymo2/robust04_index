			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Self-regulation of press sought The Association of British Editors, the Guild of Editors and the International Press Institute yesterday launched a document detailing the case against new legal restrictions on the media. In the document - Media Freedom and Media Regulation - the three organisations identify 46 statutes which they say inhibit reporting, list the media's self-regulation measures and argue that there are potential dangers in further restrictions on the public's right to know. Mr James Bishop, ABE chairman, says in his preface to the document that 'there is continuing difficulty in reconciling the individual's right to privacy and the public's right to know. 'But the legal constraints already in place, together with the latest steps in self-regulation, provide sufficient protection of privacy and are more than adequate to meet current parliamentary concern.' The document was drafted by Prof Hugh Stephenson, professor of journalism at London's City University, after a meeting of more than 60 newspaper, magazine, radio and television editors last autumn. The meeting followed pressure for legislation to make invasion of privacy a civil wrong, and the replacement of the present system of press self-regulation centred on the Press Complaints Commission. The paper gives examples of news items it believes could have been barred by legislation, including coverage of the Lyme Bay canoeing disaster, reports of the acceptance of a foreign holiday from a prominent Palestinian by Mr David Mellor, former heritage secretary, World in Action's investigation of the Birmingham Six and the publication of Mr Michael Mates's letter to Mr Asil Nadir. Mr Bishop said self-regulation had been developing all the time. 'We believe it is now working very effectively.' Privacy legislation could not stop abuses, he said. 'There are laws against murder but murders still happen.' Self-regulation meant editors sitting down together to try to prevent any problems.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by DUMA Editor in Chief Stefan Prodev: "Harsh </F> Thoughts"]    [Text] Although its date is not yet fixed, the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] congress draws near. One senses this  especially well in the local organizations that are preparing or  holding their accountability-election meetings. Spirits are  gradually being stirred, and thousands of Socialists are  attempting to look into the future. They feel simultaneously  attracted and alarmed by the idea, because the times are complex  and changeable. On the one hand, hopes are high, and on the  other, black clouds are gathering. Many want a sea change  within both the party and society, whereas others fear any  change at all. This brings people into confrontation, whether  they want it or not, and casts them into conflict.    Of course, the conflicts should not be dramatized, whatever  they may be. In times like these they are quite natural and  mirror the essence of life. The BSP is still a party with  traditions that have not outlived their time, a party of painful  restructuring that fires it with different kinds of energy. It  still wavers between recollections of the past and the present  day, filled with glorious dreams and new political plans. There  can be no doubt that this is what holds it in a state of inner  tension, which, combined with crude antisocialist attacks from  outside, makes it face major tests. However, despite everything,  the party remains whole; despite the waves that rock the party's  ship, it sails on toward the promised land. Those who expect  the party to collapse will surely be disappointed, not because  the ship is threatened by storms and leaks, but because its crew  has a clear common goal, despite their sentiments and quarrels.  This is the goal of social justice, of spiritual revival, of  saving Bulgaria from blue [color of Union of Democratic Forces,  SDS] ruin. This is more than certain, more than mere optimism.    However, the mere awareness that the conflicts are  inevitable, even if they are not disastrous, is not enough.  This must not make us either slightly gullible or  overcredulous. In addition to their natural inevitability, the  conflicts have their own inner tectonics, with unpredictable  forces that are difficult to control. These are the forces of  sharp confrontation, of complete rejection of the road we have  traveled, that are concealed in the hardest layers of the rich  party soil. For almost four years these forces have existed  unseen, confused and frightened by the cataclysm in society and  apparently doomed to remain immobile for all time. However,  now, the slightest slackening of the political pressure or the  crude aggression brings them out of the latent state into which  they have fallen. They are now shaking themselves out of this  state and are entering into the precongress dialogue, speaking  sometimes softly, sometimes with more strident tones. Many of  those who slept through the hard years in which the fate of the  socialist idea was being decided are now coming onto the stage,  ready to rout the saviors of the socialist idea. This is no  longer simply a duel between two sets of views, but a kind of  attempt at resurrecting the old and forgotten ideas.    Perhaps some of the more peace-loving among us will reject  these alarming findings, but they should not be in too much of a  hurry to do so. These findings are not invented. It is already  well-known that there are some people here and there who propose  to restore the party's old name, to declare once again its  Leninist origins, to reestablish democratic centralism, and  revive the party's revolutionary character. They not only doubt  the advantages of democracy, but also reject its achievements so  far, small though they may be. Some of them are even ready to  deny the cause of DUMA and propose the reestablishment of the  newspaper that for 45 years disseminated the so-called party  truth -- the paper with its orders depicted on its masthead,  carrying above its name the slogan that has lost its meaning  with the passage of time. These people do not recognize party  pluralism, they reject separate ideological trends, and accuse  anyone who thinks more freely of treason. Having failed to  understand the present and being alien to its complex nature,  they daydream about "their own" time, as if history was able to  bring it back for them. See how many old and rejected  conceptions about the party and life are trying to varying  extents to influence the precongress dialogue and deflect it in  a wrong direction. There should be no doubt that certain  retrograde circles that missed their chance need an earthquake  and are trying to provoke one. They will certainly fail,  because they form part of the rear baggage train of the BSP and  social development, but this does not mean that we should  underestimate them. They are in our midst, and this is good  enough reason to put us on our guard. It is not only the sick  imaginations of the right-wing forces in the SDS, but also these  friends of ours who are nourishing the fiction of some kind of  recommunization. Their threadbare thoughts and ideological  visions not only scare the Socialist Party, but the general  population as well.    The awakening of these subterranean strata within the BSP  is a major warning signal for the upcoming congress. It will be  dangerous, as well as harmful, if they are able to influence the  work of the congress. Then the congress will become an arena  that will disturb not only the party, but society as well. In  this context, the election of delegates to the congress is  transformed from a formal procedure into an almost momentous  act. The party organization should send to their supreme forum  not merely "our own people" or "good comrades," but individuals  who have proved their political maturity and wisdom, persons  totally dedicated to the new spirit of the BSP and determined to  make a final break with the past and transform the BSP into a  truly modern party, which means a party with a deep awareness of  parliamentary democracy, a party of broad social dialogue, a  party with a pluralistic approach to the problems, and a lofty  national awareness. It must be a party of people whom Bulgaria  values and loves. If this does not come about, the congress  will take a wrong turn, whether we want it or not. The times of  pompous statements, empty speeches, pledges of loyalty,  ideological sentiments, and even more sentimental concepts of  the future are past and gone. Every elected delegate must enter  the congress hall aware that he is a man of the new time, that  he defends a socialist idea in an antisocial society, and that  our goal today is not simply power, but the salvation and  ennoblement of man. At the present moment, the BSP can have no  higher goal than this. Anyone who does not understand this may  speak eloquently, but he will not be of the least help.  Therefore, those who disturb the people with their outmoded  speeches and degraded ideas about life should not seek to be  called to the speaker's platform. They can only blow up the  party and change it from a means to achieve new changes into a  bunker for unnecessary battles.    I do not know whether everyone will agree with the content  and deep feeling embodied in the thoughts I have expressed.  However, this is not important. It is more important for them  to instill these thoughts in their own consciousness and  remember them when they have to assess one or another form of  conduct. For the people from the party's rear baggage train,  those who are launching reckless criticisms that do not in the  least help the new spirit, do not deserve to be patronized.  They are noisy disrupters of the calm and are seeking backdated  recognition. One may understand them from a purely human  viewpoint, but they must receive no support or encouragement.  Their belated energy is no help to the BSP. Although in many  cases it is sincere, it is not beneficial. The only thing that  this energy can achieve is to exacerbate the inevitable  conflicts that I mentioned in the beginning, and turn them into  a crisis. Let no one forget that our party contains many new  shoots. If we want to keep it whole, we should neither accuse  them nor trample them in the mud, as certain rough "gardeners"  seem to be doing just now. Therefore, let us listen to what  they have to say, because they have the right to speak, but let  us not follow their advice. Their way does not lead anywhere.  It cannot be the way of the BSP, because the party of the  Bulgarian Socialists wants to live despite the difficulties and  bad omens. It is not a rock, as some like to think, but a  spring, a spring for the thirsty to drink from, not for those  who are looking for somewhere to wash their old clothes.</p>

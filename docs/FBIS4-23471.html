			<p>BFN     [Text] Angola is violating the sovereignty of Namibia with  the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party  [MPLA-PT] secret police involved in the compulsory recruitment  of Angolan nationals taking refuge in northern Namibia. This  has been taking place since 4 May with the consent of the  Namibian authorities, and the Angolan consul in the city of  Rundu, the capital of Okavango Province. With the current  compulsory recruitment, hundreds of youths have just been flown  to Luanda, but the campaign continues and is scheduled to reach  2,400 men. The Bagani, Omege, Mukwe, Andara, Kangongo, and  Chobe areas are currently the most affected. In February the  Namibian president guaranteed that his country would defend the  international rights of the refugees, but it seems that this is  no longer so, since he is assisting the Luanda communist  government.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Arts: A Better Day - Theatre It was a good idea to write a musical about Keir Hardie and to stage it at the old socialist stronghold of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. Not only was he the founder of the Independent Labour Party, he won a famous by-election in what was then the local constituency of West Ham South in 1892. There was also a romantic side to him, notably his love affair with Sylvia Pankhurst, the suffragette, and indeed with several Fabian ladies. All the ingredients for a boisterous, irreverent, participatory performance are there. The author is Sheila Yeger, whose writing we have learned to admire not least from her recent Self-Portrait, a play about the artist, Gwen John. The director is Annie Casteldine, who is up among the top. Do not be put off by the piece being commissioned by Nalgo; there could be worse things for a trade union to do than getting into theatre. Yet the trouble is that A Better Day does not quite come off - or at least not yet. One is reminded of Professor Dahrendorf's remark about Edward Heath's manifesto 'A Better Tomorrow'; what he really meant was a better yesterday. It would be pleasant to report that the shortcomings on the first night were due to the performance being too slow, which it was. However, there may be a deeper reason, which is that socialism is neither funny nor self-confident any more: it's dead. I never expected to sit through a rendering of 'Jerusalem' in this theatre with the audience scarcely having the enthusiasm to join in. That is at the end of the first act. The second act, which is generally much better, has a performance of 'The Red Flag' which, whatever you may think of the words, has a pretty stirring tune. It comes across like a dirge. Some lines in the text bear out the interpretation that few people, even in Stratford East, are prepared to cheer for socialism any more. Keir Hardie condemns the idea of a Lib-Lab pact, which was as much talked about at the start of the 20th century as it is towards the end. There is no applause for his advice that socialists should have nothing to do with it; only what I took to be a thoughtful silence. A Better Day has its lacunae. One of the lines is 'When in doubt, sing'. In the absence of sustained dialogue, that could be the guiding principle of the piece. Stratford East has always been good at that sort of thing. And when Elizabeth Mansfield as Sylvia Pankhurst leads her cohorts in 'If you wont't give the vote to the ladies, there'll be no more kisses for you', the old place is back at its best. The show is worth seeing for Ms Mansfield alone, as well as the nostalgia. Hardie died in 1915. Obviously he had a way with women. One of his girl friends, Agnes Hughes - played here by Shona Morris - claims in her diaries that she had a communication with him through a medium in 1945. She said he expressed his doubts that the newly elected Labour government would stick to the guidelines of the Sermon on the Mount. One awaits with fascination a new biography of Hardie by Caroline Benn to be published this summer. Meanwhile, don't overlook Stratford East. Theatre Royal, Stratford East until July 4. 081 534 0310</p>

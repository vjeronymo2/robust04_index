			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CAPITALS' RIDLEY PROVES THE NHL SCOUTS WRONG  </P> <P> For Mike Ridley, there have been plenty of rejection slips along the way to  becoming an NHL All Star.  </P> <P> He was cut from his junior hockey team when he was 17. He was passed over by  the Canadian Olympic team four years later and ignored by the NHL draft every  year in between.  </P> <P> "It's something I can always think about and say, 'Look at what I did and I  never was drafted. I proved a lot of people wrong,' "Ridley said. "When I was  playing at Tier II (Canada's Junior A hockey), an NHL Central Scout came to  rate guys and I guess I wasn't rated that high."  </P> <P> Scoring a goal and an assist in this year's NHL All-Star game and playing most  of this year as the Washington Capitals' leading scorer, the 25-year-old native  of Winnipeg is getting rated pretty high these days.  </P> <P> "I've heard the term late bloomer before," Ridley said. "I was always the top  scorer on my (junior) team, but wasn't always the best in my league."  </P> <P> Ridley made the New York Rangers as a free agent four years ago and has  improved in each of his four NHL seasons.  </P> <P> "He's come a long way since the Rangers' camp," said Washington left wing Kelly  Miller, who came to the Capitals with Ridley from the Rangers in a New Year's  Day trade two years ago.  </P> <P> "I think he's one of the best centers in the league," Miller said. "Mike really  has come on this year, but I've always seen signs of it. There would be times  (in previous seasons) where Mike would go into spells where he's been a little  frustrated."  </P> <P> That may come from all those high-scoring years in junior hockey that went  unrewarded.  </P> <P> After being cut as a 17-year-old, Ridley made the St. Boniface Saints of the  Manitoba Junior Hockey League the next year, but only after switching from  center to left wing. The following year, he blossomed.  </P> <P> "When I was 19, that's when I really came on. I broke some of Bobby Clarke's  scoring records," Ridley said.  </P> <P> Ridley scored 91 goals and had 99 assists for 190 points in 48 games with St.  Boniface in 1982-83. All three scoring totals still stand as league records.  </P> <P> "Sometimes at Tier II, people thought I might be drafted but it never  happened," Ridley said. " . . . If I was drafted at the time it would have been  the greatest thing. . . . When I was 14 or 15, a friend of mine's brother, he  was drafted by the Islanders and I'd look at him and go, 'Wow.' "  </P> <P> The three Major Junior hockey leagues in Canada have been considered the best  source of talent. After that comes the Junior A level, which is a more local  brand of competition.  </P> <P> Ridley said he had a chance to play for a Major Junior hockey team when he was  20, but turned it down. He chose instead to go to the University of Manitoba.  </P> <P> "You don't want to give up your dreams (of playing in the NHL)," Ridley said.  "You don't want to quit trying, but it wasn't in the front of my mind."  </P> <P> Playing hockey for a Canadian university is not the place to launch a pro  hockey career. "It's not a place many (professional players) come from,"  Washington Coach Bryan Murray said.  </P> <P> In the midst of a two-year career in which he was named Canada's College Player  of the Year and scored 68 goals in 76 games at Manitoba, Ridley was one of four  players invited to try out for the last spot on the Canadian Olympic team.  Ridley wound up one of the other three.  </P> <P> "It seemed like there was a day difference between (Canadian Olympic Coach  Dave) King telling me, 'No, we don't want you' and when Reg Higgs called and  asked me if I'd like to try out for the New York Rangers.  </P> <P> "Wow. What a thing that was."  </P> <P> Ridley walked into then-Ranger coach Ted Sator's first training camp and  promptly won a spot on the roster.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a thing where I came in and I was so good I made the team," Ridley  said. "They took a gamble on me. I got a break in camp with the new coaches.  They wanted to do an overhaul on the team. They didn't have big centermen. I'm  not huge, but I was bigger than anyone they had."  </P> <P> After competing for a week with the rest of the team's rookies, Ridley found  himself a little overwhelmed.  </P> <P> "It was the toughest thing I've ever done in my life," he said. " . . . I  thought, 'These guys are so good. Wait until the pros come in.' Then you start  seeing guys you used to watch on TV. (Former Ranger defenseman) Barry Beck and  those guys walk in and you've got to get on the ice with them."  </P> <P> Ridley went on to become the Rangers' top rookie that year, scoring 22 goals  and 65 points. After scoring 16 goals in the first 38 games of his second  season, Ridley was traded to the Capitals.  </P> <P> "It's January 1st. We had the day off and I was sitting around the house," said  Ridley.  </P> <P> Ridley got the news in a call from Rangers general manager Phil Esposito around  6 p.m. and spent the next three hours on the phone with reporters and friends.  </P> <P> "I got a little time to pack and get to bed," he said. "I leave the house at  seven the next morning and I never saw my place in New York again."  </P> <P> This season, Ridley has already surpassed his career-high for goals scored. He  scored 12 goals in a 13-game span in November and December and then logged 30  points in a 17-game spree in December and January. He scored four goals in  Washington's second game of the season and recorded a team-record six assists  against Chicago on Jan. 7.  </P> <P> "He's more confident and a lot stronger," Murray said. "His strength has helped  him immensely when people try to put a stick on him. . . . The big thing for  Mike is he has to skate. He has to keep his feet moving."  </P> <P> Murray has also seen a change in Ridley's mental approach to the game. "He's  matured. He understands that there are 80 games and that there are going to be  low points," Murray said. "In college hockey, you have to score every night to  be a star and here (in the NHL) that's not the case."  </P> <P> Ridley said his experience at the All Star game has helped.  </P> <P> "You go to the All Star game and you talk to the guys and they say, 'Yeah,  that's the way it goes sometimes," he said.  </P> <P> Of his improvement, Ridley said, "It's a lot of things. It's hard to pinpoint  one thing. My confidence is probably higher than it has ever been. . . . The  puck is not going in right now as much as earlier this season, but I'm getting  my chances."  </P></p>

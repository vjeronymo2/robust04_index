			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Anglia TV up 13p on 'very good' results INTERIM pre-tax profits at Anglia Television tumbled 59 per cent, from a restated Pounds 5.18m to Pounds 2.12m, in the first period of operation under its new franchise. However, Sir Peter Gibbings, chairman, said the accounts this time were not strictly comparable with last year as they included payment to the Treasury of Pounds 12.2m. This represented part of the Pounds 17.8m franchise bid and 7 per cent of the qualifying advertising revenue for the period. The comparable levy last year was Pounds 732,000. 'The results in the light of that are really very good,' he claimed. The shares moved up 13p to 375p. Total revenues for the first half of 1993 were Pounds 61m (Pounds 67.6m). Of this, programme sales were down from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 9.79m, and advertising and other revenues amounted to Pounds 51.2m, against Pounds 54.7m. It was stressed, however, that these were not comparable as, under the new franchise, the company no longer sold airtime for Channel 4 but was in direct competition with it. Sir Peter said the company expected to take about 53 per cent of its annual advertising revenue in the second half. While this was difficult to forecast, the third quarter was developing in line with the first half, when Channel 3 revenue grew by 7 per cent. He estimated that Anglia's share had risen by 0.3 per cent, giving it well over 7 per cent of the total. Operating profits were Pounds 635,000 (Pounds 4.2m). The latest pre-tax figure includes Pounds 809,000 of goodwill arising from a joint venture with Home Box Office, a division of Time-Warner, and Pounds 676,000 (Pounds 970,000) from investment income and interest. Earnings per share fell from 7.76p to 3.38p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.86p but the company said it would be considering an increase in the final.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / 'It's going to depend on who gets their support out': FT reporters declare any party could win what has been a rather subdued campaign The lack of big prizes to be won outside London in today's local elections has kept campaigning at a subdued level. As a referendum on the government's performance, the regional poll is likely to be overshadowed by next month's European elections. Birmingham, the UK's largest metropolitan authority, is the biggest potential prize for the Conservatives. Labour would lose control if its opponents captured four seats. Workers from all parties agree the result will be neck-and-neck, although Labour thinks it has done enough to stay in power. 'It's going to depend now on the parties getting their support out,' said Mr Bernard Zissman, the Conservative leader, who has been urging electors to concentrate on local issues rather than the woes of the government. 'It's not about trying to convert anybody to your point of view.' But even in Birmingham, the campaign has been unexciting. 'The thing which will decide the election is whether the Conservatives stay at home or whether they vote for another party,' said Mr David Luscombe, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who tomorrow could hold a pivotal position between the two main parties. In the south and south-west, the poll will show the extent to which the Liberal Democrats have maintained their momentum and whether Labour can build on the gains it made in 1990, when the Tories suffered badly from the unpopularity of the poll tax. The Tories expect to win back some seats, but their campaign has been largely one of damage limitation. Tory officials accept that national issues, such as April's tax increases, have predominated in voters' minds over local issues, such as the level of council tax. Even where local issues are important - for example, the high water charges in Devon and Cornwall - the Tories are on the defensive. 'The feedback on the doorstep is one of antipathy to the government,' said Mr David Fox, regional co-ordinator for the Liberal Democrats. His party is hopeful of making the seven gains needed to win control of Bath, where the Conservatives are the largest party. An easier target is the 'hung' Weymouth and Portland council in Dorset, where the Tories have only been able to field candidates in five of the 12 contested seats, and Colchester in Essex. Mr Mike Jempson, for Labour's south-west region, said the party's canvass returns 'are showing much better prospects than we expected. The Tory vote has collapsed.' His party will be disappointed if it fails to win the two seats needed to win overall control of Gloucester council, although its opponents believe that is not a foregone conclusion. Labour is also the largest party in Exeter and hopes to take outright control. In Bristol, the controlling Labour group should be able to fend off a challenge in 10 wards from the new Bristol Party, started by disgruntled Bristol Rovers football supporters. But Labour's 12-seat majority could be cut by the Liberal Democrats. In the north, the Liberal Democrats are challenging in Liverpool, where the controlling Labour group has to contend with a rival leftwing faction. Labour also has difficulties in South Tyneside, where the Liberal Democrats have pushed hard to reduce Labour's formidable majority of 55 of the 60 seats. One northern council where control could change - from Conservative to Labour - is Barrow-in-Furness. Even there campaigning has been muted. There are two main questions in Scotland: whether the Scottish National party gains the extra votes and seats it expects and whether the Tories fall to fourth, rather than third, in voting share. The elections for the nine regional councils of mainland Scotland and the three island councils are unlikely to produce changes in more than one regional council. Only in Grampian, and to a lesser extent Tayside, could the SNP conceivably win full control. The SNP has been boosted by a System Three opinion poll a week ago which put its support on 27 per cent. While Labour was on 44 per cent, with the Tories and the Liberal Democrats on 14 per cent each. However, the Conservatives expect to do better than that, claiming support for their local policies, which involve the abolition of the regions in 1996 and their replacement by a single-tier system. But they have had difficulty convincing voters that their plans do not involve privatising water.</p>

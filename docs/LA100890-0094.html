			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEAHAWKS ADD TO PATRIOTS' TROUBLES, 33-20;  </P> <P> AFC: SEATTLE SCORES TWO FOURTH-QUARTER TOUCHDOWNS IN 24 SECONDS FOR COMEBACK  VICTORY.  </P> <P> Beset by problems on and off the field, the New England Patriots were on the  verge of earning a temporary respite from their troubles Sunday against the  Seattle Seahawks.  </P> <P> But the Seahawks, behind veteran quarterback Dave Krieg and second-year running  back Derrick Fenner scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns in a span of 24  seconds to give the Seahawks a 33-20 victory.  </P> <P> The Patriots (1-4) had erased a 19-3 deficit and took their only lead in three  games when Jason Staurovsky kicked a 48-yard field goal with 12:53 left to make  the score 20-19.  </P> <P> The Seahawks (2-3) won the game when Krieg, an 11-year veteran, and Fenner, who  leads the NFL with eight touchdowns, transformed Patriot turnovers into  touchdowns.  </P> <P> An interception by Dwayne Harper at Seattle's 18-yard line set up a 45-yard  touchdown pass play from Krieg to Jeff Chadwick with 2:37 left.  </P> <P> A fumble recovery by Melvin Jenkins at the New England 21 led to a five-yard  touchdown run by Fenner 24 seconds later.  </P> <P> "It's just so frustrating," said New England quarterback Marc Wilson, who has  not won in seven starts with the Patriots. "We were right there and then  something happens."  </P> <P> Krieg completed 17 of 25 passes for 254 yards and two touchdowns. Fenner, who  had three touchdowns in each of his two previous games, led the Seahawks with  77 yards in 19 carries and scored two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Chadwick's touchdown followed Harper's interception that gave Seattle the ball  with 5:05 left.  </P> <P> One play after Chris Singleton sacked Krieg for an 11-yard loss, Chadwick  outran backup cornerback Rod McSwain down the left sideline and caught the ball  at the front corner of the end zone.  </P> <P> For the third consecutive game, New England was inept in the first half.  </P> <P> Seattle scored on its first four possessions and led, 19-10, at halftime.  </P> <P> In the Patriots' previous two games, both routs, Cincinnati scored on its first  four series and the New York Jets scored on four of their first five.  </P> <P> "Our mental preparation is killing us," Patriot linebacker Chris Singleton  said. "We're all hustling. We're all running. It's just the mental stuff and  the mental breakdowns, the missed assignments."  </P> <P> But the Patriots rallied from a 19-3 deficit on Brent Williams' 45-yard fumble  return for a touchdown 22 seconds before halftime and a 35-yard scoring pass  from Wilson to Hart Lee Dykes on their first series of the third quarter.  </P> <P> On the Patriots' first offensive play, John Stephens fumbled and Eugene  Robinson recovered at the New England 20-yard line. Three plays later, Fenner  scored on a five-yard run.  </P> <P> Krieg connected with Tommy Kane on a 20-yard touchdown pass play with 8:51 left  in the first quarter to give the Seahawks a 13-0 lead.  </P> <P> Staurovsky then kicked a 53-yard field goal that tied Gino Cappelletti's 1965  kick for the longest in team history.  </P> <P> Norm Johnson kicked field goals of 19 and 31 yards to give the Seahawks their  19-3 halftime lead.  </P></p>

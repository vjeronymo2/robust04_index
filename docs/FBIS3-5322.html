Cao Sy Kiem also made known that a USD 73 million-project  aimed at computerising and automating Vietnam's banking industry  from now towards 2000 had been approved.    The fund, he added, would be taken from the state budget,  foreign loans as well as the reserved capitals of the Vietnam  State Bank.    Over the past three years Vietnam has made great efforts to  become integrated with the world banking system. About 2,600  assorted personal computers have been put into use in various  state- run banks and commercial banks. Information networks  have been formed and completed within each bank as well as from  provincial- level banks to central bank.    Moreover, various new professional techniques have been  applied such as electronic money transfer, an interbank market,  remote inspection and supervision, preventative information,  foreign currency and precious stone businesses, and so on.    Thanks to these changes, the payment time has been reduced  considerably, thus the rate of circulation has also accelerated.    This improved service has improved the business environment  for the entire economy.</p>

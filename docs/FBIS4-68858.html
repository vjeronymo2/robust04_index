			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Borys Klimchuk, chairman of the Volyn Oblast </F> Council of People's Deputies, by Bohdan Bereketa under the  rubric "Life of the Councils"; date and place not given: " `You  Can See Things From the Top, But Not Everything,' Said Borys  Klimchuk, Chairman of the Volyn Oblast Council of People  Deputies, in a Conversation with Our Correspondent" --first two  paragraphs are HOLOS UKRAYINY introduction]    [Text] The rise of Borys Petrovych Klimchuk two years ago  to the office of chairman of the Volyn Oblast Council was  something of a surprise. A teacher by profession, he had never  worked in the party nomenklatura organs... Moreover, he wears a  moustache and a beard. Who ever saw such a thing -- a council  chairman with a beard! He was asked at the session of the  council: "What do you plan to do about your beard?" Borys  Petrovych replied: "If you want me to be chairman of the oblast  council, I will do the job. But do not force me to get rid of my  beard..."    And, you know, the beard and moustache are very becoming to  him.    [Bereketa] Our conversation dealt with the elections and  creating new governing structures. First and foremost, new local  government organs. What does Borys Klimchuk think about this?    [Klimchuk] I believe that there should be elections. This is  one way of solving the crisis in which we find ourselves. We  need new people in the local administrative organs. People whom  the public trusts. Let us be frank: those currently in power  have lost the people's trust. New people in the governing organs  means new thinking in state building.    [Bereketa] What do you think the new governing organs should  be like?    [Klimchuk] There has been much talk about local self-rule  during the last two years. This sounds find in theory. In  practice, however, we have never been very good at  self-government. We continued functioning within the overall  system of state administration based on the old model of the  councils. We need a law on governing. To put in place a  mechanism for removing the council chairman from office by the  corps of deputies. To enable us to retire a council chairman  from government service. How do we do this? So that officials  serve the people and the state. So that there are no local  princelings, who take good care of themselves and of higher  officials. There needs to be a clear-cut chain of authority:  from the Cabinet of Ministers to the village council chairman.  We must learn to submit to controls, be willing to listen to the  voice of the majority, take a long-range view of our work at the  local level and a long-range view of the development of the  Ukrainian state. In forming the new governing structures, we  must ensure that there is a clear-cut division of powers and no  double subordination.    [Bereketa] What is your attitude to the institution of the  presidential representative?    [Klimchuk] I think that this innovation no longer serves a  purpose. For a certain period of time, this was a good idea, but  it was not as successful as it should have been. The  presidential representatives in the oblasts and rayons became  something in the nature of executive committees; they became  involved in solving petty, everyday problems. But there were no  structures to oversee and correct their activities. Obviously,  we could create some sort of local bodies to oversee compliance  with the law. Because, in all honesty, virtually no one is  currently performing any supervisory functions. If an official  has a conscience and a sense of responsibility, he does some  good work. If he lacks these qualities, he does nothing. We have  to admit that work in the state structures has become  prestigious and provides some benefits. If it were up to me, I  would establish a contract system for state officials. We should  take everything we can from these people and then some. Our  times require that kind of work. At all levels. I do not like it  when people cite all sorts of circumstances which allegedly  prevent them from doing their jobs.    [Bereketa] There has lately been a great deal of discussion  about what kind of state Ukraine should be...    [Klimchuk] I support those who believe that Ukraine should  be  a unitary state. Only in a unitary state will we be able to  conduct the necessary economic reforms. As far as I am  concerned, we should throw the word "federalism" out of our  vocabulary. Nor does it make sense to play incomprehensible  games with certain regions, promising them greater powers. The  regions of a single state must not be divided into sovereign  principalities. We have our Ukraine, and we must all care for it  in equal fashion.    [Bereketa] How would you describe Volyn's contribution to  the  economic development of Ukraine? Can we do more than we are  doing?    [Klimchuk] Volyn is a unique kind of border oblast. I would  even call it Ukraine's gateway to Europe. We have manpower  resources. We are rich in lakes and forests. We have bread,  meat... You know, just a few years ago, people used to ask  indignantly: "Who ate our meat?" And now they ask: "Who will eat  our meat?" We have a great deal to sell and trade. But the  expansion of our external economic relations is being hampered  by our ineffective system of currency regulation and the fact  that our normative documents are flawed. That is why we place  our hopes in the new government and in the new laws that will  force our economy to work without all sorts of "isms."    [Bereketa] Borys Petrovych, you recently agreed to run  [again] for the office of chairman of the oblast council of  people's deputies. I have in mind in the new elections. Are you  not afraid?    [Klimchuk] No. Generally speaking, we should not be afraid  of  elections. Nor of the new people who will come to the oblast  council. The popular filter is effective and very fine. Of  course, anything can happen. But I believe that the Volynians  will elect worthy people. I myself am not very fearful by  nature; I live for the future. I am already putting together a  new team for the oblast council. You'll tell me that I'm way  ahead of myself... Perhaps. But somebody will find use for my  experience.    [Bereketa] What, in your opinion, are the most important  problems that need to be solved by local government in Volyn?    [Klimchuk] This is not an easy question. But since you ask,  let me say something about the problem of families with many  children. Just imagine, our oblast has nearly 20,000 families  with three to ten and more children. Last year, we closed down  10 kindergartens. We have 35 physicians per 10,000 residents.  The situation with respect to medical care is especially  critical in the rayons that have been contaminated with  radiation. We are managing on our own somehow, but this is an  issue of national significance. The birth rate in Polissya is  falling. This is a dangerous situation. Yet those in the highest  echelons of government do not seem to be concerned. That is why  I believe that one of the main tasks facing local government  organs is ensuring the largest possible tax base. Governing  requires money. And families with many children are in great  need of assistance.    [Bereketa] Let us imagine that you have been elected  chairman  of the new oblast council. What kind of powers would you like to  have?    [Klimchuk] To be able to veto the decisions of lower-level  governing organs. To have the decision of the council chairman  accepted without further discussion. Unconditional execution.  Less talk and more action. We have had more than enough  collective irresponsibility; there is a need for personal  accountability. The people have elected you, they trust you,  then, by all means, be accountable to them and the state.    [Bereketa] What would you like to wish the new members of  the  new local government structures?    [Klimchuk] To believe in themselves and in our Ukraine.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Foued Allani: "Social Development: Marked </F> Retreat of Poverty"--first paragraph is LA PRESSE DE TUNISIE  introduction]    [Text]     -  In 1990, 6.7 percent of Tunisians were considered poor,  compared with 33 percent in 1967.    -  From 1987 to 1991, total State assistance amounted to  12,140,000 dinars[D], i.e., 18 percent of the gross domestic  product.    -  101,000 families were covered by the National Program  of Aid to Needy Families [PNAFN], receiving on the average D250  per year per family in 1992, i.e., 178 percent more than in 1987.    Poverty has "retreated markedly in Tunisia." This is what  Mr.  Abdellatif Ben Kilani, director at the Ministry of Social  Affairs, stated at the national seminar on food and nutrition  policy planning recently organized in Tunis by the Ministry of  Agriculture, with the collaboration of the Ministry of Health  and the FAO [UN Food and Agriculture Organization].    Presenting a study on the present status and the future of  the National Program of Aid to Needy Families (PNAFN), Mr. Ben  Kilani indicated that, based on the threshold calculated by the  National Statistics Institute (INS), "the underprivileged  percentage dropped from 33 percent in 1967 to 22.2 percent in  1975, from 12.9 percent in 1980 to 7.7 percent in 1985, and to  6.7 percent in 1990, representing 82,000 families at present, or  about 544,000 individuals."    The official commented on the phenomenon, ascribing it to  the  country's economic growth as well as to "a genuine political  will to fight poverty, which resulted in many programs" being  implemented.    The officials classified these programs according to their  goals: prevention, integration, or assistance.    For instance, "some programs specifically geared to the poor  provide direct aid or subsidies and support the creation of  income sources. Others, universal in scope, play a decisive part  in fighting poverty, either by preserving the purchasing power  or by improving living conditions. Others, finally, aim rather  to prevent poverty," the official explained.    As a result, during the Seventh Plan (1987-1991), State  expenditures in this respect totaled 18 percent of the GDP, or  D12,140,000. This is a very high figure, the official noted.    Yet, he pointed out, "the State's efforts to eradicate  poverty go beyond mere operational programs and also take the  form of legislative measures."    Among these, Mr. Ben Kilani mentioned "tax exemptions  granted  to lowest income categories and specific benefits with respect  to credit, which result in a considerable loss of revenues for  the State."    The official also mentioned "policies with an obvious social  dimension, such as education, vocational training, or family  planning, which have an immediate or deferred impact on the  disadvantaged."    Direct efforts to assist needy families through regular or  occasional aid are easier to quantify.    As an example of occasional aid for the year 1992, the  official quoted the following figures:     -  D3.606 million were distributed to 40,000 needy families  on the occasion of religious holidays;    -  D15.5 million were distributed at the beginning of the school  year, on behalf of 305,000 students from needy families.    This, of course, was in addition to aid in kind, such as  meals provided by the IFTAR [expansion not given].    As for regular aid, it includes essentially food provided to  poor young students in the most disadvantaged areas. This is  subsidized in part by the World Food Program [WFP], with the  State paying for the rest.    Thus, the official mentioned that 1,350 school cafeterias  currently provide meals for 223,480 primary school students,  i.e.,16.3 percent of all primary school students.    As far as cash is concerned, regular aid is mostly provided  by the PNAFN. It is intended for "families that are totally  destitute and without resources, large families with limited  resources, and the old or handicapped with no one to support  them."    In his speech, Mr. Ben Kilani analyzed the PNAFN components,  adding a few recommendations on how to improve its services. The  program, he indicated, covered 101,000 families in 1992. Each  family received on the average D250, i.e., a 178-percent  increase compared with 1987.    [Box, p 3]  <H5>  A Profile of the Disadvantaged </H5>   What are actually the characteristics of Tunisian  disadvantaged populations?    Referring to the 1990 INS survey, Mr. Abdellatif Ben Kilani,  director at the Ministry of Social Affairs, made the following  observations:     -  "The disadvantaged represent a very variable percentage of  the population, depending on the social class and job category  of the household head: 19 percent among the unemployed active  population, and 2 percent among craftsmen and independent  workers. Actually, in addition to these two categories, poverty  affects nonfarm workers (249,000), farm workers (98,000),  retired and other nonactive individuals (51,000), and farmers  (32,000)."    -  "Since the last decade, poverty has assumed new  forms; in fact, it has become more urban than rural (67 percent  currently compared with 33 percent during the first two  decades)."    -  "It affects not only those who cannot work, but also  women and workers in the informal sector."    -  "The poverty rate  exceeds 10 percent in the west while remaining below 5 percent  in coastal areas."</p>

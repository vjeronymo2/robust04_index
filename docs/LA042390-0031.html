			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA RETALIATES, HALTS GAS SUPPLY TO SOVIET BASES  </P> <P> The Lithuanian government, in a rebellious tit-for-tat gesture, announced  Sunday that it is ending all gasoline supplies to Soviet military bases in the  republic and blocking the international export of goods produced by Soviet-run  factories in Lithuania.  </P> <P> Officials also said they are eliminating some local bus and streetcar routes to  conserve gasoline, and the republic's president appealed to citizens to  demonstrate their fortitude as the Kremlin seeks to isolate them economically.  </P> <P> At the same time, the government sent a high-level delegation to Moscow to seek  a political solution with Soviet leaders. However, the delegation, headed by  Lithuanian Vice President Bronius Kuzmickas, did not have an appointment with  any Soviet official when it left Vilnius on Sunday night.  </P> <P> "The pressure is growing for all the people of Lithuania," President Vytautas  Landsbergis said on Lithuanian television. "Sometimes you cannot believe that  big Russia can do such things to little Lithuania. Lithuania hasn't committed  any crime against the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, he urged the Lithuanian people to persevere. "You must try to  stand the economic blockade as long as you can. Time will show that our people  can survive," he said.  </P> <P> In response to Moscow's decision to dry up gasoline pipes running into the  republic, Lithuanian leaders said they were eliminating all gasoline supplies  that go to Soviet military bases in the republic. It is expected, however, that  those bases will continue to receive gasoline from Moscow.  </P> <P> In another step likely to anger Moscow, officials blocked the export by sea to  other countries of goods produced by Lithuanian factories that are run by the  Soviet Union. The Lithuanian leaders argued that they did not want any of the  foreign currency earned from those products to go to the Soviet government.  </P> <P> And in a telegram sent to Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the  Lithuanian government said it has been forced by the blockade of some raw  materials to stop exporting to the Soviet Union a number of items produced in  the republic, including electric motors, television receivers and textiles.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union began late Wednesday to impose economic sanctions against the  republic. Moscow confirmed it has cut off all oil supplies and about 84% of  natural gas supplies. Lithuanian leaders further charge that other goods are  being blocked, ranging from wood and metals to fish and sugar.  </P> <P> That was denied Sunday by Andrei Girenko, a secretary in the Communist Party  Central Committee. Girenko, in Vilnius to attend a meeting of the pro-Moscow  faction of the Lithuanian Communist Party, told a news conference that although  Moscow has cut oil and gas supplies to Lithuania, other goods are still flowing  to the republic.  </P> <P> "Plans for a total economic blockade do not exist," Girenko said. "The measures  which are being undertaken in accordance with the decisions of the president  (Mikhail S. Gorbachev) can in no way be considered as a blockade of Lithuania.  They cover only a small part of the production that was supplied and continues  to be supplied to Lithuania."  </P> <P> The economic sanctions began after Lithuania defied an ultimatum from  Gorbachev, who gave them an Easter weekend deadline to rescind legislation  bolstering their unprecedented March 11 declaration of independence from the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian leadership has offered to negotiate the legislation and all  other issues except the sovereignty declaration itself. But that has not  satisfied Moscow.  </P> <P> Girenko, the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit Lithuania since the  independence declaration, also said he will not meet with members of the  Lithuanian government during his stay in the republic. He repeated Moscow's  insistence that Lithuania first withdraw what the Soviets consider to be an  unconstitutional sovereignty declaration.  </P> <P> "I think that in the end, good sense will prevail," Girenko said. "There are  forces in the republic that understand what could happen and what a catastrophe  it could lead to."  </P> <P> A participant in the congress of the pro-Moscow faction of the Lithuanian  Communist Party attended by Girenko, meanwhile, complained in an interview with  the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya that his homeland has become "captive to a  nationalistic euphoria."  </P> <P> Reactionary nationalists, said Mykolas Burokyanvichus, are "leading Soviet  Lithuania to a political dead end and the people to tragedy." His viewpoint,  however, is mirrored by only about 10% of the republic's population, according  to a recent poll.  </P> <P> Lithuanian officials have warned that the republic cannot survive for long  under an economic blockade.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Hamilton reported from Moscow and Schrader, a free-lance  journalist, from Vilnius.  </P></p>

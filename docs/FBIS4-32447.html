			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 23 Jun (TANJUG) -- "Information that is  available to us indicates that the work of the Contact Group is  in its final stage," Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the republic  of Srpska's people's assembly, told journalists today. "What we  do know from reliable sources is that the Contact Group is in a  dilemma about whether certain areas should be defined as gray  zones or divided cities," said Krajisnik. "Neither is  acceptable for the Serbian side, because our standpoint is that  only clear-cut solutions can be a guarantee for lasting peace,"  Krajisnik said, recalling that during the contacts so far with  members of the Contact Group, especially with the French and  British, the Serbian side made this stand perfectly clear.    Commenting on Christopher's and Kozyrev's statements in  Brussels, Krajisnik said that the aim of such statements was to  exert pressure on all the sides in the conflict to accept the  proposed solutions, while the main pressure was put on the  Serbian side.    "The imposed solutions do not, however, lead toward peace  and  it is, therefore, justified to exchange arguments to see which  sides are interested in which of the controversial areas in  order to establish whose demand is more justified. Here I refer  first of all, to areas in western and eastern Bosnia, and in  Posavina," said Krajisnik. He recalled that the international  community must bear in mind the fact that Serbs in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina already have a compact state territory, while  efforts are being made to achieve the compactness of the  Muslim-Croat federation by means of encroaching upon vital Serb  interests to the detriment of Serbian territorial integrity.    "We accept that the Muslim side should explain why it  insists  on the enclaves that seriously effect the compactness of our  territory, and if their arguments prove to be well-grounded and  realistic we will acknowledge them," said Krajisnik.</p>

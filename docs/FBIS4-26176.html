			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Apparent text of speech by Jiang Zemin to the national </F> education conference in Beijing on 14 June]    [Text] Comrades: This national education conference is an  important meeting held by the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council amid the new situation in which China has  quickened its pace of building a socialist market economic  system and of modernization. The primary task of the conference  is, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line, to carry out the guidelines laid down by the 14th  CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee, to further carry out the strategy of  giving priority to educational development, and to mobilize the  whole party and country to earnestly implement the "Outline of  China's Educational Reform and Development," in order to  accomplish the task of China's educational reform and  development in the 1990's. On behalf of the party Central  Committee and the State Council, Comrade Li Peng will deliver an  important report at the conference; I hope that all departments  and localities will earnestly study the report and act  accordingly.    Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, under the leaderships of party committees and  governments at all levels and with the diligent work of mass  education workers, the country's education has developed  rapidly, educational reform has been carried out step by step,  noticeable results have been achieved in educational work,  people's educational levels have been raised, and a large number  of specialized personnel have been cultivated. All of this has  made great contributions to the country's economic construction,  science and technological progress, and social development. On  behalf of the party Central Committee and State Council, I would  like to extend my high respects to the masses of teachers and  other education workers who have worked diligently on the  education front. I would also like to extend my heartfelt  thanks to people of all social sectors who have shown concern  for and given support to educational work.    The party Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping have  always attached importance to educational work -- in the overall  development strategy for building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, they have always regarded educational work as a  fundamental issue that affects the overall socialist  modernization efforts and the historical fate of socialism.  Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed the important position  and role of education in the socialist modernization drive, and  he has maintained that the first step in the "three-step"  development strategy is to develop education, science, and  technology. He pointed out: Science and technology are the key  to achieving modernization, and education is the foundation of  modernization. We should respect knowledge and specialized  personnel. Leaders at all levels should ensure good educational  work as they ensure good economic work. We should not engage in  empty talk and should do more practical things. However poor we  are, we should ensure the availability of sufficient funds for  science and educational development. We should do everything we  can to solve educational problems -- even if this means we have  to bear with difficulties in other areas or even slow down the  speed of development a little. However difficult the situation  may be, we have to raise remuneration for teachers and truly  help them solve their specific problems. Comrade Xiaoping also  has given many important instructions on educational reform and  development: Education should be modernized and be geared toward  the world and the future. We should thoroughly and correctly  carry out the party's principle guidelines on educational  development, adhere to the right course, and truly do a good job  in educational reform, in order to bring about the great  development of and a major improvement in educational work. We  should closely attend to ideological and political education  among young people and students and cultivate socialist people  of the younger generation who have lofty aspirations, a sound  moral sense, and good education and discipline. Comrade  Xiaoping's discussions on education are the theoretical basis  for the party's principal guidelines and policy on education in  the new period. They set the course and serve as a powerful  ideological weapon for educational reform and development. In  studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, comrades of the whole party,  especially leading cadres at all levels, should truly comprehend  Comrade Xiaoping's educational thinking and, like Comrade  Xiaoping, should attach importance to education from a strategic  perspective, in order to contribute to educational reform and  development.    Comrades, what are the means and ways to realize the grand  objective of socialist modernization construction for China, a  country with nearly a 1.2 billion people, with inadequate  resources, and with a relatively undeveloped economy and  culture? There are ways which are of decisive significance.  They are: shift economic construction onto the track of relying  on scientific and technological advances; raise the quality of  the working people; genuinely elevate education to a strategic  position and give priority to the development of education; and  strive to raise the people's moral, scientific, and cultural  levels. These are the major and fundamental ways to realize  China's modernization. The following message was solemnly  delivered at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee to all party members: whether China can establish a  socialist market economic system and realize its modernization  will be decided finally by whether it can raise the quality of  its people and by whether it can train a large number of  talented people.    Since the implementation of the policy of reform and opening  up, the entire party and society have renewed and raised their  understanding of the importance of education and of the need to  elevate education to a strategic position. Also, there has been  a sharp rise in the number of regions, departments, and units  which have done an excellent job of carrying out educational  reforms and of developing education since China implemented the  policy of reform and opening up. Despite these remarkable  results, education lacks balanced development. Some regions and  departments have yet to raise education to the strategic level.  Some comrades do understand the policy of making economic  construction the central task, but they do not have an adequate  understanding of the need to shift the strategic policy onto the  track of relying on scientific and technological advances to  develop the economy and to raise the quality of the working  people. Some comrades made such remarks as: "We must develop  the economy, but education can take a backseat"; "develop the  economy first, and education later." There are even cases of  diverting educational funds for economic projects and for the  construction of office buildings, luxury hotels, meeting halls,  and guesthouses, as well as the phenomenon of delays in paying  teachers' salaries. Some comrades have not exerted enough  effort to carry out the policy of promoting the reform and  opening drive with one hand and promoting the building of a  socialist spiritual civilization with the other and have  slackened their efforts to carry out ideological and political  education among youth. Such an understanding of education, and  also those practices run contrary to the demands made by the CPC  Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping. They not only lack  being farsighted but also are harmful.    All levels of leading comrades should understand completely  that the energetic development of education, accelerating the  pace of training talented people for socialist modernization  construction, and raising the ideological, moral, scientific,  and cultural quality of all the people in the nation are the  inevitable demands for implementing the party's basic line and  for unwaveringly adhering to the party's basic line for 100  years. Only by developing education will we be able to  fundamentally enhance China's overall strength and be able to  seize the strategic initiative in the fierce international  competition. Only by training generation after generation of  the builders and successors with ideals, morality, culture,  discipline, and devotion to the socialist cause with Chinese  characteristics can we guarantee the long reign and stability of  the state. In the entire course of socialist modernization  construction, we must always persist in elevating education to  the strategic position and in giving priority to develop  education; we must never waver on this point. If we do not have  a correct understanding of the issue of education, we will lose  our opportunity, adversely affect our great plan, and make a  historic mistake.    To accelerate educational reform and development, it is  necessary to comprehensively realize the "Development Outline  for China's Educational Reform" promulgated by the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council. This is an important matter  both for educational departments and for the entire party and  society. All levels of party committees and governments should  enhance their leadership over education work in a down-to-earth  manner, should formulate a concrete enforcement plan by taking  localities' actual conditions into consideration, and should  carry out careful planning and arrangements for implementation.  Major responsible comrades should frequently visit schools and  grass-roots units to carry out investigations, to provide  guidance, and to handle in a timely manner major and pressing  issues. When formulating a development plan and an annual plan,  all levels of party committees and governments must make sure  that they give priority to developing education. The CPC  Central Committee has set out the demand that areas and  departments which have failed to implement well the guidelines  on elevating education to the strategic level are required to  further increase their understanding of the importance of  education, to readjust their construction layout and investment  structure, and to ensure that priority be given to developing  education. Attaching importance to training talented people,  ensuring adequate funds for education, and doing concrete things  for education must be incorporated into the target  responsibility system for leading party and government cadres  and be made the important criterion for evaluating their  performance. Job-performance evaluation departments must take  the above conditions into account when evaluating cadres. All  leading cadres who have a high sense of responsibility toward  the party and the people should work hard for the reform and  development of education in their localities. As for schools'  leadership structure, party committees at institutions of higher  learning which practice the school presidents responsibility  system under the leadership of party committees should discuss  and make decisions on major issues and ensure that  administrative leaders fully exercise their own rights and  functions. Party organizations should also fully bring into  play their political roles in other schools as well in secondary  and primary schools which experiment with or practice the school  principals responsibility system.    Implementing the guidelines on elevating education to the  strategic level and on giving priority to develop education  requires the entire party and society to help foster and  maintain a good social mood for respecting teachers. The hope  for revitalizing the nation rests with education, and the hope  for invigorating education rests with teachers. Teachers are  what we call the engineers of the human soul. Their profession  is noble and yet arduous. They deserve respect from the whole  party and all of society. All levels of leading cadres, senior  leading cadres in particular, should take the lead in respecting  teachers and education. It is necessary to conscientiously  implement the "Teachers Law," to help maintain teachers'  legitimate rights and interests, to raise their salaries and  improve their welfare in line with the relevant provisions, and  to create the necessary conditions for their work, for their  study, and for their daily life. Every year, many party  committees and governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities do several concrete things for teachers. This is  a good practice that needs to be greatly promoted. All  departments and all social sectors are called upon to show  concern for and to support education with great enthusiasm, to  respect teachers' hard work, and to carry forward the Chinese  people's excellent tradition of respecting teachers and  education.    Various categories of schools at different levels should  thoroughly implement the party's education principle, uphold the  socialist orientation in running schools, and make efforts to  train new people with "lofty ideals, moral integrity, good  education, and a sense of discipline" along with the development  of morality, intellectuality, and physics. Schools should  respond to the new situation and the new problems that have  emerged in the course of reform and construction by constantly  strengthening and improving their ideological and political work  as well as their political education. It is necessary to  strengthen education on such things as the basic theory of  Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought -- particularly Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, the party's basic line, patriotism,  collectivism, socialism, China's modern and contemporary  history, state conditions, and fine cultural and revolution  traditions. Various categories of schools at different levels  should sum up experience and improve their teaching skills to  ensure teaching results in political lessons. The purpose of  strengthening theoretical and ideological education and  political work is to guide and help youths and students to  foster a correct world outlook, outlook on life, and concept of  values; to build a scientific theoretical foundation; and to  identify the political orientation of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. It is only through these means that we  will be able to enhance youngsters' ability to resist the  corrosive influence of such decadent types of thinking as wrong  ideological trends, money worship, hedonism, and  ultra-individualism. Principal leading cadres of various  localities and departments should make it a rule to hold regular  situation discussion meetings with teachers and students. To  promote stability and unity, it is necessary to conscientiously  maintain teaching order in schools. All of society should help  create a fine educational environment by showing concern for and  offering protection for the healthy growth of our students.    At this juncture, I would like to particularly touch on the  question of integrating education with productive labor. This  phrase, which has been explicitly included in the "outlines," is  an important component of our education principle. The  integration of education with productive labor is a basic  measure to uphold the socialist orientation in running schools.  We have been implementing this clause all along since the  founding of the nation. This has been a correct direction with  overall success -- despite the emergence of some problems in its  implementation -- and it has been conducive to the healthy  growth of youths and students. Facts have proved that confining  students to classroom studies without taking part in labor,  without contact with social practice, without knowledge of how  workers and peasants laboriously create social wealth, and  without fostering passion for the working people will not be  beneficial to their healthy growth and all-around development.  Students' appropriate participation in certain types of  material production labor should be made mandatory and not  optional. We should fully understand this point and attach  importance to it. To implement the principle of integrating  education with productive labor, we should do well the following  tasks: 1) Schools should include this subject in their teaching  programs in consideration of their own realities and through  overall planning; 2) education departments at various levels  should offer concrete guidance and carry out supervision and  inspections; 3) party committees and governments at various  levels should strengthen their leadership in this respect; and  4) all parties concerned should positively offer their support  and cooperation to help provide the necessary conditions for  students' participation in productive labor.    One of China's basic national conditions is developing  education on a large scale while the economy is relatively  backward. We must bear this fact in mind and deepen educational  reform to ensure that the educational structure and system meet  the requirements of development in the socialist market economy  and in all social sectors. No matter how difficult our  financial situation is, we must be willing to invest in  education to ensure that compulsory education develops well --  this is a foundation-laying project for improving all the  people's educational level. We should carry out reform to  further improve the quality and efficiency of higher education;  we should forcefully develop vocational and adult education at  various levels to enable the majority of our people to raise  their ideological and cultural level and to improve their  vocational skills. The key way to readjust the educational  structure is to establish more vocational schools of various  kinds to train large numbers of junior- and medium-level  specialized personnel in all fields. This not only will help  students pursue studies in different fields but will also meet  the current needs of economic and social development. The mass  of education workers of education departments and schools at all  levels should further emancipate their minds, do things in light  of reality, strive to develop a new educational system, seek a  new educational development path under the conditions of a  socialist market economy, and endeavor to build a socialist  educational system with Chinese characteristics.    Comrades, achieving the grand goals of China's educational  reform and development for the 1990's is a very honorable yet  arduous task. With the efforts over the 40 years and more since  the founding of the People's Republic, especially with the  development over the 15 years since the country adopted the  policy of reform and opening up, our education has developed  considerably, we have accumulated many valuable experiences in  carrying out educational reform, and the country now has more  than 10 million teachers. All these things have laid a good  foundation for future educational reform and development. The  central authorities believe that under the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, China's education  definitely will develop day by day as long as we unswervingly  attach strategic importance to education and give priority to  educational development, and as long as we seize the opportunity  to implement the "Outline of China's Educational Reform and  Development" in a down-to-earth manner.</p>

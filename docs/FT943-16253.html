			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Hopes of greater stability for the US dollar, together with renewed firmness in European bond markets, brought an advance in the derivatives, although volumes remained thin, writes Joel Kibazo. The September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,952 and buying from independent traders, also known as locals, steadily sent the contract ahead. The strength of bonds provided a useful lead to futures and the release of UK economic data helped to boost trading further, US markets, usually a factor in afternoon trading, were closed for the Independence Day holiday, but September remained in positive territory for most of the session and reached a peak of 2,988. It was at a premium to cash for most of the day. The contract finished at 2,987, up 38 from Friday's close and about 10 points above its fair value premium to cash which has fallen to 5 points on this account. Volume was very thin, a mere 7,695 lots being dealt by the close. Turnover in the traded options was also poor, amounting to just 18,342 contracts. Only 4,156 lots were traded in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,550 in the Euro FT-SE option. Lasmo, which recently escaped the clutches of Enterprise Oil, was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,327 contracts traded.</p>

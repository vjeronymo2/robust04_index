			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (10): How country is held back - Industrial production Manufacturing, targeted in the original Economic Structural Adjuestment Programme document as the flagship of structural adjustment, is struggling to come to terms with the new global and regional order as well as policy reform at home. Far from growing at 5.8 per cent a year since 1990 as projected, industrial production is currently running at pre-reform (1989) levels, 9 per cent below its pre-drought peak reached in 1991, and on current trends will break new ground only towards the end of 1995. Even that four-year standstill assessment is regarded as unduly optimistic by some manufacturers. August's Business Tendency Survey by the Central Statistical Office found that 82 per cent of manufacturing firms were operating below capacity, order books had shortened with weak demand both in domestic and export markets, and investment intentions and employment had fallen. Manufacturers, especially those in clothing and textiles, warn that the country is being deindustrialised because of excessively high interest rates, the abolition of the 9 per cent export incentive at the end of 1993 and trade liberalisation leading to 'dumping' by Asian and South African suppliers. The World Bank is more optimistic, arguing that if 10 per cent annual export growth could be achieved, manufacturing would resume the lead role it played during the sanctions period, expanding at 6 to 7 per cent annually. There are two main snags in this scenario: a quarter of a century of self-sufficiency led to Zimbabwe being ranked as the second most industrialised low-income country in the world, after China, with manufacturing accounting for 27 per cent of GDP. Whether there is scope to push this ratio to 30 per cent and beyond in a Dollars 5bn market and with some manufacturing activities already being relocated in South Africa, with its Dollars 120bn market, is questionable. The second potential pitfall is the Bank's view of modern manufacturing. It argues that comparative advantage is driven by resource endowment (low cost labour) and price, while quality, design, style, and delivery play little part. The roles of scope and scale economies, experience effects, the cross-border vertical integration of manufacturing activities and, above all, the regional factor, are underplayed. Yet increasingly, these will determine whether 10 per cent growth in manufactured exports is on the cards. If semi-processed goods - ferrochrome and cotton lint - are excluded, manufactured exports have a volatile track record, contracting in the first half of the 1980s, before surging 70 per cent in the next three years. In 1989, on the eve of ESAP, manufactures accounted for a quarter of merchandise exports, with clothing and textiles the largest group worth Dollars 68m. Since 1989 only clothing and textiles have performed, increasing 80 per cent to Dollars 122m last year, with the remainder static at Dollars 340m. The rapid export growth necessary to revive industry's fortunes depends not just on changes to the tax and protection regimes, on which topic Zimbabwe is receiving lots of good advice from the Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and other consultants, but also on a revolution in industry's managerial and corporate cultures. A UNDP study finds that while effective protection rates in manufacturing are not high in relation to some countries, levels of more than 50 per cent are too high. Highly protected activities cited include rates of 137 to 248 per cent for electric motors, over 90 per cent in electronics (TV, stereos, tape recorders), 78 to 81 per cent for domestic and commercial refrigerators, between 60 and 97 per cent for furniture, and 72 per cent for garments. Industries hit hardest by trade liberalisation include electronics, food processing and clothing, where most competing imports were excluded through the operation of the negative list. Companies in these sectors, especially clothing, have since suffered a triple blow: loss of protection, a more compressed duty structure with tariffs on finished goods reduced relative to those on imported inputs, and a sharp decline in domestic demand caused by drought and falling real wages. Even so, import substitution continues to be protected whereas the best exporters can hope for is zero protection, and even that assumes that the duty drawback system works efficiently, which it does not. According to the UNDP, low local value-added exporters are suffering, because tariffs and duties on inputs to protect upstream activities (textiles) hurt downstream players (clothing). Two other drawbacks are implicit in the existing system of protection: it encourages greater vertical integration and militates against smaller indigenous firms, and it protects capital-intensive activities more than labour-intensive ones. The proposed switch to VAT and the reduced reliance on import duties should enhance the competitiveness of industrial exporters. Government officials are optimistic that the Export Processing Zone legislation will shift the incentive structure in favour of labour-intensive value-added activities, though many feel Zimbabwe has missed this particular bus. The UNDP report argues that if a duty exemption system for exporters, along the lines of the Inward Processing Rebate scheme, could be implemented, then the chief advantage from EPZ investment would be the five-year tax holiday. One lesson from African structural adjustment programmes should not be forgotten. It is always easier to level the playing field and create the enabling environment than to get the supply response. This is where the neglected issues of institutional capacity, software, corporate culture and, in Zimbabwe's case, regionalism come into play. The necessary culture change involves getting management to see exports as the main source of growth rather than as the residual addition that they have been in the past. As it is, scarcely a week goes by without a captain of industry, convinced that industrialists deserve to be 'rewarded' for exporting, calling for new export incentives. That transformation, in turn, depends on the accumulation of new and different core competencies, a focus on quality, acceptance of cross-border integrated manufacturing, as distinct from stand-alone operations in Zimbabwe and a radical change in official attitudes to the immigration of skilled personnel and access to intellectual property.</p>

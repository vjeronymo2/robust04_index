			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL CARD BETTING OPPOSED  </P> <P> Massachusetts lottery officials said today that a proposed football card  betting game could net $40 million a year, but a National Football League  executive said it would cheapen the sport. Lottery Director James Hosker said  the game, similar to Oregon's, would also put a dent in illegal gambling by  providing a legal outlet for those who like to bet on football cards.  </P> <P> "In Massachusetts, pool card betting is very popular," Hosker said at a hearing  of the Legislature's Government Regulations Committee.  </P> <P> The football betting bill is sponsored by Rep. William Galvin (D-Boston), House  chairman of the committee and a candidate for state treasurer. The treasurer's  office oversees the lottery.  </P> <P> Jay Moyer, executive vice president of the National Football League,  accompanied by New England Patriots quarterback Steve Grogan, strongly opposed  the bill. "Legalizing sports gambling will threaten public confidence in the  integrity of professional football," Moyer said.  </P></p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Threatened wages board gives farm workers 4.9% The Agricultural Wages Board has awarded farm workers a 4.9 per cent pay rise from June - double the average rate for manual workers' pay settlements this year. Some farm workers said the large increase reflected the board's belief that its days were numbered. The board's most recent awards have been more modest  -between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, told the Commons last night that she hoped statements on the future of the English and Scottish agricultural wages boards would be made next week. The increase for casual agricultural workers is 2.5 per cent, which takes the overall rise to 4.3 per cent. The settlement, which will cost the farming industry Pounds 54.5m this year, was resisted by employers' representatives on the board. Mr Don Wilkinson, who led the employers' negotiating team, said: 'We had impressed upon the board the need to take into account the financial uncertainty facing farmers and growers in the years ahead.' The settlement means an increase of Pounds 6.78 per week on the current minimum rate of Pounds 138.31 for a farm worker in England and Wales. Mrs Shephard refused to accept that the low pay level justified the continued existence of the agricultural wages board, saying groups of workers in manufacturing, hotels and catering, and the distributive trades were in the same position. But she said the 'vast majority' of 4,000 responses to a consultation exercise were in favour of the board's retention. The Labour party said it was crucial that all the activities of the board should continue but it feared that the government would retain the form but not the substance. It added that the latest award would still make agricultural pay less than three-quarters of the average for industrial workers.</p>

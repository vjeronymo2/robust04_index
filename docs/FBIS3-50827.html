			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] President Alberto Fujimori revealed today that  Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen's upcoming visit to Peru  has been postponed until further notice. The head of state also  referred to other issues during the various activities he  carried out at the settlement of Huaycan. [passage omitted]    Shortly before concluding his tour, he briefly inspected the  site where the local technological institute is being built. In  his statements to the media Fujimori ruled out the possibility  that Ecuadoran President Duran-Ballen's visit to our capital  will take place on 20 January.    [Begin Fujimori recording] The date has not been officially  coordinated at the Foreign Ministry level. In any case, it will  not occur on 20 January -- but we are waiting for our Foreign  Ministry to establish the most appropriate date. We are  obviously waiting for this expectantly, to welcome the president  of our brother country Ecuador with open arms, as he deserves.  [end recording]</p>

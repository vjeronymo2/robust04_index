			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Miyazawa attacks Bundesbank cuts THIS week's cut in German interest rates was insufficient, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, said yesterday in a rare outspoken criticism of another country's economic policy. Mr Miyazawa, speaking before the sharp rise in British rates, said the half-point cut in the German discount rate to 8.25 per cent would not be large enough to provide currency markets with long-term stability given the strength of the D-Mark. He made his comments amid a welter of grim reports on the gathering downturn in the Japanese economy. Mr Miyazawa said Japan was unlikely to face pressure at this weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers to follow the German cut. His remarks put him at odds with Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, who yesterday welcomed the German move as a step towards calming international currency markets. But Mr Mieno signalled opposition to a further cut in Japanese interest rates, which were lowered by half a point to 3.25 per cent in July. Mr Mieno said he wanted the yen to remain strong to help slow the rapid growth in Japan's trade surplus. The increase in British interest rates is likely to fuel concern in Tokyo that the turmoil in European currency markets will eventually spill over into Japan.</p>

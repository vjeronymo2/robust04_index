			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: Eccentric's collection goes on the road - Elspeth Moncrieff takes up the story of the philanthropist Albert Barnes's Foundation now that Richard Glanton has taken over THE BARNES Foundation situated in Merion, a smart suburb of Philadelphia, is notoriously inaccessible, often dubbed 'the greatest museum you never heard of'. Now it is closing down for two years and, in an unprecedented world tour, has sent 90 or so of its paintings to Washington, going on from there to Paris, Tokyo and two further unconfirmed venues. The exhibition, Great French Paintings From The Barnes Collection, includes such masterpieces as Seurat's 'Poseuses', Matisse's 'Bonheur de Vivre' and Van Gogh's 'Joseph-Etienne Roulin'. Sixteen glorious Renoirs, 20 Cezannes, 15 Matisses and nine Picassos will be exposed to mass public scrutiny for the very first time. The tour, expected to raise Dollars 15m, Dollars 7m of which to restore the Foundation's buildings and the rest to boost the existing Dollars 9.8m endowment fund, has whipped up a storm of controversy. Many people question the conservation issues involved and the ethics of overturning the will of its eccentric founder, Dr Albert Barnes. In a typically American 'rags to riches' story, Barnes, the son of a Philadelphian butcher, made his fortune through the discovery of a patented antiseptic, and acquired an art collection. Not for him the pursuit of famous Old Masters to aggrandise his social status. Instead he scoured the Parisian dealers and studies for modern art, purchasing 171 Renoirs, 57 Cezannes 54 Matisses and 19 Picassos and 'discovered' Soutine who, with Modigliani and other School of Paris painters, he introduced to the US. Barnes decided to turn his collection into a personal 'educational experiment under the principles of modern psychology as applied to education.' The Barnes Foundation was created in 1922; it was never conceived as a public gallery but as a place for the education of 'plain people who gain their livelihood from daily toil'. Barnes's own factory workers were subjected to the experiment with two hour breaks put aside for aesthetic instruction. The display of the galleries was never to be altered from Barnes's idiosyncratic hang which ignored art historical schools. Paintings by Picasso and Modigliani are juxtaposed with second rate old masters, African masks, Greek sculpture and New Mexico folk art. There are no labels or explanations. To complete his experiment, Barnes introduced a collection of metalwork. Candlesticks and tea pots sit in front of paintings by Matisse and Picasso and weather vanes hinges and keyholes punctuate the walls at regular intervals along with brightly coloured American Folk art, pottery, painted chests and furniture and Navajo rugs. Barnes had broken down the established perimeters surrounding art history, but the effect is so bizarre one senses a wicked sense of humour below the apparent seriousness. King in his little kingdom, he delighted in turning away such luminaries as Le Corbusier, TS Elliot or millionaire collector Walter Chrysler. None of the works were ever to be lent or reproduced in colour - the exhibition catalogue is the first of its kind - and social activities, with their associated preening and posturing, were not permitted inside the galleries. A decade after Barnes's death in 1951, after its tax exempt status had been challenged, the Foundation was forced to admit the public two and a half days a week. Otherwise it remained frozen in time. Barnes appointed Lincoln University, a small local black college with the power to nominate four of the five Barnes Trustees. In 1990, a combination of circumstances saw Richard Glanton elected Chairman of the board of Trustees and the pace of this inward looking institution was dramatically changed. Glanton is a 46 year old ambitious African-American attorney who has no artistic or museum qualifications. He decided that the building was in need of an urgent conservation and security upgrade and proposed selling Dollars 15 million of paintings to finance the operation. A storm of protest shook America and Glanton quickly changed his tactics. He enlisted Walter Annenberg, the Philadelphian publishing billionaire and art collector on his side, which silenced all museum opposition. Annenberg, one of the most generous patrons of American Museums, was at the time courting four leading Institutions who all hoped to receive his magnificent collection of Impressionists. In the event he left it to the Metropolitan in New York. Glanton explained that the idea for the tour and accompanying catalogue came from Annenburg. Suddenly Museum directors throughout the world were eating out of his hand at the thought of the prestige and ticket revenues this remarkable and unknown collection would bring. Paris has agreed a loan fee of Dollars 2.5m, Tokyo Dollars 4.5m and the Royal Academy tried desperately to secure the exhibition for London, but failed, unable to raise the necessary sponsorship. The contract to publish the catalogue has been awarded to Alfred A Knopf, and a licensing agent has been hired to unlease a flood of Barnes memorabilia, reproductions of 16 of the paintings will cost Dollars 600 each. Glanton estimates the potential revenue at about Dollars 15 million. Glanton's critics, led by the students of the foundation, claim he is destroying its very essence. By seeking a court injunction to overturn the founders will and tour and publish the collection he has violated a basic moral trust. Glanton counters their claims with equanimity, he wants only to bring the foundation securely into the 21st century. In the future he hopes to turn the Barnes into 'a full educational institution, running accredited courses with two chaired professors endowed from Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania.' One of Glanton's most outspoken critics is the New York dealer Richard Feigen, who was formerly a Lincoln board member and on the Barnes Foundation's Art Advisory committee. He questions the whole raison d'etre of the tour and the wisdom of subjecting masterpieces of this size and quality to such hazardous exposure. Prior to Glanton's appointment he had undertaken detailed surveys into the condition of the building. 'It was not in that bad condition. The paintings are all on canvas and on the whole in exceptionally good condition. The humidity, ventilation, air-conditioning and security systems could have been brought up to standard with the minimum of disruption to the Foundation and the students and the money obtained through an appeal. And if the building is in such appalling condition why are the paintings fit to travel?'. Glanton admits that the paintings are 'in pristine condition and have not as yet suffered any damage.' However, 'the building is a long term hazard and if they continue in poor environmental conditions there will be serious consequences.' What ever the tour's detractors claim, this is an exhibition the crowds will flock to. But although the paintings may look their very best in the high-tech conditions of a Washington or Paris show, seen thus they will have little to do with the spirit of Albert Barnes. The selection has focused on the most popular aspects of the collection virtually ignoring Soutine and the school of Paris and all the applied arts so dear to Barnes. To understand one of this century's true eccentrics take the pilgrimage to Merion to see the Picasso hanging next to the pitchfork on the old burlap covered walls. Great French paintings from the Barnes collection, National Gallery of Art, Washington until August 15; Musee d'Orsay, Paris, September 6-January 2 1994; National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, January 21-April 3, 1994. Other dates and venues to be determined.</p>

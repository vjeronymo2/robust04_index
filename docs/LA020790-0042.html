			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LANCASTER WILL PAY FOR FIREPLACE REPAIRS  </P> <P> Lancaster city officials, responding to pleas from angry homeowners, have  agreed to spend up to $160,000 to pay for repairs to as many as 32 homes with  unsafe and potentially flammable fireplaces.  </P> <P> A December fire at a modular home in the Panorama Village tract in east  Lancaster was caused by a faulty fireplace and led city officials to order  homeowners to demolish or rebuild them to make them safe.  </P> <P> Faced with that order, homeowners appealed to the city for financial aid.  </P> <P> Sitting as directors of the city's redevelopment agency, members of the  Lancaster City Council voted 3 to 0 Monday to hire a contractor to make the  repairs. Homeowners with low-to-moderate incomes will be eligible for the  city-funded repairs.  </P> <P> Residents of the tract, north of Avenue K and west of 25th Street East, had  blamed the developer for building the faulty fireplaces partially on wooden  supports, and the city for not catching the problem when the homes were built  about 1984.  </P> <P> City officials, in turn, suggested that developer Jerry McGuire or Willdan  Associates, the private company that did the city's building inspections at the  time, should bear the blame. But McGuire no longer is an active developer in  the area, and the city no longer contracts with Willdan.  </P> <P> Other fireplace flaws have been discovered recently in homes in other area  cities.  </P></p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Business Law: Challenge to legal basis for waste directive rejected - European Law The European Court of Justice last week rejected a joint challenge by the European Commission and the European Parliament to the legal basis chosen by the Council for a directive on waste. A proposal for the directive was first put forward by the Commission in 1988. The legal basis suggested by the Commission for the directive related to the establishment and functioning of the single market. The Council adopted the proposal but chose a different legal basis related specifically to the protection of the environment. At stake was the relative power of the Commission and the Parliament to influence the final shape of the directive. Under the single market legislative procedure the Commission and the Parliament have greater powers of negotiation with the Council over the adoption of amendments than under the environmental legislative procedure. The Court said the choice of legal basis had to be based on objective criteria capable of judicial control. The most important criteria were the aims and content of the legislation in question. It ruled that although there were certain elements in the directive which impacted on the functioning of the single market - for instance the introduction of a common definition of waste and related activities  - the main aim and contents related to environmental protection. The legal basis chosen by the Council was therefore correct. The Parliament attempted to introduce a new ground for judicial review which had not been raised by the Commission. The Court rejected it on the grounds that an intervening party is limited to supporting the arguments put forward by one of the main parties. C-155/91: Commission (with the European Parliament intervening) v Council (with Spain intervening), ECJ FC, 17 March 1993. German rules on foreign seamen upheld. The European Court has ruled that German rules which allow its merchant navy to employ seamen from outside the Community who are neither domiciled nor resident in Germany on less favourable terms than German seamen are not contrary to the Rome treaty. The case arose out of a dispute between a ship operator and its works council. The ship operator wanted to employ a Filipino radio operator and five other Filipino ratings. Under German law non-EC seamen can be employed on ships flying the German flag without being subject to German law and in particular without the necessity to pay the social security contributions payable for German workers. The dispute went before the national court at which point the works council claimed the relevant German rules were contrary to Rome treaty provisions on state aid and general social conditions. The European Court said the national rules, effectively allowing Germany to discriminate in favour of non-German seamen, were valid. The rules did not constitute state aid. The Court rejected the Commission's argument that they did because their aim - to make the German merchant navy more competitive by granting advantages to it - clearly encapsulated all the elements of state aid. In order for a measure to come within the scope of the Rome treaty provisions on state aid it was necessary to show that the advantages in question arose directly from a grant by the state in question or through resources of that state. In relation to social conditions the court said implementation of the objective of the rules was for the national authorities to determine.

Other cases A company which has incurred loses due to administrative delays by an EC state can rely on force majeure provisions in the relevant Community legislation even though it has failed to take measures laid down in the legislation to protect its position.

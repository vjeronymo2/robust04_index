Kelli McIlvain of the Ventura  County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Kosashi had arrived home and heard voices in the house, McIlvain said.  </P> <P> Drickerson and Ariztia, both of the Newbury Park area of Thousand Oaks, entered  Kosashi's house and caught two of three suspects upstairs, McIlvain said. A  third suspect fled the house, which had been ransacked, he said. Possessions  had been stacked, McIlvain said.  </P> <P> Drickerson and Ariztia held the two suspects -- a male and a female, both of  Northridge -- in the bathroom until officers arrived and arrested them,  McIlvain said.  </P> <P> Drickerson and Ariztia also were able to describe the car of the third suspect.  Police arrested Friedrick Widjajawiguna, 18, of Northridge on suspicion of  burglary moments later. He was carrying a few possessions believed to be from  the Kosashi house, McIlvain said.  </P></p>

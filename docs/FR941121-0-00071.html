			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Any person may submit oral or written statements and data concerning the draft permit or permit revision. Reasonable limits may be set upon the time allowed for oral statements, and the submission of statements in writing may be required. The public comment period under paragraph (d) of this section shall be automatically extended to the close of any public hearing under this subsection. The hearing officer may also extend the comment period by so stating at the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A tape recording or written transcript of the hearing shall be made available to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Obligation to raise issues and provide information during the public comment period.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the Administrator's tentative decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must raise all reasonably ascertainable issues and submit all reasonably ascertainable arguments supporting their position by the close of the public comment period (including any public hearing). Any supporting materials which are submitted shall be included in full and may not be incorporated by reference, unless they are already part of the administrative record in the same proceeding, or consist of State or Federal statutes and regulations, EPA documents of general applicability, or other generally available reference materials. Commenters shall make supporting materials not already included in the administrative record available to EPA as directed by the Administrator. (A comment period longer than 30 days may be necessary to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (g). Additional time shall be granted to the extent that a commenter who requests additional time demonstrates the need for such time.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reopening of the public comment period.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)(i) The Administrator may order the public comment period reopened if the procedures of this paragraph (h) could expedite the decisionmaking process. When the public comment period is reopened under this paragraph (h), all persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the Administrator's tentative decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must submit all reasonably available factual grounds supporting their position, including all supporting material, by a date, not less than 60 days after public notice under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, set by the Administrator. Thereafter, any person may file a written response to the material filed by any other person, by a date, not less than 20 days after the date set for filing of the material, set by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

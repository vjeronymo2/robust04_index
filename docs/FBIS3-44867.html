			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Agnes Cheung and Cary Huang] </F>   [Text] Former Chinese president Yang Shangkun has called  for strengthening the prestige of the third generation leaders  in China during his recent meetings with Guangdong senior party  cadres and army officials, mainland sources have said.    Yang told the leading officials in the southern province  that  it was important to maintain unity in the process of  transferring power to the third generation leadership.    The 86-year-old party elder is now in Shenzhen Special  Economic Zone after visiting Guangzhou a few days ago, according  to the sources.    In his talks to provincial party leaders of Guangdong and  heads of the Guangzhou Military Command Area, Yang also gave his  support to the current economic reforms in the country, sources  said yesterday.    Yang, however, warned against any social instability  triggered off by the reforms.    Some mainland analysts said Yang's trip and remarks were  likely an attempt by the party elder to strengthen his political  influence after he was forced to the sidelines by paramount  leader Deng Xiaoping.    The retired Chinese president has been tipped to be the  political strongman in China after the 89-year-old Deng dies.    Deng is said to be in Shanghai and in good health.    Analysts said Yang's meeting with military officials  demonstrated that he still had good relationships with the army  although he no longer held actual power.    The pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po in Hong Kong yesterday reported  that Yang arrived Shenzhen on Saturday for "private visit and  vacation".    Yang was said to show "robust health, a firm step and lively  conversation" despite his old age.    The newspaper failed to give details of Yang's trip.    In the spring of 1992, Yang accompanied Deng in the  paramount  leader's landmark tour to Shenzhen during which Deng called for  faster reform and opening.    The two life-long aides, however, split later that year.    This was apparently due to Deng's move in stripping Yang and  his half brother Yang Baibing from their military positions.    Last March Yang Shangkun stepped down from the state  presidency, officially ending his front stage role in China's  political arena.    Yang's visit to Shenzhen and Zhuhai added speculation that  his rift with Deng had widened as he did not spend his new year  holiday with the patriarch in Shanghai.    However, there were reports the two elders ended their feud  after Deng showed personal concern for Yang's health.    Meanwhile, other sources said that relevant departments in  Guangdong had been told to get ready for the arrival of Deng at  any time.    Sources said Deng had considered a visit to Guangzhou as his  family urged him to do so for the sake of his health.    Deng's family was said to have considered the weather in  Shanghai too cold for the patriarch.    It was understood that Guangdong officials hoped the supreme  leader would visit the province, making it another major centre  of development aside from Shanghai.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sponsors target global goals - How US companies are making the most of their association with the 1994 World Cup With the opening game of the 1994 World Cup football finals less than three months away, the tournament's main corporate sponsors are spending millions of dollars trying to make the most of their association with it. Yet involvement is something of a double-edged sword for the biggest US companies sponsoring the month-long sporting spectacular: car maker General Motors; Mars, the confectionery group; fast food chain McDonald's; Gillette, the consumer products group, and the soft drinks group Coca-Cola. Sponsors can gain valuable international exposure by marketing their products in countries where people are passionately interested in football, and where the World Cup is widely regarded as the biggest event on the sporting calendar. In the US, however, being a main sponsor of the tournament is considerably less rewarding. Football, or 'soccer' as the Americans call it, is very much a minority sport and the World Cup holds little significance for most of the country. A survey conducted at the end of last year by a London research company found that only 35 per cent of Americans even knew that the World Cup was being held in the US this summer. That compares with 99 per cent awareness in Brazil and 83 per cent in Germany. With an apparently unreceptive domestic audience, it makes sense for US sponsors to focus most of their advertising and marketing dollars on foreign markets. Having spent a reported Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.60m) on sponsorship rights, they are determined to get their money's worth. Coca-Cola, a World Cup sponsor since 1978, has developed a variety of marketing events and products for consumers overseas. Gary Hite, the company's vice-president in charge of international sports marketing, says: 'The fact of the site of the event is not a core reason why we're involved . . . We bought into it because it is such a magnificent global event. We'd be involved in it if it wasn't being held in the US.' Gillette, the US company with the longest history of backing the World Cup, also believes the greatest value of the company's sponsorship is in football's worldwide popularity. 'No other sporting event can match the World Cup in terms of marketing power,' said Alfred Zeien, Gillette's chairman, at December's World Cup draw in Las Vegas. Among Gillette's marketing initiatives, the emphasis is on gaining exposure for its products in overseas markets. 'Soccer is the universal language. If you set out to match a global brand with a global sport, there is no better choice,' says Gillette. Other US sponsors view the World Cup from the same perspective. Mava Heffler, vice-president of promotions at the credit card company Mastercard, which expects to have spent at least Dollars 75m on sponsorship and advertising by the time the tournament is over, says: 'We have targeted the World Cup as a platform to help us build brand awareness internationally.' All of the main sponsors are employing similar tactics to exploit their relationship with the World Cup. Commemorative products abound (special Coke cans, a limited edition Gillette Sensor razor), as do competitions offering cash prizes or trips to World Cup games. Television, however, is at the heart of most marketing initiatives: by the end of the World Cup, a cumulative audience of between 25bn and 30bn is expected to have watched the tournament. McDonald's has chosen to broadcast its first global television commercial for the World Cup, a single 30-second spot which will air on six continents, starting next week. Mastercard is also running a global television commercial, featuring the Brazilian footballer Pele. Other companies will be sponsoring special programmes or television series for broadcast around the world. Gillette is backing a 13-part series on the World Cup that will be seen in more than 50 countries. Coca-Cola is launching a 'Coca-Cola World Cup '94 Radio Network', which will broadcast reports and features on the tournament to foreign countries. Sponsors are keen to utilise the large advertising boards - rarely seen in US sports - which surround the football pitch. GM plans to match them to television viewers in each country. Thus, when a team from Europe or South East Asia is playing, it will use the boards to display the logo of Opel, the company's chief brand in those two regions. Similarly, the name of Chevrolet, the brand which GM sells in Latin America, will be on display for games involving countries such as Brazil and Mexico. Jim Latham, GM's project manager for World Cup '94, says this 'tele-targeting' - aiming different boards at different audiences - is many times more effective in reaching viewers in Europe than in the US. 'Advertising on soccer pitches is very well-known and means something in non-US markets,' he says. While aiming to make a big impression overseas with their World Cup marketing, US sponsors have not taken their eye off the ball at home, even if many Americans are more likely to be watching baseball during June and July. In the US, sponsors are focusing their marketing in niche markets, such as the nine cities hosting the games, and among immigrant communities where football's popularity is strong. The Spanish-speaking market is attracting the most attention - Coca-Cola and McDonald's, for example, have organised 'La Copa Coca Cola', a regional amateur football tournament. The sponsors are also hoping that Americans will pay attention to the World Cup once they realise how important it is to the rest of the world. Hite says: 'Americans love big events. Once people realise what a huge event it is, they're going to say: 'I want to be a part of that'.' Ultimately, the extent of interest in the US will depend greatly on how well the US national team does in the tournament.</p>

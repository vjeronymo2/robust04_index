			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The UK gilts market passed another milestone yesterday when the June future slipped through par for the first time since January 1993. Those groping for reasons may cite the steep growth in M0 money supply and evidence that the economy is continuing to grow despite April's tax increases. Such factors may indeed prompt the Bank of England to start wondering about when it should tighten monetary policy again. But cash selling has been limited. Gilts' weakness has been above all driven by speculative selling of the futures. That in turn leaves markets looking prey to some pretty irrational fears. The short sterling contract, for example, suggests that base rates will be as high as 6.5 per cent by December and that they will rise by a total of two percentage points between September and June next year. That might just happen with a sudden resurgence of inflation and a sharp fall in sterling. The balance of probability is that it will not. Cooler heads might prefer to consider yields of almost 9 per cent available on 10-year conventional gilts and nearly 4 per cent in index-linked paper. Gilts yield nearly two full percentage points more than their German equivalent. That is a rare premium which compares with a differential of only around 50 basis points when the market peaked. The water may still be choppy but fundamental value is discernible on the shore.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lazard Invest launches high income trust Lazard Investors is launching a high income investment trust, which will invest in convertible preference shares and convertible bonds. The Lazard High Income Trust is a revamped version of Grahams Rintoul's High Income trust, which was scheduled to be launched in March. The proposed gross yield on the trust has fallen from 8.5 to 8 per cent since March, mainly because of the Budget change which reduced the tax credit on dividends. The trust has dropped earlier plans for gearing via the issue of zero dividend preference shares. The trust will pay quarterly dividends and will have a six year life, with no further share issues intended. The minimum investment will be Pounds 1,000.</p>

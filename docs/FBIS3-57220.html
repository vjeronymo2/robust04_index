It is  envisioned that as a result of implementing the proposed  program, the share of the non-state sector in the economy will  come to 28 percent and that the state will receive over 21  trillion karbovantsi and approximately $230 million. Delivering  a report, Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of the Supreme Council  commission for issues of economic reform and management of the  national economy, mentioned 11 observations regarding the draft  of the said program, and stressed the necessity of applying  administrative penalties to officials who disregard the  privatization process. After Supreme Council commissions have  elaborated the draft, taking into account proposals expressed by  people's deputies during the discussion, it will be resubmitted  for hearings during the next plenary cycle of sessions.    A law "On the procedure for leaving and entering Ukraine for  citizens of Ukraine" was adopted. It envisions simplification  of the procedure for formalizing exit documents. Speaker  Valentyn Nedryhaylo, first deputy minister of internal affairs  of Ukraine, replied to questions on the investigation in the  affair of the disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, head of the  People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh] secretariat. Four main  versions of the disappearance are being worked on, additional  ones have appeared, and Interpol and investigative bodies from  CIS countries have joined the investigation, but so far,  according to Valentyn Nedryhaylo, "new signals have not been  received." A law "On state secrets" was adopted without  fundamental changes; the law "On data protection in automated  systems" was approved in its first reading, and the Forestry  Code of Ukraine, which was adopted, will come into force from  the day of publication.    The next plenary session of the Supreme Council will take  place on 25 January.</p>

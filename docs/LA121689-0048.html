			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEW IN BRIEF: YOUTH, 15, SENT TO PRISON IN KILLING OF  CLASSMATE  </P> <P> A computer analyst's 15-year-old son, who shot to death a Glassell Park junior  high school classmate for wearing a jersey carrying the name of a rival gang,  was sentenced in an Eastlake Juvenile courtroom Friday to 17 years to life  imprisonment. Because the youth is a minor, he will be set free at the age of  25 if he is not paroled before then, attorneys in the case said. The youth  confessed to shooting Mark Iwashita, 14, at point-blank range on Aug. 8, the  day after Iwashita wore an "Atwater-13" jersey to Washington Irving Junior High  School. While the convicted youth's father, who works for IBM, and his mother  and brother stood by, Judge Jaime Corral told the teen-ager that he was  "fortunate that your parents are more stable than most families that come to  this court. Because of your age and the support of your family, there is hope  for you."  </P></p>

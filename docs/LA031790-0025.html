			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION SPRAYING FOR THE PESKY MEDFLY  </P> <P> It seems abundantly clear that a large number of citizens do not approve of the  aerial spraying of malathion upon our communities.  </P> <P> Yet our state government seems, at best, sluggish and aloof in its response to  citizen concerns regarding this issue. My question is this: From where does the  power of government stem? Based upon the experience of this ongoing malathion  saga, the power of government obviously does not reside with us ordinary  citizens.  </P> <P> The implications brought forth in this struggle go far beyond the pros and cons  of malathion -- what might be suggested is an implementation of basic  democratic reforms in this country.  </P> <P> BEN MILES  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: An updated Rake that progresses nowhere - Festival d'Aix-en-Provence THE CONJUNCTION of a new Rake's Progress, brought to the stage of the Theatre de l'Archeveche by Alfredo Arias, with the revival from last year of Robert Carsen's hit production of A Midsummer Night's Dream gave the Aix Festival the opportunity for its very own study in Anglo-Saxon manners. It was not a survey of eccentricity that many English would recognise now, but clearly it touched chords and confirmed prejudices with a good portion of the French audience. There, though, any parallels between the two stagings begin and end, for where Carsen's production seems to me a milestone in the stage history of Britten's opera, Arias' half-baked realisation deserves to be quickly forgotten. There might well be an updating of The Rake that would give good mileage - with Tom Rakewell as 1980s yuppy perhaps, given his year of dissolute high living courtesy of all the Nick Shadows of high Thatcherism, and with any number of possible candidates for the roles of Mother Goose and Baba the Turk. Arias settled for something much woolier and less specific. While the costumes placed it somewhere in the first half of this century, his idee fixe was to double the three protagonists with dancers, who embroidered each set piece with their own parallel plot, carefully choreographed by Andy Degroat. It was never illuminating, only distracting. Even before the opera began the inmates of the Bedlam asylum were swarming over the stage; that they were all female, and found themselves in some pretty lurid postures raised suspicions from the start. Meanwhile a television set was offering edited highlights from Hogarth's engravings and soon showed itself to be another idee, dispensing a succession of Highly Meaningful Images - a pair of doves billing and cooing at one point (for Tom and Anne of course), a mouse trapped in a wheel, even, heaven help us, the Household Cavalry on parade. Not so long ago the recruitment of circus midgets used to be a reliable indicator of a desperate directorial imagination; now televisions showing irrelevant video clips have been added to the opera's director's more dubious baggage. It was all a great pity. For though the cast's American accents emphasised the out-of-kilter 'Englishness' of the proceedings, and often drew attention to the unruly prosody of Auden and Kallman's text, the three central roles were as strongly presented as could be imagined in international opera today. Samuel Ramey has been the definitive Nick Shadow for the best part of a decade and here combined a wonderfully economical stage presence and oleaginous style with singing of understated menace and impeccable clarity. Dawn Upshaw's Anne was utterly straightforward, prim, sweet and all the more moving in the second half of the opera for her very restraint. She particularly made the presence of a balletic double seem utterly superfluous. Jerry Hadley was Tom; when one overcame the culture shock of hearing the lines sung with such forthright vigour and almost a Broadway style of phrasing, his performance became a compelling demonstration of vocal prowess. The Mr Truelove of John Macurdy inevitably seemed less assertive, but together with Joan Khara's ample Mother Goose and Victoria Vergara's Baba the Turk (a replacement for the ailing Tatiana Troyanos) ensured a cast with no weak points. Kent Nagano conducted, with the kind of elegance and concern for texture and phrasing that are characteristic of his Stravinsky. Had the dramatic context only offered more, this would have been a Rake's Progress of exemplary distinction.                         *       *       * The theatrical discipline and visual flair of the Dream only underlined the shortcomings of the Stravinsky. The awards and praise showered on the production last year seem entirely deserved, for it offers a vision of Britten's opera that is both breathtakingly seductive and thoroughly perceptive. Carsen's concept, using a colour scheme of bright green and deep blue (designs by Michael Levine) is carried through without ever faltering; it hardly matters that not all the ideas are freshly minted. Its parade of true English eccentrics - Puck as dirty-raincoated flasher, Lysander regency fop, Demetrius City gent, the fairies a regiment of frockcoated public schoolboys - is never overplayed, and crucially never suffocates the individual performances of a fine cast. There is no space to catalogue the contribution of every singer, but James Bowman's Oberon is now more sensitive of phrasing and colour than ever, and Lilian Watson's Titania, was comprehensively seductive in voice and demeanour. Juliet Booth's painfully frumpy Helena, John Graham-Hall's impossibly gangling Lysander, and Peter Rose's irrepressible Bottom must be mentioned, together with Emil Wolk's virtuoso, menacing Puck. Steuart Bedford's conducting (of the English Chamber Orchestra) unfolded the score with exemplary care. Even those who regard A Midsummer Night's Dream as one of Britten's most problematic operas would have laid their misgivings aside and been held spellbound by this exceptional version, for which a revival is promised in Paris, Lyon and Montpellier in two years' time.</p>

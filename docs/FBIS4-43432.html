			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with U.S. movie director Allan </F> Francovich by Giovanni Porta in London; date not given:  "Explosive Scenario"]    [Text] The skies over Lockerbie, Scotland, 21 December  1988: A bomb hidden in the baggage compartment of the Pan Am  Boeing 747 en route from London to New York explodes, destroying  the aircraft. In the disaster 259 passengers and crew members  lost their lives and 11 Scottish citizens were killed by the  flaming wreckage. In 1990, after lengthy investigations, the  Governments of Britain and the United States formally accused  two Libyan agents of organizing the attack. The Libyan trail is  still considered today as the only valid one supported by proof.  Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's government, isolated by the  international community's condemnation and subjected to an  economic embargo by the United Nations, has always tried to  prove its innocence. It does not appear to have succeeded in  the attempt, despite millions of dollars spent on propaganda  initiatives.    Today, a new initiative which can be traced back to the  authorities in Tripoli proposes a disconcerting version of the  events, which has already sparked a fiery controversy and looks  set to unhinge many certainties.    The rendezvous was in a small Italian cafe in Soho, London,  against a backdrop of blue-movie cinemas and small antique  shops. Allan Francovich, an Italian-Croatian-American producer  and director specializing in controversial investigative fims on  the dark world of secret services -- "A Company Business," on  the mysteries of the CIA; the TV series on Gladio, NATO's secret  organization, broadcast by the BBC, which caused a huge stir --  chose this anonymous venue for the interview since it was safe  from prying eyes and ears. For some weeks he has felt that he  is in danger: The phones in the headquarters of Hemar  Enterprises Inc., his production company, appear to have been  bugged "by the British secret services"; the director's whole  team of operators, analysts, and research people is apparently  being followed by plain-clothes agents; he himself claims to  have received death threats.    Allan Francovich's secret is sealed in a video cassette  containing a new "startling" TV documentary on the Lockerbie  disaster, with the vaguely literary title of "The Maltese Double  Cross." This is a tape which nobody has yet seen -- "It will be  ready in five weeks' time" -- but which is already at the center  of a raging controversy in Britain and the United States: The  government in London is threatening to ban distribution; the  British TV Channel 4, which intended to broadcast the  investigation, has unexpectedly severed all contacts with  Francovich; the U.S. judicial authorities are on the trail of  two of the director's closest staff, in hiding in West Europe;  the families of the 270 people who died in the disaster are  quarreling openly, split between supporters -- led by Briton Jim  Swire, a relation of one of the victims -- and opponents --  lawyer Lee Kreindler, defending the interests of the U.S.  families -- of the film.    The controversy exploded in November 1993 following a  FINANCIAL TIMES report on the origin of the 633,000 pounds (some  1.5 billion lire) allocated for the making of the film. It  transpired that Hemar, a company set up on the British Virgin  Isles solely for this purpose, was backed by a consortium with  Libyan connections: the conglomerate Lonrho, controlled by the  controversial finance mogul "Tiny" Rowland, and LAFICO, the  Tripoli government's powerful holding company.    Allan Francovich did not want to reveal the "plot" of his  film, "a preview screening of which will be shown to the  relations of the British victims." But in the course of our  conversation, he ended up by divulging the trails he followed in  his investigations. The main sources he used for his  "fieldwork" were: "The Trail of the Octopus," a book by Lester  Coleman, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency [DIA] agent,  who is interviewed at length in the film; a 27-page confidential  report (which PANORAMA was able to view) commissioned by Pan Am  from a private investigation agency, Interfor Inc., owned by  Juval Aviv, an Israeli citizen; "first-hand" information  provided by Oswald Le Winter (alias Ibrahim Razin, alias  Professor Sermit), a shady character convicted for false witness  in the United States and a former international drug smuggler  "on behalf of the CIA and Colonel Oliver North"; and  confidential information "obtained by our contacts in the secret  services of various Arab countries and West and East Europe."  <H5>  300 Gms of Semtex </H5>   The complicated version which "The Maltese Double Cross"  would have us believe goes something like this: The bomb which  destroyed the Pan Am Boeing on 21 December 1988 was not shipped  from Malta, via Frankfurt, by Libyan agents Lamine Khalifah  Fahimah and 'Abd-al Basit 'Ali al-Miqrahi: The evidence  gathered on the island against the two was apparently  "skillfully fabricated." The device is said to have been  identical to those hidden in certain tape recorders and  electronic apparatus discovered by the German police in a base  belonging to the PPLF-GC (Palestine Popular Liberation  Front--General Command) in Duesseldorf on 26 October 1988. The  bomb -- 300 gms of Semtex explosive with a timer manufactured by  a firm called Mebo AG in Zurich -- was apparently placed inside  a Toshiba tape recorder hidden inside an unaccompanied suitcase  shipped from Frankfurt. The timer, an MST-13 manufactured by  Swiss expert Edwin Bollier, may have been made available to the  PPLF-GC by the East German security service Stasi, a theory put  forward in a recent article in the weekly DER SPIEGEL. The  suitcase was apparently part of one of the "controlled drug  shipments" customarily organized by the CIA and the DIA between  the Middle East and the United States in support of their own  fifth columns in the Arab world and terrorist circles. The  extremist Palestinian grouping led by Ahmad Jibril, with Syrian  connections, appears to have discovered the existence of this  traffic (tolerated by the German authorities, which did not  subject the drug suitcases to the usual checks) and to have  taken advantage of this knowledge to place the bomb; the action  was apparently carried out, with Syria's assent, to the order of  the government in Tehran in retaliation for the downing of an  Iranian Airbus in the Persian Gulf by the U.S. frigate Vincennes  on 3 July 1988.    Before the attack -- according to Francovich and his team --  the U.S. secret services received "at least 16 danger warnings,  some of which were extremely detailed," from Israel's Mosad and  another anonymous source. Nobody did anything to stop the Pan  Am aircraft or to warn the passengers -- or at least the  "ordinary" passengers: In fact, a number of important South  African politicians were due to board flight PA 103 on 21  December, "but they were obviously warned because they canceled  their reservations at the last minute."    "The CIA's men were in Lockerbie a mere two hours after the  disaster, frantically searching the wreckage," Francovich  explained. "They were coordinated by Vincent Cannistraro, a  well-known expert in disinformation operations and one of the  originators of the plan to eliminate al-Qadhdhafi." Cannistraro  "is still today at the head of the CIA team entrusted with the  investigations, and he is one of the leading supporters of the  Libyan trail."  <H5>  New Backers </H5>   Today, following the press leaks on the film's backers,  Lonrho and its partners have apparently withdrawn their support  and sold Hemar, along with the film rights. "I have been  contacted by new backers," Francovich said, "bankers, men who  have worked with Armand Hammer and Bernie Cornfeld and who want  to take over. Director Oliver Stone is interested in producing  the documentary."    "Our enemies," the director continued, "are afraid of the  terrible truths which we have discovered and can prove." "The  Libyan trail is certainly the most convenient and the easiest to  get international public opinion to swallow," the director  explained, "but we want to know why, in all these years, the  governments which want to bring the two Libyan citizens to trial  have never published the evidence they claim to have against  them. No serious investigation has ever been conducted into the  Lockerbie disaster. For the first time, our investigation  reconstructs the events which led up to the Jumbo's explosion;  it sheds light on the key characters involved in the attack, and  on the men from the CIA, the DIA, and the German and Middle East  secret services who have taken part in directing the scent  against the Libyans."    If "The Maltese Double Cross" ever gets shown to the public,  it certainly will not quench the desire for justice in the 270  victim's relations.</p>

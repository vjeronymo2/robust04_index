			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / How MI6 thwarted killing of envoy A plot by terrorists in an overseas country to assassinate the ambassador of one of Britain's most important allies was frustrated by British secret service agents, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told the Commons yesterday. In an unprecedented departure from normal practice, he cited the incident as an example of the continuing importance of MI6, the secret intelligence service. With MI5, the home security service, and the government communications centre GCHQ it is to be made more accountable to parliament by the intelligence services bill. Mr Hurd said the assassination plot was uncovered during the Gulf war when British intelligence agencies gained access to premises occupied by a terrorist in a developing country. An operation in a west European country had led directly to the saving of the ambassador's life. Mr Hurd also said that information gathered by the security services had resulted in a top company in one of Britain's European neighbours not proceeding with a construction contract in a developing country. He said: 'Our agency was able to demonstrate from its intelligence that the proposed facilities were intended for the production of weapons of mass destruction.' Mr Hurd stressed that a new committee of six parliamentarians to be appointed by the prime minister would not deal with operational activities. Its task would be to scrutinise the administration, policy and expenditure of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. Mr John Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, welcomed the bill in principle but called for a more dominant role for parliament in the new committee. He suggested that it have at least nine members. Mr Tom King, the former Conservative defence secretary, highlighted the important role being played by the intelligence services in preventing illicit deals in arms emanating from the former Soviet Union. The bill, already approved by the Lords, was given an unopposed second reading.</p>

The key to fulfilling this goal is to make  peasants more enthusiastic in growing cotton. Now, some cadres  and peasants have a lopsided view of cotton production. Some  maintain that cotton is a low-efficiency crop and thus readust  the agricultural production structure to lopsidedly reduce  cotton growing acreage. Others only catch sight of a few minor  projects whose efficiency is higher than that of cotton, and  then put undue emphasis on diversified management to neglect and  give up cotton production. Still others unreasonably compare  the disaster-afflicted cotton fields with bumper-harvest grain  fields and then draw the conclusion that growing cotton is less  profitable than growing grain. All these ideas are extremely  lopsided and harmful and negatively influence cotton production.    To make peasants more enthusiastic about growing cotton, we  must clear up these lopsided ideas, widely propagate the  important role played by the development of cotton production in  developing high-yield and fine-quality agriculture, in  invigorating rural economy, and in increasing peasants' income.  By working out accounts and making comparisons, we should  enable peasants to understand that developing cotton production  is conducive to becoming prosperous. At the same time, all  pertinent departments should set forth feasible measures to  provide good service for peasants in growing cotton and help  peasants solve practical problems in cotton production so that  peasants will be more conscious in growing more cotton, in a  better manner, with a view to bringing about an upsurge in  cotton production.</p>

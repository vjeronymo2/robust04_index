			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: China acts on treasury bonds backlog CHINA'S decision last week to halt new issues of debt and equities securities is a sign of how desperate the authorities are to clear an embarrassing backlog of unsold state treasury bonds. The March 1 issue of Yn30bn (Dollars 5.2bn) was originally due to expire on April 30, but much to the chagrin of the Ministry of Finance, only Yn4bn worth of bonds had been sold by the original expiry date. The low return rate - five and three-year bonds carry coupons of 11 and 10 per cent respectively - coupled with first-quarter inflation of 15.7 per cent make the bonds unattractive to the public who, it seems, would rather speculate in shares. The Ministry of Finance has extended the expiry date in the hope that bonds will be sold, but prospects are not good. Trading prices have fallen below their face value at most trading centres. The bonds were issued two months early this year in the hope they would be sold before enterprise bonds flood the market later this year. The freeze on new debt and equity issues comes as China is making headway in establishing a regulatory framework for its fledgling securities market and is preparing to do the same for its mushrooming futures markets. New regulations issued last week by the state council, China's cabinet, were aimed at stiffening the country's stock market regulatory framework, pending the promulgation next year of a new national securities law. The new rules cover nine aspects of stock market activity, including public offerings, general trading, corporate takeovers, continuous disclosure, investigation procedures and arbitration of disputes. Last week's interim regulations are also aimed at facilitating the listing of Chinese companies on overseas exchanges. Nine state enterprises are seeking listing in Hong Kong. Publication of the new regulations caused the Shanghai index to plummet because speculators were concerned at the effect stricter supervision would have on the market's fairly lax regulatory environment. The China Securities Regulatory Commission said the new rules were aimed at regularising the activities of China's two stock markets: Shanghai and Shenzen in a Special Economic Zone, adjacent to Hong Kong.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Wigan peer groups band together to offer advice It took 18 months of discussion, persuasion and the occasional bust-up to bring together the four main organisations which provide help and advice for business in Wigan, Lancashire. Finally, last April, the local Training and Enterprise Council, known as Metrotec, the chamber of commerce, the tourism association and the Wigan and Leigh Small Firms Club set up the Wigan Metrotec Employers' Association and moved into shared offices in the centre of town. With final details of the government's plans for a national network of one-stop business advice centres expected within the next few days, initiatives of the sort being undertaken in Wigan are of great interest to government and other business support organisations. Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary and the main mover behind the one-stop shop programme, will be be seeking bids from up to 15 Tecs to run pilot centres. Geoff Birkett, marketing director of Metrotec, believes that the employers' association would qualify to become one of these. The pilots will be expected to start operating from April 1 but the government hopes to have a national network of about 200 advice centres within two years. The purpose is to rationalise Britain's fragmented business support networks so that they become more effective and provide better value for money. There is unlikely to be a shortage of bids for the pilots. Indeed, the problem facing the government in the coming months may be to restrain local advice centres from starting up in an unco-ordinated way and damaging the idea of a cohesive, high-quality network. Metrotec began lobbying other business support organisations shortly after it was set up two-and-a-half-years ago. 'We were concerned that there was no single voice for business,' says Rod England, a Metrotec director, chairman of the employers' association and deputy managing director of the local HJ Heinz factory. The four organisations which make up the employers' association held their first meeting in July 1991. 'There was a natural suspicion and we had to make clear there was no hidden agenda,' says Birkett. The smaller, long-established business groups were wary of being taken over by the Tec, with its Pounds 10m of government funding. Despite these suspicions the four organisations came closer together and the move into shared offices in Wigan town centre last April removed the remaining barriers. Wigan New Enterprise, the local enterprise agency, is in the same building but has yet formally to join the combined grouping while Wigan's chamber of trade has decided in principle to join. The four organisations continue to have their own managing boards though the distinctions are 'melting' and new members are recruited to the employers' association rather than to the chamber or the business club. This avoids a difficulty which might have arisen with differing subscription levels set by the different organisations. Although it has been the Tec which has led the Wigan project, setting up the employers' association as an 'umbrella' organisation means that the partnership could continue if the government ever lost enthusiasm for Tecs. Sharing offices has brought numerous practical benefits. The four organisations run a single information centre for telephone inquiries and personal visits while there is a shared electronic database. Marketing and recruitment are carried out jointly. Despite the co-operation that has already been achieved, there are other important groups which have still to join the network. When the employers' association moves to purpose-built offices near Wigan Pier in 18 months it will be joined by the local authority's economic development unit. The Wigan initiative has attracted interest throughout the north-west. 'People come in and think it looks easy,' says Birkett. 'But they shouldn't underestimate the pain involved.'</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Loring Gives Thanks: Actress and singer Gloria Loring hosts the third annual  "Thanks for Giving" Juvenile Diabetes Foundation special Sunday on USA Cable  Network. "I'm trying to save my son's life," Loring says of her work with the  telethon-like program. Her 15-year-old son Brennan has the disease. Loring said  the special, which airs from 4-8 p.m., raised almost $4 million for diabetes  research last year, and that she hopes even more will be raised Sunday. The  all-star lineup scheduled to appear with Loring includes Alabama, the Jets,  Poison and the Oak Ridge Boys; as well as Mary Tyler Moore, Ed Asner, Fred  Savage, Susan Ruttan, Belinda Carlisle, Richard Mulligan, Alan Thicke, Cheech  Marin and Edward James Olmos.

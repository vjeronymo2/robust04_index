			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 18 ITAR-TASS -- Negotiations in Moscow on  the settlement of the Karabakh conflict, in which Azerbaijan,  Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh took part, is one of the leading  topics in today's national press in Russia.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA says the ceasefire orders issued by the  defence ministers of the three negotiating parties mark the  beginning of implementation in practice of the first stage of  the process which is expected to put an end to the bloodletting  conflict. The newspaper stresses that the agreement between the  three caucasian parties was achieved "through the mediation of  Russian Defence Minister, Army General Pavel Grachev".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA points out that further negotiations  were  regrettably disrupted by the refusal of the Azeri Defence  Minister, Mamedrafi Mamedov to sign the document on ceasefire.  The minister left for Baku without as much as saying goodbye.  "Many observers believe that after the Azeri delegation refused  to sign the Moscow accord, the Azeri leadership will continue to  pursue the old policy and seek to rectify the situation at the  front with the help of new offensive", the newspaper said. "The  hope for peace in Karabakh has proved futile", the headline of  the comment reads.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI comment on the resignation of centrist  Sergey Shakhray as the minister of nationalities and regional  policy and concludes that "another reshuffling is taking place  at the top". The newspaper notes that attempts had repeatedly  been made earlier to divorce Shakhray and "the nationality cause  which he had espoused". The newspaper finds surprising the  promotion to the cabinet of Nikolay Travkin, the leader of the  Duma faction of the Democratic Russian Party. The daily  suggests that he is likely to replace Vice-Premier Aleksandr  Zaveryukha, "a most influential figure in the government", who  is in charge of reforms as a whole and of agricultural sector in  particular.    TRUD is baffled by the fact that Sergey Shakhray "failed to  clear up his own understanding of the reasons behind his sacking  and evaded direct answers to direct questions from journalists".  TRUD concludes that "traditions seem to have remained the same  on the Russian political olympus which existed on the Soviet  one: The veil of secrecy guards closely whatever is happening in  the tope echelons of power, where everything is not half so  idyllic as Russian citizens would like to believe".    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA cites several versions of the scenario  behind the firing of Sergey Shakhray as the minister of  nationalities. One is that Nikolay Yegorov has been appointed  to replace Shakhray in order "to weaken the political influence  of Shakhray as the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord (PRES).    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publish an interview with President Martti  Ahtisaari of Finland who told a group of Russian journalists in  the eve of his departure for Moscow that the present stage in  relations between Russia and Finland is particularly good and  stressed that his visit to Russia would facilitate their further  development.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes an article about President  Boris Yeltsin by vice-president of the Russian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Valentin Feodorov, who used to  be deputy economics minister of Russia. "This is my third  article about Boris Yeltsin, written just as the previous ones,  from the positions of his critically-minded supporter", Feodorov  says. He points out that "people are unable to keep pace with  soaring prices, they eat less and worse and die prematurely, as  they carry the burden of the price liberation which is a  "grandiose affair".    PRAVDA offers an interview with Duma Deputy Anatoliy  Lukyanov, who declares that "the (December 1993) referendum in  the country was illegitimate: the Constitution was supported by  less than one-third of the voters. The rest were against the  policy pursued by the president's team. It means that the  Yeltsin Constitution cannot serve as the basis for advancement".</p>

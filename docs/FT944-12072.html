			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Roads budget faces cut of Pounds 400m Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, is resisting the implementation of savage cuts in his department's budget, amid signs that the Treasury is looking to reduce spending on next year's roads programme by up to Pounds 400m. Although the government's public expenditure survey is due to be completed in the next few days, Department of Transport officials have made last-minute attempts to resist reductions of up to 20 per cent in the annual expenditure on motorways and highways. DoT officials have told the Treasury a cut of this magnitude would be excessive, threatening maintenance for existing routes. However, Dr Mawhinney and his colleagues have accepted that the annual Pounds 2bn roads programme will have to be cut and that reductions cannot be confined to the budgets for 1996-97 and 1997-98. They have also decided that reductions in the annual road building budget must mainly hit new projects and that plans to construct urban by-passes and smaller routes are to be continued. Earlier this year Mr John MacGregor, the then transport secretary, cut the number of big roads projects to just six. The DoT has agreed to build the M1 to M62 link road near Leeds. But cuts could threaten five other projects. These are the M1-A1 link road at Leeds, the A6/M56 Manchester Airport link west, the A102 third crossing at Blackwall under the Thames, the A31 Poole link road in Dorset and the Poole Harbour crossing. The onslaught on the roads budget comes amid clear indications that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will impose a tough public expenditure round in his Budget later this month. In recent weeks Dr Mawhinney has signalled that he wants to implement more environmentally-friendly policies and that this could lead to a renewed focus on public transport. However, he and colleagues have warned the Treasury that up to Pounds 1bn of the annual roads budget is spent on the maintenance of existing routes, and that any reductions in the budget will therefore affect the quality of existing roads.</p>

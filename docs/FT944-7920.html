			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: International coffee market distortion attacked The international coffee sector should be allowed to take full advantage of higher earnings resulting from this year's surge in prices, Mr Celsius Lodder, the new executive director of the International Coffee Organisation, said yesterday. Addressing a meeting of the Interafrican Coffee Organisation in Lome, Mr Lodder attacked producing countries that held down domestic prices artificially or imposed export taxes 'without any regard to overall world supply'. He said such actions limited exports and increased international price volatility at a time when traders and roasters were trying to defend their market shares and build new markets, for example in eastern Europe and Asia. 'Many producers have accumulated losses and debts, and export companies, only recently acting in a free-market, liberalised economy, have not been operating long enough to build up solid working capital,' he added. Mr Lodder, who took up his post last month, said the ICO had to find a new role in a less interventionist world, where the private sector played an increasingly important part. 'The end of the large government coffee authorities, in Brazil and Mexico for example, together with the privatisation of internal and external trade, have contributed to making the private sector virtually dominant in some countries,' he said. The ICO's goals were to increase membership, involve the private sector in its activities, raise its public profile and produce more statistical information and country reports, he said. Among specific projects, he said the ICO would be linked into the Internet, the emerging information superhighway that connects about 2m computers and 7,000 databases around the world. It would also co-ordinate assistance for countries such as Angola and Rwanda, whose coffee sectors have been badly damaged by war or climatic disasters. On production policy, it would develop guidelines for the 'rational self-regulation' of output, putting an emphasis on incentives to improve quality rather than quantity.</p>

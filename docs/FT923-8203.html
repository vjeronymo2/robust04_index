			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Letter: No mention of women over 40 Sir, It is all very well for the Social Security Advisory Committee ('Retirement age of 65 proposed for men and women', August 4) and Howard Davies ('The pragmatic option on pension equality', August 7) to trumpet the virtues of raising the retirement age for women to 65, but they fail to address the issue of how likely women of that age are to find employers who want them. I know many women in their 50s who have been coerced or cajoled into taking early retirement, while a cursory glance at the jobs column in any 'quality' newspaper, including your own, indicates that anyone older than 35 need not waste time dusting off her (or indeed his) CV. If the old song is correct and 'nobody loves a fairy when she's 40', what chance has she when she's 60-plus] It certainly seems unlikely that many UK employers will be lining up to investigate her charms. It may suit the Treasury to withhold the state retirement pension until women reach 65, but does it suit Mr Davies's members to keep employing them? This is an aspect of the debate he failed to mention. Perhaps you could persuade him to pen another article on this very point. As for the government, if ministers are intent on raising women's retirement age, they should surely follow the lead of the United States and make it illegal to discriminate on grounds of age. Americans of my acquaintance gawp in horror at your appointments pages since, by their standards, the bulk of the advertisements you carry in your New York edition are breaking the law.

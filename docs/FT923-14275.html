			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Lamont warned of flawed forecasts THE TREASURY has been told to take all forecasts about the UK economy in the next few years - including its own - with several bucketloads of salt. These projections are likely to be deeply flawed because of a lack of knowledge about how the economy works, and in particular those aspects linked to financial deregulation, according to preliminary results from a study financed by the Treasury. The analysis by the independent National Institute for Economic and Social Research is a painful rebuke for most economic forecasters and raises awkward questions for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as he struggles to end the recession. The analysis was sponsored by the Treasury to gain better insights into inadequacies in its own forecasting methods. Government economists - as well as those in the City and in academic institutes - failed to foresee the extent both of the 1986-88 boom and of the current recession. In the most authoritative study yet into these failings, Mr Andrew Britton and Mr Nigel Pain of the institute say the Treasury and most outside forecasters were equally inaccurate, probably because the standard computer models of how the economy works are faulty. It suggests the Treasury's techniques to calculate the effects of policy switches such as interest rate shifts may not have caught up with the financial reforms of the 1980s. The study - results from which were released yesterday at a conference at Warwick University on forecasting - says economists should take more notice of advance indicators of activity such as housing starts, business confidence and equity prices. It adds that most private sector economists tend to take a consensus view to avoid extremes. The report clears government statisticians - who have been blamed for some of the Treasury's recent forecasting errors on the grounds that they failed to measure the economy properly - of any substantial blame for the inaccurate projections. Looking at specific forecasters, the institute says economists at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the US investment group, were 'perhaps the quickest to pick up the trends within the economy'. The Confederation of British Industry, the City University Business School and Liverpool University gain honourable mentions and Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University is singled out for giving an early warning of the recession. The Treasury said it was looking at the results of the study to 'review directions for new research'. According to Mr Britton and Mr Pain, a strong possibility is that 'structural change, due for example to financial deregulation, has changed the parameters of a number of relationships (in economic models) . . . If this is true, then it may be some years before sufficient data are available to estimate those new parameter values correctly'. The change triggered by financial liberalisation is 'particularly worrying because it could mean that we do not know how the economy responds to instruments of monetary policy'.

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Poll campaign strains ties that bind Crimea: The republic's dangerous tensions Crimea's first presidential elections, due next Sunday, are providing a new and dangerous focal point for the republic's competing loyalties to the states of Ukraine and Russia. Sensitivities over the republic's status run high in both Moscow and Kiev, not just as an issue of territorial integrity, but also as the home of the disputed Black Sea fleet, now awkwardly shared between the two states. Ethnic Russians make up roughly 70 per cent of Crimea's population and Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk has been hard pressed to respect their interests while also satisfying the demands of Ukrainian nationalists. A compromise solution, in April 1992, was Kiev's proclamation of Crimea as an 'autonomous part of the Ukraine'. The constitution that followed set up the office of Crimean president, but the republic's moderates sought to stall an election, well aware of the nationalist sentiment that it was likely to arouse. In the end, they could hold it off no longer, and the possibility of a realignment with Russia now looms large. Only one of the four front-runners, Mr Nikolai Bagrov, who is Crimean parliamentary chairman, is advocating the republic's continued status as a province of Ukraine - which it has been since Russia handed it over in 1954. The others all favour some form of reunification with Russia. The Crimean parliament has already declared independence from Ukraine once, in May 1992, and threatened a referendum on joining Russia. However, it quickly caved in to Ukrainian pressure to reverse its stand. Nonetheless, it has gained more autonomy than any other Ukrainian region, including the right to levy its own taxes and establish foreign trade representations, and Mr Kravchuk will be reluctant to let the republic move further away from Kiev. Moreover, if the vote went against Ukraine, or if Kiev anyway acted to strengthen its hold on the Black Sea peninsula, Russia would now be more likely to step in 'to protect the interests of Russians living in the near abroad,' as Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, stated recently. But there seems little awareness that the elections could provide the justification for interventions by either Ukraine or Russia. The campaign has been dominated, instead, by illusions of the republic's economic potential with Russia's patronage. Since becoming part of independent Ukraine in 1991, Crimea's 2.5m residents have seen their fortunes decline with the tumbling Ukrainian currency, the karbovanets. One leading candidate, the Communist party leader Mr Nikolai Grach, is promising the return of a socialist state through the creation of an economic union with reforming Russia. His rhetoric of workers' rights and social welfare guarantees rings well with Crimea's influential pensioners: a third of the populace are privileged retired Communists in the peninsula's fashionable coastal resorts. The most extreme is Mr Sergei Shuvainikov, a nationalist representing Crimea's Party of Russia, which has ties to Mr Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party. He wants to unite with Russia immediately, through executive order. Mr Yuri Meshkov, a pro-Russian candidate whose headquarters are a seedy Afghan war veterans' cafe, tries hard to portray himself as a moderate advocate of Crimean independence, but promises to 'create a single economic zone with Russia' and hold a referendum on uniting with Russia. Mr Meshkov admits that Russia has not yet said it will agree to absorb Crimea, but he is convinced that 'Russia's policy toward Crimea is one thing  -Ukraine is another. We're part of the Russian people. It's like the relationship between England and Yorkshire, not between England and Scotland.' Mr Meshkov asserts that his pro-Russian programme can be implemented peacefully, without pitting Crimea against Ukraine. 'I don't see a reason for Kiev to be upset. Kravchuk said at the end of December that 'what goes on in Crimea is Crimea's business'.' Mr Meshkov also plays down the importance of the 700,000 ethnic Ukrainians and 300,000 Crimean Tatars on the peninsula. 'There are no social divisions in Crimea, little support for Rukh (the Ukrainian nationalist movement), to catalyse such a conflict.' Both the Crimean Tatars and Rukh are expected to vote for Mr Bagrov, who was seen as a front-runner although pre-election opinion polls have been legally forbidden. However, despite support from business interests seeking stability, his popularity has reportedly waned as the Ukrainian economy has deteriorated. Initially, Crimeans thought they would be better off economically apart from Moscow. But now they are hostage to Kiev's economic mismanagement and must cope with hyperinflation and severe energy shortages with the loss of virtually free Russian oil and gas. 'Ninety per cent of Crimea's enterprises are in a critical state,' says Mr Vladimir Sheviyev, one of Crimea's wealthiest entrepreneurs and a supporter of Mr Bagrov. The energy crisis has shut down 35 per cent of Crimea's enterprises and forced another 55 per cent to operate at half capacity. Most aircraft at the capital's airport are grounded for lack of fuel. By contrast, Russia is perceived as an oasis of riches. 'Everyone I know is debating between Shuvainikov and Meshkov,' said a young Crimean militia officer en route to his village for the Slavic Orthodox Christmas. 'With Russia we'll have a real currency and oil. They'll take care of us.'</p>

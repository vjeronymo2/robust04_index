Saburov thinks a program of economic reforms can be  developed  in the near future to ensure the improvement of financial  relations with Russia, better banking and privatization system,  changes in the taxation system and attraction of foreign  investors.    The Russian economist praised the current Crimean Government  and said only a few new people will be introduced in the Crimean  cabinet.    The parliament meeting put on the agenda the cancellation of  moratorium on referendum on the Crimean state status and refused  to consider the application of Parliament Speaker Nikolay Bagrov  for resignation.    The parliament made no comments on the Ukrainian Parliament  resolution on bringing the Crimean legislation in correspondence  to the Ukrainian laws and voted down the proposal to restore the  Crimean Constitution of May 6, 1992, that declared independence  of the Crimea.    The law-makers listened to ministers' reports on draft plans  of Crimean economic and social development, republican and local  budgets for 1994 and discussed the documents in commissions.</p>

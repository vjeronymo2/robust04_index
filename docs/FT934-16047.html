			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Management: Meet the business schools The days when an MBA was the guaranteed passport to personal riches and an exciting new job disappeared with the recession. The world's most popular postgraduate business qualification is still widely admired, but, increasingly, employers want to know where it was granted. With more than 90 business schools offering courses in the UK alone - on top of a highly visible dozen in continental Europe and a substantial low-visiblity tail - individuals planning for the academic year starting next October are overwhelmed by choice. Given that the cost of a 12-month full-time course could be as much as Pounds 25,000 - to which must be added lost earnings - their decision is not likely to be a light one. One way to survey the options is to look at one of the guides on the market. These include the Economist Intelligence Unit's Which MBA? (Pounds 21.90), Which Business Qualification? (Kogan Page, Pounds 16.95), and the Guide to Business Schools published by Pitman publishing with the Association of MBAs (Pounds 16.99 including post and packing). Another way is to attend AMBA's forthcoming Going To Business School reception at the Institute of Directors in London on Monday October 18. The event, which lasts from 4.30pm to 8.30pm, will be attended by 24 of the top UK schools, eight continental European institutions, and eight North American. Approximately 800 would-be MBA students attended last year; the turnout this time should be an indicator of whether the historic pattern of growth - interrupted in 1992-93 - is likely to be resumed in 1994-95. Entry is free but pre-registration is requested using the freephone number of National Westminster Bank, the sponsor: 0800 282700.</p>

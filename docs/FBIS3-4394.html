			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A few days ago, the municipal government held a  municipal work conference on deepening industrial enterprise  reform. Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee,  made a speech at the conference. In his speech, he stressed the  necessity to take reform as motivation and take efficiency as a  key link, to deepen reform, to make comprehensive improvement,  to change the managerial mechanisms of enterprises, to  positively create conditions for enterprise reform, to  conscientiously implement the system of responsibility for  fulfillment of fixed targets, to carry out package reform, to  make a breakthrough in key areas, to concentrate energy on  enlivening and achieving industrial enterprises, to change the  appearances of industrial enterprises as soon as possible, and  to restore the prestige of Tianjin's industry.    Gao Dezhan made an important speech at the conference. In  her speech, Li Huifen, vice mayor of the municipal government,  set forth specific requirements for reforming the industrial  enterprises. Responsible comrades of the municipal economic  commission, made specific arrangements for deepening the  industrial enterprises. At the conference, the leading cadres  at or above the bureau level on the industrial front submitted  to the municipal government letters of responsibility for  fulfillment of fixed tasks. The machinery bureau and the  Tianjin magnetic products company introduced their experiences  at the conference.    Gao Dezhan said in his speech: Since the beginning of this  year, the broad masses of cadres and the staff and workers of  the industrial front have conscientiously implemented the  guidelines of the second session of the sixth municipal party  committee and the municipal economic work conference, rapidly  taken action, firmly attended to their work, and solidly carried  out their jobs. So, the situation in the first two months was  very good. That various industrial bureaus and the municipal  economic commission submitted letters of responsibility for  fulfillment of fixed tasks to the municipal government today  embodies the high sense of enterprise and the sense of high  responsibility possessed by the leaders at various levels on the  industrial front. This is a major measure for fulfilling the  1994 tasks for deepening enterprise reform and promoting  economic development. He hoped that the comrades on the  industrial front should continue to make efforts, maintain and  develop the current gratifying situation, make new improvements,  big breakthroughs, and big headway in this year's industrial  production.    Gao Dezhan set forth three opinions on industrial  enterprises' reform and development.    First, we should deepen reform, make comprehensive  improvement, and concentrate efforts to achieve and enliven  industrial enterprises. Gao Dezhan said: Enterprises should be  taken as a foundation in developing the economy. Enterprises  are the foundation. Only when enterprises are vigorous will  Tianjin become prosperous and vitalized. Tianjin has a good  foundation and many favorable conditions for development.  However, the municipality is also confronted with many  difficulties and problems. We should rely on vitalized  enterprises and enterprises' good economic results to solve  these problems. The industrial department should adopt major  measures to change the appearances of the enterprises having  difficulties, accelerate the development of good enterprises,  and enhance the strength of the municipality's industries. We  should be determined and actively go into action to vitalize  enterprises. The leaders at various levels should enhance the  sense of urgency, the sense of crisis, and the sense of  responsibility to enliven enterprises as soon as possible. To  enliven enterprises, we should foster the idea of relying on  reform to promote development, take reform as motivation, take  efficiency as a central link, give different instructions to  different enterprises, and make comprehensive improvement.    We should do a good job in using foreign capital,  readjusting structures, intensifying management, developing  products, and conducting technological transformation, and  building leading bodies. By deepening reform, changing  mechanisms, and increasing economic results, we should ensure  that more is handed over to finance, that enterprises obtain  more, and that staff and workers gain more. We should focus the  deepening of enterprise reform on changing the enterprise  managerial mechanism; continue to implement "the enterprise law"  and "regulations" well; no longer limit small accounting units  within enterprises; deepen the reform of the labor personnel,  wage, and distribution systems; streamline organizations; and  reform and perfect the organizational managerial system. In  addition to enhancing internal functions, enterprises should  also positively create good external conditions. It is necessary  to vigorously advocate the practice of doing solid deeds for  enterprises. The departments in charge of the overall work, the  departments in charge, and administrative and law enforcement  departments should support enterprises and turn on green lights  for enterprises' reform and development. We should go deep to  the grass roots to actively serve enterprises, try every  possible means to help enterprises solve their problems, and  adopt realistic measures to continuously reduce enterprises'  burden.    Second, we should conscientiously implement the system of  responsibility for fulfillment of fixed tasks and ceaselessly  upgrade the leadership level. Gao Dezhan said: Carrying out  this system is a specific indicator for doing solid work and  firmly fulfilling tasks as well as an important guarantee for  promoting work and fulfilling tasks. So, at the time of  defining targets and implementing tasks, we should be sure to be  realistic, rigid, and perfect. That is, tasks should be  assigned to individuals; targets should be advanced and fixed  persistently according to high standards, high starting points,  and the general requirements of the municipality; and the  contents of the tasks should be complete and reach general  levels. On the basis of grasping the work of his own  department, each and every leading cadre at or above the bureau  level on the industrial front should take charge of the work of  two good enterprises and two money-losing enterprises, use the  experiences of the good to promote overall work, and strive to  make key breakthroughs. We should persist in the system of  responsibility for fulfillment of fixed tasks and regularly  examine the implementation of the system. It is necessary to  examine and assess every season to make a general assessment at  the end of the year. The assessment should be linked with the  assessment of cadres' political achievements.    Third, we should comprehensively implement the "222  project,"  change as soon as possible the appearances of the industries,  and restore the prestige of Tianjin's industries. Gao Dezhan  said: The second plenary session of the sixth municipal party  committee set forth the necessity to implement the "222  project." That is, grasp two large key enterprises, namely the  general vehicle industrial corporation and the steel tube  company; grasp 20 municipal-level key enterprises; and grasp 200  key enterprises at the bureau, district, and county level.  These enterprises are key enterprises of Tianjin as well as  pillar industries. They must attain advanced international and  domestic levels, become enterprises with large amounts of  profits and taxes, and play a decisive role in the  municipality's economic development. Upon the successful  accomplishment of this project, these enterprises will become a  model of reform and management and make greater contributions to  developing the economy in a better and faster manner. All  fronts should pay high attention to this project, make concerted  efforts to grasp it, perfect plans, implement measures, give  preferential treatment to key enterprises, and carry out the  project in a ladder- like manner. We should concentrate energy  on grasping the work of key enterprises to promote the work of  the ordinary ones, ensure that good enterprises improve and  groups of good enterprises emerge, also carry out the principle  of selecting the best and eliminating the bad, gradually balance  the paths, embark as soon as possible on the orbit of taking a  favorable turn in Tianjin's industries, and realize the grand  target of restoring the prestige of Tianjin's industries.</p>

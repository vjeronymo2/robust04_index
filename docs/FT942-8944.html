			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Chernomyrdin sees the light Victor Chernomyrdin was chosen as Russia's prime minister because he had a proven track record of running a successful Soviet enterprise. He was not picked because of his grasp of the economic and management skills required to shift a centralised and militarised economy towards a decentralised, market system. But the policy statement published in this newspaper on Monday indicates, at the very least, that Mr Chernomyrdin has been persuaded by 18 months in high office that currency stability is a top priority and that potential foreign investors require a stable legal and tax regime and have to be wooed, not grudgingly tolerated. These are important conclusions, reflecting a marked shift away from the attitudes with which Mr Chernomyrdin assumed office. Gasprom, the gas enterprise he once controlled, was always a ferocious lobbyist for more funds and fiercely resistant to foreign investment in one of Russia's industrial 'crown jewels'. Mr Chernomyrdin appears to have taken on board both the advice of the international institutions and the reform experience of central Europe and the former Soviet Baltic states, especially Estonia. He portrays himself as a convert to the virtues of positive real interest rates and tightly controlled budgets. As proof, he points to his government's perseverance with anti-inflationary policies in the face of a 25 per cent decline in production and screams of pain from the powerful military, industrial and farm lobbies. Such perseverance is brave. But, as Mr Chernomyrdin now concedes, there is no alternative. The really difficult part still lies ahead. Monthly inflation of 7 or 8 per cent is better than 30 per cent, but it has to be reduced still further if the preconditions for stable growth are to be established. Loss-making plants It is hard to see how inflation can be reduced, however, while the prime minister continues to argue that the loss-making plants which sustain employment and social amenities in 'hundreds of cities and towns throughout Russia' have to continue in production. These plants and cities were built in defiance of economic logic to serve a militarised economy which has to be largely dismantled if resources are to be freed up to allow the development of new enterprises, responsive to the needs of consumers and capable of producing the goods and services required to build a market-based economy. Equally clearly, however, the millions of Russians who live and work in such communities cannot simply be abandoned to their fate. Devising a social security framework which would allow the Russian authorities to provide unemployment pay, and to retrain and relocate workers and their families away from what were often in origin Stalin-era prison labour camps or cold war bastions, should become a top priority for co-operation between the Russian and western governments. Managed decline At the same time, however, the leaders of Russia have to keep in the forefront of their mind that the new economy which will eventually grow out of the wreckage of the Soviet model will not be a modernised version of the old. An economic policy which concentrates on revamping and modernising thousands of Soviet-era plants is not likely to leave adequate resources for budding entrepreneurs to build enough new factories and plants on greenfield sites. Nor will revamping the old release sufficient resources to permit the development of the service industries which have been so woefully lacking in the past and which provide such a high proportion of employment and wealth in contemporary market economies elsewhere in the world. Mr Chernomyrdin is right to focus upon the need for financial and monetary stability and is well placed both to understand the fears of state sector managers and to explain the need for managed decline of the state sector. But his main energies should be devoted to extending privatisation and encouraging both foreign investment and the domestic entrepreneurs. The private sector already provides more than 50 per cent of the jobs in the booming Polish economy, and is rapidly increasing its share in other former socialist economies. Russia, with its skilled labour force and resources, is perfectly capable of developing a modern economy along similar lines. The trick is to release the energies of those capable of using Russia's potential wealth in a creative and modern way, not to spend too much energy propping up the old structures.</p>

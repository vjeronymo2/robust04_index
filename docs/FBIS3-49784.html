			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Only a few minutes ago we learned the following  from Raycho Raykov, spokesman for the Council of Ministers:    The sharp escalation of incidents related to organized crime  have evoked a broad discussion in our society and the mass  media. In this context, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov has been  consulting with Valentin Karabashev and Evgeni Matinchev, deputy  chairmen of the Council of Ministers; Minister of the Interior  Viktor Mikhaylov; and other high-ranking state officials since  yesterday.    The specific circumstances surrounding the recent brazen  violations of the public order and the struggle against crime  are being clarified.    At the behest of Minister Mikhaylov, the participants in the  consultations discussed many specific measures aimed at sharply  improving the legal order in the country.    Assuming total responsibility for the tragic incident of 14  January in Belite Brezi, Minister Viktor Mikhaylov tendered his  resignation to Lyuben Berov, chairman of the Council of  Ministers. The resignation will be discussed tomorrow by the  Council of Ministers.</p>

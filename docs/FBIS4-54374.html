			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The daily REPUBLIKA praises Philippine President  Fidel Ramos for making a very tactical move to overcome a crisis  in relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the  Philippines by barring foreign delegates from attending a  conference on East Timor to be held in that country.  Apparently, although he put the credibility of his leadership  at stake, Ramos attaches greater importance to Philippine  national interests -- maintaining good relations with Indonesia.    What lessons can be learned from the crisis? First,  according to REPUBLIKA, East Timor has clearly become a very  sensitive point in the context of relations between Indonesia  and other nations. This means that we have to reassess how  effective our overseas campaigns on East Timor have been and  what strategy the Department of Foreign Affairs should adopt to  deal with such cases. Second, Indonesia has been very reactive  to such cases. The Indonesian Government should have dealt more  coolly and [word indistinct] with the Philippine Government with  regard to the conference because the reactive stand only  benefits groups opposed to the integration of East Timor into  the Republic of Indonesia. REPUBLIKA concludes that  anti-integration groups may have intentionally provoked  Indonesian anger.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUE EVANGELISTS NEED NO DIVINE MASK;  </P> <P> RELIGION: THOSE WHO LITERALLY LOVE GOD AND THEIR FELLOW MEN AND WOMEN CAN'T BE  JUDGED BY THE SINS OF THE CHARLATAN FROM CHARLOTTE.  </P> <P> The conviction of television evangelist Jim Bakker brings to a close a sordid  chapter in the history of American religion. For the last 2 1/2 years, much of  the press and public have watched in astonishment, and some in glee, as  Bakker's private sins of greed, sexual indiscretion, pomposity and fraud have  been exposed.  </P> <P> For many, the word evangelist has become a synonym for the worst kind of  deception, in which a charlatan carries out his criminal activity behind a  divine mask.  </P> <P> Yet, just as supporters of 1988 presidential candidate Gary Hart did not  abandon the Democratic Party when Hart's private activities were made public,  neither should we cynically indict all evangelists because a minority are shown  to be corrupt.  </P> <P> I recall keeping company with genuine evangelists at a 1986 meeting in  Amsterdam, sponsored by the Rev. Billy Graham.  </P> <P> These were itinerant evangelists, and their mode of living was the antithesis  of most of those involved in big-time American religion. I remember meeting  John Bulawyo, who rides along the border between South Africa and Mozambique on  the wheel rims of his bicycle because he cannot afford tires. His territory  covers a 40-mile radius, and he is the only minister to 20,000 refugees living  in tents and cardboard shacks.  </P> <P> I had dinner (on paper plates and using plastic utensils) with Odo Ratchie, a  black pastor in Soweto who is responsible for six churches. Why so many? Few  pastors want to serve there. Ratchie and his family are constantly threatened  and intimidated.  </P> <P> Then there was Sami Daghar, who is pastor of a church in Beirut. Daghar has  been offered positions in the United States but stays in what may be the least  desirable spot on earth because "God called me with my people in Beirut." His  church has been shelled several times, and many church members have been  wounded or killed.  </P> <P> Hernando Martinez was one of 43 evangelists who came to Amsterdam from  Nicaragua. Martinez had been arrested by the Sandinistas for his preaching and  sent to prison. When he was released and told not to preach any more, he  preached anyway and was sent back to prison.So he started a church in prison.  </P> <P> Tadesse Welde Giorgis of Ethiopia spent two years in prison because he preached  to young people in violation of the Communist system's laws.  </P> <P> Rev. Ebiasali Emolu Akeso of Uganda was preaching in his church during Idi  Amin's regime when troops stormed in and arrested him and his 65-member  congregation, hauling them off to prison.  </P> <P> Many of these evangelists live at or near the same economic level as those to  whom they minister. They ride burros or bicycles, or walk. Most got to  Amsterdam because Graham's organization paid their way. Many had never left  their countries before or flown on an airplane. A few had never seen indoor  plumbing and began to dig latrines behind their dormitories before others  introduced them to toilets.  </P> <P> These are the people I think of when I think of evangelists, not the charlatan  of Charlotte, Jim Bakker.  </P> <P> These are people literally in love with God and with their fellow men and  women. They had no love for the things of this world. Heritage USA and  American-style TV evangelism would be as foreign to them as life on another  planet.  </P> <P> The Bakkers got caught up in the sin of much American religious work: the  belief that big is better and small means failure.  </P> <P> "While big is not necessarily evil, or small necessarily virtuous," notes  Senate Chaplain Richard C. Halverson, "results are not the acid test for a  given program. The end does not justify the means. God is interested in means,  perhaps as an end."  </P> <P> I have met many evangelists, in Amsterdam and elsewhere. I have known some  evangelists quite well. And Jim Bakker is no evangelist. A biblical warning  seems appropriate here: "Not everyone who says unto me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall  enter into the kingdom of heaven."  </P></p>

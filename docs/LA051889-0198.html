			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BURGLAR PASSES OUT IN O.C. CONDO  </P> <P> A would-be burglar is in custody today after police found him passed out in an  upstairs bedroom of a Monarch Beach condominium, and stereo equipment on a  chair by the door "waiting to be stolen," officials said.  </P> <P> Police had been called about 9:10 p.m. after a guard at the private complex on  St. Kitts opened the gate for a resident and a pickup truck sped in behind,  Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Bob Rivas said. The guard told police that  the driver appeared to be drunk.  </P> <P> While officers were inside the complex, police received another call from  neighbors who had heard glass breaking in one of the condominiums. Officers  arrived there as a man was leaving. "He yelled out that he lived there and that  it was OK, and then ran back into the house," Rivas said.  </P> <P> Officers entered the home through a broken den window. Upstairs, they found the  man "passed out on the bed. He got a few cuts from going through the broken  window, but that was all," Rivas said.  </P> <P> Scott Michael Gaffney, 25, of Dana Point was booked at Orange County Jail on  suspicion of burglary. Bail was set at $25,000.  </P></p>

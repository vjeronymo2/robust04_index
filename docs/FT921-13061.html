			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Mieno detects rise in Japanese confidence MR YASUSHI MIENO, the governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday said he detected a slight up-turn in business confidence, in a comment designed to dispel the general gloom about the state of the national economy. At a news conference after a meeting of the central bank's branch managers, Mr Mieno acknowledged the economy was in fact slowing at a greater pace than before. But the current downturn should be mild because of the growing impact of recent declines in interest rates, he said. Bankers said Mr Mieno's remarks seemed aimed at influencing businessmen while they were preparing investment plans for the new financial year starting in April. He has specifically expressed concern, in his recent public comments, about the weakness of business sentiment, including the statement he issued when he last cut the official discount rate on December 30. He now believes the reductions in interest rates could be bearing fruit. His branch managers reported at their meeting this week that, since the last meeting in October, business confidence had stopped declining. Nevertheless, Mr Mieno carefully hedged his remarks, saying that it would be an exaggeration to say that the decline in business confidence, which began in earnest last autumn, had definitely come to an end. He acknowledged that the weakness in the stock market could affect business confidence and economic activity. But it was unlikely to be a serious drag on growth. A Bank of Japan official said Mr Mieno's comments were consistent with his previous views but did contain a significant change in emphasis. Mr Mieno also welcomed the recent strengthening in the yen on currency markets, saying that in view of Japan's current account surplus it was desirable for the yen to be stable and firm. The yen closed unchanged in Tokyo at Y123.34 to the US dollar, keeping the gain of about Y4 it had registered since last week.</p>

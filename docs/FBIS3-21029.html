			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rainer Alhaus: "Like a Repair Shop"] </F>   [Text] Philipp Pommerenke does not want his operation  mistaken for an auto graveyard. "This is not going to be like in  a factory, with a lot of noise and mountains of wrecks in the  courtyard," says the graduate engineer; "we don't want to be a  scrapyard but function like a modern auto repair shop." Not too  large, extremely friendly toward the environment, without impact  on the residents around it, easy to fit into any business area,  are Pommerenke's terms of reference.    The engineer heads Berlin's newest pilot project for  recycling old cars. The Lepkojus Innovations-Gesellschaft (LIG)  fuer Entwicklung und Fertigung fuer Aufgaben im Umweltschutz mbH  [Lepkojus Innovation Company for Development and Production for  Environmental Protection Tasks Ltd.] operates this auto  disassembly facility at a former Sero site in the city district  of Hellersdorf. Approximately 15 vehicles a day are now being  disposed of here. The goal is to do twice that amount. The  principal advantage: The work is done with "nonspecific models."    The operator of the facility, the Alba company, once again  "had its finger on the pulse and recognized a future market,"  praised Federal Environment Office President Dr. Heinrich von  Lersner when the project was taken into operation. More than 2.5  million vehicles wind up on the scrap heap each year in the FRG;  in Berlin alone it is about 200,000. In Hellersdorf a maximum of  7,500 scrapped cars, precisely three percent, can be recycled in  the first expansion phase. A drop in the ocean in comparison  with Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer's goal of recycling half  of all old cars by the year 2000.    The Berlin pilot project is aimed at future safety. The  basic  sealing of the work hall is the same as in waste dumps; 1,000  square meters of disassembly surface was sealed with  high-pressure polyethylene foils. Under that lies a  10-centimeter-thick concrete plate on top of a  20-centimeter-thick sub-base.    One out of every three German marks [DM] of the DM 6.6  million investment cost--half of the expenditure was provided by  the Federal Environment Ministry--went for soil and ground water  protection. Waste water is led through separate dirt and  rainwater channels, passing through an oil and coalescence  separator. The waste water from the hot steam vehicle cleaning  unit also flows through an de-emulsification facility.    Dr. Dieter Pautz, in charge of old car recycling at the  Environment Ministry, praises the Berlin-Hellersdorf facility:  "Here an example is being set for the integration of all known  technologies." The Federal Government's cost sharing is for the  purpose of "raising the level of the technology in this field."    Five points are of primary importance for auto recycling:  Complete removal of fluids--so far it is only possible to drain  about 95 percent, separation of all synthetic parts by type,  extracting secondary raw materials, the greatest possible profit  from sales of replacement parts and, finally, consideration for  all ecological requirements.    The project has national economic proportions. If projected  onto the entire annual German number of cars, a total of about  1.7 million tons of metal and 450,000 tons of special waste in  the form of oils and fluids, synthetic and compound materials,  rubber and glass would result. Thus, professional and ecological  disposal has its price: The Association of German Automobile  Industry allocates DM 400 per car; experts from various  institutes estimate DM 300 to 600. Pommerenke would like to push  the cost down to an acceptable DM 150.    Utilization of replacement parts from the old cars for  maintenance and repairs can also make a contribution. On the  shelves at Hellersdorf are stored engines, wheels, tires, doors,  body parts, seats, radiators, tanks, carburetors, propeller  shafts, dashboards, gear shifts, headlights, rear lights,  mirrors... Pommerenke manages the inventory with the help of a  computer: "We can react quickly to customer inquiries." The  price advantage for auto firms, private persons, car repair  garages, reprocessing enterprises and exporters is 30 to 50  percent below the new price. A supraregional operating system is  being established at this time.    In addition to the old oil, particularly the synthetics  require a great deal of expenditure. If the legislators actually  decree the return of cars and exclude thermal disposal, plastic  parts must be easily separated out and properly recycled. For  that reason, a laboratory is already a part of Pommerenke's  pilot project. Dr. Dietrich Schumann is often a guest. In his  laser laboratory in Adlershof (LLA GmbH), synthetic waste  products with various fillers, contaminations and dyes are being  studied. As a result, a near-infrared sensor was created  (0.7-2.5 micron wavelength), with which synthetics can be  detected in 10 milliseconds and--in a facility down the  line--semiautomatically separated out. A type purity of 96  percent is to be possible.    With his development, the LLA marketing chief says, he can  only succeed in industry if the method does not get too  expensive: "There must be no DM 250,000 lasers in a recycling  facility." The frequently black automobile synthetics make this  more difficult: "Just as plastic parts with metallic coatings,  they produce a type of fog when looked at with spectroscopy. The  LLA device has now got this problem under control."  <H5>  Trabant: No Problem </H5>   At least 500,000 Trabants are still rolling on the roads.  Unless it involves as few prized specimens with options for  future increases in value, these must also be disposed of at  some point. But the plastic bombers are not a special recycling  case: "The Trabant is not an environmental problem," says Dr.  Dieter Pautz, an engineer. "Anyone who wants to make money on it  is getting a bad deal." With not quite 35 kilograms--"all of it  uncomplicated Duroplast"--there is less synthetic material in  the Trabant than in the Golf, for example. Recyclers can easily  deal with this plating on bumpers, roof, doors and trunk lids.</p>

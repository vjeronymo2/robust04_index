			<p>BFN     [Text] The 11 French people of Premiere Urgence who have  been detained by the Bosnian Serbs for more than a month now  could be released within the next few hours. Their imminent  release was announced by the Serbs this morning and confirmed  later by the European negotiator, Lord Owen. French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe, who is in Washington, has confirmed this  information to Philippe Reltien:    [Begin Juppe recording] I would like to take this  opportunity  to say a word about the 11 hostages. According to news that has  reached me from Paris, and also from Belgrade or Sarajevo, a  possible release of the hostages could take place within the  next few hours. I am still very cautious on this matter because  I have no confirmation. I would like to recall -- to deny  certain reports circulated in France -- that since the  hostage-taking in early April, not a single day has passed  without our diplomats deploying their efforts in Belgrade, Pale,  Sarajevo, at the United Nations, the Greek presidency, and our  allies. We have ceaselessly applied pressure, explaining  clearly to the Serbs that we will not accept a mockery of  justice, that this was a hostage-taking, that there was  manipulation, that we will not bargain, and that we want the  release of all the hostages. If the news were to be  confirmed--I repeat that I am cautious--this will be the result  of this continuous and efficient diplomatic effort. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD BOWL EVENT A MARIACHI MILESTONE  </P> <P> Rodri J. Rodriguez said the idea came into her head about a year ago while at  the International Mariachi Conference in Tucson.  </P> <P> The Cuban-born Rodriguez wanted to create a milestone mariachi event in Los  Angeles. What resulted was the first Mariachi USA Festival to be held Sunday,  June 24, at the 18,000-seat Hollywood Bowl.  </P> <P> "Once I envision a show I need to bring it to life so that others can enjoy it  too," said Rodriguez, the owner of the Rodri Group production company that is  organizing the $250,000 event.  </P> <P> Rodriguez, director of the show, received advice from Grammy Award winners  Linda Ronstadt and Vikki Carr while planning the event. Rodriguez, 35, is a  friend of Carr and serves as president of the scholarship foundation named  after the singer. Ronstadt accepted Carr's invitation to perform at the Bowl.  </P> <P> Other entertainers at the event will include Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan, a  Mexican group that is one of the best-known mariachi bands in the world;  Mariachi Campanas de America of San Antonio, and three Los Angeles area groups.  The local groups are Mariachi Sol de Mexico, which performs at Cielito Lindo  Mexican restaurant in El Monte; Mariachi Los Camperos, which plays at La Fonda  Mexican restaurant, and Mariachi Los Galleros, which performs at El Rey Mexican  restaurant in Montebello.  </P> <P> "These mariachis are the best in the business, especially Vargas," said Steven  Loza, professor of music at UCLA and an expert on mariachis. "The music will be  of first caliber."  </P> <P> Rodriguez said this is the most challenging endeavor she has undertaken in her  14-year career as a concert promoter/producer.  </P> <P> Rodriguez admittedly views the show with the same optimism and determination  that are part of her everyday life. She said she acquired these qualities after  her parents sent a 7-year-old Rodriguez from Cuba to the United States, where  the girl had no one waiting.  </P> <P> "They wanted to save me from communism," remembered Rodriguez, who left Cuba in  1962. Rodriguez was 14 and had lived for seven years in temporary refugee camps  and in the home of a New Mexico family when her parents joined her in the  United States. "I became strong during those years away from my parents," she  recalled recently. Another pivotal action, she said, was her insistence in the  mid-1970s that a Latin category be added to the Grammy Awards, an  accomplishment for which she became well-known.  </P> <P> Rodriguez is completing a second four-year term as the only Latina on the Los  Angeles Cultural Affairs Commission.  </P> <P> She said Rodri Group acts as a liaison between American entertainers and  European and Latin American production companies interested in having U.S.  talent perform in their countries.  </P> <P>  Mariachi USA, June 24 at 6 p.m. Bowl gates open at 4 p.m. Tickets at  Ticketmaster locations. ($10 to $50 each.)  </P></p>

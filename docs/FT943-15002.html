			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Ruling on Cypriot import certificates  -European Court When citrus fruit and potatoes are imported from the part of Cyprus to the north of the United Nations buffer zone, member countries of the European Union are precluded from accepting movement and phyto-sanitary certificates issued by authorities other than the competent authorities of the Republic of Cyprus. This was the European Court of Justice ruling on the interpretation of the 1972 EEC/Cyprus Association Agreement and a 1977 directive on plant health controls. The ruling was given in the context of English judicial review proceedings against the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by Republic of Cyprus fruit and potato exporters. They challenged the UK authorities' practice of allowing imports into the UK accompanied by certificates issued by the Turkish community. Movement certificates prove goods' Cyprus origin, in particular for purposes of preferential treatment, and phyto-sanitary certificates guarantee plant health. It was agreed by the parties that the Republic of Cyprus is a sovereign state, recognised by European Community member states; that the UK imports significant volumes of citrus products and potatoes from the part of Cyprus to the north of the UN buffer zone, accompanied by certificates issued by the Turkish community there; and that none of the certificates are issued by the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus. The ECJ confirmed previous decisions establishing that the system whereby movement certificates are regarded as evidence of the origin of products is founded on the principle of mutual reliance and co-operation between the competent authorities of the exporting and importing states. Such co-operation was excluded with the authorities of an entity such as that in the northern part of Cyprus, which is recognised neither by the Community nor by the member countries. The only Cypriot state they recognise is the Republic of Cyprus. Accordingly, the ECJ held that the provisions must be interpreted strictly, to ensure uniform application of the agreement. 'The customs authorities of the exporting state' must be interpreted as referring exclusively to the competent authorities of the Republic of Cyprus when exports to the EC are involved. The agreement, therefore, precluded acceptance of certificates from other authorities. The Greek and Irish governments intervened in support of the applicants. The UK and the Commission, however, claimed that the special situation of Cyprus justified acceptance of certificates issued by the entity in the northern part of the island, in order to prevent discrimination between nationals or companies of Cyprus, so as to ensure the entire population of Cyprus enjoyed the commercial advantages available under the agreement. The ECJ held that the de facto partition of the territory of Cyprus, as a result of the intervention of the Turkish armed forces in 1974, into one zone where the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus continue fully to exercise their powers and another zone where they cannot do so, raises problems difficult to resolve in connection with the application of the agreement to the whole of Cyprus. However, that did not warrant a departure from the clear, precise and unconditional provisions of the agreement's rules on the origin of products and administrative co-operation. The Court also rejected arguments based on international law which the Commission claimed justified a practice which it was found to have unilaterally applied of distributing stamps and signatures used on unauthorised certificates. For similar reasons, the ECJ held that the term 'authorities empowered' in the 1977 directive must be interpreted as referring exclusively to the authorities empowered by the Republic of Cyprus to issue phyto-sanitary certificates. The directive, therefore, precluded the acceptance of certificates issued by other authorities. The ECJ also ruled that the answers would be no different even if certain circumstances connected with the special situation of the island of Cyprus were taken as established.

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / BCCI creditors drop compensation appeal THE UK creditors' committee of Bank of Credit and Commerce International has dropped its appeal against a High Court ruling that sanctioned a Dollars 1.7bn compensation package negotiated between Touche Ross, the liquidators, and the bank's Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. The creditors abandoned their appeal when they were told that they might be personally liable for costs in the action rather than being able to recover appeal costs from BCCI assets. A similar ruling to the UK approval in Grand Cayman left the liquidators seeking one final approval in Luxembourg today to get all the court approvals necessary for the agreement to proceed. Agreement to the package by the Luxembourg court would leave Touche Ross needing acceptances from creditors representing 51 per cent of the identified liabilities before it begins making staged payments to creditors early next year. According to Touche Ross, the deal should return to the creditors between 30 and 40 per cent of their original investment.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arnab Neil Sengupta] </F> <H5>  [27 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] With each passing day, the world's largest case of  arsenic poisoning assumes even more alarming dimensions as  tubewells in West Bengal disgorge contaminated water in block  after block, village after village--this time in Calcutta's own  backyard: the South 24-Parganas (pop. 5.7 million).    Even as the Centre and the State ignore the enormity of  arsenic poisoning in five other districts of West Bengal,  surveys conducted by Jadavpur University's School of  Environmental Studies in the past several weeks have turned up  shocking evidence of how many more lakhs of people are now  threatened in areas hardly a few kilometres from the city.    On Saturday afternoon, as a team of scientists from the  school, accompanied by doctors and environmental experts,  arrived at Purandharpur, a village in Baruipur in the South  24-Parganas, they were besieged by scores of locals desperate to  know the results of analysis of water samples taken from  tubewells in the area by the team a week earlier.    Far away from the corridors of power of Calcutta and New  Delhi, a quiet tragedy unfolded as the villagers, their faces  shot with anxiety, took in the terrifying news: barring two, all  the tubewells of Purandharpur had arsenic contents more than 30  times the recommended level! Water from these tubewells,  according to the School of Environmental Studies, is unfit for  cattle, not to mention human consumption!    For the school, which until now had been preoccupied with  arsenic contamination in water elsewhere in the State, the  finding of the dreaded metalloid in South 24-Parganas tubewell  water was not something straight out of the blue.    Last year, after detecting arsenic in water in a Jadavpur  locality, the team had taken some random samples from several  villages in the Baruipur block and found arsenic in three. A  week ago, the team went back for more samples and the results  confirmed the team's worst fears: arsenic turned up in alarming  concentrations in almost 80 per cent of the affected areas.    On Saturday at Purandharpur, in the crowd waiting for the  results of the analysis of tubewell-water samples was Sankar  Mondal (51), his body dotted with tell-tale signs of arsenic  poisoning that doctors described as raindrop skin pigmentation.  Mondal earns a living by playing the tabla, but that has been  made increasingly difficult in the past few years by lesions on  his palms and soles, a condition known in medical parlance as  hyperkeratosis.    As the Jadavpur University team weaved through standing  crops  and hushed households of this South 24-Parganas village, the  symptoms that Sankar Mondal bore quickly became a familiar  sight. Skin afflictions apart, explained Dr. Jayanta Dasgupta of  SSKM [expansion not given] Hospital as he examined the  arsenic-affected locals, they were suffering from either  conjunctivitis, enlargement of the liver or affliction of the  nerves of the upper and lower limbs.    Purandharpur's residents are especially alarmed because the  tubewell water used by more than 1,500 students of the village's  educational institutions has been found to contain 35 times more  arsenic than recommended!    Paying the price for human avarice are nearly 32,000 people  in the South 24-Parganas alone, found till now to be drinking  arsenic-contaminated water. The actual figure could be  mind-boggling.  <H5>  [28 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] Niranjan Das, a resident of gram panchayat Ramnagar  II in the South 24-Parganas' Baruipur Block, is counting his  days. Years of drinking arsenic-contaminated water has  irreversibly damaged his body's vital organs -- a plight common  to all four members of the Das family.    Yet, that's only part of the tragedy. During the past few  years, Niranjan Das's mother and two sisters died one after  another -- all victims of arsenic poisoning that, after five  districts of the State, has now been revealed to threaten lakhs  of people in the South 24-Parganas.    Out of the district's 30 blocks, Jadavpur University's  School  of Environmental Studies recently picked two and analysed  tubewell-water samples from a total of 28 villages. Shockingly,  not a single village has been found to be safe from the threat  of arsenic.    Till now, the school has found nearly 9,000 villagers with  arsenic-related skin lesions in the two South 24-Parganas Blocks  that they have surveyed. However, according to Dr. D.N. Guha  Majumdar, who heads SSKM Hospital's gastro-enterology  department, not all who are suffering from chronic arsenic  toxicity will show skin lesions. "Many might be affected  internally," he said.    Not surprisingly, ignorance about melanosis and  hyperkeratosis -- arsenic-induced skin afflictions -- is taking  a heavy social toll in the villages. Wives are being sent back  to their parents; finding grooms for daughters is proving an  uphill task; and competent candidates are being turned down for  jobs. Indeed, arsenicosis-affected persons are being treated not  unlike leprosy patients in many of the districts.    SSKM's Professor Guha Majumdar, who has been collaborating  with the Jadavpur University team in studying arsenic poisoning,  says that safe drinking water and a nutritious diet can help  reverse early damage caused by arsenicosis.    Till now, six districts of the State -- Nadia, Burdwan,  Murshidabad, Malda and the North and South 24-Parganas -- have  been found to be affected by arsenic-contaminated underground  water. In all these places, the deadly metalloid has been  gushing out of underground acquifers through water pumped out by  tubewells.    An ever increasing demand for water -- mainly for irrigation  and partly for domestic use -- has spurred more and more  tubewells to be sunk. "This has possibly upset the underground  geological balance, causing arsenic to leach out of the iron  pyrite's crystal lattice," said the school's director.    The need of the hour, according to him, is to find out and  isolate all the tubewells in the State spewing  arsenic-contaminated water. Residents should be told to use only  those tubewells whose water had tested arsenic-free.    "Our studies have shown that tubewells up to even 450 feet  deep are not safe," said a scientist of the school. Studies  conducted so far suggest that the deeper the well, the lesser is  the chance of arsenic contamination.    To eliminate the scourge, the School of Environmental  Studies, which is planning to convene an international seminar  on arsenic poisoning in the State in January next year, advises  boring tubewells deeper than 500 feet and monitoring their water  quality constantly to keep tabs on the arsenic content.    Solution in the long run, according to wetlands experts,  lies  in proper management of water resources, conservation of rain  and surface water, and planned utilization of ponds and  water-logged areas.    Unless the Government moves in to stop the profligate  spending of underground water, the experts warn, the fate of 30  million people in six districts of the State, could well go the  same way as that of the more than 7.5 lakh people drinking  arsenic-contaminated water in these districts now.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Halifax withdraws sales force: Financial services team to be re-tested after failing to meet regulatory standards Halifax building society, one of the UK's largest personal finance organisations, is to withdraw its 600-strong financial services sales force for re-testing, after discovering failures to meet regulators' standards. The temporary withdrawal is a severe embarrassment to the organisation, coming just two months before the launch of a wholly owned life insurance subsidiary, Halifax Life. Halifax said yesterday that the compliance failures revealed by its internal checks related to 'observed interviews' which sales agents perform as part of their continuous training, and there was no evidence that any customer had been given poor advice or had suffered. While most of the irregularities were minor - such as an intervention in an interview by an observer who should have remained silent - some more serious matters - including failures to carry out the observed interview at all - had involved 'a handful' of the sales force. Mr James Crosby, general manager of financial services at Halifax, said yesterday: 'It is disappointing that a minority of our advisers have not followed the required procedures. We have a comprehensive action plan in hand to ensure that these incidents do not recur and that all our advisers measure up to the high standards we have set ourselves.' Even so, the move is awkward for the society as it prepares for its own life subsidiary, particularly as earlier this year Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive, set the society the specific aim of being 'the biggest and best personal finance business in the UK'. Halifax's approach to setting up the life operation has been marked by a desire to see its strong brand image as a mortgage lender extended to the new business, partly by exercising strict control over the products and services offered. The re-testing process is due to take two to three weeks. The sales agents who pass - which Halifax expects to be the vast majority - will then be able to go back to giving financial advice for mortgage-related products. At the same time they will receive detailed training on Halifax Life products as the society had intended they should in December anyway. They will not return to more general financial planning advice until the new operation opens for business. Yesterday's announcement does not affect the 2,000-plus Halifax branch staff who can advise on endowment mortgages but not on the full range of financial services. Halifax is not the first large financial organisation to have to undertake a high-profile withdrawal of its sales force this year. Norwich Union, the insurer, and Nationwide Building Society, the UK's second largest, have both had to announce temporary suspensions of financial services sales staff for re-training.</p>

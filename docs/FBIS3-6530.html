The Japanese Government will offer such provisions as 811  tons of condensed milk, 2,581 tons of vegetable cooking oil,  1,165 tons of canned mandarin oranges and 1,082 tons of canned  pork meat, the ministry said.    The 11 cities include seven in the far eastern region such  as  Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Yuzno-Sakhalinsk, and four cities in  east Siberia, including Irkutsk and Ulan Ude, it said.    Japan will first implement the monetization on March 28 in  Vladivostok and move on to other cities until the end of April.    In Russia, people classified as socially weak, such as  pensioners, are facing difficulties because of inflation, the  ministry said.    And since local administrations are short of sources of  revenue for implementing social welfare projects, it is useful  to implement the monetization system, it said.    Japan implemented the monetization last year in nine cities  in Russia. The 4 billion rubles accumulated through  monetization have been used to build hospitals and medical  facilities and to purchase medical equipment, the Foreign  Ministry said.</p>

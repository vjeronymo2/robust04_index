			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No conflict in investigating accountants becoming receivers Sir, I refer to Andrew Jack's article,'Debate Reopens on Accountants' Insolvency Role' (June 16) which refers to Mr John Jackson's letter published the same day. Mr Jackson 'launched an attack on the process by which investigating accountants appointed by banks are permitted to take on the receivership of the business they examine'. I am a partner in Levy Gee, chartered accountants. We carry out a significant number of viability reports on behalf of a good cross-section of lending bankers. Each assignment commences with an agreed letter of engagement which makes clear that our duty of care is owed to the lending banker and not to their customer. A recent legal judgment stated that it is not possible to owe a duty of care to more than one party. A bank will not appoint a receiver if there is a viable alternative and any insolvency practitioner who recommends this course, simply to improve his fees, will soon see his work flow dry up. Lending banks are reluctant to lose customers. What is rarely emphasised by banks and accountants is the substantial amount of diligent work each does in rescuing companies and businesses. About half of the cases we handle do result in a receivership appointment. Therefore, the other half do not, and I hope benefit from our involvement promoting better communication and understanding between banker and customer. Costs and efficiency is an important factor. Where receivership is unavoidable, it is clearly cheaper and more efficient to have the same firm conduct the viability assignment and the receivership. They will be familiar with the company's situation and be able to 'hit the ground running'. A fresh receiver would have to waste valuable time bringing itself up to speed with the situation which could lead to higher costs and a slower result. We do not agree with Mr Jackson that there may be some dangerous conflicts of interest where he perceives that a reporting accountant can exercise considerable economic power. Consider the case of the surgeon or barrister. If they recommend surgery or proceedings to trial is it envisaged that they would have to say 'sorry, please go to another surgeon/barrister as I have a perceived economic power in pursuing your case and therefore you need to go to somebody else to take the matter further'.

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Carlton stumbles Nervousness over Carlton Communications ahead of the annual meeting next week sent the shares down 17 to 947p in a buoyant sector. The selling was prompted by recent news that three big media organisations - MAI, Time Warner and Pearson - had formed a consortium to bid for a national Channel 5. The channel would be in competition with Carlton's terrestrial broadcast arm. There was also speculation that BZW, the company's joint broker, had lowered its forecasts although Mr Peter Hilliar, BZW's leisure analyst, said: 'If we were to change the figures we would move them up rather than down'. Hoare Govett said the shares had underperformed the All-Share index by 4.7 per cent over the past month and fallen to a 10 per cent premium. Pearson was steady at 720p and MAI firmed a penny to 296p. It was announced that MAI's bid for Anglia (up 4 at 655p) would not be referred to the monopolies and mergers commission. Television stocks were enlivened by the implications of Thursday's deal between Flextech, an arm of the world's biggest cable TV group, and HTV, the Welsh and West of England broadcaster. USM-listed Flextech rose 13 to 457p and HTV 7 to 159p. The improved bid potential gave a boost to the other regional groups. Scottish gained 24 to 574p while Ulster jumped 44 to 760p. Yorkshire Tyne-Tees rose 5 to 351p. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo lost two thirds of the gains notched up after Thursday's sparkling interim results. Some US investment houses refused to be cheered by the figures. Lehman Brothers, for example, said at its morning meeting: 'At a p/e of 15 times 1994 earnings Glaxo looks fully valued', and advised clients to take profits whenever the stock broke through 700p. The shares fell 18 to 679p. Hong Kong-related stocks, which have closely reflected the fortunes of the Hong Kong stockmarket recently, went their own ways. HSBC and Cable &amp; Wireless fell 29 to 990p and 13 to 469p respectively on profit-taking. Standard Chartered, benefiting from a recommendation by Swiss Bank, lifted 17 to 1302p. Oil majors reflected a crude oil price at a five-year low of around Dollars 13 a barrel. Analysts expect oil prices to remain under pressure at least until the next OPEC meeting in late March. BP fell 5 to 361p and Shell Transport lost 5 at 729p. ICI slid 15 to 774p ahead of figures on Thursday, which are forecast to reflect a turnaround in profits. In spite of downgrades late last year on concerns over tough trading conditions, analysts predict profits of between Pounds 270m and Pounds 328m, compared with hefty losses last year. Wellcome lost 8 at 656p. The company announced that the amount of shares held in the form of American Depositary Receipts was below 4 per cent for the first time since the 288m share offer by Wellcome Trust in August 1992. The stake has fallen to 3.97 per cent from a peak of 8.7 per cent then. Textiles company Atkins dropped 28 to 139p after a profits warning. Aerospace and medical equipment group Smiths Industries added 4 at 479p on perceptions that the group will benefit from this week's Dollars 6bn Saudi aircraft order. Smiths is a supplier to Boeing. A buyer of around 2m shares at 584p, boosted Inchcape, the shares gaining 3 to 579p. Vosper Thorneycroft raced 27 ahead to 799p, after an agency cross of around 200,000 shares at 800p a share. Concern over the extent of interest in the Channel tunnel helped P&amp;O, the cross-Channel ferry operator, the shares adding 6 to 700p. Ashtead resisted a thin day in building and construction stocks to rise 30 to 451p ahead of interims on Monday. Composites insurers were dragged down with the market, in spite of good figures expected next week. 'Pre-results torpor' was how one analyst described the day, adding that the market was forecasting a downturn in underwriting profits by 1994-95. First to report next Tuesday is Guardian Royal Exchange, down 7 to 232p. Charterhouse Tilney is forecasting a Pounds 165m profit. Commercial Union, down 12 to 636p, reports on Wednesday, with Panmure Gordon forecasting Pounds 190m against Pounds 24m last year. Thursday sees figures from Royal Insurance, down 5 to 314p. General Accident fell 11 to 681p and Sun Alliance 10 to 378p. A mixed trading statement from Greenalls confirmed the current dull trend among domestic drinks stocks. The shares fell 5 to 455p.</p>

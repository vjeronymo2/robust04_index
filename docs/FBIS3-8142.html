Most criticism regarded the "roadsign bill" on bilingual  names of communities, parliament did not pass, as well as the an  amended bill on names and surnames requiring the Slovak suffix  -ova for Hungarian female names, said Fico who represented  Slovakia on Tuesday's [1 March] meeting of the CE Committee.    "The law is good, but its interpretation is disputable,"  Fico  said, adding that "the atmosphere in the Committee was  orientated unequivocally against Slovakia."    The controversial issue of referendum on the loss of  mandates  of the deputies who quit their parties was not officially  raised, Fico reported. There was, however, certain fear "at  least" at the unofficial level of the CE.    The bilingual roadsigns and use of Hungarian names and  surnames are the most frequent demands of ethnic Hungarians  which are supported even by Slovak President Michal Kovac.</p>

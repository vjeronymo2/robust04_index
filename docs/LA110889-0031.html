			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAR-REPAIR SHOP EXPANSION OKD DESPITE PROTESTS;  </P> <P> ZONING: RESIDENTS OF A NORTH HOLLYWOOD AREA FAIL IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO USE A NEW  LAW TO DRIVE THE SHOP AND OTHERS LIKE IT OUT OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.  </P> <P> City zoning officials on Tuesday approved expansion of a North Hollywood  auto-repair shop, dealing a blow to residential neighbors hoping to force the  business and others nearby to move from the area.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals voted unanimously to grant owner Wayne  Durose a conditional use permit to expand his business at 11307 Burbank Blvd.,  provided that he met certain conditions.  </P> <P> Durose, who wants to knock down a 41-year-old garage and build a larger  facility, must perform all work inside the new building, ensure that his  customers' cars are not illegally parked on residential side streets and close  early on Saturdays. The board limited work at the shop to mechanical repairs  and prohibited Durose from continuing to perform auto-body repairs, including  spray-painting cars, which residents said releases fumes in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "I reluctantly, with great misgivings, conclude we are better off" with the  proposed development than with the older facility, where spray-painting and  auto-body work was performed, said Joseph D. Mandel, board vice chairman.  </P> <P> But neighbors said they will appeal to the City Council, which has final say  over the proposal. Residents said the proposal's defeat would send a message to  other business owners in the area to move out. About five residents testified  Tuesday at the hearing, and the board received letters from several others.  </P> <P> They said they have complained for years about fumes and noise from the  auto-body shops lining Burbank Boulevard between Lankershim Boulevard and  Vineland Avenue and are taking advantage of a new city ordinance to contest  Durose's expansion.  </P> <P> The ordinance, passed in February to protect residential neighborhoods,  requires public hearings on development proposals from auto-related businesses  within 300 feet of residences.  </P> <P> "For the first time, we have a choice, and we want a better quality of living,"  said Maria Fant, a longtime area resident. "There's no fresh air to be had on  Martha Street now, and the noise is unmerciful. If they allow the facility,  we'll have 10 times the problem."  </P> <P> But board members said the proposal appeared to be an improvement over the  existing business, which Durose wants to expand from 3,000 to about 5,000  square feet. Their action reversed a decision in August by Zoning Administrator  Robert Janovici, who had sided with neighbors.  </P> <P> Since then, Durose has modified his proposal, agreeing to set the new building  back five feet from residences and plant a landscape buffer, lower the  building's height to 19 feet, evict a tenant who had been cited for  spray-painting outdoors in violation of the law and stop all auto-body work at  the site.  </P> <P> Board Chairman James D. Leewong did not attend Tuesday's meeting.  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / APV shares plunge after margins warning: Food equipment manufacturer halves interim dividend and cites competition from German rival Shares in APV fell by 30 per cent, from 118 1/2 p to 83p, yesterday after the UK-based food processing equipment specialist cut its interim dividend and warned that it was facing increasing pressure on profit margins. APV blamed increasing competition on a recent push by GEA, a German manufacturer, into the liquid food equipment market long dominated by APV and Tetra Laval, the Swedish food packaging and equipment group. Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, said: 'It is clear to us that GEA has been extremely aggressive and is trying to elbow its way into the industry. This is not a happy scene in terms of margins.' APV reported an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 5.8m in the six months to June 30 but said it would take an unspecified charge in the second half to cover further restructuring of its liquid foods division. Sir Peter said: 'We remain committed to improving the group's profitability and consequently we will further attack our cost base and improve efficiencies.' Analysts could only guess at the size of the restructuring charge, but they certainly expect it to exceed forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m and push the group into a substantial loss. The group has raised about Pounds 100m from disposals in recent years, but there is little scope for further sales. Although gearing has been cut to 33 per cent, the decision to cut the interim dividend from 2p to 1p is a tacit admission that the year-end charge will strain APV's banking covenants. Sir Peter said that over the past few years APV had made real progress in rationalising capacity, improving efficiency, divesting non-core businesses and focusing on target markets. But he added: 'Competition in most of our major markets has recently become much more intense, and this is undermining prices at which orders are currently being won. We believe that competitive pressures are unlikely to ease in the near future.' Orders on hand at the end of June were 18 per cent higher than a year earlier and the value of orders received in July and August was significantly higher than in the same two months of 1993, although at lower margins. Sales from continuing operations rose 1.7 per cent to Pounds 381.3m. Earnings per share doubled from 0.5p to 1p. Lex, Page 18</p>

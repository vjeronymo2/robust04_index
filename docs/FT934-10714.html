			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Anger at VAT on orange juice THE Treasury last night moved to impose VAT on freshly squeezed orange juice from the beginning of December, holding out the prospect of an increase of more than 30p in the price of a one-litre carton, Philip Stephens writes. The move, through a parliamentary order which precluded debate on the floor of the Commons, triggered angry protests from some Tory MPs who saw it as the precursor to a wider extension of VAT in the Budget on November 30. It also brought accusations that the government had for the first time extended the VAT to fresh foods. Processed fruit juices, including orange, are subject to VAT at 17.5 per cent because they are classed as manufactured goods. But freshly squeezed juices - overwhelmingly orange - have been zero-rated. The market in fresh juices is worth about Pounds 50m per year. The Treasury said the zero-rating had been an anomaly, pointing out that apple juice was already subject to VAT at the standard rate. The rest of the fruit-juice industry, with sales of around Pounds 1bn a year, also paid the tax. But some Tory MPs said the Treasury's method of pushing through the change suggested it was afraid of a backlash from the Conservative back benches.</p>

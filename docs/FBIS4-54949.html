			<p>BFN     [Text] The Republic Party was one of the parties which have  already commented on the election results. Katalin Horvath  reports:    [Horvath] According to Republic Party Chairman Janos  Palotas,  people voted for parties rather than personalities. The  sweeping victory of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] was due  to this fact and it is the Hungarian Democratic Forum's  government policy -- not the MSZP -- which is responsible for  this. It is certain that these election results are not  politically healthy, Janos Palotas said. This kind of victory  is unprecedented even in the western democracies. But the MSZP  won in democratic elections and the will of society should be  respected.    As far as the economic policy programs of the MSZP and the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] are concerned, they are  similar to the Republic Party's economic ideas in many points,  although they can only be compared when the MSZP and the SZDSZ  present their ideas on domestic market regulation, taxes,  customs duties, and inflation.    Janos Palotas hopes that the MSZP's victory does not cause a  political shock and does not make the economy collapse. As far  as the Republic Party is concerned, in Janos Palotas's view the  party is ready for parliamentary work and it can enter  parliament in the next elections. The Republic Party is now  preparing for the local government elections.</p>

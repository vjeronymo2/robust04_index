			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK BOYS FINALLY BEAT CORONA DEL MAR IN CROSS-COUNTRY  </P> <P> Led by Eddie Salinas' record-breaking performance, the No. 1-ranked Saddleback  High School boys' cross-country team edged Corona del Mar, 26-29, Thursday in a  Sea View League dual meet at Mason Park.  </P> <P> Salinas, a junior, ran the mostly flat, three-mile course in 14 minutes 38  seconds, eclipsing the previous mark of 15:02 set last year by former Corona  del Mar star Eddie Lavelle.  </P> <P> Since Saddleback joined the Sea View League seven years ago, the school had  never beaten Corona del Mar in cross-country. And Corona del Mar had not lost a  dual meet since 1985. The Sea Kings, ranked sixth in the county, are the  three-time defending league champions.  </P> <P> "They've been looking forward to this for three years," Saddleback Coach Mel  Silva said. "We decided that if we were to be one of the best teams, we had to  beat the best team in the league."  </P> <P> Although four Corona del Mar runners took the lead from the start, Saddleback's  one-two punch of Salinas and Robbie Price took over and, by the two-mile mark,  held a commanding lead. In the final mile, Corona del Mar's Chris Cannon closed  in and passed Price, finishing second in 14:50.  </P> <P> In the girls' race, Corona del Mar breezed to a 15-47 victory, with Sea Kings  Kristen McFarland and Johanna Wallin tying for first in 19:30.  </P></p>

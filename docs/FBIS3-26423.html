Police arrested 23 people and seized 56 handguns and are  checking on the whereabouts of 3,000 other guns believed to have  been smuggled into Taiwan by the group over the past two years.    The arrested ringleaders of the group include Wang  Hai-sheng,  44, who was in charge of the group's finances; Liu San-chu, 41,  the group's marketing expert; Yin Ching-lin, 39, and Wang  Jung-chang, 34.    Initial investigations show that the group illegally brought  into Taiwan 3,000 guns and 18,000 rounds of ammunition in seven  shipments from 1992 through 1993. The shipments were labeled as  either electrical appliances or sporting goods to fool customs.</p>

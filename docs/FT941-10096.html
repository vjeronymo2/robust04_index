			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Clinton to speak at ILO anniversary President Bill Clinton is to speak at the 75th anniversary conference of the International Labour Organisation in June in a sign of his growing concern to introduce a social agenda into discussions on the global economy. It follows his decision to call a jobs summit next month in Detroit for the seven main industrialised nations to discuss global unemployment. Mr Clinton's trip to Geneva underlines the increasing importance the American administration is giving to labour questions, reflected in the training and employment policies being drawn up by Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary. It also indicates an important shift in American international labour strategy. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush the US took a hostile view of the work of the ILO and American employers believed it was hostile to the principles of free enterprise. Observers believe Mr Clinton's trip will provide a welcome support for the ILO's new social agenda which will be presented to the conference by its director-general Mr Michel Hansenne. In a recent report Mr Hansenne argued that the ILO needed to adopt a more positive line on social issues with the onset of freer international trade after the successful completion of the Gatt Uruguay Round and the creation of the North American Free Trade Area. The ILO believes this must go beyond the setting of universal standards of labour practice. Mr Clinton will be the first US president to travel to Switzerland to address the ILO. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt spoke to the ILO when it met in Philadelphia in 1944, when the organisation was relaunched in the closing stages of the second world war.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW INS CHIEF OPPOSES DITCH ALONG BORDER  </P> <P> In his first public appearance since his Senate confirmation, Immigration and  Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene McNary said Wednesday that he opposes  a controversial proposal to dig a 4-mile ditch along the U.S.-Mexican border  near San Diego.  </P> <P> "I don't think the ditch is a very good idea," McNary said at a press  conference.  </P> <P> When asked if he favors any form of physical barrier along the Mexican border,  McNary said that he wants to look at that possibility. But, in another apparent  reference to the ditch, he added: "Some of the suggestions made heretofore, I'm  not locked into them."  </P> <P> The new immigration commissioner said also that he plans to visit the Soviet  Union to determine the extent of persecution of Jews in that country and plans  to meet with advocacy groups who have been critical of the INS in the past.  </P> <P> His comments on the border ditch appeared to doom the controversial proposal,  which was supported by former INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson but condemned by  immigrant rights groups and the Mexican government.  </P> <P> The ultimate decision on the ditch rests with Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, who  is still considering it as an option, David Runkel, his spokesman, said. "He's  not made any final determination," said Runkel, who set no timetable for a  decision.  </P> <P> The proposed ditch would be 14 feet wide and 5 feet deep and would extend along  a 4-mile stretch of the Otay Mesa, a broad expanse of flat arid land east of  the port of entry at San Ysidro.  </P> <P> The concept, originally proposed as an environmental project to catch rainwater  runoff, was taken over by the INS early this year because of its potential for  curbing illegal immigration and drug trafficking.  </P> <P> U.S. authorities have said that hundreds of vehicles carrying illegal  immigrants and drugs go across the border in that region each month. But the  number has declined considerably since earlier this year, according to  immigration officials in San Diego.  </P> <P> Detractors likened the ditch proposal to a U.S. version of the Berlin Wall,  contending that the physical barrier would emphasize divisions between the  United States and Mexico at a time when Mexico City and Washington are working  toward improved relations.  </P> <P> An INS official said McNary's statement means that the agency is unlikely to  proceed with its plans for the $2-million excavation project. "The idea has  just died a natural death," the official said.  </P> <P> In San Diego, word of McNary's opposition to the ditch was applauded by some of  the project's opponents.  </P> <P> "I'm delighted that he has taken that position," said Bob Filner, a city  councilman who has argued against the project. "I hope we're going in the  direction of doing something that's acceptable to both governments."  </P> <P> In his comments on Soviet Jews, McNary said that one of his initial priorities  will be a visit to the Soviet Union to determine if Jews who want to immigrate  to the West are still being persecuted.  </P> <P> He said that he wants to study the reforms initiated by Soviet leader Mikhail  S. Gorbachev and assess the level of intimidation experienced by Jews in the  country.  </P> <P> Under previous U.S. policy, virtually any Soviet citizen who obtained  permission to leave the country was granted refugee status and admitted to the  United States.  </P> <P> In September, however, the Bush Administration adopted new rules that limit  immigration to applicants who have parents, children, brothers, sisters or  spouses living in the United States. Some exceptions are allowed for cases "of  special concern to the United States."  </P> <P> The new policy was adopted after U.S. officials realized that recent Soviet  reforms had resulted in more applications by Soviet citizens to enter this  country than immigration officials could handle.  </P> <P> "My concern is what's happening to those Soviet Jews who want to come to this  country," McNary said, adding that he wants to determine if the Soviet  government is persecuting or intimidating those seeking to move to the United  States.  </P> <P> "That's one of the things I'd like to go to Moscow to see. I think we need  first-hand observations of the situation in Moscow."  </P> <P> McNary did not address what policies he would advocate if his observations led  him to believe that persecution of Jews is not as widespread as once believed.  </P> <P> McNary said his early goals include meeting with advocacy groups concerned  about the rights of illegal immigrants and grappling with the agency's  administrative problems.  </P></p>

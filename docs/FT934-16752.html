			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A better way to export Exporters, the banks and the government are all criticised in a report* on the quality of services to help exports. Exporters are accused of insularity, the banks of not providing suitable support and the government of failing to market its services effectively. 'It is particularly depressing to note the number of active exporters who are insular in their approach to currency management, risk reduction and competitive sales practices,' commented Ian Campbell, director general of the Institute of Export, which commissioned the survey. It was based on the responses of 250 companies, 69 per cent with sales of up to Pounds 10m. All were already engaged in exporting. Few companies had a strategy for handling foreign exchange and many small companies would sell only in sterling, the survey found. Businesses were concerned at the cost of credit insurance premiums and British companies made less use of insurance than their continental European counterparts. Three-quarters of the companies polled went first to their bank for export advice, but smaller firms in particular were dissatisfied with the service they received. Most exporters financed exports from working capital, usually their bank overdraft, although 5 per cent used their own funds. This reliance on overdrafts and own funds reflected the decline in the number of special export finance schemes on offer from the banks. They have fallen from 13 to five over the past two years. Exporters were critical of services provided by the Department of Trade and Industry, with most criticism coming from companies which used the services least. Amid this general criticism, some elements of DTI help were rated more highly, including its regional offices, overseas trade missions and export market research service. 'The government still has much work to do in persuading smaller companies that the services it offers and the assistance it provides are relevant and beneficial to them,' the report, by the Bank Relationship Consultancy, said. *From Institute of Export Tel. 071 247 9812.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Discounters hurt Marui profit Marui, the big Japanese department store group, suffered sharp falls in non-consolidated profit and sales for the year ended January as consumer confidence continued to wane. The retailer said parent pre-tax profits fell 14.9 per cent to Y29.8bn (Dollars 280m), while sales declined 6 per cent to Y506.8bn. Japan's department stores have been hit by competition from discount retailers, with consumers opting for value at the expense of higher margin items. Mr Tadao Aoi, Marui's president, said the retailer will try to prevent further declines in sales. A fall in interest income due to the fall in interest rates also hurt profits, with after-tax profits down 12 per cent to Y16.5bn. For the current year, Marui expects profits to decline further. It predicts a 12.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y26bn on a 0.6 per cent rise in sales to Y510bn. Aoyama Trading, the Japanese retailer of discount men's suits, said it will tie up with JC Penney, the leading US department store, to set up a men's casual wear chain in Japan. Aoyama plans to open the first store in the autumn and expects to expand the chain to 50 to 70 stores during the year ending March, 1995.</p>

He said:    I hope Jordan and Israel will be able to defeat their  fundamentalists so that the desired peace between the two  countries can be achieved soon. I also hope that after signing  the peace treaty between them, it will be possible to execute  joint tourism projects that will attract foreign tourists to  Israel and Jordan. Businessmen and investors from Jordan are  prepared to cooperate with their Israeli counterparts to set up  joint ventures to serve the economies and tourist industries of  both countries.

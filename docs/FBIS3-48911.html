Many things we  hoped for did not happen, those which did happen were not always  done as they should have been, and meanwhile some other very  important things were achieved ensuring a good start for next  year," President Zhelyu Zhelev says in his New Year message to  the Bulgarian nation which will be broadcast on the National  Television and Radio a few minutes before 1994.    According to the president, the possibility of obtaining a  most favourable settlement of Bulgaria's foreign debt, of  quickly concluding an agreement with the International Monetary  Fund, of attracting foreign investments to Bulgaria, of  receiving compensations for the Bulgarian losses ensuing from  the Yugo embargo, of completing the restitution of land and of  carrying out mass privatization are the things that give ground  to believe that 1994 will mark a turning point in the period of  transition. We will either make it or will be listed in another  category of states, Dr. Zhelev says. However, making the  possible a reality depends on us and first of all on the  Bulgarian politicians, on their will and efficiency, on their  ability to place the national interests above their narrow party  ambitions and their strife for power, President Zhelev believes.    Bulgaria is not surrounded by enemies, it is not threatened  by hostile neighbours, the president says.    Addressing the Bulgarian people, President Zhelev wishes  everybody health, happiness and success in 1994. "May the New  Year be prosperous, peaceful and successful for Bulgaria,"  President Zhelev says in the end of his New Year message.</p>

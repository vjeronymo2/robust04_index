			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Clearly identify the pertinent major filing(s);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Comply with all applicable requirements of &sect;1.41 through &sect;1.52 of this chapter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of which official notice may be taken, are supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which are sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party in interest and that a grant or other FCC action regarding the major filing would be inconsistent with the public interest;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Be filed within 30 days after the date of the Public Notice listing the major filing; and.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Contain a certificate of service showing that a copy has been mailed to the applicant no later than the date of filing with the FCC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Expansion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Petitions to deny a major amendment to an application may raise only matters directly related to the major amendment that could not have been raised in connection with the application as originally filed. This paragraph does not apply to petitioners who gain standing because of the major amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dismissal <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The FCC may, by letter, dismiss any petition to deny a major filing if the petition does not comply with the requirements of this section, if the issues raised become moot, or if the petitioner or his/her attorney fails to appear at a settlement conference pursuant to &sect;22.135. The reason(s) for the dismissal are stated in the letter. When a petition to deny is dismissed, any related responsive pleadings are also dismissed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.131  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Mutually exclusive applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two or more pending applications are mutually exclusive if the grant of one application would effectively preclude the grant of one or more of the others under the rules governing the Public Mobile service involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procedures <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Procedures for disposing of mutually exclusive applications are prescribed in the subparts of this part governing the individual Public Mobile Services and in part 1 of this chapter. The FCC may first dismiss any applications that are untimely filed or otherwise subject to dismissal under &sect;22.128. If any remaining applications continue to be mutually exclusive, the FCC may grant one of the mutually exclusive applications and dismiss the rest pursuant to &sect;22.128. In selecting the application to grant, the FCC may use competitive bidding, random selection processes or comparative hearings, depending on the nature of the mutually exclusive applications involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Separate applications <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Applicants that file an application, knowing that it will be mutually exclusive with one or more applications, should not include in the mutually exclusive application a request for other channels of facilities that would not, by themselves, render the application mutually exclusive with those other applications. Instead, the request for such other channels or facilities should be filed in a separate application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.132  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Grant of applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for authorization may be granted thirty days after the issuance date of a Public Notice listing an application or the latest filed major amendment thereto as acceptable for filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Criteria for grants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The FCC grants applications without a hearing if, after examination of the application and consideration of any petitions or other pleadings and of such other matters as it may officially notice, the FCC finds that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A grant will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) There are no substantial and material questions of fact presented;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The applicant is eligible and qualified under applicable FCC regulations and policies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The application is acceptable for filing, and complies with the FCC rules and other applicable requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The application has not been designated for a hearing after being selected in a random selection process;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) There are no applications entitled to comparative consideration with the application being granted; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Operation of the proposed station would not cause interference to any authorized station(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grant of petitioned applications <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The FCC may grant, without a formal hearing, applications against which petitions to deny has been filed. If any petition(s) to deny are pending (i.e. have not been dismissed pursuant to &sect;22.130(c) or withdrawn by the petitioner) when an application is granted, the FCC denies the petition(s) and issues a concise statement of the reason(s) for the denial, disposing of all substantive issues raised in the petitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Partial and conditional grants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The FCC may grant applications in part, and/or subject to conditions other than those normally applied to authorizations of the same type. When the FCC does this, it will inform the applicant of the reasons therefor. Such partial or conditional grants are final unless the FCC revises its action in response to a petition for reconsideration. Such petitions for reconsideration must be filed by the applicant within thirty days after the date of the letter or order stating the reasons for the partial or conditional grant, and must reject the partial or conditional grant and return the instrument of authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Designation for hearing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The FCC may designate applications for a hearing, specifying with particularity the matters in issue, if, after consideration of the application, any petitions or other pleadings, and other matters which it may officially notice, the FCC is unable to make one or more of the findings listed in paragraph (a) of this section. The FCC may grant, deny or take other action with respect to applications designated for a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.135  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Settlement conference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Parties are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution procedures to settle disputes (see subpart E of part 1 of this chapter). In any contested proceeding, the FCC, in its discretion, may direct the parties or their attorneys to appear before it for a conference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The purposes of such conferences are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To obtain admissions of fact or stipulations between the parties as to any or all of the matters in controversy;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To consider the necessity for or desirability of amendments to the pleadings, or of additional pleadings or evidentiary submissions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) To consider simplification or narrowing of the issues;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) To encourage settlement of the matters in controversy by agreement between the parties; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) To consider other matters that may aid in the resolution of the contested proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

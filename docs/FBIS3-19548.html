			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "JAS to Meeting in Norway?"] </F>   [Text] The Norwegian Air Force wants to see the JAS-39  Gripen multirole air defense and attack aircraft at an air  display in Norway this summer and has sent a formal request to  the Swedish Air Force to that effect, Lt. Col. Anders Eisen  revealed.    "Before we can reply, the Air Force and the JAS consortium  has to fix its next program of test flights," he said. "The  only thing we can do at the moment is show the aircraft on the  ground or in a simple fly-past."    The JAS received bad press when it crashed during an air  show  at the Water Festival last year.    According to Jan Ahlgren of Saab's Military Aircraft  Division, Norway -- which will start replacing its U.S. F-5  aircraft by the turn of the century -- is among the countries  which have shown an interest in the JAS-39.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY'S ANNUAL SURVEY ENCOURAGING;  </P> <P> * IT SHOWS A COMMITMENT TO MAKE THINGS WORK  </P> <P> From afar, Orange County is easily stereotyped as a kitschy mix of right-wing  extremists, glamorous Newport Beach jet-setters and freeway cowboys, with a  heavy dose of back-yard barbecuers.  </P> <P> But as the Orange County Annual Survey revealed last week, people here are much  more complex, and much more mainstream, than that. They are worried not just  about preserving their suburban lifestyle but about their own impact on the  environment. They hate traffic congestion and seem more willing than before to  pay for mass transit to relieve it. They are concerned about growth but are  just as worried about providing housing for young families who hope to buy  their first homes.  </P> <P> In short, the ninth annual survey's latest snapshot reveals that Orange  County's reputation for provincialism and extreme politics does not adequately  reflect the maturity that residents are in fact showing in 1990. These new  attitudes are important because they can empower the people who live here to  deal with today's complicated problems.  </P> <P> For one thing, the pessimism so dominant in previous surveys has leveled off,  indicating residents aren't indulging in doom and gloom or an attitude of  resignation about problems. Yes, people seem frightened about the current  downturn in the economy, but there is an underlying commitment to make things  work.  </P> <P> Those are all good signs. It is important that local leaders build on that  sentiment to help Orange County confront the very tough economic times that  appear to be ahead.  </P> <P> Among other things, the survey found that the environment has evolved into one  of the county's major concerns, ranking with crime, taxes and jobs. Residents  have been conserving water and recycling trash, especially in the past year,  many for the first time ever.  </P> <P> The tougher issue of reducing gasoline consumption, however, still has not yet  been seriously confronted, the survey indicated. The same huge percentage of  residents -- about 80% -- prefer commuting solo to any other means of  transportation. They like the idea of high-speed trains or other methods of  public transit, but, for now at least, they prefer to leave the alternatives to  others.  </P> <P> But transportation officials should take note that "improving public  transportation" ranked almost as high as "widening existing freeways" as a  funding priority -- a marked change from six years ago. There is a strong  interest in rapid rail, including monorails, as a way to ease traffic. And  people are much more willing to entertain the idea of car pools or public  transit when they are confronted with higher parking fees and other increased  costs of driving. That means that there is a unique opportunity to build  political support for mass transit and car-pooling.  </P> <P> One other significant survey finding is that Orange County residents are very  suspicious of regional government as a means of addressing problems. Keep in  mind that such approaches have worked well elsewhere, and may become important  in the years ahead.  </P> <P> The Orange County Annual Survey was conducted by UC Irvine social ecology  professor Mark Baldassare and researcher Cheryl Katz, and sponsored by public  agencies, private foundations and corporations, including The Times Orange  County edition. Combined with November's surprising election results -- in  which a countywide half-cent sales tax for transportation and two important  local environmental measures were approved -- the survey results indicate that  Orange County is growing up.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTTERY SALES DROP BY 25%  </P> <P> I wish to commend The Times for its editorial ("More Winners Make for Better  Business," Aug. 20), which was critical of the lottery administration and its  latest move to increase its "take." However, I would like to point out that  your statement, "Does common sense say that you will attract more players if  one person occasionally wins $40 million . . .," is not applicable to the  lottery if it is referring to a jackpot winner.  </P> <P> For example, if you win $40 million, the state pockets the $40 million and pays  you only 5% of that amount each year for 20 years. If the state wanted to  invest that $40 million in, say U.S. Treasury notes paying over 8%, it could  earn over 3% per year for the next 20 years and still end up with the $40  million. Even if the state spends your $40 million immediately, it ends up with  an obligation to you similar, in effect, to a 20-year municipal bond that pays  5% interest per year for 20 years and zero principal at maturity.  </P> <P> Apparently, lottery officials with their latest gimmick to increase the odds to  increase the jackpot, are firm believers in the old maxim "never give a sucker  an even break."  </P> <P> ROBERT H.

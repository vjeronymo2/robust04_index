			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A shell fired at a market in Sarajevo yesterday  killed 68 and wounded 200. This carnage has provoked outrage  everywhere and has already resulted in a response by NATO  countries this afternoon. There were many contacts between  capitals today, and it was decided to organize a NATO meeting as  early as possible. France will call on its allies to serve an  ultimatum on the belligerents in Bosnia, a three-point  ultimatum. Let's listen to French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe:    [Begin Juppe recording] First, the siege of Sarajevo must be  lifted, this means that Serbian forces must pull back to a  distance making the renewed shelling of the town materially  impossible. Second, with a view to lifting this siege, heavy  weapons held by Serbs and Bosnians within a range of 30 km  around the town must be brought together and put under UN  Protection Force control. This measure will be the first stage  in setting up the UN administration over Sarajevo which is --  let me remind you -- a basic element of the European Union peace  plan and which has been accepted in principle by all parties.  Third, if these two conditions are not met within a short  deadline to be set by the allies, all means, including air  power, should be used to enforce them. [end recording]    [Announcer] This statement was made less than half an hour  ago at the Quai d'Orsay and was recorded by Philippe Lefebvre.</p>

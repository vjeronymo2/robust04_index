			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: New centre helps Bentalls cut interim deficit to Pounds 419,000 BENTALLS, the department store operator, reported a reduced interim pre-tax loss yesterday helped by an exceptional gain and the first rental income from the recently completed Bentall Centre in Kingston. The group, which operates seven department stores in the south-east of England, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 419,000 (Pounds 1.05m) in the six months to July 31. But despite posting losses per share of 0.67p (0.29p), the group is maintaining the 0.6p interim dividend. Turnover grew by 11 per cent to Pounds 33.8m (Pounds 30.5m) led by the flagship Kingston store, which accounts for 60 per cent of the total, and by sales of household items. Operating profits of Pounds 480,000 (Pounds 971,000 loss), were bolstered by the Pounds 825,000 minimum guaranteed rental income from the Bentall Centre which opened in November and by Pounds 345,000 in receipts from reductions in the uniform business rate on two of the smaller stores and the head office building. These gains helped offset interest charges which increased to Pounds 899,000, against Pounds 75,000 last time when the group benefited from Pounds 1.27m of capitalised interest. Mr Edward Bentall, chairman, said the results included reduced losses at the group's store at the Thurrock Lakeside shopping centre which was acquired two years ago. In the second half, the group is also expected to benefit from the increased customer traffic generated by the Bentall Centre, particularly during the important Christmas period.</p>

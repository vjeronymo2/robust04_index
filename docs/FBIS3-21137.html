			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Researchers working on the Kimura Metamelt Project  at the Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC) have  found that the density of liquid silicon changes over time and  shows abnormality in temperature dependency, both of which  suggest a structural change in liquid silicon on the atomic  level. In the past, it was believed that the density of liquid  silicon changed in a linear manner, but when researchers  measured the density with a measuring device they developed,  they found that the rate of change in density was different  depending on the temperature region, and they also confirmed  that the density changed over time. By controlling the liquid  silicon with these parameters, it should be possible to improve  the quality of silicon crystals when they are pulled  [Czochralski Process] and also to increase the yield. These  results were announced on 10 December at the meeting to report  on research in Operations To Promote Innovative Science and  Technology at JRDC held at the Keidanren Hall in Otemachi, Tokyo.    To measure the density of the liquid precisely in the Kimura  Project, a method based on Archimedes Principle was adopted that  uses a dual probe to cancel the effect of surface tension when a  float with a constant volume is submerged in the liquid. The  float is made of graphite and coated with silicon carbide like a  crucible to give it heat resistance. This enables highly precise  measurements to an accuracy of 1%.    Researchers measured the density of silicon liquid with this  device. When they plotted a graph of density vs. temperature,  they found that the slope of the change in density (temperature  dependency) was different in three separate regions. Density is  an important quantity reflecting the number of atoms and the  distance between adjacent atoms. Until now it was believed that  the density decreased linearly and that silicon liquid changed  linearly from a semiconductor to a metal. However, with this  recent confirmation that the slope of the change in density is  different in low-, mid-, and high-temperature regions,  researchers now believe that when silicon first begins to melt  it forms giant aggregates of atoms (clusters) with covalent  bonds, in the mid-temperature range it becomes a mixture of  metallic atoms and chains of atoms with covalent bonds, and in  the high-temperature range the atoms all become metallic.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-07A>           Temperature Dependency of Density in Liquid Silicon </FIG>       Researchers also studied the change of density over time at  1431C, which is the boundary between the low- and  mid-temperature regions. After melting began, the density rose  for three hours and then gradually fell off. Researchers believe  this means that the covalent bonds require time to be broken,  and this phenomenon appears as a change in density over time.    The discovery of this phenomenon provides the first  scientific corroboration of know-how learned through experience  at silicon crystal-pulling sites such as the saying: ``You get  high quality crystals if you wait two or three hours after  melting before you pull.''    Researchers have not only obtained some clues on controlling  the liquid by noting this change in its properties, but this  discovery also opens the door to a dramatic reduction in the  density of defects in pulled crystals, etc.</p>

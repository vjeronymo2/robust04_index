			<p>BFN     [Text] We have talked about the testimony of a former drug  dealer who has been questioned by the U.S. Senate and who has  implicated members of Haiti's military in drug trafficking,  including the chief of Police. The following is Lieutenant  Colonel Joseph Michel Francois' defense to those accusations. We  read:    On 28 October 1993, I publicly challenged Father Aristide or  any of his supporters, foreign or national, to bring just one  piece of proof of the existence of any link between myself and  illicit drug trafficking. The allegations of drug dealer Gabriel  Taboada, in prison for five years now and a witness in the  service of U.S. agencies, reveal only two things: a blatant lack  of imagination from the silent partners to this accususation  which is, according to Beaumarchais, the last resort of cowards.  Second point: the unbearable thoughtlessness with which the  Haitian case is being treated in the United States. So far as I  am concerned, the challenge remains complete.    This was a note from Lt. Col. Michel Francois in reaction to  accusations of drug trafficking.</p>

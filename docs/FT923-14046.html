			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Nike strides ahead but L A Gear falls back THE contrasting fortunes of Nike and LA Gear, two of the biggest sports shoe and apparel makers, was underscored yesterday when they turned in results for the three months to May 31. Nike, which has steadily improved its performance in spite of the recession and a weak retail climate, said its fourth-quarter net income grew 21 per cent to Dollars 70.7m, or 92 cents a share, from Dollars 58.6m, or 76 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose 18 per cent to Dollars 847.6m from Dollars 719m. Nike's results were stronger than Wall Street had expected, and the shares jumped Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 66 1/8 at midday yesterday. For the full year, Nike's net earnings rose 15 per cent to Dollars 329.2m, or Dollars 4.30, from Dollars 287m, or Dollars 3.77, in 1991. Revenues advanced to Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 3bn. Mr Philip Knight, chairman and chief executive, said futures orders for the next six months were up 17 per cent, which 'sets the stage for another record year in 1993. This increase reflects US retailers' continued success with Nike products in an otherwise difficult retail environment.' He added the company was committed to achieving revenues of Dollars 6bn by 1996. LA Gear, which brought in a new management team this year in an attempt to reverse its fortunes, posted a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 24.4m, or Dollars 1.29. The results were distorted by an after-tax charge of Dollars 13.9m, or 68 cents, from the settlement of lawsuits. In the 1991 second quarter, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 4m, or 20 cents, including losses from discontinued operations of 3 cents a share. Sales dropped 36.9 per cent in the 1992 quarter to Dollars 104.7m from Dollars 166m, reflecting a drop in shoes sold and a fall in selling prices as LA Gear continues to liquidate inventory. The company expects to stay in the red for the rest of 1992 as it continues to liquidate old inventory and increases promotional spending.</p>

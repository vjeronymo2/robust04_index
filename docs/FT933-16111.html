			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Defence spending declines to 50-year low: RAF to lose another Tornado squadron EVEN IF the Ministry of Defence manages to defend itself against further Treasury pressure - which is by no means certain - defence spending is set to drop from 3.9 per cent of Britain's gross domestic product to 3.2 per cent in two years, the lowest level for some 50 years. This year's defence white paper contains a series of cuts further to the Options for Change plan of three years ago, which reduced the armed forces by more than 20 per cent. It contrasts sharply with previous years, when the annual Statement on the Defence Estimates has been little more than a recapitulation of policy. Following public expenditure curbs in November, the Ministry of Defence lost Pounds 1.05bn from its spending plans for this year and 1994-95. After the strong emphasis on defence at the height of the Thatcher years, the government has tried to portray the changes as a logical response to a changed world, and to fend off the impression of being forced by Treasury pressure to cut back. But it has never been completely convincing. Two guided-weapon projects have been abandoned: An air defence system to replace the Bloodhound missile, withdrawn because of old age in 1991. British Aerospace was bidding for the Pounds 500m-plus contract jointly with Raytheon, makers of the Patriot missile. GEC and Siemens Plessey were also bidding in separate partnerships with foreign companies. The MoD says there is 'no near-term requirement', leaving open the possibility of a more advanced anti-missile system later. Guided anti-tank munitions for multiple rocket launchers. After spending Pounds 100m, Britain has joined Germany and the US in withdrawing from this project, leaving only France. Other cuts are made in existing equipment on the grounds of a reduced direct threat to the UK and to Atlantic shipping routes: The frigate and destroyer fleet. In the 1980s the number of craft was firmly set at 'about 50'. It is now 39 and due to be reduced to 'about 35'. But more of the latest Type 23 frigates will still be built. Diesel-electric submarines. Four new Upholder class vessels, built at a cost of about Pounds 900m, the last one commissioned just 10 days ago, are to be sold, leased or mothballed. Older minesweepers will be taken out of service, leaving a smaller fleet, although with more new Sandown class minehunters. The RAF, after losing 14 aircraft squadrons under Options for Change, will lose a further squadron of Tornado F3 air-defence fighters. One of the RAF's seven Awacs radar aircraft will be put in reserve. On the other hand, unspecified extra funds have been set aside to provide the RAF with its long-promised troop-carrying helicopters, a question the MoD says it is now 'urgently considering'. Plans for a new helicopter carrier, once thought to have been axed, were already confirmed in May. The changes form part of a long line of reviews and adjustments since the second world war, made necessary by a mismatch between the role Britain has sought to play in the world and its means for fulfilling it. The white paper sets out for the first time in detail the tasks allotted to Britain's forces and the assets - battalions, ships, aircraft - and resources earmarked for them. These tasks grouped under three broad headings: protection of the UK and dependent territories; Nato defence; and wider security interests including peacekeeping. They range from nuclear deterrence to the reinforcement of Brunei. The white paper can be seen as a defence both against arbitrary financial cuts and against parliamentary critics who argue that cuts have gone too far. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, has been desperate to avoid a repeat of the recent row over Army strength which he failed to quell in February by increasing planned numbers by 3,000 to 119,000. Officials say Army 'overstretch' will be eased by 1995 when reorganisation is complete and troops have been withdrawn from posts such as Belize. Because forces are often available for more than one job, the white paper purports to demonstrate that Britain is getting Pounds 43.1bn-worth of defence for its Pounds 23.6bn annual expenditure. The government sees the data as providing the basis for 'a coherent and viable debate on defence'. More cuts, however, are to come. RAF and navy personnel are due to fall below the 70,000 and 52,500 levels set out in the white paper, already reduced since Options for Change. A new air-launched nuclear missile, costing up to Pounds 3bn and under discussion with France and the US since 1988, is virtually certain to be cancelled. A verdict is still awaited on whether the Army will get more Challenger 2 tanks, or updated Challenger 1s, and how many. Also undecided is the extent of plans for upgrading Tornado bombers. The MoD's suppliers still lack all the answers they have been waiting for.</p>

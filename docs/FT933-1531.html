			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hostages to declining housing market fortunes - Andrew Bolger looks at the events leading up to the boardroom clear-out at Spring Ram IN HIS eight short weeks as chairman of Spring Ram, Mr Roger Regan has become used to grim jokes about what he would do to the former stock market star - on the lines of 'kitchen-sinking' the accounts and management bloodbaths. Yesterday's announcement of a boardroom clear-out, heavy losses and a much-depleted balance sheet lived up fully to its lurid advance billing. But Mr Regan, a veteran of the building industry, also insisted: 'I know this company is fundamentally sound.' Invited to take over by Prudential Corporation and other institutional investors, Mr Regan said that he and Mr Martin Towers, his new finance director, were confident they had got to the bottom of the Yorkshire company's problems. The chairman said: 'We've turned over the whole field and made sure there's nothing else.' The new team at Spring Ram believes that the departing management at the bathroom and kitchens group became prisoners of their own propaganda, and the high expectations they had raised in the City of being able to maintain growth - even through the UK housing market's worst crash. Founded by Mr Bill Rooney in 1979, Spring Ram rapidly became a leading producer of self-assembly kitchens and bathrooms by investing heavily in technologically advanced factories on greenfield sites. However, problems began to surface in 1991, when the falling housing market made it increasingly difficult for the group to maintain the growth which had turned it into a highly-rated stock. Mr Regan said: 'Senior management did not want to recognise that the recession had happened, and kept up the pressure on managers to deliver.' Mr Towers said: 'There was a culture of override by head office. Certain individuals went out of their way to wind it all up, and were still reaching for the sky as trading deteriorated.' The new finance director said it was these pressures which lay behind what he described as 'very aggressive' previous accounting, such as the early booking of sales, treatment of grant income and spending on marketing and business development, and the sale and leaseback of plant and equipment. The new chairman believes the departure of 10 directors - including three at board level - has removed the problem, and said financial staff and managers in the group were now relieved to be working in a more realistic environment. He said Spring Ram's shift from having Pounds 45m in cash in the bank at the end of 1991 to its current position of carrying a significant level of core borrowings came as a surprise to most of the management. The chairman believes that an important check on the business was lost when Mr Bob Murray, co-founder of Spring Ram with Mr Rooney, left the group in 1990. Mr Regan said: 'As well as marketing drive, every business needs someone who goes around switching off the lights every night, and asks: 'What happens if this goes wrong?' ' The most expensive misjudgments by the old guard were the start-up last year of two businesses, Regency Doors and Artisan Tile, which Mr Regan said 'were permitted to commence trading without the benefit of definitive business plans, and without an adequate appreciation of the technical, production and marketing issues surrounding the early development of the businesses.' The operations lost an aggregate Pounds 6.2m in the six months to July 3. Most of the losses were made at Regency, on which the group has to date invested a total of Pounds 46m. Mr Regan's decision to keep them going is the most controversial and unexpected of his initial decisions, since analysts and institutional investors had been bracing themselves for an early closure. The chairman acknowledges that the write-down involved would have blown such a substantial hole in Spring Ram's balance sheet that he would probably have had to seek a rights issue, but denied that was the deciding factor in the decision to keep them trading. He was confident that Regency could be turned into a profitable, cash-generative business, although he anticipated between 12 and 18 months of reducing losses while technical and marketing problems were solved. Mr Regan bases his confidence in Spring Ram as a whole on the high standing which he says the group's products have with its biggest customers, such as Texas and B&amp;Q, the DIY multiples. But he believes that decentralisation within the group has been taken to excessive lengths, leading to unnecessary duplication of stocks and overheads. Tighter control of cash should improve profitability, although the chairman was cautious about the group's full-year results. Mr Regan is also keen not to take a public view of the share price. 'I want the market to determine the value of these shares - if I give them all the facts, they will decide,' he said. Both Mr Regan's long haul on the trading side and the market's revaluation exercise could be cut short by a bid from prospective buyers such as Masco, the US building products group. Mr Regan will contact Masco, but said he did not expect any prospective bid would match the potential value of the business. Meanwhile, the City is left to pick over the lessons of another fallen favourite. In many ways, Spring Ram was an unlikely go-go stock: no rights issues, few acquisitions and what was, until recently, believed to be an ungeared balance sheet. Spring Ram stuck out in one key respect, however: its apparent ability to defy declining markets. Yesterday's red ink and resignations thus illustrate one of the stock market's oldest adages: 'If a thing looks too good to be true, it probably is.'</p>

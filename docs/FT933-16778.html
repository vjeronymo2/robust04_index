			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Daimler-Benz to reclaimeast German property: Issue raises doubts on treaty DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial holding company, is seeking to reclaim property in eastern Germany which was expropriated during the Soviet occupation between 1945 and 1949. The decision throws into question the interpretation of Germany's unification treaty which states that 'the expropriations on the basis of the Occupation Law (1945-1949) are irreversible.' If Daimler-Benz can prove that the Soviet Union never asked for the irreversibility of these expropriations, then thousands of former owners of industry and land in eastern Germany could claim back their property. Over 14,000 landowners, covering 13,000 square miles, had their property expropriated during this period. Many include former aristocratic land owners in Prussia. Daimler-Benz is claiming over 1m square metres of industrial property. If the claim by Daimler-Benz is successful, it would also mean that efforts to speed outstanding claims on property in eastern Germany would be set back for many more years. Daimler-Benz said yesterday it was simply 'acting on behalf of its shareholders. They regard it as our duty to do so. If there is any chance to get the property back, we would try to get hold of it,' a spokesman added. Daimler-Benz is also acting on behalf of Mercedes Benz, Dasa, and AEG, the electronics company which before 1945 had 90 per cent of its manufacturing base located in eastern Germany. All three are part of the group's holding company. The spokesman denied that by claiming back its industrial sites, Daimler-Benz was challenging the unification treaty. 'We started putting in our claims in late 1990 in order to keep our rights alive so that when there would be any change in the unification treaty, we would be in a position to claim our rights,' said the spokeman. Under the unification treaty, those whose property was confiscated between 1933 and 1945, and between 1949 and 1990, have the right to restitution, or compensation. Until recently, it had been claimed by the German government, that as a precondition for the unification of the two Germanies, the Soviet Union had insisted that no property which it expropriated during its occupation of eastern Germany between 1945 to 1949 should be given back to their former owners. But Daimler Benz, and other claimants are now arguing, in the light of documents available from Moscow, that the Soviet Union never insisted on this clause. Instead, they claim Moscow only asked that the 'lawfulness' of decisions made by the Soviet Union between 1945 and 1949 should not be questioned by courts in Germany. They claim that the last east German government, which was led by Mr Lothar de Maiziere, did not want aristocrats to claim back their property, and had used the Soviet Union 'precondition' as a means of preventing their return.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Those were the days: Transcaucasia may welcome a reassertion of Russian power 'The ebbing of Russian power after the 1917 revolution seemed to provide more auspicious conditions in which the national aspirations of the peoples of Transcaucasia could be realised. As it turned out, Russia's weakness proved only temporary . . . The record of the independent republics of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia established in the interim was in any case not particularly promising.' The quote is from Post-Soviet Transcaucasia by Jonathan Aves (RIIA, Pounds 6.50) - the latest in the impressive series of papers produced by Chatham House's Post-Soviet Business Forum. And the question it raised for me - one that has been nagging away at the back of my mind ever since the Soviet Union began to break up - was: will history repeat itself? For if one thing emerges clearly from Mr Aves's paper, it is that the record of those three republics is not very promising this time round, either. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been gradually destroying each other since 1988 in the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, while Georgia has been destroying itself almost single-handedly. Georgia's leaders, it is true, tend to blame Russia for stirring up trouble, notably in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Mr Aves, a lecturer in Russian government at the London School of Economics, only partially endorses such accusations. He is much more scathing about the Georgian leaders themselves, especially the self-appointed defence minister, Mr Tengiz Kitovani. Even the widely respected former Soviet foreign minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, does not come out too well. Mr Aves admits that Mr Shevardnadze's return to head the Georgian government a year ago 'established the credentials of the new regime', but he goes on to point out that, 'dominated by ex-communists', the government has so far taken no significant measures to promote economic reform, 'despite the republic's catastrophic economic situation'. At the same time he detects a 'drift towards authoritarianism'. A personality cult appears to be emerging around Mr Shevardnadze, and critics of the government find it increasingly difficult to express their views. Mr Aves is equally pessimistic about Azerbaijan, in spite of its relative good fortune in having 'a strong agricultural base and enough oil to give it a trade surplus with the other republics'. Paradoxically, he says, 'these economic strengths have combined with political turmoil to retard plans for economic reform', since the government 'appears to believe that future income from oil removes the need for rapid change'. At the same time, military reverses at the hands of the Armenians have undermined political stability, and the hold on power of President Abul'faz El'chibei, the nationalist leader who came to power last year, 'is by no means to be taken for granted'. Armenia's President Levon Ter-Petrosian gets slightly better marks, for introducing at least some economic reforms, and having the political skill to consolidate his power base without resorting to authoritarianism. But such compliments will ring hollow in the ears of the many Armenians now enduring their second winter in unheated apartments, and often short of food, thanks to the Azerbaijani blockade and the repeated sabotage of the gas pipeline through Georgia. Nor is Armenia's political stability exactly obvious when, since Mr Aves's paper went to press, the president has had to dismiss his prime minister (for denouncing the government's own economic plan in a speech to parliament), the opposition has spurned the president's offers of a coalition government, and over 100,000 people have demonstrated in the capital, Yerevan, demanding his resignation. More ominous still is Mr Aves's warning that, although Armenia had the best of last year's fighting, the odds favour an Azerbaijani military victory in the long run. Armenia, he points out, has few natural resources and no outlet to the sea, being 'bordered by an unreliable ally, in the form of Georgia, an uneasy partner, in the form of Iran, a hostile regional power, in the form of Turkey, and a declared enemy, in the form of Azerbaijan'. There must, Mr Aves says, 'be a serious question mark over the long-term future of the state'. Although Armenians, radicalised by the Karabakh issue, were one of the first Soviet peoples to demand independence in the late 1980s, they are also the one with most to lose when Russian influence in their region declines. In 1920 Armenia had to beg for Russian protection to prevent itself being overrun by the Turks; and by 1992 it had become, alone in the region, 'a loyal and enthusiastic member' of the Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States. Most Armenians will therefore be glad to hear that 'in 1992 there has been a perceptible reassertion of Russian influence in Transcaucasia', and may even hope that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, obtains the United Nations mandate he requested for his country last Sunday, to serve as 'guarantor of peace and stability' throughout the former Soviet Union. Pax Russica is, after all, the only peace that Transcaucasia has known in the last two centuries; and the chances of its peoples making peace spontaneously among themselves seem very slight.</p>

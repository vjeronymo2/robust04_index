			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis tweaked President Bush by accusing him of  apparently failing to include cleanup funds for Boston Harbor in his budget  message. Recalling the sometimes nasty presidential election, during which he  was Bush's opponent, Dukakis reminded his audience at a reception that Bush had  made an issue of Boston Harbor in the campaign by accusing Dukakis of being  unable to clean up the polluted waters. "Without being parochial, I want you  all to know that there is no money for the Boston Harbor cleanup, zero,"  Dukakis said.  </P></p>

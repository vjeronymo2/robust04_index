			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER SHOOTS, KILLS HIS ALLEGED ATTACKER  </P> <P> A police officer attempting to break up a domestic dispute shot and killed a  man who allegedly hit him with a metal fan, Orange police said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Ramon Ibarra Ibarra, 27, died at 10:09 p.m. Monday at Western Medical  Center-Santa Ana. He had been shot twice -- once in the left side of the chest  and once in the buttocks, hospital spokeswoman Ellen Ball said.  </P> <P> The officer, whose name was withheld pending an investigation by the Orange  County district attorney's office, was treated for a head wound by his private  doctor and released, Sgt. Bob Gustafson said.  </P> <P> Ibarra's common-law wife, Connie Owen, said she called the police to their  apartment on South Lemon Street after Ibarra came home from work in a rage and  threatened to kill her and harm their five young children.  </P> <P> "I feel sorry for the policemen," Owen said as she sat on the front stoop of  the apartment complex, still in a daze from the night of violence. "But they  didn't have to shoot him. All I wanted was for them to take him away."  </P> <P> Orange police and the district attorney's office, which routinely investigates  officer-involved shootings, released only sketchy details of Monday's incident.  </P> <P> Gustafson said Ibarra ignored orders to surrender, picked up the fan and swung  it at the officer, hitting him in the head. The officer then opened fire. Owen  described the fan as a three-foot-square metal fan.  </P> <P> Gustafson declined to say how many shots were fired or how many officers were  present at the time of the shooting.  </P> <P> With tears welling up in her eyes, Owen recounted the events that led up to  Ibarra's death.  </P> <P> She said that Ibarra came home about 9 p.m. and that the couple immediately got  in a fight. He struck her and their 5-year-old daughter and appeared to be  under the influence of drugs, she said. Police declined to comment on whether  there was evidence of drugs or alcohol abuse.  </P> <P> "He was just out of it on drugs," Owen said as she held her 3-month-old baby,  Debbie. "He kept saying he was going to kill me. . . ."  </P> <P> "I've seen him mad before," she said of Ibarra, an immigrant from Mexico who  had recently lost his job. "This time I thought he was going to kill me and the  kids."  </P> <P> Owen said she and the children fled the apartment, seeking refuge in a  neighboring unit.  </P> <P> A short time later, Ibarra wandered out to a common area of the narrow complex  and began screaming her name and shouting obscenities. He then walked back  inside, she said.  </P> <P> At that point, Owen said, she called police as she had a week earlier when he  threatened her.  </P> <P> Officers arrived at the apartment minutes later and went into the darkened  home, Owen said.  </P> <P> Owen said she stood outside and heard Ibarra taunting the officers. "They  (police) said, 'Stop where you are.' But he kept screaming for them to come and  get him."  </P> <P> "The next thing I knew, I heard two shots. I knew it was Raymond who was hit.  He doesn't have a gun."  </P> <P> After the shooting, Owen said, she saw an officer "pacing back and forth in  front of the building, all nervous. He was waving his arms and he looked really  torn up, I could tell."  </P> <P> The incident was the second officer-involved shooting in Orange County in a  week, and the 10th this year. Three of the shootings, including Monday's, were  fatal.  </P> <P> On Friday, a sheriff's deputy critically wounded an armed man suspected of  beating a taxicab driver with a .45-caliber automatic pistol, stealing his car  and leading police on a freeway chase.  </P> <P> Last week, the district attorney's office ruled that Orange County officers  were justified in the shooting deaths of two men in March and April. Two  off-duty Los Angeles police officers who were working as security guards were  exonerated in a third.  </P> <P> One of the cases involved Orange police officers who killed Jose de Jesus Ramon  Gonzalez, 27, in front of a Tustin convenience store. He was later found to be  unarmed.  </P> <P> District attorney investigators determined that police acted correctly because  in all three cases the victims appeared to be pulling a weapon.  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Air traffic control may be privatised - Aviation The government is considering privatising air traffic control services to help finance new civil aviation investment programmes. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday set up a working group of officials to report by early 1994 on the possibility of transferring the Civil Aviation Authority's National Air Traffic Service (NATS) operations to the private sector. An airline industry lobby has been campaigning for splitting air traffic control services from the CAA, arguing that privatisation would make NATS more cost-efficient and reduce airline charges. Opponents have said that privatising these services, which employ about 5500 people, would raise serious safety issues and that it was best for an independent government agency like the CAA to retain control of these operations.</p>

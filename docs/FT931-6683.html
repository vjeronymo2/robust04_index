			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Property: What chance a pink Belgravia? - How the look of London may change under new owners WILL THE Housing and Urban Development Bill, now in the House of Lords, change the look of London? This is an issue that will affect millions of people who live in, work in and visit central London. The reason the city (or at least most of it) looks so smart is not government intervention, but the high standards of maintenance shown over many years by some of the old, private property estates. If they lose ownership of their houses and flats to leaseholders who are empowered to enfranchise under the new Bill, will that mean that the end of the white (in fact, often magnolia) stucco of central London, repainted every three or four years? Is it the end of smart black railings, or lawns mown in stripes? Will Belgravia, Chelsea, South Kensington and Regent's Park sprout magenta doors, lime green stucco and adventure playgrounds in the gardens? The leasehold system has been a powerful force to make London a handsome capital city, with whole streets painted in harmony in the same colour. This has been achieved through positive covenants in the leases which are enforceable only because this is the context in which they appear. Through restrictive covenants the estates also ban chickens, displays of washing, satellite dishes and air conditioning boxes on the fronts of buildings. 'You know when you are on an estate, and when you are off it,' says Roland Culham of Cluttons, managing agents for Smith's Charity. The estates' standards have been tougher and have had more success than anything the local authorities could have done, even though they can use the powers of the laws for Conservation Areas (which generally apply to all the estates) and Listed Buildings. However, the way these rules are drafted, councils are commited more to stopping buildings from falling into ruin rather than keeping them in good repair. Under the present rules, a few houses have enfranchised on the estates. As part of the deal, the estate has often made management agreements with the owners. Houseowners in Ebury Street say that these have all the same clauses as the previous lease, except those concerning ownership. The Grosvenor Estate reminds them when it is time to re-paint, specifies which paint to use and inspects the job on completion. The fee for this scheme for one house in Ebury Street has risen from Pounds 16 to Pounds 57 in five years. These small schemes for a few houses are easy for the landlords to include in the general costs of running their estates. But what of the future, when there may have been piecemeal enfranchisement of well-managed estates? John Neale, casework secretary of the Georgian Group, the conservation society, is worried about how these properties might look. 'The effects will be particularly bad in streets of stuccoed houses.' And Colin Redman, London estate director for the Grosvenor Estate, foresees that 'the biggest problem will be the lack of positive covenants to enforce.' In an attempt to head this problem off, the new bill allows landlords to institute management schemes for areas which they are in danger of losing. The Leasehold Valuation Tribunal must approve these and will 'have regard to the past development and present character of the area and to architectural or historical considerations.' Such schemes will be fine in the early years of enfranchisement when the estate is largely still unified. But as the landowner loses more and more, he will be bound to question what he is doing administering schemes for properties which he does not own. Expect debate on this in the Lords, and the reappearance of an amendment, which was proposed and withdrawn in the Commons, to allow 'heritage areas' that the Secretary for National Heritage could exempt from enfranchisement on grounds of architectural and historical importance. To see why it matters, walk through Belgravia and look at the details that combine to make it a glorious showpiece of London. If it is all enfranchised, its freeholders will have to be unusually responsible, imaginative and co-operative. Or will a government of the future introduce a bill to direct local authorities to restore the standards the estates now enforce?</p>

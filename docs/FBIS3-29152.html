			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii on Tuesday [15 February] termed the yen's recent rapid  appreciation against the U.S. dollar undesirable for both the  Japanese and global economy.    Japan will take suitable steps at the appropriate time,  Fujii  told a press conference after the day's cabinet meeting. But he  denied that Tokyo has contacted other members of the Group of  Seven leading nations to discuss the matter.    Fujii said the yen's sharp upswing reflects "speculative  movements" by currency dealers. Any currency's exchange rate  should mirror the country's economic fundamentals, he added.    The yen began soaring against the U.S. currency after the  collapse of the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks last Friday  between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton. It surged by 2.56 yen against the  dollar in Tokyo on Monday and by a further 2.84 yen to finish  Tuesday morning in Tokyo at 102.85 yen to the dollar.    Fujii said the government's latest 15.25 trillion yen  stimulus package could not produce desired effects unless the  yen-dollar rate stayed at levels reflecting each country's  economic fundamentals.    The G-7 countries had agreed during their gathering last  September that rapid exchange rate fluctuations are not  desirable for the global economy, he said.    Fujii said he had heard nothing about possible U.S.  sanctions  against Japan in the field of autos and portable telephones.    Tokyo should do its utmost to dispel U.S. "misunderstanding"  about Japan's trade stance, he said.    The finance minister confirmed a newspaper report that he  received 10 million yen in political donations from a salt  industry group last August. But he said a receipt was made  following due accounting procedures.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Gatt chief keeps up pressure MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has called a meeting of top negotiators in the Uruguay Round of trade talks for next Thursday. The meeting of the 116-nation trade negotiations committee is intended to keep up the pressure on negotiators to come forward with better offers in bilateral talks, under way in Geneva, on improving market access for imported goods and services. With the Round due to end on December 15, these negotiations will have to be largely completed within the next four to six weeks. Negotiations on services are said to be proceeding well and are putting the finishing touches to the draft General Agreement on Trade in Services, which provides a framework of rules for the continued liberalisation of services trade. The revised draft is due to be presented to negotiators on Friday. But negotiations on goods remain stuck in areas such as agricultural products and textiles, where leading traders have allegedly failed to make adequate offers. Countries are also hoping to complete talks on revised codes of practice for government procurement and civil aircraft by mid-December, to coincide with the Uruguay Round deadline.</p>

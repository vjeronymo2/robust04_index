			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US in new open skies gambit The US transportation department plans to sidestep the larger European countries in its quest to open up the skies for US airlines by starting negotiations with nine smaller European nations. Mr Federico Pena, the transportation secretary, said the US plans to build on the open skies treaty already signed with the Netherlands, and hopes to conclude agreements in the next few months. US officials refused to say which countries would be involved in the negotiations, but they are all smaller nations in western Europe, including some members of the European Union. France, Germany, Italy and the UK are not involved. Aviation experts said the list was likely to include Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and probably Iceland, Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg. The US is deadlocked in aviation negotiations with the UK and France, and the new policy appears to abandon the attempt, urged by some big US airlines, to seek a global open skies agreement. In May, Mr Pena said that the current system of bilateral treaties which regulate international air transport was 'designed to limit, not to foster, competition, and inhibits or distorts globalisation'. But in a draft policy statement issued for comment this week, the department said it would concentrate on open skies agreements with 'a group of countries that share our liberalisation vision and offer important flow traffic potential for our carriers,' while renewing efforts to achieve more liberal agreements with larger partners such as Canada and the UK. Mr Jeffrey Shane, a lawyer with Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering in Washington and former head of aviation policy in the Bush administration, said the Clinton administration had found 'some way of advancing the ball', as there appeared to be no one ready to sit on the other side of the table for multilateral talks. 'Notwithstanding the fact that we are talking about smaller countries, which will not on the surface provide great access opportunities for US carriers, by talking about a cluster of nine of them it will certainly shake things up,' Mr Shane said. The Netherlands agreement has already brought dividends by paving the way for approval of a co-operation agreement between KLM, the Dutch airline, and Northwest Airlines. Government approval of a similar arrangement between British Airways and USAir was much more conditional.</p>

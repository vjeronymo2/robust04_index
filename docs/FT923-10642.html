			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / A lesson from the minister: The education white paper, released yesterday, marks a return to a managed system 'Parents know best the needs of their children - certainly better than educational theorists or administrators, better even than our mostly excellent teachers.' Education white paper If schools were supermarkets, life would be simple. The successful would thrive; the failures would go to the wall; and parents, knowing best the needs of their children, would shop around for the highest quality at the cheapest price. Many on the right of the Conservative party believe such notions can be applied to Britain's schools. In their book, vouchers, a minimal core curriculum and the abolition of local education authorities (LEAs) would do the trick, driving bureaucrats out of the classroom and freeing parents to pick and choose as they see fit. 'The free market, if all the rules and regulations can be swept away to make it truly free, will both raise standards and diversify provision,' says Mr Stuart Sexton, special adviser to Lord (then Sir Keith) Joseph when education secretary in the mid-1980s. Post-Thatcher Tories continue to use market language. Entitled 'Choice and Diversity', Mr John Patten's education white paper employs it page by page. 'Parents know best,' it says. 'Resources will follow pupils so that good schools will flourish.' Opting out of local authority control will, it argues, free the spirit of the nation's schools, allowing them to specialise to appeal to parents, and leaving parents free to 'choose the school they believe best suited to the particular interests and aptitude of their children'. In reality, however, yesterday's white paper marks the return to a managed education system. Schools will be subject to less interference, and market forces will play a greater role than before Mr Kenneth Baker's 1988 Education Reform Act encouraged schools to opt out of local authority control. But standards and management, not choice and diversity, are the guiding lights. The main difference with the pre-Baker schools regime lies in the definition of the standards and the identity of the managers. On the one hand, schools will be expected to meet more rigorous, nationally-imposed and monitored, standards. On the other, out go locally-appointed bureaucrats, in come centrally-appointed bureaucrats - quangos, inspectors, curriculum designers, task forces to rescue failing schools and, standing behind them all, Mr Patten, with powers greater than any previously wielded by an English education minister. Mr Patten's proposals for the transition from local to national management are workmanlike. An appointed Funding Agency for Schools (FAS) will take over the payment of funds to opted out, 'grant-maintained' (GM) schools which are funded directly by central government. It will also assume a range of powers to plan school provision, progressively taking over functions from local education authorities as the proportion of schools opting out of LEAs increases. It will establish regional offices 'as the number of GM schools grows'. The white paper insists that the powers of the agency will be 'closely prescribed'. But then so are those of existing local education authorities under present policy, which is devolving budgetary discretion to all schools. In effect, the government is proposing to replace elected local councils with appointed education quangos. Since all state schools are bound to follow the national curriculum, which occupies about 85 per cent of available teaching time, the opportunity for schools to specialise is limited - a point Mr Patten went out of his way to stress yesterday in response to concern about a widespread return of grammar and secondary-modern schools. Whatever the balance between grant-maintained and LEA schools, the community comprehensive looks set to remain the basic school model for the foreseeable future. The Tory right will be disappointed that Mr Patten failed to axe local authorities in one fell swoop. The government remains committed to parental ballots before schools can opt out. Mr Patten predicted yesterday that by April 1995 4,000 schools would be grant-maintained, including a majority of secondary schools and a 'substantial number' of primaries, attracted to opt out by new provisions allowing them to exit in clusters. That would still leave LEAs with 21,000 schools, including most primaries. Until 75 per cent of schools have opted out, LEAs will continue as now to be able to propose the establishment, closure and significant enlargement to schools, and will retain a veto over schools in their charge changing their characters. The government is clearly anxious to avoid instant upheaval in the local government system, still convalescing from the introduction of the unpopular poll tax. Indeed, ministers have been going out of their way to talk up the role of LEAs. Addressing the Council of Local Education Authorities last week, Baroness Blatch, the schools minister, referred to 'successful authorities of the future', noted 'clear evidence that at least some local authorities are recognising the imperatives of greater competition and are implementing changes to the way they deliver services', and highlighted the opportunities for them in the new inspection and monitoring arrangements. Earlier this week Mr Nigel Forman, the further and higher education minister, stressed the 'valuable role' LEAs could still play in post-16 education. For the next decade, therefore, partnership between local, national and appointed authorities appears to be the name of the game. To see the new system at work, consider three issues high on the government's education agenda: surplus places, failing schools and special educational needs. Schools in England and Wales currently contain about 1.5m surplus places, a huge drain on the education budget. If schools were purely voucher-financed, there would be no such thing as a surplus place: only 'real' places would attract funds and, says Mr Sexton, 'those schools which persist in failing to respond to parental demands for high standards would close'. The white paper has no such touching faith in market forces eliminating waste. Instead, local authorities and the funding agency are to have a duty to report annually on surplus places. If they fail to remove them, Mr Patten proposes to take new powers not only to direct them to produce plans for doing so, but to publish proposals himself. Since such proposals must inevitably include school closures, the implication is clear: the funding agency, with Mr Patten's consent, will be empowered to close grant-maintained schools, in defiance of their governors if need be. Since, to date, one of the principal motives behind schools opting out has been the desire to avoid closure or reorganisation, there is a grim irony in that. But as one county education director put it yesterday: 'At last they've stopped pretending the system doesn't need planning - now we can get on with the job again.' An equally firm grip is to be taken on failing schools. Few deny the necessity for it. Figures for last year show a third of 16-year-olds failing to gain a single GCSE pass at grades A-C, with one in 14 school-leavers failing to gain a single graded GCSE. The post-16 staying-on rate is improving, but last year only only one in five 18-year-olds gained so much as a single A-level pass. Here again, the market is given a marginal role. Mr Patten sees rigorous inspection and follow-up as the answer. Under this year's Education Act, the fruit of Mr Kenneth Clarke's brief stint at the education department, all schools will be subject to inspection once every four years. Inspectors will be asked to declare failing schools as 'at risk', and Mr Patten intends to ask the inspectorate to organise its first cycle of inspections, starting in September 1993, so as to maximise the early coverage of schools thought likely to be 'at risk'. When a school is declared 'at risk' the government will expect the LEA (in the case of a controlled school) or the governors (in a grant-maintained school) to take urgent remedial action. Additional powers will be given to LEAs for the purpose, including a power to appoint extra governors and to withdraw delegation of funding. It does not stop there. Where Mr Patten believes the LEA and/or governors have failed to turn the school around, he will have new powers to send in an education association to run the school. According to the white paper, the association will be a 'small and cohesive body' of some six members with a 'remit to improve each identified school within a defined period,' and with powers to 'require staffing changes at the senior management level and within the teaching force.' Mr Patten says education associations will be composed of retired teachers and people 'good at running things'. Education associations are the most novel feature of the white paper, a bold attempt by the government to get a hold on sink schools. Mr Patten envisages them working by administering short, sharp shocks, returning schools to grant-maintained status when done. Many commentators sympathetic to the association idea are sceptical that it can be done quite so easily. Says Mrs Alison Wolf of London University's Institute of Education: 'Running a school is not a bag of tricks. Everything we know about schools tells us that leadership and team building is key. It is crucial that when the associations withdraw an effective management structure is left in place.' The same emphasis on partnership and strong direction in defiance of the market is evident in the third area, special educational needs. A fifth of pupils are estimated to have special educational needs at some point in their school life, and according to the Audit Commission, even the best-performing local authorities are taking 50 per cent longer to assess special needs than the government's guideline of 15 months. Under the white paper, special schools will be able to opt out, but any maintained school named in an special educational needs report will be required to admit the child, whatever its head and governors think. Mr Patten also intends to take powers to require local authorities and the funding agency to rationalise special schools, and to permit himself to put forward his own proposals, subject to a special inquiry. Read between the lines, therefore, and what the white paper really says is: 'John Patten knows best the needs of children - certainly better than local authorities and often better than our mostly excellent parents.'</p>

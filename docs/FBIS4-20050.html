			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Barbara Gillmann: "East Europe's Interest in </F> Ifo-Technique for Management Polling Is Growing"]    [Text] Since the beginning of this week, the cream of  German economic researchers are meeting at Poschingerstrasse 5  in Munich's posh Bogenhausen section. During this and next week,  they will write the spring survey on Germany's overall economic  prospects, eagerly awaited by industry and politicians.    The six participating institutes, Ifo, IfW, HWWA, DIW, RWI  and IWH, host in turn the two decisive weeks of meetings. This  time, it is Ifo's turn.    The struggle for a common line often lasts until after  midnight; this is how Gernot Nerb, head of the overall economic  analysis department of Ifo, describes his experience of the past  years. But very often, it already becomes clear at half-time  whether they can agree, or whether an individual institute, such  as the DIW in spring, will cast a minority ballot.    In a week and a half, the institutes' presidents in Bonn  will  present the joint analysis to the public. Senior among the six  gentlemen is Professor Karl Heinrich Oppenlaender. The  62-year-old has been heading the Ifo Institute, whose name  stands for information and research, since 1976. After a  business apprenticeship, he studied in the Bavarian land capital  and joined Ifo in 1958. Since 1983, he has also been teaching at  the University of Munich. Oppenlaender challenges his colleagues  not only in scientific disputes, but also in regular table  tennis rounds.    Work on the joint survey is only a small part of the  institute's work. It has become famous, and even familiar to  some economic laymen, for its enterprise polls. Since 1950, the  Munich researchers have been polling up to 12,000 enterprises  each month on their assessment of the situation and prospects  for the coming six months. In January and February 1994, for  example, the enterprises predominantly considered the situation  still bad, while for the first time in many months their  majority assessed the prospects for the coming six months to be  positive.    With this reflection of the mood at the grass roots, Ifo  wants to advance economic theory. Oppenlaender emphasizes that  science still has no pertinent explanation for the ups and downs  of the business cycle, thus making it difficult to predict.    The Ifo procedure has found adherents worldwide. At present,  over 1,000 institutes in 43 countries poll enterprises using the  Munich method, reports Oppenlaender.  <H5>  Oppenlaender Is the Most Senior of the Institutes' Presidents </H5>   United in the Centre for International Research on Economic  Tendency Surveys (Ciret), the specialists for enterprise polls  meet every two years. In 1991, the exchange took place for the  first time in East Europe, in Budapest to be precise. For a very  good reason: At the time of planned economies, enterprise polls  were largely unknown in East Europe, but now interest is  growing. For instance, members of Yeltsin's staff have already  had the handbook for Ifo polls translated--but without first  asking for permission in Munich, notes Oppenlaender.    The Chinese also interviewed 2,000 enterprises using the Ifo  questionnaire. To evaluate the data, they turned to Munich for  help. According to Oppenlaender, the department for developing  countries rendered them this "service of friendship."    Not only researchers of the formerly communist world change  their thinking; Ifo also had to reorient itself. "Actually, you  don't quite know what is really going on here in eastern  Germany," Saxony's Finance Minister Milbradt rebuked the Ifo  president in 1992. Oppenlaender reacted promptly and talked the  Saxons into giving financial support for a branch office. So  since September 1993, there exists now a Dresden Ifo. Since  January 1994, the magazine IFO DRESDEN REPORTS provides  information on the new laender, based among other things on the  economic tests done in Saxony.    Also new, since the beginning of 1994, is the East Europe  department. Six researchers deal primarily with Hungary, Poland,  the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. A further focal point of  Eastern research centers on observation of Kazakhstan,  commissioned by the federal economics minister.  <H5>  The Dresden Branch Office Received Impetus From Saxony's </H5> Finance Minister    Also this year, Ifo will establish a department for the  labor  market and social policy which is to devote itself to overall  health research.    Two-thirds of Ifo researchers deal with microeconomic  issues;  most departments belong to the division "sectors, regions, and  enterprises." The remaining capacity deals with the foreign and  domestic economy.    In addition to the branch office in Dresden, the researchers  at the parent office will also continue to focus on the new  laender. For instance, they study construction activity  separately, for integrating the east in the "overall German  construction preestimate" of Ifo does not yet make sense "for  years to come." For the German railway they are supposed to find  out, for example, to what extent the eastern construction boom  will bring additional transport orders for building materials  and waste removal.    Ifo presents scientific results in numerous publications.  The  SCHNELLDIENST [express service] appears three times a month; the  WIRTSCHAFTSKONJUNKTUR [business cycle], KONJUNKTURINDIKATOREN  [economic indicators], and the BRANCHENSERVICE [branch service]  once a month; the Ifo DIGEST in English four times a year;  studies; and SPIEGEL DER WIRTSCHAFT [Economic Mirror] annually.    Oppenlaender appears content with the devlopment of Ifo  itself. In 1993, its budget rose by 6.5 percent to almost 28  million German marks [DM]. Of this amount, DM11.7 million were  earned by surveys. Thus the institute achieves an outside funds  ratio of 42 percent. Only the DIW can show a similarly good  result (43 percent); IfW, HWWA, RWI, and IWH lag far behind.  <H5>  Forty-two Percent of Revenues Earned by Surveys </H5>   The basic subsidy, shared by the Federal Government and  Bavaria, amounted to DM13 million in 1993. In absolute terms,  the institute received noticeably less than IfW, HWWA, and DIW,  and more than RWI and IWH. Per staff member (DM58,000), however,  Ifo costs the public authorities the least. Overall, 223 people  work in the institute; 105 of them are scientists.    The federal economics minister is the largest client of Ifo;  in 1993 he commissioned surveys for DM3.3 million. The EU  [European Union] Commission is becoming more and more important.  Yet the orders from Brussels are less lucrative than others,  since the Commission frequently finances only 50 percent of the  cost of surveys. If Oppenlaender cannot find a cofinancer, he  accepts only subjects of scientific interest.    In general, competitors from Great Britain and France have a  better "old boys' network" in Brussels, and furthermore, British  institutes are less expensive, complains the Ifo chief. In  addition, there is competition from business consultants such as  Price-Waterhouse or McKinsey. To improve the position in the  EU-wide competition, in 1990 Ifo merged with six European  economic research institutes in the Ereco consortium.    Not least of all because of the intensive work with  enterprises, Ifo is less exposed to economic policy disputes.  Between regulative and distribution politicians, supply and  demand orientation, "we hoe a middle line," says Oppenlaender.  The division of tasks is clear: "Our goal is also advising  policymakers, but they must set priorities--we only point up the  alternatives."</p>

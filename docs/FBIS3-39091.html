In a remarkably frank outburst last December, the French  Socialist MEP [Member of the European Parliament] Claude  Cheysson, a former foreign minister and European commissioner,  stated that it was inconceivable that a Briton could take on the  top Commission post after the country had shunned monetary union  and vast tracts of planned social legislation.    The attack demonstrated some of the unexpected obstacles  that  Sir Leon Brittan, the external economic affairs commissioner,  who had just emerged with plaudits from negotiating the GATT  Uruguay Round, faces in his campaign to succeed Delors.    This, and London's failure to win in the hosting of the  European central bank, may be political repercussions of  Britain's less-than-total commitment to Maastricht's goals. But  legal repercussions of the EMU [European Monetary Union] opt-out  are unlikely to be felt for several years.    Similarly, the clarifications on European citizenship,  defence, justice and home affairs which Denmark subsequently  negotiated to the treaty have caused the Union few legal  difficulties.    But it is in the area of social policy that the Union now  faces its greatest challenge -- a situation where legislation  might apply to 11 members but not to the United Kingdom. London  has been accused of trying to operate social dumping -- reducing  social cost to attract investment from its European competitors.  But it is the legal implications that are haunting  policy-makers.    The obstacles became apparent this week with the  Commission's  latest proposal to establish works councils, calling on  multinational firms in the Union with at least 1,000 employees  to inform and consult their staff. The proposal is directed at  employer groups and trade unions in the hope they can agree on a  consultation mechanism. But if this fails, there may be moves  to enforce the measures in the 11 countries that subscribe to  Maastricht's Social Chapter.    Under the scheme, a multinational with branches in Britain  could ask employers and unions to participate although the  management would be free to refuse. More controversially, the  Commission proposes that British-based staff of other EU  [European Union] companies be counted when calculating whether  the level of 1,000 employees, which activates the consultation  measures, has been reached. British multinationals with more  than 1,OOO staff in the Union would also have to implement the  system, even for British staff in other EU countries, because  the opt-out is based on territory, not nationality.    But governments are also unclear how such proposals should  be  processed. All commissioners will draft future legislation.  All MEP's will be allowed to debate and amend such proposals,  after a crude attempt to exclude British Conservative members  from the process failed last month. Similarly, all members of  the advisory economic and social committee will have their say.    The difficulty is in the Council of Ministers. No one  believes that Britain should be allowed to vote on such  legislation, but governments are divided over whether British  ministers and officials should be allowed to participate in  discussions influencing the eventual shape of the law, or be  told to sit and observe.    There is another insidious consequence of the derogations  governments have been prepared to grant EU countries. It makes  it harder for the Union to say categorically to applicant  countries that they must accept the full body of EU law and  responsibilities when exceptions are made for current members.  Several Austrians feel aggrieved that their efforts to control  the sale of second homes to other EU citizens is being so  fiercely contested when Denmark secured the very same opt-out in  1973.</p>

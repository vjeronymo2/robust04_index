			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Budget rumours boost the yen THE DOLLAR continued to weaken against the yen in both Asian and European trading on Thursday, reaching another historic low against the Japanese currency, writes James Blitz. Strong speculation about the Japanese government's fiscal package to boost the country's economy was the main factor driving the yen upwards. In Thursday's Asian trading, the dollar dipped to another record low of Y112.85. In Europe, the US currency later eased to a close of Y113.55. The yen also showed the same power against a generally softer D-Mark, reaching a four-year high in Asia at one stage. It weakened again to close on Thursday night at Y71.84 from a previous Y70.38. Boosting the Japanese currency was speculation that the government's new fiscal package, due to be revealed on Tuesday, would be larger than expected. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party has proposed a package of more than Y13,000bn to stimulate the economy. According to Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, this is the type of fiscal package that could underpin the next big move upwards in the yen/dollar rate. 'I see no reason why the yen should not test Y105 to the dollar in the weeks ahead,' he said. The dollar also traded weakly against the D-Mark in Europe on Thursday. A smaller than expected rise in US core inflation dashed speculation that the Federal Reserve might lean towards tightening monetary policy later in the year. US producer prices rose 0.4 per cent in March, but the core ex-food and energy measure rose just 0.1 per cent, against forecasts of a 0.3 per cent rise. The US currency finished at DM1.6070 from a previous DM1.6155. The D-Mark was generally weaker against most other European currencies. The French franc briefly pierced the FFr3.38 level against the German currency after the Bank of France surprised the market by deciding not to cut its official interest rates. But the franc weakened again to close at FFr3.385 from a previous FFr3.384. Thursday's keynote speech to the French parliament by Mr Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, also attracted some support for the franc - in particular his suggestion that the Bank of France could become fully independent within the next few months. Sterling enjoyed another strong performance against the D-Mark. The pound closed on Thursday night at DM2.4500 from a previous DM2.4475, and some dealers expect that strong economic data next week might help the UK currency up towards DM2.50.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The press agency of the Slovak Republic has  succeeded in obtaining a program statement by the signatories of  the Alternative of Political Realism within the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. The signatories gave a briefing on  their initiative to members and deputies of the ruling movement  at today's session of the HZDS deputies' club in Casta  Papiernicka. We quote:    Being aware of the fact that a confrontational policy does  not guarantee Slovakia's further positive development and that  it is necessary to concentrate the efforts and responsibilities  of political forces toward overcoming problems Slovakia has been  struggling against, taking into account the inevitability of a  political reconciliation in the period preceeding early  elections, we propose:    1. To form a government with the participation of the HZDS,  the Party of the Democratic Left, the Christian Democratic  Movement, the Slovak National Party, and the Alliance of  Democrats--without personal participation of the chairmen of  those parties and movements.    2. To invite experts without party affiliation to join the  government.    We consider it inevitable to return to the movement's  original democratic principles and to fulfill its liberal social  program.    With the aim of following these aims, we have created the  Alternative of Political Realism within the HZDS.</p>

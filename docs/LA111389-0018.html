			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DITKA IS EXCITED AFTER BEARS WIN ONE, 20-0  </P> <P> A few weeks ago, Coach Mike Ditka said he wasn't sure if his Chicago Bears  could win another game.  </P> <P> But the Bears' 20-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday was proof  Ditka's dire prediction was premature.  </P> <P> The Bears turned six Pittsburgh turnovers into 17 points and improved to 6-4,  one game behind the NFC Central-leading Minnesota Vikings.  </P> <P> "I'm excited," Ditka said. "I'm encouraged."  </P> <P> Left cornerback Lemuel Stinson, starting in place of Donnell Woolford, had two  of Chicago's three interceptions. Woolford missed the game because of an eye  infection.  </P> <P> Stinson covered Louis Lipps, who caught four passes for 112 yards, including a  60-yard reception. But Stinson also intercepted two passes intended for Lipps.  </P> <P> "Stinson got beat on some plays, but he came back and made some big plays,  too," Ditka said.  </P> <P> The first interception came on Bubby Brister's first pass of the game and the  other stopped a Steelers' drive at the Bears' five-yard line.  </P> <P> "Give credit where it's due because he made the plays," Brister said. "But I  threw the ball right to him."  </P> <P> The Bears' defensive line pressured Brister throughout the game, recording four  sacks for a loss of 35 yards. One on sack, tackle William Perry threw Brister  for a 17-yard loss.  </P> <P> Perry, whose season was described as "mediocre" by Ditka earlier in the week,  had four tackles, two sacks and a fumble recovery.  </P> <P> "William played well," said defensive end Richard Dent, who shares the right  side with Perry. "Nobody's been really running at us the last couple of weeks,  so we haven't had the opportunity to make the plays."  </P> <P> The shutout was the Bears' first this season.  </P> <P> Kevin Butler kicked field goals of 39 and 35 yards. That gave him 22  consecutive field goals, tying him for the NFL record with Mark Moseley, who  did it in 1981-82. Butler is 12 for 12 this season.  </P></p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Nigerians agree interim rule NIGERIA'S Social Democratic party has agreed in principle to form an interim national government to replace the military regime on August 27, provided it can choose key members of the government and that elected local, state and legislative institutions remain intact. The National Republican Convention, the SDP's rival party, is joining it in talks with President Ibrahim Babangida in an attempt to reach terms agreeable to both parties and the military government. The NRC would prefer new elections before August 27. Both parties were established by the government, the NRC representing the traditionally powerful north and the SDP the economically important south-west. The government on Tuesday issued an ultimatum to the parties to either join a national government and accept the dissolution of all democratic institutions or face fresh elections before August 27. Statements from both parties and the government leave the transition as uncertain as ever. The SDP has rejected the option of fresh elections before the military is meant to hand over because it insists its presidential candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola, was a fair winner in last month's elections. The government has annulled those polls and banned Mr Abiola from standing in fresh elections. SDP officials say that the inclusion of Mr Abiola as head of the interim government is a condition of their acceptance. Protests in Lagos lasting three days have demonstrated popular rejection in the south-west of Nigeria, the main base of Mr Abiola's support, of fresh elections before August. The two parties met in Abuja yesterday and agreed on the need to maintain elected civilian institutions and to end military rule in August, but the NRC accuses the SDP of intransigence in ruling out elections. Troops have restored order in Lagos as protesters in the commercial capital await details of the military government's plan for an interim national government. Mr Uche Chukwumerije, the information minister, denied reports that troops had shot protesters there. The main casualties on Tuesday were the result of a road accident in which a taxi driver ran over some youths blockading the road and was lynched.</p>

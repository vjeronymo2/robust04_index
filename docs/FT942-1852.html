			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / EU unable to provide ministers' voting record The Council of Ministers, the most powerful European Union institution where ministers of the 12 member states decide on hundreds of European laws that are later put on national statute books, is unable to provide records of how members have voted. In a letter to the Financial Times turning down a request for voting records, the general secretariat of the Council says it cannot provide such records because it does not compile them. However, the rejection of the request has been contested by the Netherlands and Denmark, and reservations about the decision have been expressed by the UK. Ministers' votes are recorded in the minutes of Council meetings. The Council has refused to release these. The EU system of qualified majority voting (QMV) brought the UK and Spain into dispute with their partners this spring in the worst row since the crisis over ratification of the Maastricht treaty. However, the often tendentious claims made during that dispute could not be tested against a public record of how majority voting worked in practice. Such a record would show that the EU culture of consensus means very few legislative proposals are put to a vote, in order to avoid isolating member states. When a vote is taken, Germany, the largest member state, is the country most often outvoted. After the spring row, and because the votes dispute will resurface before the 1996 constitutional review of Maastricht, the Financial Times sought information on the workings of QMV in decisions made by the Council of Ministers for foreign affairs, the internal market, social affairs, and agriculture, dating back to 1989. Under the single-market programme alone, ministers agreed over 200 Euro-laws during that period, most under the QMV system. The FT request was made under the code of conduct on public access to information, which was established after five successive summits of EU leaders called for more open government to 'bring Europe closer to the people'. Most votes taken since the code was passed last December are now made public. In reply, on May 31, the general secretariat of the Council said it did 'not compile voting records' and was unable to supply the information requested. On June 6, the FT exercised its right to have the rejected request pass from the Council secretariat to member states. The member states received the correspondence on June 17, when the low-level General Affairs Group of the Council tried to push through a second rejection. That was vetoed by the Dutch and Danes, while the UK sought more time to consider a change in the appeal procedure. The draft of the second rejection, obtained by the FT, restated that 'the general secretariat does not compile lists of voting records and the Council is not in possession of any such statistics'.

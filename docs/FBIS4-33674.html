			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem do Para, 9 Jun (EFE) -- Brazilian Foreign  Minister Celso Amorim today revealed that one of the proposals  Brazil has made for the so-called Summit of the Americas is the  creation of a special fund to finance integration processes in  the continent.    Brazil believes that one way to prevent the presidential  summit organized by U.S. President Bill Clinton from ending in  another declaration of principles would be to propose concrete  projects for action and promotion of hemispheric integration,  Amorim said.    One of the projects, Amorim said, could be the creation of a  specific fund within the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)  to help finance economic integration processes in the continent.    "Integration processes are essential for our country, and it  is important to have the resources with which to carry them  out," Amorim said during a news conference he gave on the  occasion of the 24th OAS General Assembly, which has been taking  place since 6 June in Belem do Para, northern Brazil.    According to Amorim, who mentioned this proposal to Strobe  Talbott, U.S. under secretary of state, during a meeting they  held on 6 June, the IDB was created precisely as an instrument  of support for Latin American integration.    The resources from this fund could help the integration  processes that have been developing in the past few years, such  as the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), the Andean Pact,  the Group of Three, and the Amazon Integration Treaty, among  others.    Another proposal that will be made by Brazil for the Summit  of the Americas, which will be held from 9 to 10 December in  Miami, Florida, is to create mechanisms for financial and  technical cooperation in the field of human rights defense.    Human rights conditions could improve with financial and  technical cooperation agreements to improve the living  conditions of prison inmates and strengthen the judicial system,  Celso Amorim said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Renata Verissimo from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] Future Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero will be  sworn in on 5 April. He said today he will not touch the  government economic plan.    Ricupero will spend the next four days in Brasilia, talking  with the economic team to learn about issues at his new  ministry. He admitted he is not well acquainted with all issues  and that it would be premature to comment on any decision he  might make. Ricupero confirmed that he intends to maintain the  entire current economic team but he also is bringing along five  advisers to help him in his new post. He also promised he will  not modify the government economic plan. He said he totally  favors the economic plan, and that he believes in the FHC  [Fernando Henrique Cardoso] plan's success. Ricupero also chose  the fight against inflation as his No. 1 goal:    [Begin Ricupero recording] I consider inflation the first  problem that must be solved because without stability, there is  no solution. Without stability, no commerce, or regional system,  or industrial policy, or anything else will work. Therefore,  that is the main subject of my convictions. As for the details  and how inflation will be curbed, evidently it depends on the  daily analysis of the economy's performance. [end recording]    Minister Ricupero added that President Itamar Franco is  analyzing some names to replace him in the Environment Ministry.  According to Ricupero, some of the possible candidates are  former Ibama [Brazilian Institute for the Environment and  Renewable Natural Resources] President Fernando Cesar Mesquita  and Amazon Secretary Henrique Brandao Cavalcanti.</p>

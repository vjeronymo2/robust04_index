			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Small companies may lose in EC public deals race SMALL AND medium-sized British companies are in danger of losing out to Continental competitors as the market for public procurement opens up in the next few years. This was the warning yesterday from Sir John Cuckney, chairman of a National Economic Development Council working party on open public procurement in the European Community. Sir John, chairman of 3i, the venture-capital investment group owned by the Bank of England and the clearing banks, said small and medium-sized companies were in danger of sticking their heads in the sand just as their public-sector markets were about to undergo a huge transition. He was speaking at the launch of a working party to examine the likely impact of open public procurement on British companies over the next 18 months. Under the single-market programme the EC is issuing a series of directives designed to eliminate barriers to cross-border trade in public services. Public procurement in the EC is worth about Pounds 430bn a year. The working party is the first NEDC body to include representatives from the Continent: Mr Bernado Cremades, a leading Spanish lawyer; Mr Bernard Gosselin, the secretary-general responsible for public purchasing at the French ministry of economy and finance; Mr Preben Jackobsen, director of the Danish directorate for state purchasing; and Peter Prince Wittgenstein a member of the executive board of German engineering group Mannesmann. The working group plans to examine the market for public-sector building and infrastructure projects including their design, local authority public purchasing, markets to supply health authorities in the EC, and the supply of services in general. Among other things, the working party will study whether there are unfair barriers to British companies bidding for contracts on the Continent. Sir John said the working party would be just as concerned with the outlook for large companies as for small ones, and added: 'It will take some time before groups either gain the economies of scale or the specialisation to move into exports outside the EC.' The working party plans to issue British companies with practical guidance on how to bid for public-sector contracts on the continent.</p>

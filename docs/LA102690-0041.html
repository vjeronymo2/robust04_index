			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES: A TALE OF 2 STUDENTS AT PALOMAR COLLEGE GALLERY  </P> <P> Louise Kirtland-Boehm, director of Palomar College's Boehm Gallery (no  relation) is what all good curators should be: a talent scout. In addition to  mounting shows of such established local artists as Ernest Silva, Faiya Fredman  and Raul Guerrero, she has made a habit of canvassing schools for emerging  talent.  </P> <P> In 1987, she organized a group show of students working toward their master of  fine arts degrees at San Diego State University and UC San Diego. The show  helped introduce new work to the community while testing the integrity of the  work outside its own native academic environment. By presenting a variety of  work reflecting a breadth of approaches, the 1988 "MFA/SDSU/UCSD" show also  helped dispel stereotypes associated with the two universities' art  departments.  </P> <P> This year, Kirtland-Boehm has selected just one student each from the two  schools for a show (through Nov. 21) with the same title as its precedent. Both  M. Luera of SDSU and UCSD's Gary Boswell show promise, a consideration of  primary importance in this type of show. Both have achieved a respectable  technical maturity and an interest in evocative themes, but neither manages yet  to present a rich, enduring and fully evolved body of work.  </P> <P> The figures in Luera's series of paintings, collectively titled "Invented  Lives," loom larger than life in scale and in their glowing, cinematic  vibrancy. They press against the edges of each canvas, creating a visual  tension that Luera matches with ambiguous and often unsettling visions of men  in conversation, in communion and in conflict.  </P> <P> In "Men in Boat," two shirtless men flank a central, fully dressed passenger.  The man in the immediate foreground seems to be whispering affectionately into  the ear of the man in the middle, while the figure in the rear shifts his gaze  to the side and continues to row.  </P> <P> "Men in Suits with Youth" also shows a man sandwiched between two others, but  this time the younger man in the center wears no shirt, and those in front and  back wear matching suits. Here also, it is the man in the foreground who makes  contact with the central figure, but his gesture is less gentle than that of  the man in the boat. He presses his hand against the youth's jaw, and though  the young man smiles, his expression seems forced and uneasy.  </P> <P> A similar confrontation takes place in "Men with Fish," where two men,  waist-deep in water, share an ambiguous, awkward moment. One of the figures  wears an expression midway between a scowl and a laugh as he pulls back a  younger man's head by his hair. By painting the younger man's eyes closed,  Luera denies his face an easy read and instead gives it the simultaneous  expression of passion and pain.  </P> <P> Luera borrows much of her strategy of subverting familiar images and ordinary  relationships from the New York painter Eric Fischl. Like Fischl, she paints  large, lifelike figures in casual but ambiguous situations, mixing the clothed  and the semi-nude, the young and the older for suggestive effect. Her men have  tremendous physical presence, but she doesn't consistently endow them with  enough psychological depth to sustain that presence. As a result, the paintings  verge on the superficial and sensational.  </P> <P> Boswell's neighboring installation, "Semaphore Horizon," deals more with the  cerebral than the sensual, perhaps to a fault, but the work does induce a  physical self-consciousness that slows the pace and prompts new perceptions. A  semaphore, the signaling device commonly used on railways, never appears in a  literal form, but other modes of marking location and direction fill the  gallery's walls and floor.  </P> <P> A compass is mounted on one wall, an arch of cutout, painted arrows hovers high  on another, near a formation of drawings of eyes, in the shape of the big  dipper constellation. A painting of blue, hazy sky with a single feather  attached to the surface alludes to determinations of wind direction and force.  Newspaper pages, strewn across one long wall, are covered with stenciled text  repeating a phrase about the various positions of the body during sleep. On a  tree branch, covered in gold leaf, hangs a piece of cloth, as if a marking of  one's path in the woods.  </P> <P> None of these navigational systems is functional here -- the compass is fixed  to the wall, and the feather to the painting -- but all of them do evoke an  acute awareness of one's position in space, one's movement and direction. By  presenting these systems outside of their normal, useful context, Boswell draws  attention to them as abstract notations, symbolic languages in themselves. They  become abstract, poetic phrases punctuating the austere gallery walls,  important clues with no real meaning of their own.  </P> <P> ARTISTS' OPPORTUNITIES:  </P> <P> Sushi Gallery is issuing an open call for proposals for its sixth annual public  art program. For "StreetSites '91," Sushi will commission several temporary,  site-specific projects at public locations within the city. The program is open  to all artists living in San Diego County. Selected artists will receive $2,000  to create their work. For more information, call Sushi (235-8466) or attend a  "technical assistance" meeting at the gallery (852 8th Ave., downtown) on  Monday, Nov. 5, at 7 p.m. The deadline for proposals is Monday, Nov. 26 at 5  p.m.  </P> <P> The Carlsbad Arts Office is seeking proposals from local artists interested in  participating in two of its annual programs. The Grants program will award  $20,000 this year to fund cultural and artistic projects in Carlsbad. Artists  in all media and not-for-profit institutions are eligible, but individual  artists must be sponsored by a not-for-profit organization. Grant applications  must be received by Dec. 3.  </P> <P> Proposals are also sought for Carlsbad's Artist-in-Residence program, which  aims to involve Carlsbad citizens in creative experiences. Projects will be  conducted in schools or community organizations. Last year, residency grants  were awarded for a dancer and a storyteller, who conducted three-month-long  projects in Carlsbad schools. Proposals must be received by Nov. 16.  </P> <P> For more information about applications and eligibility for both programs, call  the Carlsbad Arts Office at 434-2920.  </P></p>

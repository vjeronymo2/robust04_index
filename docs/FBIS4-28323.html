			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 9 (YONHAP) -- The Board of Governors  [BOG] of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has  decided to discuss the nuclear row with North Korea on Friday  [10 June] and major board members will reportedly submit a draft  resolution demanding Pyongyang's nuclear transparency to the  secretariat on Thursday, sources said.    Board Chairman Ronald Walker announced that the nuclear  issue  would be discussed at a board meeting on Friday morning as the  last item on its agenda.    Representatives of the United States, Japan, France and  other  major board members met informally Thursday to discuss drafting  an IAEA resolution on the North Korean nuclear issue, with an  eye to submitting a draft to the secretariat Thursday.    These nations are reviewing the draft resolution's wording  in  a bid to get more than 20 board members to endorse it, a source  said.    In the resolution, the IAEA will express concern about the  destruction of historical records on North Korea's nuclear  development program as a result of the stalinist state's  unsupervised refueling of its 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon,  while demanding that Pyongyang permit special IAEA inspections  to ensure its nuclear transparency.</p>

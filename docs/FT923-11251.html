			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Drink: Through an aperitif glass, darkly - A few pre-prandial stimulants BRITONS do not have much truck with aperitifs; they offer their guests 'a drink' but this rarely has any relevance to the fact that everyone is about to eat. White wine probably is the most popular; if you are lucky, you get champagne. In old-fashioned houses, it is sherry, whisky or gin. Aperitifs, however, are not to be despised. They serve a real purpose: setting the gastric juices in motion and literally 'opening up' appetites for dinner. As such, they deserve a deal more thought. As I learn from Andre Domine's useful book Die Kunst des Aperitif (Weingarten 1989) - which, being written in German, is unlikely to reach the wide audience it deserves - aperitifs came into being at the close of the 18th century when, because of the upheaval caused by the French revolution, restaurants were beginning to achieve importance. Significantly enough it was the 'Father of the Table' Grimod de La Reyniere who was the first to advocate le coup d'avant to excite the appetite before a meal. Grimod also called for a coup du milieu: a glass of spirits used to reactivate the appetite in the middle of a lengthy dinner or banquet. This idea survives as the trou normand - a glass of calvados being brought to you before the main course. The first aperitifs were absinthe and vermouth of various sorts. Absinthe was finally banned on health grounds in 1915. In the next two decades the market was flooded with less lethal imitations such as Pernod and Ricard. It was Ricard which created the Provencal myth around pastis by its advertising which focussed on blue seas and southern landscapes. Ricard drinking in Marseille - or anywhere else - is no older than the creation of the company: 1932. Most of the flavoured wines we call vermouth were created in the second half of the 19th century. Campari was founded in 1867, but opened its first factory only in 1892. Lillet, the aperitif wine known to all who visit Bordeaux, was created in 1887; Byrrh in 1890. Some like Picon were flavoured with chinchona bark or quinine and were thought to be useful in combatting malaria in the French African colonies. Picon was the French colonial version of the British g and t. A glass of pastis with water and ice still seems to me to be a perfect summer aperitif; preferably accompanied by a bowl of green olives. Pastis is particularly kind to the stomach, and, unlike a more alcoholic aperitif, negronis spring to mind, it does not have that heaviness which ends up by killing your appetite. Younger people in France do quite disgusting things to pastis mixing it with Grenadine or peppermint cordial. This is not to be recommended if you are about to sit down to lunch. Once in a blue moon I quite enjoy a gin. Both Gordon's and Tanqueray I find too overtly flavoured with juniper, which gives them an almost sickly smell. Better are Beefeater or Bombay which have more complexity of aroma. The best gin and tonics I ever drank were made by a veteran of the Sudan Political Service who kept everything (even the glass) in the fridge. He insisted on using oranges rather than lemons because they went better with the tonic water. An American-style dry martini would kill your appetite in the majority of cases, but gin can be combined with vermouth in less powerful doses. I recall an old headmaster offering me a vermouth in his holiday home in Provence. He filled a tumbler three quarters full then from under the table brought out a gin bottle and topped it up. 'I thought you were offering me vermouth,' I quibbled. 'Without the gin it is undrinkable,' he replied. In certain senior common rooms gin and French is still the favoured drink prior to High Table. People used to drink 'gin and It' - gin with red, or Italian, vermouth; or even gin and mixed - a combination of red and white. It has been a long time since I have seen one of these. Bitter drinks such as Campari tend to be effective when it comes to stimulating appetite. In France the equivalent of the 'Camp sod' (as a friend used to call his Campari and soda) is often a gentian-based aperitif such as Suze. This is not for the faint-hearted: for many it is like taking a swig from a scent-bottle. One aperitif I rediscovered only the other day was a mint julep, made by steeping Bourbon whiskey (sic) mint and sugar for ten minutes; adding more whiskey and crushed ice, then stirring. Best Bourbons are Maker's Mark, Wild Turkey and George Dickel.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Portillo set to challenge EU work directives Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, plans to strongly oppose draft European Union directives which he believes would add to employer costs and create more unemployment. The proposed directives, to be discussed at next Tuesday's EU social affairs council meeting in Brussels, concern part-time and fixed-contract work and the terms of employment for workers who are sent by companies to posts outside their own country. Last night it emerged that the German government, which holds the EU presidency until the end of the year, has split the part-time and fixed-contract directive into two separate measures. But this will be opposed by France and the UK is unlikely to support the move either. Mr Portillo believes equalising part-time employment rights with those of full-time workers as the directives require would restrict job opportunities and add to the burdens on employers. He is convinced the proposed directive would lead to companies firing part-time employees, who are often women, and replacing them with a smaller number of full-time workers who are usually men. Britain's employment secretary also intends to argue that the so called 'posted workers directive' would reduce the free movement of services and workers within the EU. This directive would require companies carrying out contracts in member states other than their own to pay employees at the same rates as the host country. The government believes this measure could stop companies with low costs from competing in high-cost countries. Mr Portillo is convinced it is anti-competitive and would make it harder for the unemployed to find work. The employment secretary is also expected to make a legal challenge against the posted workers directive if his colleagues try and push the measure through Tuesday's meeting by a qualified majority of votes and not by unanimity. Mr Portillo intends to tell his EU ministerial colleagues that they should concentrate not on social regulations but on tackling European structural unemployment in line with EU social affairs commissioner Padraig Flynn's white paper on the future of European social policy, also to be discussed on Tuesday. Strong support for the employment secretary came yesterday from Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry who told a conference of Unice - the European employers organisation - in Berlin that next Tuesday's meeting would provide 'an important test of the EU's willingness to grasp the implications of its social policies on Europe's competitiveness problem'. Mr Davies said that while 'some basic rights' such as health and safety and equal opportunities should apply to posted workers, a directive that covered terms and conditions of employment was 'anti-competitive and inconsistent with the principles of a single market'. He added that the latest draft part-time and fixed contract work directives were 'unacceptable' as they stood.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELAY IN RESTARTING OF A-PLANT ORDERED  </P> <P> The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday ordered the operators of  the troubled Rancho Seco nuclear power plant to delay restarting the nuclear  reactor pending a federal investigation into concerns that the plant could be  unsafe.  </P> <P> New questions about the plant's safety are raised in a letter from the  Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, an Atlanta-based group made up of  nuclear plant owners, NRC spokesman Greg Cook said.  </P> <P> The letter was scheduled to be delivered Wednesday to the Sacramento Municipal  Utility District, which operates the 913-megawatt plant. Although senior NRC  officials were aware of the letter, Cook said, he had not been briefed on its  contents and the nature of the institute's concerns.  </P> <P> "(The institute) has raised an issue with us about Rancho Seco. Our people felt  that the issue was potentially safety significant and should be evaluated  before Rancho was restarted," Cook said.  </P> <P> The plant automatically shut down last Tuesday -- the third closure since  December -- because of a malfunctioning water pump. Sacramento district  officials have not determined what caused the mishap and have not set a date to  restart the plant's nuclear generator.  </P> <P> When notified by the NRC of new questions about the plant's safety, utility  district officials immediately agreed to delay restarting the plant until  federal regulators and company officials could investigate the concerns stated  in the institute's letter, Cook said.  </P> <P> Kerry Shearer, a spokesman for Rancho Seco, characterized the NRC request as  "informal." He said the Sacramento utility district would comply with NRC  wishes and keep the plant closed "until issues raised in a forthcoming letter"  from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations can be resolved by the utility  district.  </P> <P> Shearer said an institute team last visited the plant in February, but did not  notify utility district officials about any safety concerns.  </P> <P> "We are certainly more anxious than anyone to see what the letter says,"  Shearer said.  </P> <P> Sacramento area voters gave the 15-year-old plant a reprieve last year,  allowing it to continue operating on a trial basis, but are scheduled to vote  June 6 on closing it permanently.  </P> <P> The controversial plant, located 25 miles southeast of Sacramento, reopened a  year ago after a 27-month shutdown prompted by an overcooling accident. It has  been closed more frequently than it has operated during its troubled history.  </P> <P> The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations conducts inspections of nuclear power  plants and presents reports to owners of the utilities. These reports are  normally not made public, but are considered proprietary information. However,  the institute is required to notify the NRC about safety concerns.  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Independent on Sunday staff voice fears JOURNALISTS on The Independent newspaper met yesterday amid growing uncertainty over the future of the loss-making Independent on Sunday. They called on the management of Newspaper Publishing, the company that publishes both newspapers, to consult fully with journalists over any change of plan that might affect working practices. Yesterday's union meeting was in response to a management meeting to consider options for cutting costs. It is believed that one option raised was closer integration of the daily and Sunday titles - in effect creating a seven-days-a-week operation similar to the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs. The Independent on Sunday, launched in January 1990, is understood to be selling about 370,000 copies a week but is losing heavily because of the advertising recession. The Independent itself is believed to be modestly profitable. There have even been unconfirmed rumours that the Independent on Sunday might be up for sale.</p>

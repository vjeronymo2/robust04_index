			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ACTRESS EVE ARDEN DIES AT 82  </P> <P> Actress Eve Arden, the wisecracking and thoroughly delightful English teacher  of television's "Our Miss Brooks," died of heart failure today. She was 82.  </P> <P> Arden, famous for her quick ripostes, died in Los Angeles at her Doheny Estates  home at 2:30 a.m. with one of her daughters, Liza West, at her bedside, said  her personal manager, Glenn Rose.  </P> <P> The tall, blonde comedienne had a distinguished career in movies and on the  stage, but she was best known for her years as Miss Brooks, including four on  radio and four in television's early years.  </P> <P> Arden began the series in 1947 and made the switch to television in 1952. She  won an Emmy in 1953 for best female personality.  </P> <P> Arden's character earned her a lifelong image as a schoolmarm and wisecrack  artist, with her put-downs delivered in an expressionless twang. Countless  motion pictures and stage appearances and two other television series failed to  rid her of the Connie Brooks image.  </P></p>

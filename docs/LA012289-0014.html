			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CHIP ON HER SHOULDER  </P> <P> Why bother having Cynthia Parsons review former Secretary of Education William  Bennett's "Back to Moral Basics" (Book Review, Dec. 25)? From the first to the  last, her grousing reveals a consuming chip on her shoulder. Her readers  receive hardly a glimpse of what the book is about, just how greatly Parsons  disdains it and how quickly she dismisses it as so much conservative palavra.  </P> <P>  Parsons derides Bennett for using the first person often in these speeches  delivered when he was the head of the Department of Education (how dare he!) --  all while she interjects a personal anecdote and her own clairvoyant  assessments of Bennett's motives for writing the book in the first place.  That's consistent.  </P> <P> Parsons states, "If . . . this is some 'last hurrah,' then only friends and  fellow-believers need spend the time to read this volume." In other words, if  you like Bennett, you'll like this book; if not, not. What does this review  tell us except that Parsons belonged to the latter group -- before and after  she read the book.  </P> <P> JOHN PAUL ARNERICH  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

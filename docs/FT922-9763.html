			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Pioneer Group to launch mutual fund in Poland PIONEER GROUP, the US based investment fund, is to launch Poland's first foreign run mutual fund next month. Mr John Cogan, Pioneer's president, said the venture will be investing Poles' savings in local equities on the country's fledgling stock exchange as well as in government bonds. Pioneer has also applied for permission from the NBP, the central bank, to invest 10 per cent of the fund's assets abroad. Poland's state owned PKO bank will be responsible for the distribution of the units for the fund which is called the Pioneer 1st Polish Trust Fund. Mr Cogan is looking for Poles to deposit some Dollars 50m in the fund within the first 12 months but he admits that demand at the moment is 'absolutely unknown'. Pioneer will limit its investments in any one company on the stock exchange to 10 per cent. At present the Warsaw bourse trades in stocks of 13 companies with a capital value of some Dollars 150m. The number is expected to rise to more than 20 companies by the end of the year.</p>

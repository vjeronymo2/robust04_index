			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Australian rate cut likely as quarterly inflation falls to zero MR JOHN DAWKINS, the Australian federal treasurer, yesterday forecast a cut in official interest rates in the wake of zero inflation in the three months to March. Government figures showed that the consumer price index (CPI) was unchanged over the quarter. The annual rate rose, however, from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent, the second lowest figure recorded since March 1964. The CPI figures also showed that the underlying rate of inflation fell to 0.4 per cent from 3 per cent a year ago. This is the lowest rate of increase since publication of figures for underlying inflation began in 1971. The unexpectedly low figures prompted the government to revise its inflation forecast for the year to the end of June from 2.25 per cent to 2 per cent. The 1992-93 forecast was also revised downwards by one percentage point to 2.5 per cent. Mr Dawkins said the figures removed any doubts about the possibility of cuts in official interest rates. However, he said the size of the forthcoming reduction would not be determined until the next meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia board due on May 5. 'This figure certainly means that there is now room to have some relaxation of monetary policy, which will return a dividend to the community as a result of this substantial improvement on the inflation front,' Mr Dawkins said. Economists said the March quarter CPI outcome indicated that interest rates were likely to fall by one percentage point, rather than the 0.5 percentage point reduction the financial markets had been expecting. The official cash rate was last cut by one point to 7.5 per cent in January. Official rates peaked at 18 per cent in January 1990 as the government tried to cool the overheated economy. Mr Dawkins said there were 'convincing signs' that Australia was recovering from a recession which led to six consecutive quarters of flat or negative growth in GDP.</p>

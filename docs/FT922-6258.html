			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Council Services: Setting up shop in the council marketplace COMPULSORY competitive tendering is still in its infancy. Although a few adventurous Tory councils contracted out services in the mid 1980s, compulsory tendering officially began less than four years ago. Before then, most councillors of all parties - not just Labour - resisted the idea, and addressed it seriously only after the 1988 Local Government Act forced them to. The learning curve has been steeper still for companies, faced not only by the formidable legal complexities of bidding, but by the variety of type of work and size of contracts. Councils range from tiny rural districts to large metropolitan authorities. The act specifies services to be put out to tender and the authorities obliged to tender them - all district and county councils, as well as police, fire and waste authorities and urban development corporations. It also sets out a framework, the most notable features of which are the length of contracts - mostly between five and seven years; a detailed procedure for inviting tenders - at least three companies expressing an interest must be invited to tender; an exemption from tendering for services with an annual contract value of less than Pounds 100,000; a requirement on local-authority in-house teams to make a 5 per cent annual rate of return on capital employed, and provisions to prevent anti-competitive behaviour. Such behaviour has been exceptional, even among Labour authorities. In most councils the tendering process is in the hands of officers, with members involved only in setting specifications and formally allocating contracts. The Department of the Environment has issued only 44 orders requiring authorities to explain their action over a contract. More frequent are complaints from companies about the packaging of contracts in a way to suit the in-house team. As the first round of tendering draws to a close, the study highlights significant trends: Refuse collection and street cleaning: with more than a quarter of contracts now held by the private sector, this has proved the most fruitful area. Councils traditionally used a single department to run both services, and a large proportion of contracts are for both services. The average value of contracts is accordingly high, at around Pounds 1.2m. The early stages of tendering saw a number of management buy-outs, notably at Westminster City Council where MRS Environmental Services won a Pounds 12m contract and has gone on to secure three others totalling Pounds 4m. Since then subsidiaries of French and Spanish multinationals have moved to the fore. Onyx UK, the largest player with 20 contracts worth Pounds 25m a year, was formed by two French water companies in 1990 and its subsequent growth has largely been through acquisitions of British concerns - notably UK Waste - which specialise in local-authority work. The private sector has fared increasingly well in the past two years. Its share of contracts has risen from 14 per cent of the August 1990 tranche to half of those awarded this January. Its success has not been limited to smaller packages: private contractors have done better in London than any other region, taking 43 per cent of the capital's market. Building cleaning: by proportion of contracts, this is the most successful field for the private sector, which won a majority of contracts awarded at the start of this year. Since the work is labour-intensive, with low start-up costs, its success is perhaps unsurprising. Local authorities have tended to split the work in two, contracting school cleaning separately. Civic cleaning, the smaller of the two operations, has proved most attractive to private operators. Initial Contract Services, owned by BET, the UK's largest contract services company, is the lead player, with 47 contracts worth Pounds 17m a year. Catering: in spite of the private sector's experience in catering, it has made little impact, winning fewer than a tenth of contracts. School and welfare catering has proved particularly unattractive to private operators, given the number of outlets, and term and pricing constraints. Smaller contracts in other areas have proved more enticing, but catering remains the untrodden field of tendering. Grounds maintenance: councils were obliged to tender for this sector over a five-year period, and a large tranche of first-round contracts has still to be awarded this year and next. Contract specifications have proved difficult. The main private player - Brophy, with 53 contracts worth Pounds 14m a year - was tiny prior to tendering. Grounds maintenance has attracted a large number of successful cross-border bids by council teams, with one in 10 contracts awarded to another council's direct-labour service. The legality of the practice is hotly disputed but has yet to be tested directly in the courts. Leisure services: everything from swimming pools to golf courses, with facilities and practices varying enormously between authorities. The sector is proving susceptible to management buy-outs. But councils retain control over admissions prices and opening hours. There are two useful tips for potential bidders say those in the know. Meet council officers at an early stage - particularly to ascertain the quality of service expected, which is often ill-defined in the specification. And do not underestimate the cost of bidding - most of all the first time round. Vehicle maintenance: private companies have taken almost a fifth of the market. Local-authority practice in transferring vehicle stock with responsibility for maintenance varies widely, as do arrangements for depot facilities. Half of all contracts fall between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 500,000, and more authorities have declared their contracts de minimis in this sector than in any other. More than half of all tendered contracts have gone to four leading companies. Transfleet Services, a joint venture between Lex Services and Lombard North Central, which merged with Chart Services UK in 1989, has been most successful, holding nine contracts worth Pounds 4.7m a year.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / A firm voice in Threadneedle St: Profile of a man likely to take a tough line in dealings with the Treasury IF YOU sneak into the Bank of England tomorrow afternoon you will catch in full flight the man whose views are one of the firmest elements in a distinctly wobbly UK economic policy. Professor Mervyn King, the Bank's economics director, will be launching its quarterly report on inflation, a document written largely by him. It is seen as a vital check on government ministers over possible price pressures now Britain is outside the European exchange rate mechanism. The 45-year-old professor is a principal lieutenant to Mr Eddie George, who moves from Bank deputy governor to governor in July. Both men are determined that Threadneedle Street shall play a bigger role in advising the Treasury on monetary policy, a goal that may be helped by the Treasury's weakened state in the aftermath of the ERM fiasco and a run of policy errors. Prof King, who went to the Bank only two years ago, does not lack ambition. One theory is that if the new and untried deputy governor - Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, former editor of the Economist - fails to make a mark then Prof King would be his natural replacement. The affable but publicity-shy Prof King enjoys a high reputation among academics. Professor James Meade, the Nobel prize-winning economist, calls him 'first-rate'; Mr Lawrence Summers, an ex-Harvard economist who is under-secretary for international affairs at the US Treasury, says he is one of the 'top few European economists' of his generation. Prof King joined the Bank from the London School of Economics. A specialist in taxation and corporate behaviour, he made a particular impression in the US, where he has had several spells at Harvard and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prof King - educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School and King's College, Cambridge - can be very eloquent. Professor Charles Goodhart of the LSE, a former Bank economist, says: 'A big strength is that he can argue his case at almost any level of academic complexity.' But in the City he is viewed as an enigma. One City economist says: 'Meetings with Bank people are rarely a bundle of laughs but even so Mervyn can be especially daunting; he is seen as unapproachable.' Prof King can also be difficult to work for and, according to one Bank economist, is 'a stickler for detail'. He once told his Bank staff to tear up a speech the day before he was due to deliver it because he disagreed with the fine print. Another associate says: 'He's not the world's best diplomat; he's a bright lad who makes it clear if he thinks people are not on his intellectual plane.' A few weeks ago MPs on a Commons committee visibly bristled when he suggested they might have trouble following his argument. A certain robustness has also been evident in his dealings with the Treasury, traditionally the senior partner in the monetary relationship. Prof King is determined that the Bank's inflation report - the first of which came out only in February - should be seen as the Bank's work, untainted by Treasury influence. According to one account he told Treasury officials to 'get stuffed' earlier this year when they tried to engineer amendments to the first report. Had he accepted the blandishments five years ago of former chancellor Lord Lawson, Prof King might now be at the Treasury himself. He was offered the job of deputy chief economic adviser - it would almost certainly have led to being chief economist - but opted to stay in academic life. Several people close to the professor believe academia may still reclaim him. Harvard professor of economics John Kain says: 'Prof King did a great job when he was here. Just about every leading US institute would bid should he want to come back.'</p>

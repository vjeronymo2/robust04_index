			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Property: Eyes Wight - but few do - Mainland buyers stay away THE ISLE of Wight is a curious place. Where else but Cowes would most of the shops shut for lunch in the one week of the year when the town is thronged with thousands of visitors wanting to spend money? And where else would it be so difficult to get them to look at property? The problem, of course, is the recession. And the Isle of Wight depends more than most places on outsiders to invest in the top end of the property market. Last year, John Lelliott re-developed the four-acre site of the Victorian railway station and a school in the centre of Cowes. But its first phase of 33 apartments at Admiral Gardens has attracted only five buyers at prices from Pounds 52,500 to Pounds 250,000 (through Nationwide's local office; telephone 0983-292-141). Roger Easton, managing director of John Lelliott Residential, explains: 'We have not dropped our prices because our problem is not the product. People are very impressed with what they see but we are not getting enough people from the mainland to come and see it.' Yet, Lelliott is selling to local people at Mortonbrook, a re-development of a former caravan park at Sandown where 37 of the first 40 new houses and flats have been sold at prices from Pounds 38,000 to Pounds 49,500. The Rotch Property Group also has had difficulty attracting buyers for the Gloster, its redevelopment of the hotel that used to be the Royal Yacht Squadron's waterfront home at Cowes. So far, eight of the 15 apartments have been sold through Nationwide at prices from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds 165,000. Things are little better elsewhere on the island. At Ventnor, the former Heights Hotel has been demolished and the four-acre site, with planning consent for 26 houses, is being offered for sale by Allsop &amp; Co. (071-584-6106) on behalf of receivers for the the developers. Since the Halland Hotel at Seaview Bay was redeveloped three years ago by Westridge Horton Homes, its parent company, Leading Leisure, also has gone into receivership. While all eight waterfront houses were sold at around Pounds 225,000 each, only three of the 30 flats have been sold through Nationwide, acting on behalf of the receivers, Price Waterhouse. But five have been reserved since prices were cut (they now range from Pounds 62,500 to Pounds 145,000) and the last three of the 20 retirement flats that Leading Leisure developed at Newport were sold last week. That is encouraging news for Hewitts (Southern), which has redeveloped Seaview's central bus station in a joint venture with local builder Caws &amp; Hermans. Known as the Anchorage (although it does not have any moorings), the project is just inland from the Seaview Yacht Club. The 16 houses and flats at the Anchorage have just gone on the market at prices from Pounds 69,000 to Pounds 159,000 through the local office of Nationwide (0983-612-212) and the Bournemouth office of Savills (0202-298-585). Peter Hewitt, a former helicopter pilot turned builder who started Hewitts (Southern) when he moved to the island two years ago from Cranleigh in Surrey, is reluctantly selling his own property, Steyne House at Bembridge, for which the local office of Nationwide (0983-872-141) and Savills at Bournemouth want Pounds 650,000. Steyne is a handsome, late-Georgian building in 21 acres of well-maintained grounds. There are buyers around - that was shown by Humberts' sale of Barton Manor, Edward VII's former home at East Cowes, and its 105 acres which were bought for Pounds 1.1m by Robert Stigwood, the impresario. Paul Jackson of Lymington (0590-674-411) hopes this augurs well for Shalfleet Manor, a 17th century house near Yarmouth, which he is offering with 420 acres of land for Pounds 1.5m.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / NUT will fight rises in class sizes Delegates yesterday committed the NUT teachers' union to a campaign against rising class sizes, including a policy of refusing to cover for other teachers. The union's annual conference at Scarborough, North Yorkshire, decided this would apply in education authorities that did not allow primary school teachers to spend at least 20 per cent of each week in 'non-contact' time - time not spent in front of pupils. The union's moderate executive opposed the motion which was only narrowly successful, being passed by 86,314 votes to 85,326. The NUT must now campaign for a statutory maximum class size of fewer than 30 pupils. Delegates unanimously passed a motion attacking the reduction in government grants for areas with high numbers of children from ethnic minorities. It authorised strike action for areas where teachers thought the cuts would lead to job losses. One delegate said the shift in funding would cost 8,000 jobs, while another accused the government of a 'racist attack' against children. A motion opposed by the executive calling for a flat-rate pay increase of at least Pounds 3,000 for all teachers was narrowly defeated.</p>

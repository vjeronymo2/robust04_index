			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 31 Mar [date as received] (AFP)--The High  Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] this  evening adopted a completely new "constitutional act" for  governing Zaire's democratic transition towards the Third  Republic.    This particular act defines relations between the government  and the Presidency of the Republic and also entrusts the HCR-PT  with the task of overseeing the government's activities. It  fixes the duration of the transition at 15 months, during which  time a constitutional referendum, as well as presidential and  legislative elections, must be organized. The Parliament  earlier on had adopted Article 76 of this act, over which the  presidential group and the radical opposition had been divided  for the past seven months.    The Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition, USOR, did not  succeed in having Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi recognized as the legal  prime minister, because he was elected by the Sovereign National  Conference, CNS. The conditions for the appointment of a prime  minister do not make any reference to the CNS, but simply say  that he must be appointed by the opposition "after consultation  with the political class."    Several members of the USOR delegation left the HCR/PT in  protest, and three of them were expelled from the room for  disorderly behavior. Since voting was carried out by a raising  of hands, it was not possible know which members of the various  parties forming the USOR voted for the adoption of the text,  which was contested by the hardliners of the radical opposition.</p>

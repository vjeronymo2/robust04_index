			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGERS TELLS PARENTS SHE'S NOT A RISK IN TEACHING JOB  </P> <P> The wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers III has sent a letter to the parents of each  of her former students at the La Jolla Country Day School saying that she does  not pose a security risk, had planned to return to the school, but was  "terminated" by school officials.  </P> <P> A school official, who asked not to be named, told The Times on Wednesday that  Sharon Rogers was ordered not to return in part because of concerns about the  safety of the children, but also because administrators were worried that  parents would pull their children out of the exclusive private school.  </P> <P> She has not taught at the school since a bomb went off under the van she was  driving March 10, prompting an investigation into whether she was the intended  victim of a terrorist attack. Her husband skippered the guided missile cruiser  Vincennes that mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner down over the Persian  Gulf last July, killing 290 people. Iran vowed revenge at the time.  </P> <P> The La Jolla school official estimated that the school might lose as many as  100 of its 702 students if Rogers had returned. "You lose 100 kids at $6,000 a  head, hey. . . ," the official said.  </P> <P> He said the school administration also was "afraid for the children's lives.  I'm afraid for my life. If she came back to the school I would consider  resigning."  </P> <P> Whether Rogers agreed to leave or was fired has been a matter of controversy  since her departure was announced as a "mutual decision" by the school last  week.  </P> <P> Jim Stewart, a spokesman for the school, said Wednesday she was not fired.  "We're just not renewing her contract," he said.  </P> <P> But Stewart added, "No matter what kind of furor she expresses, she's not  coming back. Period."  </P> <P> In her letter to parents dated Saturday and obtained by The Times on Wednesday,  Rogers said she was "terminated" by the school last Thursday. She said in the  letter that earlier, in consultation with school officials, she had requested  that the words "mutual decision" appear in the school's press release "to help  ensure integrity of the board's decision." At that time, according to sources  who have spoken to Rogers, she wanted it to appear that she had not been fired.  </P> <P> She said in the letter that federal agencies had done "an in-depth threat  assessment" and found that "no evidence exists of a direct or implied threat  against me or the school." As a result, she said, she was "prepared to resume  (her) full classroom schedule."  </P> <P> Two teachers who work at the school said that they and other teachers were  angered by the administration's decision to fire Rogers. "Most of them feel the  decision was made entirely too soon because they don't even know for sure who  did it (the bombing). There was no reason to fire her. All they had to do was  say, 'Mrs. Rogers is on an administrative leave,' and then make the decision."  </P> <P> "I think they were reacting to the pressure of the media and a real minority of  the parents who were hysterical," said one teacher, who spoke on the condition  that her name not be used. "None of us ever felt scared. . . . We were  horrified for Sharon but most of us didn't feel like they were going to bomb  the school."  </P> <P> The teacher said that at a faculty meeting last week, administrators said  keeping Rogers could "choke a school to death" financially. The school's  handling of the incident was "disgusting and it doesn't make me proud to teach  here," she said.  </P></p>

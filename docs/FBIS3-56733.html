According to a reliable source, no documents shaping out a  new cabinet have been signed yet.    Conflicting media reports on Boris Fedorov's stance were  clarified to some extent by Valentin Sergeyev, chief of the  governmental press service. He quoted Fedorov as telling him by  telephone at 15:30 today that he has "not formally asked to  resign as a vice-premier". But he has "not accepted the  prime-minister's offer to hold the post of finance minister in  the reformed cabinet", Fedorov was quoted as saying.</p>

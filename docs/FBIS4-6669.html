			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] With regard to the question of Japan's permanent  membership on the UN Security Council [UNSC], a top Foreign  Ministry official said on 20 April: "If we do not join the  UNSC, there are various kinds of information that we cannot  obtain. In order to play an active role, Japan should attain  permanent membership on its own initiative rather than wait for  other nations' recommendations." He thus indicated that with  the inauguration of the new administration, Japan should  demonstrate an even more positive attitude than that of the  Hosokawa administration.</p>

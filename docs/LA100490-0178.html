			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM GERMAN CLUB TOASTS REUNIFICATION OF HOMELAND  </P> <P> Edda Hampel remembers when East Berlin soldiers erected the wall that divided  the city in 1961, when she was a young Berliner. Some nights, she would hear  shouting, see searchlights followed by gunfire and know someone else had been  killed trying to cross into West Germany.  </P> <P> "I will never forget that," said Hampel, who emigrated to the United States  three years ago and now lives in La Habra with her Berlin-born husband, Jack.  </P> <P> Those memories make Wednesday's unification of East and West Germany into one  democratic nation all the more surprising and joyous, Edda Hampel said while  celebrating the unification at the Phoenix Club.  </P> <P> The Phoenix Club, which founders say is the largest German club in the United  States, marked the occasion with champagne, bratwurst, Polish sausage, choruses  of the German and American nation anthems and news footage of November's  crumbling of the Berlin wall.  </P> <P> About 200 people, most of German descent, sang and danced beneath a banner  proclaiming: "Vereinigtes Deutschland," United Germany.  </P> <P> "I've always told my children that reunification would not take place in my  lifetime -- short of a war," said Jack Hampel, 58, an auto-body shop manager  who took off from work to celebrate at the club. "The amazing thing is, it did  take place."  </P> <P> Hampel, who has lived in the United States for 35 years, said unification will  not be easy for Germans, who have lived as two nations since World War II.  </P> <P> "It will be very difficult to get these two countries with two cultures and two  economies to get together," he said. "Everything in life has a prices. Yes,  taxes will be raised but people have to look at the rewards."  </P> <P> When the Berlin wall went up, Jurgen Maerz, 42, was a Boy Scout staying at a  Berlin youth hostel. "I saw them build that awful thing," Maerz said.  </P> <P> He still remembers the people crying, the nighttime gunfire and wondering  whether they would be allowed to cross the East German border to return to his  home in West Germany. If you can comprehend those feelings of a country  divided, he said, you will understand how Germans feel to be united again.  </P> <P> Although some are calling Wednesday a "reunification" of the Germanys, Maerz  said, he stresses that it's a unification.  </P> <P> "This is no re anything," he said. We don't want to put back anything. We don't  want to put back Hitler and we don't want to put the Kaiser back from before,"  Maerz said.  </P> <P> Wednesday's celebration at the Phoenix Club initially was meant to be a low-key  luncheon for members but grew after people kept telephoning to ask what was  being planned to commemorate the event, club president Hans Klein said.  </P> <P> Another big celebration is planned for Saturday, when Walter Momper, Berlin's  mayor and third highest ranking government official, will visit the club to  help celebrate unification and the official German-American Day, Klein said.  </P></p>

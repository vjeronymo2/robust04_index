The Abkhazian permanent representative to Moscow, Igor  Akhba,  who also took part in the consultations and the head of the  Georgian experts' group, Irakly Machavariani, told Interfax that  the joint jurisdiction was supposed to include issues related to  foreign policy and trade, customs service and border guards,  human rights protection, the energy sector, transportation and  the credit and financial systems.    The two sides decided not to speculate on the question as to  whether Abkhazia will remain part of Georgia or not, but to  solve specific issues. Both Akhba and Machavariani consider  this as a constructive side of the dialogue. The Georgian  expert even noted that he had not expected such progress.    At the same time, neither of the sides retreated from its  positions. The Abkhazian delegation supports the republic's  independence from Georgia, equal relations, and does not rule  out the possibility of creating a confederation of the two  states. On the contrary, the Georgian side insists on  preserving Georgia as a single state embracing Abkhazia.    Machavariani said that the head of the experts' group, UN  representative and professor at the University of Geneva Giorgio  Malinverni, will prepare a report on the results of the  consultations for the third round of the Georgian-Abkhazian  talks in Geneva scheduled for February 22. Malinverni asked  both sides to prepare their proposals as to which powers they  wanted to delegate to the joint power body.</p>

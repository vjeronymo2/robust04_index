			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PANEL EXPECTED TO OK FUNDING REQUEST  </P> <P> The Ventura County Board of Supervisors is expected Tuesday to approve an  application for $150,000 in federal funds for a project designed to reduce gang  and drug involvement in Ventura County.  </P> <P> "Gang activities in the county have been increasing, but compared to places  like L.A., we have nothing," said Sharon Clark, supervising deputy probation  officer at the Colston Youth Center.  </P> <P> The center, a division of the county Corrections Services Agency, is proposing  the project.  </P> <P> In the category of funds that Ventura is applying for, Clark said, only 10  projects nationwide will be granted funding. But, she added, the county does  have a fighting chance.  </P> <P> The main objectives of the proposed project are to provide support groups for  incarcerated youths who are involved with gangs and drugs, to fund  presentations by former gang members and former drug users and to offer parents  gang and drug awareness education.

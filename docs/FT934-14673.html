			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television Two of the very best English gardens, romantic Kiftsgate Court in Gloucestershire and Esther Merton's rectory in Berkshire, bring to a close An English Woman's Garden (BBC 2, 8.30). Mrs Merton's garden is full of marvellous plants and is not widely known, so tonight's programme should not be missed. A new comedy series, Demob (ITV, 9.00) brings Griff Rhys Jones and Martin Clunes together as soldiers newly back in Civvy Street. They team up and start at the bottom of the ladder as comedians in Liverpool. Odd one out of the week is The Living Soap (BBC 2, 7.15), the fly-on-the-wall documentary about the lives of six very assorted students studying at Manchester University. They share a house procured for them by the BBC - hundreds of students applied for the job. The six are, quite rightly, paid for appearing in the series, which will help their measly grants stretch a little further. Clive Anderson Talks Back (C4, 10.30), is the first of another series of the long-running chat show - guests are David Frost and Gore Vidal.</p>

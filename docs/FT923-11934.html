			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Nortel suffers reverse for first time in three years NORTHERN Telecom suffered a one-third drop in second-quarter earnings, the first profit setback for the fast-growing Canadian telecommunications equipment maker in almost three years. Although a decline in earnings was expected, the size of the drop took investors by surprise. Nortel's share price plunged by CDollars 5.38 to CDollars 40 in early trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, but recovered part of the loss later. Second-quarter earnings were USDollars 72.3m, or 28 cents a share, down from USDollars 106.5m, or 42 cents, a year earlier. Revenues dipped to Dollars 1.95bn from Dollars 2.1bn. The company ascribed the setback to the disposal of several businesses which it bought as part of the acquisition of Britain's STC in early 1991. This was as well as deferred orders for central office switches by US regional telephone companies, which are among its biggest customers. The drop in revenues was also due to the accounting treatment of sales by Motorola-Nortel, a joint cellular-phone venture which started operations in the US earlier this year. Dr Paul Stern, chairman, said he was disappointed by the results, but noted that orders climbed by 6 per cent in the latest quarter, reaching a record backlog of over Dollars 3bn on June 30. He said the company had recently won substantial contracts in the US, Canada, Australia, Korea and Spain. One Toronto analyst said investors were especially unsettled by a 'serious deterioration' in gross margins from almost 41 per cent to 39 per cent, and an increase in research and development spending from 12.2 per cent of revenues to 13 per cent. However, he added that Nortel appeared to be maintaining market share and remained 'an extremely strong competitor'. It had focused for the past two years on reducing its dependence on North America through expansion overseas. Besides the STC acquisition, it unveiled an alliance last month with Matra, the French telecommunications and electronics group.</p>

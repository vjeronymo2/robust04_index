			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Credit Lyonnais Paradoxically the modest scale of Credit Lyonnais' losses reported yesterday means the state-owned banking group will remain in the mire longer than it might have done. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, appointed by the government as chairman of the state-controlled group last year, clearly lost his battle to post an even bigger figure. This would have allowed him to clear the decks for the future by forcing the French state to inject even more money. However, the government appears to have balked at the size of the capital injection necessary to ensure Credit Lyonnais met European solvency ratio requirements had even bigger losses been declared. Those believing governments should not subsidise poorly-run state-owned organisations may applaud the decision, but it leaves Credit Lyonnais in a desperate plight. The need for disposals has been made more acute and Mr Peyrelevade, as a forced seller, will find it even harder to achieve decent prices for his assets. The year-on-year 3.3 per cent reduction in general and administrative expenses is a start, but future cuts will have to be more draconian. A dividend payment remains beyond the horizon and privatisation somewhere over the rainbow.</p>

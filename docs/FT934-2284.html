			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Return to ERM bands ruled out Creation of a single European Union currency does not depend on a formal return to the tight movement bands of the exchange rate mechanism, according to Mr Henning Christophersen, economic affairs commissioner, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'You cannot exclude that a group of countries could go into Emu (economic and monetary union) stage three without having formally re-entered the narrow bands,' a European Commission spokesman quoted Mr Christophersen as telling Danish journalists. But he said Mr Christophersen stressed that currencies still had to be stable and close to their central rates in the European Union's system of semi-fixed exchange rates. Mr Christophersen's comments mark a policy shift for the Commission. The EU's executive has always insisted that there had to be a formal move back to the grid's narrow bands before a single currency could be created. EC finance ministers gave in to more than a year of money market turmoil on August 2 and opened the currency grid's fluctuation bands to 15 per cent either side of central rates from 2.25 or 6 per cent. Only Germany and The Netherlands held on to their 2.25 per cent bands under an informal deal. The move prompted speculation that the EU's timetable for creating a single currency in 1997 or by 1999 had become more fantasy than fact. Senior EU monetary figures say a formal tightening of the bands could not take place in the near future and in any case would simply serve to offer money markets easier targets. They have said that the most sensible way forward is for countries to set up informal support agreements with each other along the lines of the German-Dutch deal as the ERM's hard core begins to crystalise. Since August 2 both the Belgian and the French francs have crept back inside the narrow band and the Danish crown is sitting just outside. In effect, the so-called hard core has virtually re-formed itself. One monetary committee member said last week this proved formally setting the narrow bands had itself been a mistake and should not be repeated.</p>

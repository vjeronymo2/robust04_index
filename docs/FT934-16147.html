			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / German manufacturing orders fall MANUFACTURING orders in western Germany fell by 2 per cent in August against July and by 7.1 per cent against August last year, the economics Ministry reported yesterday. Orders for July and August together, however, were 0.5 per cent higher than in May-June, indicating 'a continuation of the upward tendency observable since spring', according to the ministry. The level of industrial orders will be watched closely in eastern Germany, where any sustained economic growth will depend on receiving orders from companies in the west. Real exports from the five eastern states are expected to rise by 5 per cent this year compared with last, but it will hardly dent the trade deficit which totals DM200bn (Dollars 123bn). The latest figures coincide with a report by the Berlin-based DIW Institute for Economic Forecasting which sees no signs of a fall in unemployment in either western or eastern Germany. Despite adjustments for seasonal factors, the DIW expects unemployment in the west to have risen by a further 20,000 last month, bringing the total number of officially unemployed to 2.16m, or 7.2 per cent of the labour force. In the east, the DIW says there is not yet 'light at the end on the tunnel' in terms of stemming structural unemployment. However, the number of job vacancies stood at 64,000, a rise of 7,500 over the same period last year, and 40,000 remain unfilled.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Howard urges backing for participation - Employment Questions MORE companies were urged to encourage employee participation in management on a voluntary basis by Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, yesterday. Insisting that voluntary arrangements were preferable to statutory requirements, he described the best practice of British industry as 'second to none'. Mr Howard reaffirmed the government's determination to resist the imposition of a 'statutory straitjacket' by the European Community. He welcomed the part being played by the CBI in 'encouraging others to follow the lead set by the best in industry'. Mr Howard again attacked the Labour party's proposals for a statutory minimum wage, claiming they would destroy 'countless jobs', particularly if better-paid workers sought to maintain their differentials. To Labour cheers, Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, hit back by calling on Mr Howard to accept that the recession was much deeper than the government had so far been prepared to admit. Mr Blair accused the government of cutting training provision at a time when Britain had the fastest rising unemployment anywhere in Europe. Mr Howard told Labour MPs that they were in no position to demand more resources for training when it was not one of the priority areas for increased expenditure authorised by Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.</p>

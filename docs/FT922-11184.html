			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Observer: Guru relaunch The forecasting record of the City's economic gurus has been pretty terrible of late, so now is as good a time as any for Dr Paul Neild to prove that he has not lost his old touch. The man who was Extel's number one-rated economic guru for 11 years until 1985 is joining County NatWest. Observer's younger readers can be forgiven for wondering why anyone should be bothered about Neild's return. After all, he has spent the last three years in front of the TV cameras after a bad back cut short his job as head of equities at Phillips &amp; Drew. Indeed, he won the Wincott broadcast business journalist of the year award last week for his 'incisive yet entertaining' reporting of the economic scene for Channel 4 news. Admittedly, it has been seven years since Neild was P &amp; D's chief economist. But in his heyday he was a bigger star than newcomers like Goldman Sachs' Gavyn Davies, Roger Bootle of Greenwell Montagu, Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research, or P &amp; D's Bill Martin. Although, Neild was incommunicado yesterday, County NatWest's Bob Semple was overjoyed by his coup and said that it was another sign of the renewed confidence in his firm. Given Neild's walk-on role in the Blue Arrow affair, his arrival at County NatWest is the clearest sign to date that County is prepared to put this unhappy episode behind it.</p>

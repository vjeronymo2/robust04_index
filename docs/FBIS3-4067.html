What will the investment situation be  in 1994? We could say that this is a question that all people,  from top to bottom, are very concerned about, since it is  related to whether or not the national economy can achieve  sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian  kang di fa zhan 2070 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4104 4099 1455].    In the spring of this year, in a packed meeting room of the  Investment Research Institute of the State Planning Commission,  scores of experts and scholars from the Ministry of Finance, the  People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Domestic Trade, the  China Materials and Equipment Center, the State Information  Center, the Quantitative and Technical Economics Institute of  the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and the State Planning  Commission's General Department of National Economy, Center for  Economic Research, and China Prices Information Center directly  participated in a wide-ranging and vigorous discussion on the  investment situation in 1994. The main views they expressed are  presented below.    The participants agreed that the current economic situation  as a whole is good, with the economic growth rate reaching 13.4  percent in 1993 and a comparatively high level expected to be  maintained this year. In 1993, China's total social investment  in fixed assets exceeded 1,180 billion yuan, a rise of more than  50 percent over the previous year, and the greatest increase for  any year since the introduction of reform and opening up.  However, if we exclude price rises, the quantity of goods  produced increased approximately 20 percent, lower than the 23  percent rate of increase for 1992. From the perspective of the  economic situation in 1994, since various regions are still very  enthusiastic in developing the economy, and the numerous new  projects initiated in the last two years still require  comparatively great investment for their completion, plus the  increase in the retail price index of 13.2 percent in 1993, this  year will be a period of high-speed expansion of the economy and  we will be faced with the prospect of relatively large  investment and the pressure of inflation.  <H3>  Investment Growth Will Remain High and The Investment  Structure Will Remain Poor </H3>   According to estimates by Zhang Hanya, a research fellow  from  the Investment Research Institute of the State Planning  Commission, in 1994, to compensate for depreciation, the input  of capital should not be less than 290 billion yuan; and to  ensure that the new projects initiated in the last two years are  completed on time investment must not fall below 790 billion  yuan--the total of 1,080 billion yuan is the minimum investment  for 1994. Zhang stated that the level of supply of raw  materials will limit the total volume of investment, with  domestic production and financial resources playing a major  role. Generally speaking, if the GNP increases by 1 percent  then it could sustain a 1.5 percent increase in investment. It  is estimated that in 1994 the GNP growth in China will probably  reach 10 percent, which means that physical quantity investment  could increase to approximately 15 percent, and will probably  reach 1,860 billion yuan. If we consider an investment price  index of 7-10 percent, in 1994 investment currency will increase  by 23-26.5 percent to between 1,460 and 1,500 billion yuan.    The various reform measures to be introduced this year, such  as reform of the banking system, will also probably influence  the scale of investment. Comrade Wang Yida of the Comprehensive  Planning Department of the Ministry of Finance said that the  Central Bank's method of controlling loans granted to  specialized banks would be changed from administrative  distribution to management of asset-to- liability ratio. This  will reduce the restrictions on loans granted to various  commercial banks, but there is the possibility that this will  result in a rapid increase in fixed-asset investment loans and  thus foster fixed-asset investment inflation.    Wang Tongsan, a research fellow from the Quantitative and  Technical Economics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences, said that at present economic development in China is  primarily dependent on investment, and that if investment is  suspended, the economy will not be able to develop as rapidly.  Of China's enterprises, 80 percent are manufacturing  intermediate products, and only 20 percent are producing end  products. If there is not considerable investment then this 80  percent will be hard- pressed and experience difficulties. In  1993 the scale of investment was already very high, and it is  reasonable to forecast that the investment scale will be  approximately 1,400 billion yuan in 1994. If we can control  investment within this increased limit, no major problems should  develop in the economy. If not, then the economy will slide.    Comrade Xu Hongyuan from the State Information Center  pointed out that on the basis of the turnpike theorems [da dao  ding li 1129 6670 1353 3810], when the per capita GNP reaches  between $400 and $2,000 a nation should experience a stage of  high-speed growth. This is the turnpike for economic growth.  This high-speed growth means that probably within 10-15 years a  state's industrialization will be completed. According to our  calculations, China's per capita GNP should be $470. We have  the necessary conditions to bring about this so-called turnpike  of high-speed growth. Investment and consumption are the  driving forces behind economic development, but since we are a  developing country, consumer goods cannot reach a very high  level. Because of this the main factor determining growth is  still investment. The Japanese rate of investment at its  highest was 47 percent and was maintained at 40 percent for a  long period of time. The "four little tigers" have also reached  in excess of 40 percent. Last year China's investment rate  reached 36-37 percent, which is appropriate.    While the total social investment is growing at an  ultra-high  speed, there also exist the problems of a nonrational investment  structure and low returns on investment. Qiu Quanning, an  associate research fellow from the Investment Research Institute  of the State Planning Commission, pointed out that: a) There  has been a comparative reduction in personal investment in  agriculture; in 1992 there was a negative increase and last year  the rate of increase was only 10.2 percent--only one-fifth of  the national average. At the same time, the per capita incomes  of the close to 80 percent of the population who live in the  countryside have fluctuated at a low speed for a long time, and  the gap between their incomes and those of the population living  in the cities and towns has gradually widened. This serious  imbalance in the development of the economy has a negative  impact on the maintenance of sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development, and even on social stability. b) Since  the beginning of the nineties, the increased investment in  state-owned units has been constantly higher than the average  rate for society as a whole. Last year the proportion of  investment in state-owned units had already reached 70.8  percent, the highest since reforms were introduced 13 years ago.  However, in the same year the industrial growth rate in  state-owned industrial enterprises increased at a rate of only 9  percent, less than half the average for society as a whole.  That is to say, state-owned enterprises were set in motion by  investment higher than the social average, but their output  yield was much lower than the social average. To centralize  resources in low-yield sectors goes against market economics,  and high input but low yield will inevitably result in a great  wastage of resources. For this reason, the reform should be  speeded up and investment policy and management structure need  to be established and perfected, various unregulated government  actions corrected and overcome, and the wasteful use of  investment reformed in order to improve the benefits from  investment.  <H3>  Although the Channels for Financing Decreased, the Financing  Volume Was Still Large </H3>   With regard to the sources of investment funds, Comrade Ma  Ruohong of the People's Bank of China pointed out that between  January and November last year, 47.8 percent of the investment  for capital construction and renovation in state-owned units was  self- funded, primarily from a large stock of money obtained by  various means to support investment. After the disorderly  accumulation of funds was stopped, although the channels for  financing decreased, the financing volume was still large. In  the first half of last year, self-funding amounted to 90.1  billion yuan, an increase of 69 percent over the same period in  1992. This shows that if there is a large amount of capital and  household savings, then except when returns from investment are  lower than the interest rate or when the government uses  political measures to limit investment, investment will  otherwise sustain high-speed growth.    Jia Fang, deputy leader of the Comprehensive Group of the  Economic Research Center of the State Planning Commission,  pointed out that from 1988 to 1991 foreign funds actually used  averaged just over 10 billion yuan per annum; in 1991 this  figure reached 11.5 billion yuan; in 1992 it grew to 19.8  billion yuan; and in 1993 it was approximately 30 billion yuan.  This is a very influential factor. If the foreign exchange  rate is calculated at six yuan (to the dollar), foreign funds  used in 1993 amounted to approximately 180 billion yuan in fixed  assets. Apart from this, there should also be funds to match  the foreign currency. It has been estimated that in 1986 one  dollar of foreign capital required a corresponding one yuan,  while today one dollar calls for three yuan and in 1993 the  corresponding capital would have been approximately 100 billion  yuan. If we take last year's investment at the current  increased rate of 50 percent, it is close to 300 billion yuan  and means that China's investment has increased by 16 percentage  points. The current situation is excellent in terms of  opportunities in the international arena. At present, overseas  interest rates have fallen 2-3 percentage points, which presents  a very good opportunity for a low-income developing nation such  as China to use foreign capital.  <H3>  To Reduce the Remaining Inflationary Pressure the Key Is To  Control Excessive Increases in the Rate of Investment </H3>   Both the cost-push and demand-pull models of inflation exist  at the same time, but there is the question of which is the  principal factor.    Analyzed in terms of currency, Comrade Ma Ruohong pointed  out that the current inflationary pressure is caused by the  money supply being approximately 600 billion yuan in excess in  the period from 1990 to 1992. Although the money supply was not  excessive in 1993, there was no obvious tightening of the money  supply. Because of this, hidden inflationary pressure continues  to exist in 1994. If the scale of investment this year remains  relatively large, the prices of investment products will  continue to escalate. Added to this will be the concurrent  influence of a rise in the prices of crude oil and coal and the  reunification of the exchange rate, which will also in large  part be reflected in the price of investment commodities.  Whether or not the inflationary pressures left over from the  past can be released this year depends on whether the current  excessive rate of investment in fixed assets can be controlled  at the reasonable level of approximately 20 percent. The rise  in the retail commodity price index will depend on whether or  not in 1994 we can stabilize the consumption behavior of those  living in the cities and towns in terms of macropolicy. Before  the rate of inflation can reach a lower level, if a high rate of  interest can be maintained to stabilize consumption behavior, it  will still be possible to control the retail price index to  within single-digit figures.    From the perspective of the prices of the means of  production, Dai Dingyi, deputy director of the China Materials  and Equipment Information Center, remarked: Now that prices  have been deregulated, and the channels at home and abroad have  been opened up, the bottleneck in supplies for building up  production will be reduced considerably. This bottleneck is  mainly in communications, and for the most part raw materials  are no longer the major factor. All we need is money, and then  we can buy whatever China lacks from overseas. Both circulation  and materials and equipment enterprises expect that the more  investment the better. Price rises for the means of production  are not the main reason for rising prices, but fluctuations in  the economy have a profound effect on fluctuations in the  production of capital goods.    Based on historical experience, this year's inflationary  pressure will chiefly have an effect on inflation next year.  Comrade Wang Yida noted that in 1993 the rate of currency  circulation was 30 percent in excess, causing the general price  level this year to rise by more than 8 percent. In terms of  demand, the inflation caused by demand usually comes a little  delayed, and the effect of the inertia of high investment in  1993 will be maintained for a time this year. Approximately 40  percent of investment will be transferred to consumption funds,  and this transformation will be reflected in the market. The  main reason for the nation's economy being currently overheated  is investment. Even if we adopt macroeconomic regulatory and  control measures to gradually stabilize the prices of investment  products and means of production, retail market prices and the  prices of consumer goods will continue to rise for a time  because of the costs. However, this year's measures for price  reform and other reforms will, more or less, directly and  indirectly, force prices upward. Because of this we must aim to  control price increases to within 10 percent. Increases in the  scale of investment must also be maintained within appropriate  limits in order to ensure the sustained, rapid and healthy  development of the economy.</p>

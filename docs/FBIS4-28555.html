			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 10 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The Foreign  Ministry said on Friday that Foreign Minister Ali Alatas'  condition has improved but he will undergo further treatment in  Melbourne, Australia.    Through a statement, the Foreign Ministry said, Alatas had  been doing some work from his bed since he was admitted to the  Intensive Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU) of a Jakarta private hospital  more than two weeks ago.    The minister is very much concerned with a rash of  speculation on his health and has expressed his desire to meet  with the mass media, it said.    "However the medical team attending him advised that he  takes  a complete rest," it said.    Alatas, 61, a key figure in the Nonaligned Movement (NAM)  and  in preparations for this year's summit of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC), was admitted to a Jakarta hospital  on May 25 after complaining of stomach aches playing golf.    Officials said he had suffered a mild heart attack.    The Foreign Ministry also said Alatas will undergo further  medical tests in Melbourne to look into the possibility he may  have sclerosis.    Sources close to the Foreign Ministry said Alatas who is  widely known as a hard-working chain smoker will leave for  Melbourne either later on Friday or Saturday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 13 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb soldiers  have tried to reclaim heavy weapons placed earlier this year  under UN control, UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Rob  Annink said Wednesday [13 April].    He said the soldiers tried to take the weapons Tuesday in  Krivoglavci, northwest of Sarajevo, and withdrew after receiving  orders from their command post in Lukavica which had been  contacted by the UNPROFOR.    The weapons were placed under UN control following a  February  accord between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems on an immediate  ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from around the  capital Sarajevo.    The agreement was prompted by a NATO ultimatum to Serb and  Moslem units to remove artillery pieces to sites outside a  20-kilometre (12-mile) radius or face air strikes.    Annink said that following the recent NATO air raids against  Serbian position in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, Serb troops  have placed mines around three of the weapons collection sites  thus blocking the UN personnel guarding the sites.    He added that the UNPROFOR is also unaware of the  whereabouts  of a UN military observer and his Serb interpreter who  disappeared two days ago after leaving the Moslem enclave of  Zepa.    He said attempts to get information about the pair from  Bosnian Serb authorities have been unsuccessful.    Annink said that 58 other UN military observers have been  blocked in Serb-held territory since the NATO raids Sunday and  Monday.    He said some of the observers are considered hostages while  others have been allowed limited freedom of movement. They  include observers based in Lukavica, near Sarajevo.</p>

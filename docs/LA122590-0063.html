			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS PUT TO THE TEST BEFORE KIDS START SCHOOL;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: PROGRAM HELPS FAMILIES MAKE THE MOST OF ESSENTIAL PRESCHOOL LEARNING  YEARS. EARLY RESULTS SHOW THAT IT WORKS.  </P> <P> "I want my kids to be all-around great," says Steve Marsden, whose third son is  just over a week old.  </P> <P> Marsden and his wife, Elaine, are typical parents. They want their children to  do all the right things at the right time and be successful in school. But,  unlike most parents, the Marsdens are receiving the attention of the local  school district even before their preschoolers enter kindergarten.  </P> <P> As voluntary participants in a program called Parents as Teachers (PAT), the  Marsdens are getting support in their role as their children's first teachers.  </P> <P> PAT is based on research suggesting that the first three years of life are  essential learning years and that parental involvement is an important  contributor to a child's success in school.  </P> <P> "We go through our lives getting grades and raises, but there is very little to  tell parents that they are doing (their job of parenting) well," says Marsha  Gebhardt, who visits the Marsden home every six weeks.  </P> <P> Gebhardt is one of about 1,400 "parent educators" who are trained to work with  the 53,000 Missouri families participating in the statewide program. Hired by  the local school districts, these parent educators provide home visits, group  meetings and annual developmental screening. The screening program monitors  language and motor development, as well as tests for hearing or vision  problems.  </P> <P> Districts are required by the state to provide this service, but families are  free to decline the screening aspect of the program, according to Mildred  Winter, director of the Parents as Teachers National Center in St. Louis and a  founder of PAT. Records kept by parent educators become part of the child's  school record.  </P> <P> Home visits take place every month to six weeks, and group meetings are held in  which parents can get together to discuss problems and insights having to do  with raising children.  </P> <P> The Marsdens joined the program when Luke, now age 4, was 18 months old. Since  PAT concentrates on parents with newborn to 3-year-old children, Gebhardt's  visits to the family now focus on Sam, 20 months, and the newest family member,  Matthew.  </P> <P> Gebhardt arrives at the Marsdens' middle-class home looking a bit like Santa  Claus. She has two shopping bags full of homemade toys. Soon after settling on  the living room floor, she blows up a balloon for Luke and Sam to hit back and  forth with cardboard bats made from empty paper towel rolls.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Gebhardt talks with the parents about adjustments the family is  facing in response to 10-day-old Matthew's birth. In the course of a one-hour  visit, they discuss a number of typical child-rearing matters. The most  frequent concerns include discipline, sleep patterns, eating and toilet  training, Gebhardt says.  </P> <P> "Most of what I'm doing is counseling and supporting parents in their job,"  says Gebhardt, who has a master's degree in social work and two children of her  own.  </P> <P> "It's really nice to have somebody say, 'This is normal, it will pass,' "  Marsden says.  </P> <P> "We get things off our chest with somebody," Marsden says, adding that Gebhardt  brings good ideas for homemade toys and family activities.  </P> <P> Mildred Winter describes the role of the parent educator as a "listening ear"  who comes in to help solve parents' problems or concerns.  </P> <P> Parents have an active role to play in the program, Winter says. "They're not  going to go off and do the ironing while you come in and work with their  child."  </P> <P> All parent educators have some background in education and must complete a  34-hour training class. Certification renewal is required annually, with a  minimum of 20 hours of training each year.  </P> <P> Home visits and parental education programs are cropping up nationwide. But  Missouri is the only state with a statutory mandate for statewide parent  education.  </P> <P> "One of the great problems of children in our society is the fact that so many  of them are lost to view from the time the parent leaves the hospital with the  baby until the baby shows up in school," says Edward Zigler, a professor of  psychology at Yale University.  </P> <P> The unusual component of the PAT program is the link between parent education  and the local school district, Zigler says. "Schools are beginning to see that  if you really want a child ready for school, you don't wait for them to show up  at the age of 5," he says.  </P> <P> A pilot project was launched in 1981; more than 300 families in four school  districts across the state received the services.  </P> <P> At the end of three years, an independent study found that the participating  youngsters were significantly more advanced than a comparison group in language  development, intellectual abilities, and social skills. In addition, their  parents were more knowledgeable about child-rearing than the average parent who  was not involved with the program.  </P> <P> A follow-up study done when the same group was in first grade showed that the  participating children maintained their early advantage.  </P> <P> In 1984, under the leadership of then-Gov. Christopher Bond, now a U.S.  senator, the state passed legislation to expand the program to all 543 school  districts in Missouri.  </P> <P> Winter calls the passing of this legislation "unprecedented."  </P> <P> "We're a very conservative state, and the idea of taking children away from the  home in the early years would not have been an acceptable one in many areas of  our state," Winter says. In fact, Missouri did not have mandatory kindergarten  until 1986.  </P> <P> Parent participation in the program is voluntary. Ideally, parent educators  begin working with a new family in the third trimester of pregnancy.  </P> <P> Participants are recruited through hospitals, birthing centers and various  social service agencies, but word of mouth seems to be the most successful  recruiter.  </P> <P> The mandated expansion of the program from four sites to 543 diverse school  districts created controversy even among PAT advocates.  </P> <P> An original consultant and founder severed his ties with the state's program in  opposition to the rapid expansion.  </P> <P> "I could not see how they could maintain adequate quality the way they were  headed," says Burton White, director of the Center for Parent Education in  Newton, Mass.  </P> <P> "In retrospect, it was really a blessing in disguise," Winter says of the move  to statewide implementation. "It has given us a chance to test out the program  with every conceivable population." About 30% of the state population with  children from birth to 3 years old are now participating in PAT.  </P> <P> Although it is designed to serve parents of all backgrounds and socioeconomic  status, program administrators make an effort to target "hard-to-reach"  families.  </P> <P> PAT's budget is $13 million for 1991, up from $2.7 million the first year. The  districts are required to provide a minimum of five contacts over an  eight-month period, including three home visits. More than half the state's  districts provide the same level of contact as the pilot program, Winter said.  </P> <P> Most of the parent educators work part time, which allows for flexibility in  making home visits in the evenings or on weekends.  </P> <P> Districts set salaries for parent educators, but the average pay is about $12  an hour, says Sue Treffeisen, training coordinator at the national center.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's much argument anymore about the value of this program  for middle-class parents," Zigler says. "The issue that's causing some  head-scratching is: Is this program effective with inner-city families or rural  families?"  </P> <P> A "Second Wave Evaluation" is now being conducted to help answer that question.  Results are expected in December.  </P> <P> According to White, the funding, training and levels of family contact mandated  by the state law are insufficient to replicate the results of the pilot  project. He expects the study to show "very little beneficial effect. . . .  nothing like what happened in the pilot studies."  </P> <P> "A fair number of states have made inquiries about the program through me,"  White says, "and I tell them all the same thing: 'It's a marvelous program if  you can replicate the pilot."  </P> <P> "I would be amazed if we didn't get positive effects with Parents as Teachers  in its present form," Zigler counters. He points to many other programs showing  positive effects from home visitation and parent education.  </P> <P> "Researchers feel you're never really finished fine-tuning and developing,"  Winter says. The mandate to go statewide gave them no choice but to do the best  they could, she says.  </P> <P> "Children and families are having a hard time today in America" and cannot wait  for the last word of science, Zigler says.  </P> <P> He has spoken out in favor of national legislation to provide $20 million in  federal seed money for the implementation of new PAT programs and the expansion  of existing projects. Currently, 81 replications of the program are operating  in 28 states.  </P> <P> Steve Marsden knows he doesn't want to wait to start teaching his sons about  the world: "To sit and wait for kindergarten to come is ridiculous," he says.  "Why not start as soon as we can?"  </P></p>

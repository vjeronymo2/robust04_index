These studies will evaluate the impact of existing program services on the psychological adjustment and transition to new living situations among children whose mothers are in the terminal stage of AIDS or have died of AIDS. The study of this research issue as it pertains to minority populations (defined as one of the four federally-recognized groups: Black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander, and Native American) is encouraged because minorities constitute over 49 percent of all reported cases of AIDS and approximately 75 percent of all women and children with AIDS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Research has suggested that by the end of the decade more than 80,000 children and adolescents will be motherless due to AIDS. Not since the influenza epidemic of 1918 has this country been faced with this large a number of motherless children. Cities expected to be the most affected include Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, New York City, Washington, DC, and San Juan, P.R. However, the problem extends far beyond these pediatric HIV epicenters. More than 40 percent of the motherless children are anticipated in other cities as well as suburban and rural areas. In 1992 nearly 7,000 children were born to HIV-infected women; 3,000 of these were born in the southeastern United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is currently expected that all children born to HIV-infected mothers will be left motherless. To place the magnitude of this problem in context, cancer kills the mothers of 4,200 children and 8,700 adolescents each year. Motor vehicle accidents annually kill the mothers of 3,200 children and 1,900 adolescents. In 1994 AIDS will leave 3,900 children and 3,400 adolescents motherless.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact of these deaths will be experienced on both the institutional and personal levels. Programs for children of HIV-infected mothers will require large social welfare expenditures in the coming decades. And yet, little research has been completed to demonstrate the essential and effective social-service components that will be required, particularly for families with HIV-infected members. It is anticipated that programs for children and their caregivers should include mental health and bereavement counseling, programs that bridge the transition from AIDS-specific entitlement and services to general programs, housing support in the larger cities, and school/community programs to help reduce high-risk behaviors in coming generations. In the face of the problems of exponential growth and diminishing funds, research should be conducted which determines the critical elements of a successful program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the personal level, recently initiated behavioral studies have begun to highlight the impact of HIV infection on mothers and their children. Studies have emphasized both the stigma associated with HIV infection and the important role children play in decisions made by infected mothers. Evidence has suggested that mothers fear disclosing their HIV infection to their children, and because of this, often delay seeking much needed health care for themselves. Because of anticipated stigma, families may withdraw socially, attempting to cope without help from outside the family. Mothers also delay making plans for the care of their children after their death so that children may be placed in temporary foster care for many months during a period of considerable emotional stress to the child and family. Finally, there is preliminary evidence that teenaged children of HIV-infected mothers may engage in HIV-related sexual and drug-using behaviors in the period following the mother's death, behaviors attributed in part to the emotional trauma experienced by the adolescents during the transition period. Transitional social service programs for younger children at the time of their mother's death may in effect serve as primary prevention programs by helping children more effectively adjust to a new living situation and cope with the loss of their mother.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.

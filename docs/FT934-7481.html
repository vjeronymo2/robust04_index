			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Observer: Don't laugh And well done to Price Waterhouse itself for its Budget Christmas cracker which has landed on Observer's desk. Instead of the usual weak jokes, such as why couldn't the leopard escape from the zoo? (answer, because he was spotted), PW's tax specialists have filled the cracker with famous sayings from Tory chancellors. Bound to raise a few titters are: 'Henceforth a zero PSBR will be the norm' (Nigel Lawson, March 1988); 'We are likely to see the temporary re-emergence of a public sector borrowing requirement' (Norman Lamont, March 1991). However, Observer's favourite is Anthony Barber's observation in his 1972 budget that VAT has been 'deliberately designed with the interests of low income families in mind'. Hope this little cracker doesn't jeopardise PW's chances of winning any more juicy privatisations.</p>

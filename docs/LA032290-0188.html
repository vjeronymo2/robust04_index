			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRICE, NOT COASTAL VOYAGE, SURPRISES TRAINER  </P> <P> Ron McAnally said he wasn't surprised by Coastal Voyage's 8-1 upset in the  $106,900 Sierra Madre Handicap Wednesday at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> In fact, the trainer could hardly believe that the 6-year-old went off at such  a healthy price, the fifth-longest shot in the field of seven.  </P> <P> "I really liked this horse today," McAnally said after his fourth stakes  victory of the meeting, the most he has had at Santa Anita since he won five in  1982.  </P> <P> "He's a genuine racehorse," McAnally said. "At this distance, he's genuine.  (Jockey) Alex (Solis) works him every morning and knows him real well."  </P> <P> Obviously, Solis and Coastal Voyage do have a love affair with the Santa Anita  hillside turf course. They are now three for three over the layout.  </P> <P> Coastal Voyage put away Diamonds Galore, Summer Sale and favored Frost Free  early, then held off the charging Raise A Stanza and won by a neck in 1:12 2/5,  equaling Baffle's 20-year-old stakes record.  </P> <P> Weldnaas, the 5-2 second choice, was another head back in third, a length in  front of Tanker Port. Frost Free finished fifth at 17-10 in his first try on  the turf.  </P> <P> "Ron and I talked about it before the race," Solis said, "and he told me there  were two or three speed horses in there and to lay second, third or fourth  behind the speed. When he got clear at the quarter pole, he took off. He loves  it down the hill. He's really smart and he's a lot of fun."  </P> <P> Frost Free, who had blitzed Sunny Blossom in the slop in last month's El  Conejo, didn't seem overly fond of the grass, according to Chris McCarron.  </P> <P> "He didn't feel very comfortable," he said. "But he's got some class. He kept  digging and trying, even though he wasn't getting a hold of it."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Hialeah President John Brunetti, who owns Coastal Voyage, flew in to watch the  Sierra Madre. "I lost my luggage, but it was worth it," he said. "I enjoy  California racing. It's organized, structured, delightful, a pleasant change  from Florida." . . . With the pool having exceeded $500,000 Wednesday, there  will be a mandatory payout in the Pick Nine today. There is also an $85,392.53  carryover in the Pick Six.  </P> <P> The stewards fined Corey Black and Patrick Valenzuela $100 apiece for their  altercation in the jockey's room after Sunday's seventh race. . . . Oraibi, who  won six of 17 starts and $361,850 for trainer Richard Mandella, has been  retired and will stand at stud at Tony Matos' farm in Llano. Oraibi, who won  the Sierra Madre Handicap and Malibu Stakes, broke a cannon bone after working  Feb. 15. . . . Alex Solis, Robbie Davis and Valenzuela each won twice  Wednesday.  </P></p>

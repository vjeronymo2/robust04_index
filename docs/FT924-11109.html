			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Politics and the economy depress Johannesburg - Why investors are nervous Fragile international equity markets, poor growth prospects and a gloomy domestic political scene have created a very nervous mood on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). In spite of a 3.5 per cent recovery last week, the overall index is still 19 per cent off its high for the year of 3,749, achieved on June 5th, closing at 3,007 yesterday. The industrial index, which closed at 3,995, is 15 per cent off its year high while the gold index, at 822, recently hit a seven-year low. Despite these corrections, there is broad consensus that the market is likely to go lower in the short term. Mr Rob Lee, of the Board of Executors financial institution, said that the recent correction was a case of the market catching up with reality, having previously defied the deteriorating political and business climate. The fundamentals, meanwhile, had worsened. 'Ratings are still high while expectations are much worse than they were,' said Mr Lee. The gloomier sentiment is closely related to the dawning realisation that economic recovery in the main western economies will be slower than anticipated. South Africa is traditionally drawn out of recession by a commodity upturn, which now looks as though it may be delayed until 1994. There is also concern about the possibility of a sizeable downward correction in the Dow Jones, which the JSE traditionally tracks closely. Some analysts also blame the spill-over effect from tight global liquidity, which is depressing world markets and economies. Prospects for domestic growth are little to get enthusiastic about. South Africa's GDP is likely to fall by about 1.5 per cent this year and average growth forecasts for next year are only about 1 per cent. These poor fundamentals have already filtered over into bad corporate results, with the expectation of worse to come. Profit forecasts in recent weeks have stressed overwhelmingly the likelihood of weaker earnings in the year ahead. The traditional shortage of scrip argument as a support for the JSE is also undermined by potentially large cash calls on institutions: a R600m (Dollars 140.2m) rights issue from Stanbic, R1.3bn being sought for the Alusaf project and about R2bn for the Royal group's acquisition of Del Monte Foods International. While the JSE is to a large extent mirroring international trends, there are also two factors that lend domestic flavour: the severe drought, which the Reserve Bank has estimated could knock 1.8 percentage points off GDP growth this year, and politics. Following a two-year honeymoon period, when expectations of the political reform process tended towards the euphoric, the last three months have seen a mood of considerable, possibly exaggerated, pessimism set in. Although the current gloom probably has more to do with poor economic fundamentals, it could certainly do with a political fillip. While the installation of an interim government might until recently have done the trick, cynicism about the political process has reached the stage where the market is probably likely to regard a new government only as introducing further uncertainty. Mr Tony Gibson, of the Syfrets group, said: 'The longer you wait, the more good news you need to attract people back.' Sentiment has been further undermined by the dramatic plunge in the value of the financial rand, the investment currency for foreigners, earlier this month. A weak financial rand normally boosts share prices, but the failure of this to happen has highlighted the nervous mood among investors. Mr James Inglis, of Liberty Asset Management, predicted a sharpening polarisation of the market as funds chase the increasingly small pool of 'Rand Club' stocks which have the ability to continue raising earnings - especially defensive stocks like Premier and Tiger Oats in the food sector and financials such as Liberty and Stanbic - while allowing others to languish. Mr Gibson foresaw continued vulnerability on the JSE until at least mid-1993. He said one of two things had to happen: either strong earnings growth would come through in the next six months, or current market ratings would unwind. Of the two, the latter appears more likely.</p>

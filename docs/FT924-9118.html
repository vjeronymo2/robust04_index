			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade War Fears: Washington prepares its second volley FAILURE by the EC to signal soon its serious intent to reduce oil seeds production may bring on a second wave of punitive US tariffs on both farm and industrial products worth up to Dollars 700m (Pounds 451.6m). Mr Steve Yoder, chairman of the American Soyabean Association, which made the complaint at the heart of the trade action, said the administration had decided to disrupt world trade as little as possible but 'to slowly send the message that we are serious about the EC reforming its oilseeds policy'. In announcing the Dollars 300m in 200 per cent tariffs on Thursday, Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, also published a list of industrial products which could be targeted for the second phase in the trade confrontation. The US claims damages of at least Dollars 1bn for lost oil seeds sales. If the next tranche of punitive tariffs goes forward, the additional sanctions will be placed on a Dollars 2bn list of farm products, published last June, and a new Dollars 1.7bn list of EC industrial products. The new 'hit list' includes tyres, perfumes and toilet waters, paper and paperboard, ceramics, glassware, tubes and pipes, records and tapes, and furniture. 'This government doesn't want trade war,' said Ms Carol Brookins, a Washington agriculture consultant. 'But if there is counter-retaliation by the EC, we could jump quickly into raising the stakes.' The administration has scheduled a 30-day period of comment by potentially affected industries on the new list of industrial goods. Public hearings are scheduled for December 7. However, the whole public comment period could be waived if the EC announced retaliatory measures, according to Ms Brookins. In that case, the sanctions would be applied forthwith. Mr John McInespie, a trade analyst with a Washington law firm, said higher tariffs on tyres could badly hurt German companies as well as the Goodyear plant in Luxembourg. New tariffs on ceramics would hit hard Italy as well as France and potteries in England. 'The Americans were quite clever in this,' Mr McInespie said. 'There are American alternatives for every one of these (proposed targets). The American consumer won't be even remotely inconvenienced.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Jayme Brener in Fort Lauderdale, </F> Helio Contreiras in Rio de Janeiro, and Sonia Figueiras in  Brasilia; date not given]    [Text] If a dictionary on neoliberalism were to be  compiled, the term privatization should be defined as: "The act  of selling a public company to private investors, seeking to  reduce the public debt." So, should investors believe the term  private sector means that the pertaining public company will  change owners and orientation? Not always. The auction of  Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company]--which is scheduled for  20 May in Sao Paulo--may be a kind of self-privatization.  Managers of the most profitable Embraer subsidiary, the Embraer  Aircraft Corporation (EAC), its U.S. subsidiary, are preparing  themselves--under EAC President Newton Berwig from Rio Grande do  Sul--to purchase this filet mignon from Embraer. It is really a  filet mignon because there is evidence that the EAC--which is  totally controlled by Embraer--has for years been fattened with  juicy commissions and exclusive rights to sell Embraer planes  while the mother company increasingly suffered the losses. "Of  course we would like our independence," Berwig told ISTOE  reporter Osmar Freitas Junior at the EAC headquarters in Fort  Lauderdale, Florida.    "I am very surprised over this self-purchase attempt, which  has never been mentioned during the high command meetings," said  Brigadier Mauro Gandra, chief of the Civil Aviation Department.  The conditions of the auction, which were published on 5 April,  do not foresee this possibility. The Air Force, which generated  and protected Embraer, never discussed the possibility of  dismembering the company. "I favor the independency of the EAC  but I do not know if the company can purchase itself," Embraer  President Ozires Silva told ISTOE in Sao Jose dos Campos. For  this reason Newton Berwig has summoned, at the request of Ozires  Silva, a group of brokers. They are offering Embraer to U.S.  investors, especially those in the financial field. If they form  a consortium and buy it, the next step will be to divide it into  three. The military part of Embraer will remain under the  control of the Air Force in light of its reluctance to sell. The  EAC would then remain light and free, metamorphosed into an  independent company with exclusive rights to sell  Embraer-produced Brasilias, CBA-123's, and Bandeirantes  worldwide, except for Latin America. The civilian part of  Embraer would be managed by the consortium. Given that the  investors know planes only as passengers, they will have to hire  experts for the new Embraer. The strongest candidates for these  positions are members of the team headed by Ozires Silva, who  founded Embraer in 1969 and who has shown a remarkable example  of political survival. Except for a few months during the Collor  administration, Ozires has always managed Embraer. And he may  not step down. "I believe that if the new company chief comes  from the financial field he may maintain the current company  management," Brigadier Gandra said. "I do not know if Ozires  will remain in his post, but I believe that he should remain  because he is the father of Embraer and he knows the company,"  echoed Newton Berwig.    But this is not what most consultants are telling their  clients who are interested in Embraer's privatization. Brigadier  Lauro Ney Menezes, retired, a former director of the Sao Jose  dos Campos Technical Aerospace Center said: "There has been a  managerial perpetuation that has steadily followed questionable  guidelines." Menezes is today an independent consultant.  Multiplic Bank director Manuel Cintra added: "Following the  auction, Embraer must have a new board of directors because,  although it has a team of qualified managers, they are used to a  subsidized system." Multiplic was asked by Newton Berwig to take  part in Embraer's self-privatization, but declined.    The domestic solution proposed by Berwig/Ozires does have  one  point in its favor: There has been little interest, at least  thus far, by foreign investors in Embraer's auction. It should  be noted that the terms of the proposal will affect this and the  next generation. The government has committed itself to  liquidating a $640 million debt of Embraer. This loss will, of  course, be paid by taxpayers. The established value is $295  million plus $30 million, which will have to be fueled to  Embraer. The package could turn out to be a bad deal because it  also includes $205 million in debts accrued since 1993, which  the 31 December 1992 auction notice astutely overlooked. The  notice envisages the sale of 60 percent of Embraer shares, of  which up to 40 percent will be available for foreign investors.  The state, through the Air Force, will keep 20 percent of the  shares plus the Golden Shares; that is, those with a veto right  concerning strategic decisions, especially those dealing with  military initiatives. The 5,600 Embraer employees will be able  to buy 10 percent of the shares at a 70 percent discount, and  the remaining 10 percent will be offered to small investors.    Foreign companies are not being deterred either by the  limits  imposed on the amount of shares they may buy, or by the Golden  Shares. Joao Antonio Lopes, president of the Trevisan consulting  company, said: "The problem stems from the lack of governmental  decision to support the aerospace industry." He added: "The  presidents of the United States and France have taken the  initiative personally and have engaged in diplomatic efforts to  advertise their industrial products." No major aerospace, space,  or military company has ever prospered without the help of its  own government. The privatization proposal includes the purchase  by the government of the CBA-123 project. The problem is that  state support for military and aerospace industry has declined  in recent years.    Despite the doubts existing in Brasilia about Embraer, there  are at least three consortia--in addition to those supporting  Newton Berwig's "self-privatization" proposal--that are planning  to participate in the auction. Another former president of  Embraer, Ozilio Silva, (no relative of Ozires), who is being  advised by Trevisan, is backed by the French Bank and the  Brazilian Bank. He hopes to win the auction through the  participation of Martin Marietta, one of the giants of the U.S.  aerospace industry. Silva does not favor the division of  Embraer. He is also dealing with Raytheon, a company that has  already got a foot--or, rather, a toe--in Brazil. Raytheon is  bidding for a project to set up the Amazon Region Surveillance  System (Sivam). As its Brazilian partner, Ozilio is negotiating  with the Constran construction company. He hopes foreign  investors will consider Embraer as a first step toward larger  investments in the aerospace program and in the privatization of  the Brazilian communications system. It is also expected that  consortia organized by the Monteiro Aranha group and by the  Multiplic Bank will also participate in the auction.    Some people oppose the privatization. The metal workers  union  and the Sao Jose dos Campos engineers union have called for a  recovery project for Embraer by a group of consultants headed by  Amir Khair, former finance secretary of the PT [Workers Party]  Sao Paulo Municipal administration. The document concludes that  Embraer could recover with a $70 million injection without being  privatized. "No matter the future of the public company, the  main issue is that there should be a committee of civilian  institutions to control its activities and to prevent financial  disasters," Khair said.    Embraer executives believe the group that is best prepared  for the auction is Newton Berwig, mainly because it started  organizing earlier than the rest. "The self-purchase of the EAC  has been talked about for a long time," said a company manager  who did not want to be identified. An Embraer document dated  1991--when the public company was trying to reorganize itself to  overcome the national economic crisis--lists different ways to  fatten the EAC. The document states: "Profit opportunity: The  EAC creates a subsidiary to finance Embraer planes. In a fiscal  paradise, the EAC Finance Corporation could also facilitate the  international financial operations of Embraer." These points  interest those who want to extend their field of operations.  From this restructuring the EAC became much stronger. Since  Embraer owed it $40 million, the EAC purchased--at $15 million  off the debt--the exclusive right to sell Embraer planes  worldwide, except for Latin America. Fantastic business. One  Embraer executive said: "We were naive and did not see that the  EAC was getting stronger at the expense of Embraer."    This naivete is due to the EAC's unblemished record. The  company has sold nine out of every 10 Brasilias, the most  successful Embraer plane. The EAC placed 270 airplanes in the  demanding U.S. market which gave it in 1990 a 38-percent share  of the international 21-40 seat airplane market. The EAC, which  has 125 employees, operates from a two-building complex, the  kind which Americans call clean cut high-tech [preceding three  words in English]. The modern parts control and management  software of the EAC has been adopted by large U.S. companies  like Northrop.    Since its foundation in 1989, the EAC has placed more than  300 Bandeirantes planes in Uncle Sam's skies. It is true that  the EAC received a lot of aid from the mother company. To  guarantee a place in the U.S. market, many Brasilias were sold  at very low prices. For example, a contract with the large U.S.  company Continental to supply it with 100 airplanes was closed  at a loss. This means it lost money on the deal. The expectation  was to make money later, when the Brasilia would be a known  airplane in U.S. skies. It is just that "later" came the U.S.  recession which made the EAC sales drop considerably.    In times of economic depression, everyone must tighten their  belts. One would think that the commission of Embraer salesmen  should have also been reduced. Wrong. Sales commission  represents EAC's black box or double accounting. When the  company was created, enormous commission was paid: 18 or 19  percent for each Bandeirantes that was sold. It was really a  concealed way to inject capital into the EAC, seeking to  stabilize it and avoid problems with the Brazilian Government.  Commission dropped to 14.2 percent in 1986, to 10 percent in  1887, and stabilized at 12 percent in 1989. Commission never  varied from this fantastic percentage which is greater than the  international average. For each Brasilia sold for, let us say,  $7.5 million, the EAC received $900,000. On a sliding scale, 2  percent of the commission was divided among all the EAC  employees, from the president to the janitor. The management  kept $5,000--nearly the price of a cheap car--for every Brasilia  delivered. In 1989 the EAC sold nearly 60 planes in the United  States and each EAC executive received $300,000, apart from his  salary.    During the following years the number of planes sold and  delivered abroad dropped considerably. Only 15 planes were sold  in 1992. A restructuring proposal in 1991 foresaw a cut in the  sales commissions. Berwig said he accepted this proposal. The  EAC president then froze the salaries of the executives and main  salesmen at their highest average rate. That is, salaries plus  commission. From that figure he cut 20 percent. "If sales had  increased, the measure would have represented a real saving, but  sales continued to drop and the incorporation of commission into  the salaries represented an increased cost for the EAC," said a  former EAC director. This means the big EAC bosses earn an  annual salary of at least $300,000. Some Embraer people believe  they even reach $500,000--which not even a Ford or IBM executive  would scorn. "In some cases the commission exceeded the labor  cost of the plane," a former Embraer director said.    Meanwhile, in the world of the Brasilia, Embraer faces  serious turbulence. The U.S. recession was slowly overcome but  sales continued low, perhaps partly due to the lack of  stimulation that the commission represented to EAC salesmen.  Their salaries, however, continue very nicely thank you. In  practice, Embraer continues to inject capital into its  subsidiary and we should not be surprised if the well-nourished  prodigal son wants his independence.    Newton Berwig blames the company's salary situation on the  U.S. Internal Revenue Service which forbids cutting commission  under the pretext of combating tax evasion. Some years ago the  EAC spent nearly $1 million on lawyers to explain to the U.S.  Internal Revenue Service that sales commission had been  stabilized at 12 percent. No changes have been made since then;  salaries continue high and the main Sao Jose dos Campos company,  which is totally indebted, has not done anything about it. The  EAC maintains the Embraer planes sold in the United States by  buying spare parts at a 30 percent discount. In 1992 the EAC  received two free Brasilia planes, to increase its capital, and  an enormous stock of Brasilia spare parts to pay for Embraer  debts. But Embraer still owes $20 million to EAC. "We were  unable to stop this drainage of funds," one Embraer executive  regrets. Berwig's enemies--and there are many inside  Embraer--have another version. They say that Berwig, a U.S.  naturalized citizen and former U.S. Air Force pilot, has a  "secret" contract with Embraer.    A secret clause requires that approximately $4 million would  be paid immediately to Berwig as severance pay--in addition to  other benefits over the next few years--should he be dismissed.  The self-purchase of the EAC would also certainly be  advantageous to Embraer because it would preclude an audit that  new owners would certainly order.    The privatization/EAC self-purchase imbroglio is just  another  mishap in the history of Embraer. The company started out with  the blessings of the Air Force in the form of an initial order  of dozens of Bandeirante planes. It had all kinds of incentives:  between 1970 and 1988, any corporation could deposit 1 percent  of its income tax in Embraer. To promote the acceptance of  Brazilian planes in the United States, the Brazilian Government  removed all duties on the import of planes. The only problem is  that Brasilias, Tucanos, and the like today face an altogether  different market constraint: a 19.2-percent fiscal burden.    Embraer, which combines aeronautical production, advanced  technology, and military industry, has become an easy target for  political maneuvers. Salo Roth, former director of the EAC and  an Embraer official for 18 years, said: "In the 1980's, Ozires  Silva unwillingly embarked on the creation of Orbita, a company  to manufacture missiles but which failed." There were  international operations like the bold triangular operation  through Great Britain of four Brasilias to Bophutatswana, a  black territory that was only recognized by South Africa. Brazil  officially opposed the racist South African regime and endorsed  all UN resolutions against it.    During the government of Jose Sarney, who in 1987 signed a  cooperation agreement with Argentina, Embraer began the CBA-123  binational aircraft project. Yet, the Argentine money never  came. The Brazilian money did not come either. Nevertheless,  Embraer president Ozilio Silva decided to develop the aircraft  anyway. The CBA-123 model has the novel feature of having its  engines set backwards. The money was obtained from the financial  market at soaring interest rates. The CBA-123 is almost ready.  There are three prototypes, but they are not selling. The  project represents a $300 million loss. The loss is even higher  in the case of the AMX subsonic fighter project, which was  implemented jointly with Italian companies. The Air Force fell  behind in paying because of its critical financial situation and  even considered backtracking completely. It will purchase only  22 aircraft. That is all.    Although it is on the brink of collapsing, Embraer has  savored some victories. The main ones are the Tucano and the  EMB-145. The Tucano, a training plane, is considered to be one  of the best of its kind in the world. The Tucano accounts for 45  percent of this type of aircraft on the market. In association  with Northrop, Embraer is participating in a bid worth millions  of dollars to supply 675 aircraft to the U.S. Air Force and  Navy. The EMB-145, which is still on the drawing board, will be  a beautiful 50-passenger jet plane and there are already 136  orders for it. Whether these orders will be fulfilled depends on  what the future holds for Embraer.    Based on these possibilities and under the labor union  proposal, the Committee Against the Privatization of  Embraer--which comprises dozens of institutions--will try to get  the 20 May auction suspended. The auction represents another  bird being sucked into the Embraer turbines. The enemies of  privatization maintain that the auction conditions must be  approved by Congress, which has not happened. Decree-Law No.  770/69--which created Embraer--states: "In the ordinary issuance  of shares to increase capital, the Federal Government must  underwrite enough shares to guarantee a minimum 51 percent of  the voting stocks." If privatization takes place without the  annulment of the decree, the auction process may be blocked by  lawsuits.    The contenders have got the ball rolling, and the result  will  be known on 20 May, the date of the auction. Self-purchase or  pure and simple privatization, a great duel will take place  between the Silvas. On one hand, Ozires Silva, colonel and  eternal Embraer commander, on the other hand, former Embraer  president Ozilio Silva. They have known each other for 40 years,  they were great allies, but know they treat each other  contemptuously. Curiously enough, the two Silvas live in the  same condominium, the luxurious Bosque do Engenho, in Sao Jose  dos Campos, with its magnificent view of the marshlands. Will  passengers please fasten their seat belts.  <H5>  The AMX </H5>   This is an ambitious subsonic fighter plane for ground  attack, developed by Embraer, Alenia, and Aermacchi (Italy). The  project has been superseded and its cost is approximately that  of a modern American F-16. It has accumulated enormous losses.  <H5>  The CBA-123 </H5>   This is the result of a political agreement between Brazil  and Argentina. It never received the funds promised by the two  governments. Embraer developed the plane by contracting loans  from the financial market. It represents a $300 million loss.  <H5>  The Bandeirante </H5>   Created in the 1970's, it represented Embraer's business  card  in the international market. More than 300 units were sold in  the United States alone. The Bandeirante consolidated Embraer's  position in its regional aviation niche.  <H5>  The Brasilia </H5>   The successor to the Bandeirante with a pressurized cabin,  it  has allowed Embraer to control more than one third of its  regional aviation market in the world. Nearly 320 units were  sold, 83 percent of which were sold in the United States.  <H5>  The Tucano </H5>   A military training airplane, considered one of the best  planes in use in the world, it controls 45 percent of its market  and is manufactured under license in the United Kingdom.

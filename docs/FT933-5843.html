			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cookson Group builds laminates side in Europe COOKSON GROUP, the specialist industrial materials company, is strengthening its position as a supplier to the printed circuit board industry by making its second related acquisition in a week. The group, which has been refocusing on four core divisions, and will announce interim results tomorrow, is acquiring the European electronic laminates business of Perstorp, a quoted Swedish company, for over Pounds 11m. Cookson announced plans last week to buy Brent Electronic Chemicals for Pounds 24m in cash and assets. BEC is a division of Brent Chemicals International, which supplies specialty chemicals, solders, fluxes and other materials to the PCB industry. Perstorp is the second largest supplier of electronic laminates in Europe with sales last year of Pounds 35m. The acquisition will substantially strengthen the position of Cookson's existing subsidiary, Polyclad Laminates, which is the market leader in the US in high performance multi-layer laminates and has growing sales in the Far East market. Perstorp produces a similar range of multi-layer materials and mass lamination products used in sophisticated electronics manufacturing, from highly automated plants in Perstorp, Sweden and Nantes, France. Mr Richard Oster, Cookson's chief executive, said: 'This acquisition will give us a significant, well established position in the European market for multi-layer laminates. It will also give us management and technology, all of which will further enhance our position worldwide.' Under the terms of the purchase agreement Cookson will initially acquire 90 per cent of the group's Swedish operations and all of the French operations for Pounds 11.1m. In addition the agreement includes an earn-out arrangement whereby profits in excess of a 20 per cent return on Cookson's investment will be shared on a 50:50 basis over a three-year period.</p>

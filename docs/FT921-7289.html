			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Equities The failure of the London market to respond to yet another record close on Wall Street was merely the latest in a series of striking reminders that UK equities are thoroughly becalmed. Since the start of the year, the FT-SE index has risen by 50 points, or just 1.7 per cent, more than half of that increase occurring this week. Granted, the market has been restrained by political worries: yesterday's opinion polls were reason enough for the market to reflect a note of caution. As the corporate results season gets into full swing, there is sufficient concern over dividends to limit investors' enthusiasm. Equally, it is fashionable to turn the argument around and contend that US investors are impossibly optimistic about economic recovery - the yield ratio between US bonds and equities has reached its highest level since the 1987 Crash. It is thus the more interesting to note that the FT-SE would now be some 45 points higher, but for the notable underperformance since mid-January of three very large stocks - Glaxo, BP and Shell. One implication is that the broader performance of equities has been surprisingly positive. Unfortunately, that could mean London will be even more vulnerable to bad news.</p>

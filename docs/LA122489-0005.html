			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> "The Wonder Years" is so painfully realistic that I'm certain its writers were  once junior high school students! I've been out of junior high school for 23  years now, but with each new episode, I feel myself reliving those awkward,  frustrating years. The show is terrific, but let's tone down the realism. I get  enough stress watching "thirtysomething."  </P> <P> Henry Sakaida, Temple City  </P></p>

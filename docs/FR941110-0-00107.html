			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters complained that in cases where the facility fails to provide the list of residents and their physicians required in proposed &sect;488.175(h) (redesignated in this rule as paragraph &sect;488.325(g)), the State will be unable to comply with the State notification requirements in proposed paragraph (i) (redesignated in this rule as paragraph (h)). If the facility provides the list late, the State will miss its 30-day deadline. These commenters believe that this paragraph should be rewritten to require the State to issue notice within 30 calendar days of receipt of the resident/physician information from the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are accepting this suggestion with some modification and are revising redesignated paragraph (h) to read, ``Not later than 20 calendar days after a SNF or NF complies with paragraph (g), the State must provide written notice of the noncompliance to_''. This revision imposes the notification requirement on the State once the State has received the necessary information from the facility. Also, &sect;488.325(g) provides that facilities that fail to provide the information to the State timely will have termination or alternative remedies imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters questioned whether there would be a revisit prior to the notification to physicians and licensing boards, and, if so, and corrections had been made, whether notifications must still occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Act does not require revisits, appeals or any other pre-notification activity prior to notification to physicians and licensing boards. If the facility does manage to correct the deficiencies designated as substandard quality of care and have the correction substantiated by State or Federal surveyors before the notification, that notification should indicate that corrections have been made. However, the Act is clear that physicians and licensing boards are to be notified when the facility has provided substandard quality of care. Therefore, substandard quality of care provided before corrective action was taken, still must be reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters wanted to know how physicians will know when a facility, previously found to have provided substandard quality of care, has achieved compliance. Other commenters questioned whether physician and licensing board notifications are subject to an appeal by the facility, and if so, whether the results of the appeal will be communicated to the physicians and licensing board. These commenters also asked what becomes of this information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There is no statutory basis for notifying physicians more than once about a facility's compliance status. However, there is nothing to preclude facilities, physicians, or licensing boards from following up on this matter absent a statutory or regulatory requirement. Physicians are free to initiate inquiries into this matter, just as facilities are free to contact physicians and licensing boards about corrective action having occurred after the initial notification by the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

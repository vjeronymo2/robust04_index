			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 433] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, Feb 9, ELTA -- Presidential annual report  about the current situation in Lithuania and Lithuania's  internal and foreign policy was delivered to Seimas [parliament]  members. President is obligated to make the annual report by the  Constitution.    On February 10 President Brazauskas will present  commentaries  on the report. The draft agenda gives half an hour for  Brazauskas to speak. Then he will answer to the questions asked  by Saeimas members.    The presidential annual report consists of approximately 70  pages.    In the report Brazauskas notes that the current political  situation in Lithuania has become calmer after the period of  looking for enemies passed. The efficient work of Saeimas was  instrumental in stabilizing the political situation, although  some contradictions existing in the society is reflected in  Saeimas as well. Brazauskas expresses regret that parliamentary  competition among political parties often has destructive  results.    According to Brazauskas, one of the most important problems  is restructuring of the state apparatus. "What we need is not  many, but professional state officers", Brazauskas admits. This  must be achieved not by apealing to morals, but by adopting a  law on state officers.    Brazauskas suggests that the legal system should be reformed  as soon as possible because of the increasing crime rates. The  report includes statistics -- last year's crime rates increased  by 6.6 times as compared with 1992.    The report says that at present 14 thousand people are in  the  military service in Lithuania. Brazauskas notes that this  number must be the limit which should not be exceeded. Instead  the intellectual potential of the people in the military service  should be increased alongside with a better material supply.    Brazauskas considers the economic situation and says that  the  inflation decreased from 1163 percent in 1992 to 32 percent in  1993.    He expressed regret that investments into the Lithuanian  economy were rather small. Foreign investments did not add much  to the Lithuanian economy as well.    Until 1994 Lithuania received 430 million US dollars in  foreign loans. This year it must pay the interest rates which  will make 17 million dollars. But Brazauskas denied statements  of some economists that all the credits are used only for the  food purchase.    Brazauskas points out positive results in Lithuanian foreign  policy, the unity of the three Baltic States among them. A new  formula "three plus five" has been strengthening its position in  the foreign policy. This is cooperation between the three  Baltic and five Nordic countries.    The report notes that "rapprochement between Lithuania and  European Union would make positive influence on the life of  people". Thus, the agreement on free trade between Lithuania and  European Community is considered by Brazauskas as a priority in  Lithuanian foreign policy. He hopes that it will be signed in  the middle of this year and will come into force in 1995. In  the next stage of the relations with EC Lithuania should sign  the agreement on associated membership.    Brazauskas admits that at present a new page has been opened  in the history of the Lithuanian-Russian relations. However,  issues of the compensating the harm which was done during the  years of occupation will remain on the agenda of the  negotiations with Russia. Brazauskas suggests forming a special  group at the Foreign Ministry which will deal with the issues of  compensation. Brazauskas emphasizes that Lithuania objects to  giving a mandate by the United Nations for Russia according to  which Russia will be granted a right to maintain peace keeping  in the former USSR territories.</p>

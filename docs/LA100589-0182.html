			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE VET: GIVE YOUR CATS TIME TO FEEL AT HOME  </P> <P> Q. We share our home with three indoor/outdoor cats. They have easy access to  the house through a cat door. We are planning a move sometime in October and  are very concerned about how to move these cats and what to do with them once  we are in our new home. I'm afraid to let them go out in fear they may not find  our new home again. They are not accustomed to a litter box.-Madeline  Contract,Garden Grove  </P> <P> A. Moving pets to a new home will require some planning on your part to prepare  your cats for a big change in their lives. You should start to train them to a  litter box by confining them indoors more often, even if it means confining  them to a room where they are fed and a litter box is available. This way, they  will be ready for a limited indoor restriction when you get to your new home.  It may take one or two weeks of patience, but it will be worth it.  </P> <P> When you arrive in your new home, keep the cats indoors, maybe even restricted  mostly to a room with a box and their food. Allow them some time to explore  their new home without a lot of distraction. This way they will get used to the  new scents in the house and become familiar with where everything is located.  After they are accustomed to the new surroundings and all the local sounds, you  might let them outside in the back yard while you are present. Leave a door  open as an escape route back into the house. Go and do your yard work while  they are outside with you, letting them adapt. Once they feel comfortable, you  might try letting them go out by themselves, but leave an opening back into the  house. Soon they will feel just as comfortable as they did in their old home  and will give you no cause for concern. You might check with neighbors who have  pets to make sure that there are no local problems with pets being outside or  if there is a neighbor who objects to cats being in his yard. I'm sure they  will enjoy their new home.  </P> <P> You should talk to your veterinarian to see if sedatives will be necessary for  the move. It will depend on the type of transportation and the length of the  trip. Most cats settle down in a car once they have been on the road for an  hour or so. Do keep them in a carrier to prevent any accidental escapes.  </P></p>

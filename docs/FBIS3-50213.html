The protocol mentions the two parties' will to further the  process of democratization of the country and deepen the course  of the economic reform, secure social protection, strengthen  legality and public order, maintain the political and social  stability in the country, gradually enlarge the basis of  national consensus, as a requisite for the easing of the  tensions in today's Romanian society, further the efforts for  Romania's integration in the Euro-Atlantic space. Special  attention, the protocol reads, will be paid in this respect to  the development of the relations with the European communities,  the consolidation of Romania's position in the Council of  Europe, Romania's joining in the NATO as a strategic requisite  for its political-military security within the new political  architecture which is being built in Europe, the promotion of a  foreign policy in keeping with the Romanian people's national  interests, with its vocation as partner open to collaboration  and understanding with other peoples, the neighbouring ones  first of all.    The two parties stress the necessity that the future  government should be a political one, so that all its members,  starting with the prime minister, should be members of one of  the parties making up the government coalition. It is envisaged  in this respect to change the composition of the Nicolae  Vacaroiu government, by switching from the current format of the  government made up of members of the Party of Social Democracy  of Romania and independent experts, to the format of a bicolour  political government (PDSR and PUNR). To this end, the two  parties agree upon including in the Vacaroiu cabinet, by January  24, 1994, through government reshuffle, four PUNR  representatives, who will be given the following ministerial  portfolios: justice, agriculture, transport, communications.  The candidacies for these portfolios will be analyzed together  by the two parties' leaderships, with the participation of the  prime minister. The same procedure will be employed in the case  of possible changes with the portfolios of other ministries.    In view of furthering the process of democratization of the  institutions of the state of law and in compliance with the  Council of Europe's recommendations, the two parties agree that  the future ministers of national defence and the interior should  be civilian political personalities.</p>

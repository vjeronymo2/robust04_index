			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Bonds: SG Warburg leads quiet day with Pounds 125m offering In an otherwise quiet day in the Eurobond market, the S. G. Warburg group raised fresh capital in the sterling bond market with an issue of subordinated debt. The Pounds 125m offering of subordinated perpetual bonds pays a coupon of 9 per cent and is priced to yield 225 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017. The spread tightened to 220 basis points at the bid price towards the close. Market participants said most of the paper was likely to have been pre-placed by lead manager S. G. Warburg Securities. According to an official there, most of the bonds went to investors in the UK and the Channel Islands, although he also reported some continental buying. The slide in gilts, which fell by more than a point at the long end, sent traders scrambling to cover positions in recently issued paper. Jittery markets and the uncertain interest rate outlook may limit further issuance in the near term, traders said. In the D-Mark sector, Dresdner International Finance issued DM100m of so-called leveraged 10-year floating-rate notes. The notes pay a fixed coupon of 5 1/8 per cent for the first two years, and two times 6-month Libor minus 6.9 per cent for the third year. According to lead manager Dresdner Bank, the notes are structured so that their price rises as long-term interest rates rise. They are targeted at investors who expect German short- and long-term rates to rise, although investors are protected from near-term rate cuts by the two-year fixed-rate coupon. The structure is the mirror image of the so-called reverse floaters, which have gained popularity in the past few years. According to the lead manager, the leveraged floater effectively represented the 'synthetic short selling of an eight-year bond and is the result of a double long position in an FRN and a short position in a bond with a fixed coupon of 6.9 per cent'. It is a typical bear-market instrument, and is 'ideal as part of a portfolio of fixed income securities - it is a hedge instrument for fixed coupon bonds,' said the lead manager. The other structured D-Mark deal was a DM100m 10-year issue of floating fixed-rate notes for the World Bank via Mitsubishi Bank. The bonds pay a floating-rate coupon of 27 1/2 basis points above 6-month Libor for the first five years, and then a fixed coupon of 6 3/8 per cent. They are callable after five years. The lead manager said the bonds were placed with institutions in continental Europe and Japan. 'It's an odd view to take - most people expect rates to fall first and then to rise, so you have the worst of both worlds if you hold this paper,' said one trader. 'Mitsubishi Bank probably identified specific demand for this type of paper from an investor and tailored the deal around that,' he said. In the French franc sector, French carmaker Renault issued FFr2bn of 10-year bonds via Societe Generale. The bonds were priced to yield 56 basis points over the 5 1/2 per cent OAT due 2004 and closed at that spread. According to the lead manager, the bonds met good demand, mainly from French investors attracted by the yield pick-up.</p>

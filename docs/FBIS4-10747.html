			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Liz Mineo] </F>   [Text] The creation of the National System for the Control  and Repression of Drug Production and Drug Trafficking [Sistema  Nacional de Control y Represion de la Produccion y el Trafico  Ilicito de Drogas] is the most important contribution  encompassed in the national antidrug plan drafted by a  commission of experts at the government's request.    According to the draft, this new drug control system will  group all the many dispersed antidrug government actions which  need to be centralized and organized.    The new Peruvian Government antidrug policy organization  will  fulfill functions similar to the Office of National Drug Control  Policy, which drafts, centralizes, and implements the U.S.  Government's antidrug strategy under the leadership of Drug Czar  Lee Brown.    The influence of the U.S. model does not stop there, because  the National Drug Control and Drug Prevention Plan [Plan  Nacional de Prevencion y Control de Drogas] -- which is already  in President Alberto Fujimori's hands for study and approval --  is a Peruvian version of U.S. goals, objectives, plans, and  programs in this area.    The Peruvian program encompasses drug production and drug  trafficking; alternative development programs; and drug  prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation.    The plans call for the national system to be divided into  four subsystems, each of which will concentrate their efforts on  drug control and drug repression activities in the battle  against drugs; the deviation of chemical precursors and inputs;  the transfer of funds and laundered money; drug production and  drug trafficking; and the smuggling of arms and explosives.    These subsystems will be subordinated to the central  organization, which will be in charge of the planning,  coordinating, controlling, and information and decisionmaking  process of the antidrug efforts to be undertaken by the Peruvian  Government from 1994 to the year 2000.    In addition to creating this arm for the antidrug struggle,  the plan has 20 other objectives, among which are the  development of the alternative development program, the  monitoring of coca crops, the safeguarding of the environment,  and the development of research programs for the beneficial use  of coca.    The main objectives are centered on the gradual reduction of  coca crops, the repression of drug production and drug  trafficking, and decreased drug use.    By the year 2000 the goal of this ambitious project is to  incorporate through the alternative development programs at  least 50 percent of the peasant population currently involved in  coca production for illegal purposes in legal farming activities.    In addition to alternative development, the plan proposes a  strategy based on the establishment of legal and institutional  order.    According to the draft, during the 1994-2000 period the  promotion of the alternative development program will be granted  "top priority" with the objective of achieving the reduction of  coca crops used for illegal purposes.    The national antidrug plan, the first of its kind in our  country, was drafted by a multisectorial commission headed by  General Arnaldo Velarde Ramirez, Peruvian representative to the  OAS Inter-American Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug  Abuse (CICAD).    The commission was established in November, and is made up  of  representatives from government ministries, with support from  the United Nations International Drug Control Program [Programa  de las Naciones Unidas para la Fiscalizacion Internacional de  Drogas] (PNUFID) and prominent experts on the matter.</p>

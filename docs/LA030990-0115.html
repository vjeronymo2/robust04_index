			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 9 CHARGED WITH HAVING HOT AVOCADOS  </P> <P> You have to figure that any suspect charged with grand theft avocado is in deep  guacamole, especially if he's arrested in the biggest avocado bust in recent  California history.  </P> <P> And that's exactly what happened in Temecula on Wednesday night. Nine suspects  were arrested in an operation conducted by the Riverside County Sheriff's  Department that netted 11,000 pounds of the green fruit allegedly stolen from  nearby groves.  </P> <P> The suspects were charged with breaking California Penal Code 487, the grand  theft statute that covers agricultural products from algae to shellfish. If  convicted, the men could face jail sentences of up to a year.  </P> <P> "According to the information we have received, it's the biggest (bust) ever,"  said Avi Crane, director of industry affairs for the California Avocado  Commission. "It's really amazing. . . . These guys, wow, they were  sophisticated."  </P> <P> Particularly in seasons when the crop is small and prices are high, avocados  are the most commonly stolen agricultural product in California -- the state  that produces 90% of the nation's avocados. California's crop is valued at $200  million annually; theft is estimated at $10 million a year. The retail value of  the stolen goods recovered Wednesday was about $50,000.  </P> <P> Four sheriff's deputies found the hot Haas on Wednesday when they raided two  garages at a Temecula apartment building, said Deputy Sgt. Bill Walsh.  Authorities had received a tip that avocados were being illegally stored,  packed and shipped from the site.  </P> <P> Five days of surveillance and two search warrants later, deputies "swooped down  like Rodan" and raided the garages, Walsh said. What they found there was a  central processing site; it was the agricultural equivalent of narcotics  officers stumbling on a drug lab. "It looks like a majority of these thefts  were committed by people who work in certain groves," Walsh said. "They were  stealing from their employers and getting receipts from a packing house in  Fallbrook. We're not sure if they were stolen, forged or legitimate."  </P> <P> The receipts were important, said Bob Vice, president of the California Farm  Bureau Federation, because Penal Code 487 makes it illegal to haul more than 40  pounds of produce without a receipt, shipping permit or other proof of  ownership.  </P> <P> The thieves then allegedly packed the avocados in used boxes from legitimate  growers, like the Calavo Growers of California. The boxes were stamped with  California Food and Agriculture certification, so restaurants and markets  believed that they were buying the fruit legally, Walsh said.  </P> <P> "They'd head up towards Los Angeles and sell them from Los Angeles to San  Francisco," Walsh said. "These markets were under the impression that they were  buying legitimate fruit. They were making these guys a lot of money."  </P> <P> The avocados were taken from groves in the Rancho California area, west of  Temecula. On Wednesday night, it took three pickup trucks three hours to haul  the fruit to a refrigerated warehouse. Once it is photographed, the fruit will  be returned to its owners, a process that demands speed and sensitivity.  </P> <P> "We're going to have to return them very quickly," Walsh said. "They're ripe  and we can't dilly-dally. By the time this comes to trial, they'll be a  steaming compost heap."  </P> <P> So much for evidence.  </P></p>

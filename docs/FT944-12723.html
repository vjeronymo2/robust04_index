			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / World Bond Marekts: Moody's move puts spotlight on Sweden - Capital &amp; Credit The decision by Moody's Investors Service to place Sweden's Aa2 foreign currency debt rating on review for a possible downgrading is likely to weigh heavily on the bond market when it opens today. After rallying sharply last week, the rating agency's move, prompted by its concerns over the country's public-sector deficit, will force investors to focus once again on Sweden's debt situation, which has troubled the market most of the year, causing an exodus of foreign participants and the withdrawal of leading Swedish investors. After posting sharp gains during the 1993 bond market boom, Swedish bonds have suffered particularly this year, not only from the bear market that has depressed fixed-income markets worldwide, but also from problems at home: a growing budget deficit and political jitters surrounding general elections. Swedish bonds have been further dogged by inflationary fears and the spectre of monetary tightening after the Riksbank raised interest rates on August 11  -the first European rate increase in the current cycle. Last week, however, Sweden's bond market was the strongest performer worldwide; according to Salomon Brothers' world government bond index, Swedish government bonds returned 1.41 per cent in the week to Thursday, compared with a 0.35 per cent drop in the European bond index. Their yield spread over German bunds narrowed sharply to around 320 basis points on Friday from 357 points a week earlier. Bond prices were propelled higher last week by a range of factors: Monday's bullish bond auction result (with each tranche snapped up by a single buyer), currency strength, and increasing hopes that Sweden will vote in favour of joining the European Union in its referendum on November 13. The Riksbank's 20-basis-point hike in the repo rate to 7.40 per cent on Thursday further underpinned bonds because it was seen to boost the central bank's inflation-fighting credibility. Lastly, prices were boosted by calls from Mr Goran Persson, the finance minister, for larger than forecast government spending cuts: in addition to the SKr61bn of budget savings promised by the Social Democrats during the election campaign, he proposed further spending cuts of 20 per cent over the next four years. However, the Moody's rating review highlights the risks still surrounding Swedish bonds in the shape of the continuing accumulation of public-sector debt. 'Stronger economic growth, lower unemployment and additional fiscal restraint expected from the recently elected government suggest that budget deficits relative to GDP will shrink; nevertheless the build-up in public-sector debt will continue,' the agency warned. 'Moody's review will focus on the degree to which policies can be forged over the medium term to strengthen the public sector finances and improve the investment climate,' it stated. Some market participants were surprised by the timing of the announcement. 'I think Moody's may have acted a bit prematurely here, especially considering that the government hasn't yet presented the details of its economic plans and with the EU referendum coming up,' said Mr James McKay, international economist at Kidder Peabody. On the other hand, he said, Moody's announcement could be welcomed as a warning shot to the government, forcing it to place fiscal discipline at the top of its agenda. Mr Persson is due to unveil details of his fiscal plan on Wednesday. The EU referendum remains another significant risk. In spite of Finland's recent vote in favour of EU membership, the Swedish yea-sayers have held only a slim majority in recent opinion polls, amid a large pool of undecided voters. 'If the Swedes vote 'no', that could undermine the Social Democratic leadership,' warns one analyst, who says a 'no' vote could cause the Swedish yield spread over bunds to balloon back to more than 400 basis points. Even before the Moody's announcement, Mr Graham McDevitt, strategist at Paribas Capital Markets, was recommending switching out of Sweden ahead of the EU referendum. One strategy would be to move into Danish bonds, while more adventurous investors should consider a switch into Norway, which faces an EU referendum on November 28, he says. According to Mr McDevitt, Swedish bonds are moving to put bias on a 'yes' decision while Norwegian bonds have 70 per cent discounted a 'no' vote. 'If Sweden does vote for EU, Swedish bonds should rally but Norwegian bonds should out-perform on hopes that a 'yes' result may now be possible in Norway,' he says. 'If Sweden votes 'no', Swedish bonds would succumb to significant profit-taking from long positions built up over the past month; this would drag on Norwegian bonds, but better underlying fundamentals should limit the decline,' he adds.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $3.5-BILLION NUCLEAR CARRIER COMMISSIONED  </P> <P> The Navy commissioned a $3.5-billion nuclear aircraft carrier Saturday and  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the country must keep its military strong  despite the liberalization sweeping Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "We look forward to a Europe that is whole and free," Cheney said at  commissioning ceremonies at Norfolk Naval Station.  </P> <P> "NATO is a rock in that sea of change. This is not the time to reduce any of  our commitments," he said.  </P> <P> Speaking of the rapid change in East Germany -- where the government opened its  borders with the West last week -- and reforms in many other Warsaw Pact  nations, Cheney said those reforms were brought about by the United States'  military strength.  </P> <P> "We are seeing the fruits of our patience. But we know from history that the  Kremlin is capable of rapid shifts of intention," Cheney said. "It took five  years to build this carrier. Intentions can change overnight."  </P> <P> The 100,000-ton, 1,092-foot Abraham Lincoln, the Navy's heaviest warship, will  have a crew of 6,000.  </P></p>

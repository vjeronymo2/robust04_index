			<p>CSO     [Text] Blueprint for Post-Heisei Recession Period    When one era ends, the systems, customs, and ideas that  sustained the era shackle progress in the ensuing era.    A classic example is erstwhile macroeconomic policy. Postwar  Japan modernized the economy with the national objective of  catching up with Europe and the United States. Pursuit of that  objective involved adoption of fiscal and financial policies  which gave highest priority to the development and growth of  industry. Tax systems were designed with a variety of provisions  favoring businesses. Favorable treatment of savings unheard of  in other parts of the world were adopted to ensure the recycling  of family savings into the industrial sector.    Comprehensive implementation of macroeconomic policies of  this nature which favored industry resulted in spectacular  growth for Japan in a short period.    However, macroeconomic policies of the past, which  functioned  so well during the catch-up era, are no longer very effective  now that we have passed the catch-up era. And, there is more to  the problem. The former macroeconomic policies are creating a  series of problems that are bound to become obstacles to future  economic growth. Such problems are countless and include  accumulation of huge international balance-of-payments  surpluses, international economic friction, the lowest housing  standards of principal leading nations, and price levels which  are high when compared to other nations.  <H5>  Limitations of Erstwhile Macroeconomic Policies </H5>   Macroeconomic policies of the past were designed so as to  accumulate savings necessary for industrial growth. However,  continuation of economic growth led by exports has become  difficult and industrial capital demand has declined sharply,  while savings have increased and international  balance-of-payments surpluses have continued to accumulate.    If we are to learn from these lessons, it is obvious that  the  economic policy to be adopted by Japan in the post-Heisei  recession period should be a modification of the excessive  savings habits. The most unattractive aspect of Japan, which  supposedly built an affluent society, is its low housing  standards centered in urban areas. Especially urgent in our  nation which is about to usher in a senior citizen society is  the construction and expansion of residential capital stock.    From an international viewpoint, we must work expeditiously  to establish an economic system which will enable us to coexist  with the rest of the world. There is no way that Japan with a  15-percent share of the world's gross national product (GNP) can  survive by isolating itself from the rest of the world.    Aggressive deployment of a new macroeconomic policy which  corrects imbalances between savings and investment as an  alternative to earlier macroeconomic policies will guarantee  economic growth led by domestic demand and reduce international  balance-of-payments surpluses. Attainment of those results will  require special emphasis on the following three points on a mid-  and long-term basis:    First, we address reform of tax systems. The government Tax  Council is playing a central role in studying a plant to  decrease and increase taxes which combines an income tax cut and  consumption tax hike. I too believe that in the face of the  pending arrival of the senior citizen society, modification of  the direct and indirect taxing ratios should be effected in the  interests of stabilizing overall tax revenues. However, I am  opposed to any modification of direct and indirect taxing ratios  which calls for an "overall increase in taxes," as strongly  advocated by some quarters of the Ministry of Finance [MOF]. In  terms of modifying the direct and indirect tax ratio, it would  probably be acceptable to see a result that would produce  "neither an increase nor a decrease on an overall basis."  However, it is desirable that the ratios be modified so that the  result is an "overall decrease in taxes" in order to enhance the  soundness of our consumer markets which lack vitality. This  approach is presented with the idea that it will enhance the  expansion of domestic demand and lead to an improvement in the  savings-investment balance.    As an offset for deficiencies in tax revenues, we should  probably consider a further cut in fiscal spending and a boost  in tax revenues through comprehensive taxation of special income  categories such as interest income. Further, we must not lose  sight of the need to exert efforts at increased tax revenues  attained through economic growth by means of putting the economy  back on a stable growth track.    Second, we address a fundamental revision of the public  works  program. Already, the industrial infrastructure has been built  to a considerable extent in terms of roads, harbors, bridges,  and railways. Any uncontrolled expansion of public works  spending based on past categories could lead to a waste of  resources.    On the other hand, there has been a major expansion in the  investment needs for construction and expansion of new social  capital required in Japan for the future. For example, as  mentioned in previous installments of this editorial series  titled "Blueprint for Post-Heisei Recession Period," they  include constructing a next-generation information-communication  infrastructure, organizing transportation systems incorporating  needs of the senior citizen society, building medical and  nursing systems, establishing a worldwide environmental  protection infrastructure, and developing advanced technology  and equipment and systems for pollution measures. Use of current  categories of public works programs would preclude effective  fulfillment of these new kinds of needs.    The two major classifications of national construction bonds  and national deficit bonds are no longer compatible with current  conditions for issuance of national debt instruments. It is  difficult to place research and development funds used for basic  research which is significantly tied to the future Japanese  economy under the two categoies of bonds used in the past. We  should actively invest public funds in the public sector for  social needs even if they do not result in the building of  tangible assets such as roads and bridges.  <H5>  Let Us Make Housing With 100-Year Lifespans </H5>   Third, we address implementation of bold, preferential  policies for residential investments.    Housing built in Japan in the past was of a meager quality  which barely exceeded the definition of durable consumer goods.  Quality of housing was affected by the high cost of residential  construction, including the cost of land and the government's  housing policy which emphasized the idea that "housing was  acceptable as long as it was habitable." Such a policy was  tolerable when Japan was a poor nation.    However, in the future there is a need to supply durable  homes which will last about 100 years. Such homes will lead to  the creation of comfortable, high-quality residential  environments. It would be desirable to attain that goal by  stimulating investments in homes by emulating the method used by  the United States in encouraging housing construction after  World War II by exempting from taxes the income used for  interest charges on home loans.    The foremost obstacle which can be visualized in  implementing  macroeconomic policies which emphasize the correction of  imbalances between savings and investments will probably be past  forms of bureaucratic systems and bureaucratic concepts. Strong  political leadership will be indispensable in overcoming such  barriers. Having said that, it must be obvious as to the  direction of economic policy to be assumed by the new Hata  government, the second cabinet following abandonment of the  "1955 political system."</p>

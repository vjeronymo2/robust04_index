			<p>BFN     [Text] Nihad al-'Umari, wife of former Libyan Foreign  Minister Mansur al-Kikhya left for the Libyan capital of Tripoli  this morning after receiving an invitation from Colonel Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi following her repeated appeals to locate her  missing husband.    Our correspondent in Paris, Rula al-Zayn, met al-'Umari and  had this conversation with her before she left for the Libyan  capital.    [Begin recording] [Al-'Umari] Two weeks ago, I received and  accepted an invitation after talking to the French lawyer Michel  Juber, who advised me to accept the invitation. Mr.  al-Qadhdhafi will do his best, he promised me in his recent  letters, to look for my husband, who is a Libyan citizen.    [Al-Zayn] Have the Egyptian authorities answered your  questions on the circumstances of the abduction?    [Al-'Umari] The Egyptian authorities initially acknowledged  that Mansur was abducted, which is a known fact because he was  attending an official conference. Afterward, they never talked  about the incident. On the contrary, President Mubarak tried,  as they say, to absolve himself of responsibility. From the  legal point of view, since he was abducted from Cairo, Egypt is  the prime responsible party to me and to the world.    I wrote to ministers and French President Mitterrand and  received a reply from Foreign minister Alain Juppe. A week ago,  I received another message from Alain Juppe and President  Clinton. In his message, President Clinton told me that they  will not fail to pressure Egypt to discover the obscure facts.  [end recording]</p>

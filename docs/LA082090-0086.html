			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT: SSI'S HEDGING WORKS  </P> <P> Statistical Sciences Inc. has preached its novel stock market hedge strategy  for 17 years. But nothing makes the word "hedge" sound so interesting as a bear  market -- such as the one Wall Street appears to be in.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills-based SSI, founded by John D. Gottfurcht in 1973, manages $260  million for about 60 clients, including Pepperdine University and Hawaiian  Airlines. The firm is little-known in L.A. money circles, yet Gottfurcht and  his staff of 20 claim an enviable investing record:  </P> <P> * SSI's basic stock-picking plan, called Profits Plus, beat the Standard &amp;  Poor's 500-stock index in seven of 10 years in the 1980s, SSI says.  </P> <P> * Profits Plus 70, a conservative stock plan that on average invests 70% of a  client's money in stocks and 30% in cash investments, beat a similar  S&amp;P/cash portfolio in eight of the past 10 years.  </P> <P> * The SSI Hedge plan, a stock program designed for ultraconservative investors  who would otherwise stick with short-term Treasury bills or other safe havens,  has beaten Treasury bill returns six of the past 10 years.  </P> <P> It's the Hedge plan that sets SSI apart from most money managers. Traditional  hedge programs try to protect stock portfolios from sharp market declines by  using futures or index options contracts. Those instruments are sold at a  locked-in price while the stocks are bought. So, in theory, the portfolio is  hedged if the stocks plunge.  </P> <P> SSI hedges in a different way. Each time it buys a stock that it believes is  poised to advance, it also "sells-short" the weakest-looking stock in the same  industry.  </P> <P> In a short sale, you borrow stock and sell it, betting that you can replace the  loaned shares later at a lower price. If the stock indeed drops, your profit is  the difference between the price you got in the sale and what you pay to  purchase the stock later to cover the loan. If the stock rises, you lose.  </P> <P> Short-selling has a foul reputation, mostly because some short-selling pros  have used nasty tactics -- such as spreading lies about a firm -- to make their  shorted stocks drop.  </P> <P> So, not surprisingly, SSI has faced a major marketing job in pitching its Hedge  program to some big investors -- particularly pension funds, which are subject  to close public scrutiny.  </P> <P> Yet, John Gottfurcht says, SSI is the antithesis of the traditional gunslinging  short trader. SSI uses short sales solely as a means to a conservative end -- a  hedge -- rather than as a speculative tool for big gains, he says.  </P> <P> For example, to balance a "long" position in Procter &amp; Gamble, the Hedge  portfolio has shorted Clorox. If consumer stocks in general zoom, SSI figures  that P&amp;G will lead -- which it did in the spring bull market. If those  stocks plunge, SSI figures, Clorox looks weakest. Hence, the hedge.  </P> <P> Likewise, the Hedge plan has a long position in Texaco and a short position in  Ashland Oil. That has worked well, as the stock of oil producers such as Texaco  has jumped with higher oil prices, while stock of refiners such as Ashland has  been pummeled.  </P> <P> "The idea we had in 1973 was to develop a strategy where we could do well in  all different types of market environments," Gottfurcht said. The Hedge plan  isn't aimed at aggressive investors, he said, but at investors who want  controlled risk and consistency of return -- but something better than what  T-bills pay.  </P> <P> In the current market slump, SSI's hedge portfolio is a standout. Year to date,  it's up 9%, the firm says. In contrast, an investor who stayed in T-bills has  earned about 5%. Meanwhile, the market, measured by the S&amp;P 500, is down  5.7%.  </P> <P> It's also a forgone conclusion, Gottfurcht notes, that a portfolio hedged with  short sales will under-perform the market when the vast majority of stocks are  rising.  </P> <P> That's why hedging was such a tough sell in the 1980s, when the bull market  raged, said Amy Jo Gottfurcht, who as SSI's executive vice president has built  the company with husband John since 1982. "In the 1970s nobody understood  hedging, and in the 1980s nobody wanted it," she said. But in the '90s, she  said, the return to careful stock picking bodes well for hedging -- because  careful stock analysis will identify many probable losers as well as probable  winners.  </P> <P> And in fact, short-sale techniques are finally gaining acceptance among a  growing number of pension funds and other big investors. Pensions &amp;  Investment Age magazine reported in April that big investors had pumped about  $950 million into short-sale strategies during the previous year -- an amount  unheard-of in the 1980s.  </P> <P> Yet many pension funds, in particular, face barriers to short-sale investing,  and even those that use the strategy generally refuse to discuss it. Imagine,  for example, a pension fund shorting the stock of the company whose employees  are the pension beneficiaries. That might be difficult for many of the  employees to accept, even if they thought it was a smart investment move.  </P> <P> Even if SSI faces a tough challenge selling the Hedge program, its  stock-picking ability under its Profits Plus plans could win the firm greater  recognition in the '90s. So far this year, the Profits Plus portfolio is down  just 1%, versus the market's 5.7% loss, and Profits Plus 70 is up 0.5%.  </P> <P> With a strong long-term record, why isn't SSI managing a lot more than $260  million? Besides the difficulty in marketing the Hedge plan, Gottfurcht  maintains that SSI has in general spent little time prospecting. Many clients  have come as referrals from others. And some rival money managers say the  Gottfurchts simply don't sell their message well.  </P> <P> SSI's strategy is computer-driven, which John Gottfurcht says was his  orientation from the start. The firm uses a wealth of historical data on market  trends and individual stock trends to guide its market timing and stock  decisions.  </P> <P> The basic question is the same that any investor asks: How do I buy low and  sell high? SSI breaks the question down into individual stock price building  blocks, such as price-to-earnings ratio trends and corporate asset values.  </P> <P> In addition, SSI focuses heavily on money-flow trends, identifying patterns  that indicate when a stock is building up to heavy buying -- or selling -- by  institutions.  </P> <P> Amy Jo Gottfurcht, who manages the computer operations, says a key to SSI's  success is constant experimentation with historical data to determine "what  events make a difference with a stock and what events are redundant" compared  to what SSI already knows.  </P> <P> In late June, the company's computer model turned negative enough to warrant a  pullback from stocks, which has helped minimize the damage to SSI's portfolios  compared to the market.  </P> <P> For now, SSI is a firm for big investors only (its minimum is $250,000). John  Gottfurcht says a pooled investment fund for smaller investors has been  discussed.  </P> <P> As for SSI's unheralded status in the Southland, Gottfurcht says he has no  regrets spending more time on computer models than on marketing. "If our  strategy weren't so complex, a lot of other people would have been doing the  same thing," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SSI'S LONG-TERM RECORD  </P> <P> Here is how two conservative investment plans of the money management firm  Statistical Sciences Inc. have fared since 1980, compared to benchmark  conservative measures. The Hedge plan is aimed at investors who want consistent  performance and controlled risk. The Profits Plus 70 plan is for investors who  aim for 70% of their portfolio in stocks and the other 30% in cash investments,  on average.  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.89IN:1.67IN:1.89IN:1.89IN:2.00IN"

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / BT steps up redundancy plans: 33,000 jobs to go this year First quarter profits fall 27.8% ONE OF British industry's largest redundancy programmes was stepped up sharply yesterday when BT said it would shed more than 33,000 jobs this year. About 19,000 staff will leave on Friday. A further 15,000 jobs a year may be shed over the next three to four years as BT continues to slim down its organisation through targeted voluntary schemes. The news came as BT announced a 27.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the first quarter to June 30. The company's total workforce could be reduced from 210,200 at the start of this financial year to 120,000 by 1996. Expected job losses this year are well above figures originally announced by BT. It had been expected that 24,000 jobs would be shed - 20,000 through voluntary redundancies and 4,000 through natural wastage. These figures have now been increased by 9,000 as BT was inundated with applications to leave. About 20,000 employees are being refused the generous redundancy package because of oversubscription. Unions have complained that many members were misled into thinking they would be able to take voluntary redundancy, only to be turned down. BT said yesterday it had 'had the opportunity to rethink budgets' and would now be able to offer more voluntary redundancies. The package, Release 92, provides for payments as high as Pounds 100,000 plus pension entitlement, although the average sum is likely to be about Pounds 30,000. At least three months' guaranteed work through an employment agency, plus Pounds 1,000 in training vouchers, are also being offered. The 19,000 staff leaving on Friday will qualify for a bonus payment of 25 per cent of salary. The main BT union, the National Communications Union, described the package as 'one of the best in the UK'. It warned BT 'not to underestimate the depth of resentment felt by those who were assured by management that they would be released and who were later refused'. The Union of Communication Workers, which represents BT operators, said the scale of the redundancy programme had artificially deflated profits.

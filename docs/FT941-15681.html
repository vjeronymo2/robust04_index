			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Chemical stocks unsettled Leading chemical companies BOC and ICI were hit by changes of stance from sec-urities houses which exacerbated the pressure of a sliding market. Industrial gases group BOC dropped 21 1/2 to 638 1/2 p on turnover of 6.8m shares after Hoare Govett, a long-term bull, turned seller of the stock and lowered its current year profits forecast to Pounds 295m from Pounds 340m, well below the present range of analysts' estimates. Hoare's Mr Martin Evans said: 'The industrial gases side will be hit as low inflation inhibits price rises, and we expect a poor performance from the health care side.' However, Smith New Court's Mr Philip Morrish said yesterday's share price move was 'unwarranted' and he reiterated his buy stance. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs advised clients to take profits on stock of ICI, arguing that the share price could comfortably decline to 700p, although the company's fundamentals were sound. ICI shares retreated 23 to 773p with 5.8m traded.</p>

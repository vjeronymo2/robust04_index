			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A HIGHLY nervous session in derivatives yesterday mirrored the uncertainty in underlying equities, reports Terry Byland. Trading volumes were unimpressive, especially in stock index futures, and prices tended to move erratically in response to activity in government securities after when-issued trading started in the bonds scheduled for auction. The December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index fared a little better than the underlying market, holding on to the 3,000 mark even at the day's low, which came early in the session. A rally set in on the announcement of the official data on domestic trade and GDP, and the contract advanced to 3,026, a premium of about 4 on fair value of 24. Only 8,929 contracts were done, however. The final reading of 3,023 showed December effectively in line with fair value. Traders said that several UK based securities houses had successfully arbitraged against equities, buying the future and selling stocks. Traded options recorded 23,186 contracts, against 19,509 previously, but the FT-SE 100 option saw only 9,864, compared with 9,141 on Monday. The Euro FT-SE option headed the actives list but with only 2,047 lots transacted. Also busy was the Tarmac option, turning over 1,781 as the market took a generally cautious view of the trading results and of the rights issue call which accompanied them.</p>

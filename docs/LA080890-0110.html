			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAY ANDERSON: HE'S THE WILD MAN OF THE TROMBONE;  </P> <P> JAZZ: THE MUSICIAN, WHO PLAYS AND SINGS OUTRAGEOUSLY, IS ON HIS FIRST VISIT TO  THE SOUTHLAND AS A LEADER OF A BAND.  </P> <P> Ray Anderson is the most talked-about performer in a sparsely populated field.  His apparent aim is to play the trombone higher, lower and wilder than anyone  else, and to bring together the past, present and future of the horn in one  fell swoop. For his efforts he has earned critical praise and has won the last  four Down Beat polls.  </P> <P> At 38, the Chicago-born Anderson has worked on avant-garde gigs with Henry  Threadgill, led a jazz/rock/fusion band called the Slickaphonics that enjoyed  success in Europe, played rhythm-and-blues and Latin dates around New York, and  more recently has led an all-purpose quartet that has recorded for Gramavision.  </P> <P> If his playing is outrageous, he has a personality to match it. When he speaks,  he is Harry Belafonte crossed with the Godfather. When he sings, he is apt to  break out into multiphonic effects that suggest two Louis Armstrongs. His tall,  gangling visual image has reminded some observers of a 1940s-style hipster.  </P> <P> Currently on his first visit to the Southland as a leader, he played Monday and  Tuesday at Elario's in La Jolla; tonight he will be at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill  in Hollywood and Thursday at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Ave. Bar.  </P> <P> Anderson's bizarre technique both vocally and on the horn would seem to have  been self-taught. "I was the lead vocalist with the Slickaphonics," he recalls,  "and I developed this strange double sound. A singing coach told me my vocal  cords were vibrating to produce one note while the skin outside the larynx  vibrated to produce a second. She said it was an incorrect technique, and I  should never do it again." He has been using it, of course, ever since.  </P> <P> Like so many American jazz artists, Anderson has enjoyed more success abroad  than at home. He's been the subject of many feature stories in European jazz  magazines. Japan, typically, has put out the welcome mat. "I've been there a  half-dozen times, with various people, and just got back from there this  weekend."  </P> <P> He is not entirely a prophet without domestic honor. True, his Slickaphonic  sessions were made for European consumption; most were unreleased here.  However, his more recent albums for Enja and currently for Gramavision have  been earning five-star ratings, and he has accumulated a pile of laudatory  clippings hailing his appearances at New York's Village Vangarde.  </P> <P> His best-known album, "What Because," showcased him with what was then his  regular touring band. At present he has to assemble a group when enough work  opportunities arise. "There just aren't enough jobs for me to hold a band  together. I look forward to the time when I won't have to rehearse a new  personnel for every few gigs. But I'm happy with the people I have right now."  (Pianist Amina Claudine Myers is a recording artist for RCA, bassist Mark  Helias also has recorded as a leader, and drummer Dion Parsons on drums  completes the quartet.)  </P> <P> Although the appearance went by almost unnoticed, he was at Catalina's a couple  of years ago as a sideman with the International Orchestra led by the Swiss  composer George Gruntz. Playing in a brass section, however, is his idea of  nothing to do: "You just sit there a whole evening and get to play one solo. It  might be fun to have a big band of my own someday, but what I'm doing right now  is what I really want to do -- be in charge and play what I like."  </P> <P> Proving his point, Anderson then took to the bandstand and, after a few  explosive warm-up noises, went into a long series of uproarious cadenzas,  growling and trilling, reaching for notes beyond the blue horizon, plunging to  the depths, and then, after a premonitory vamp, easing his group into a buoyant  chorus of a mainstream standard, Duke Ellington's "In a Mellotone." The  Anderson phenomenon was off and cooking.  </P></p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Cellular phones help Motorola jump 50% Worldwide demand for cellular telephones helped to boost Motorola's sales and earnings to record levels for the third quarter and year to date. The US communications, electronics and semiconductor group lifted third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 380m, up almost 50 per cent from Dollars 254m. Earnings per share jumped to 65 cents from 44 cents. Revenues rose 28 per cent to Dollars 5.7bn from Dollars 4.4bn in the same period last year. Motorola's largest businesses - wireless communications and semiconductors - saw revenues grow strongly. Sales of cellular telephone equipment advanced 63 per cent to Dollars 2.2bn. The number of cellular telephone service subscribers worldwide grew to nearly 50m, an increase of about 50 per cent from the end of 1993. Motorola was awarded contracts during the third quarter for digital cellular systems to be built in Moscow, Hong Kong and Nigeria. Contracts for analog cellular systems came from the Philippines and several countries in Africa. Other parts of Motorola's wireless communications business - including two-way radios, pagers and wireless data communications for mobile computer users - together accounted for Dollars 1.5bn in revenues, up 23 per cent on the same period last year. Semiconductor sales rose 18 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn, continuing an uninterrupted record of more than five years' growth. The company's largest chip customers are the automotive and communications industries. In a push to increase its presence in the computer industry, both as a chip supplier and a systems manufacturer, Motorola is collaborating with IBM and Apple Computer on the development of PowerPC microprocessor chips. Last week Motorola launched a range of computers based on PowerPC to be sold through third parties. In the third quarter, however, its computer sales rose only 2 per cent and orders were flat. Revenues for this segment were not reported separately. For the first nine months Motorola's sales reached Dollars 15.8bn, up 32 per cent from Dollars 12bn a year ago. Net earnings were Dollars 1.05bn, or Dollars 1.79 a share, compared with Dollars 682m, or Dollars 1.20. The 1993 per-share figures were restated for a 2-for-1 stock split in April.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Taken out of service: How BR's privatisation will affect its pension plans The politics of privatising British Rail are fraught enough as it is. But the implications for British Rail pensioners are turning out to be almost as big an irritant for ministers and officials as the restructuring of the rail system. Controversial proposals advanced by the government in January have prompted a host of anxious retired rail folk to make full use of a commodity with which they are richly endowed - time - to deluge the Department of Transport with letters and phone calls. The result is that a chastened government is preparing to beat a rapid retreat in the face of pensioner power. The government's problem is that the railways are being privatised piecemeal. A single employer will be replaced by several employers ranging from the manager of the track-owning company, Railtrack, to the holders of franchises to run passenger services. With more than 200,000 pensioners and deferred pensioners in the British Rail pension schemes, far outnumbering existing employees, it would be difficult to allocate pensioners to the successor companies after privatisation. Existing BR employees have been promised pension benefits in a joint industry scheme that will be no less favourable than the present arrangements. This looks reasonable enough, although it remains to be seen whether other rights such as representation on trustee boards turn out to be comparable. But the deal offered to pensioners is more controversial. The government has offered two options. The first involves putting money into a closed scheme, where pensioners would be dependent for security on future investment performance. There would be no government undertaking to provide a continuing guarantee of either the fund's solvency or the index-linking of benefits. The second option would, in effect, involve the nationalisation of the pensioners' money. The government would agree to pay the same benefits promised in the existing rules, rising in line with the retail price index. Further improvements in pension benefits would be ruled out. Because the government would be taking on a commitment to pay pensions in exchange for acquiring the scheme's assets, the Treasury would then have to dispose of Pounds 8.5bn of mainly equity-type investments. This would be helpful in funding a soaring public-sector borrowing requirement since it would take pressure off the gilt market. But once the marketable equities had been sold, it would leave a headache for the hapless officials required to manage a rump of less liquid investments, ranging from great tracts of Aberdeenshire to office blocks in the capital. Neither of the two options is very palatable for the pensioners, most of whom receive very modest weekly sums from their fund. In a closed fund with no new cash flow, trustees would be obliged to run a low-risk, low-return investment policy. That is dismal news, especially for older beneficiaries on low pensions, for whom recent high investment returns have been a boon. Not only would their hopes of any uplift in benefits in future be dashed; they would also lose the security they enjoy in the present scheme. Under option two, they would enjoy full, inflation-proof security, but no uplift in benefits arising from good investment performance. On the face of it, the pensioners would be short-changed, since at present most of them enjoy both index-linking and the fruits of good investment performance. The government has nonetheless argued that the index-linking in the main BR scheme is not cast-iron. A clause in the trust deeds allows BR to wind up and distribute the funds if they fall into deficit. Yet the circumstances in which this would happen are almost impossible to conceive. The BR schemes are not like private-sector pension funds in which the employer guarantees to meet the balance of the cost of pensions after employees have made a fixed contribution. BR and the employees share an agreed proportion of the cost of meeting the level of benefits specified in the rules. As long as BR's continuing monopoly was not in question, contributions could have been adjusted on actuarial advice to ensure that deficits were only transitory. So the winding-up clause was academic and the index-linking secure. Officials now privately concede that the two options proposed in January are dead in their existing form. The question is whether they can be turned into something more promising. On the index-linked formula, some consideration has been given to offering an alternative to the RPI. But a link to earnings would be politically difficult after the state scheme's move from earnings-related pensions to the less costly RPI. And a notional link to the performance of the joint industry fund would raise questions about how the government would provide security for pensions. An alternative approach now being actively pursued is to find a way of putting the pensioners into the joint industry fund alongside members still in employment. But to do this, the actuaries would have to overcome an uncomfortable demographic fact: 40 per cent of the members who are still in employment would be supporting 60 per cent who are existing and deferred pensioners. The Inland Revenue would also have to be satisfied that there were no cross-subsidies between the various employers before granting its approval. And the government would probably have to offer some kind of security guarantee. This it would be reluctant to do without retaining a right to interfere in order to protect the taxpayers' interests. At this stage it looks like an intellectual and political minefield. But ministers still have one possible card up their sleeves. An actuarial valuation of the fund is due on April 1 and the results will be known by autumn. They are expected to show a much diminished surplus. If that causes militant pensioners to conclude that, even without privatisation, uplifts in benefits in the existing fund would have been much rarer in the 1990s than in the 1980s, they could be more open to the government's ideas when they emerge. But at this stage all that is certain is that the saga will run and run.</p>

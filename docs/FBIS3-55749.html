Sources from among the Ukrainian presidential staff told  ITAR- TASS Clinton's stop-over will last for about two  and-a-half hours.    The American and Ukrainian presidents are expected to  discuss  bilateral relations, military political problems and  international security.    After the talks, President Clinton will board Air Force One  en route to Moscow. President Leonid Kravchuk will join his and  President Yeltsin in the Kremlin on January 14 for a trilateral  summit which is expected to culminate in the signing of  documents, which will ease tension in relations of the three  countries.</p>

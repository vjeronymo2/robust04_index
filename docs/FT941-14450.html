			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Tesco reins in expansion plans Tesco yesterday bowed to growing pressures in the grocery market and said it was cutting its store opening programme, building smaller and cheaper stores, and taking Pounds 153m charges on writing down land and buildings. The statement by Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco chairman and one of the leaders of the grocers' dash from the high street, effectively ended an era of unbridled superstore expansion, backed by ever increasing profit margins. 'In my 10 years covering the sector, this is quite a historic day,' said one analyst. The UK's second largest grocery group admitted that increasing price competition from discounters such as Aldi and Netto, coupled with the number of superstores battling for customers, made it more difficult to make adequate returns on new stores. 'Saturation of the market has been with us for some time, and what you are seeing now is just a continuation of that,' said Mr David Reid, finance director. 'Margins were going up between half and one (percentage) point a year, but now they've fallen,' he added. 'This is a numbers game and the numbers have changed.' He said Tesco's gross margin had first fallen as a result of its own pricing initiatives, including introducing its Tesco Value range of low-priced goods, and been trimmed further as the company responded to price cutting by rivals Kwik Save and J Sainsbury. Analysts estimate industry gross margins have fallen between 0.5 and 0.7 points. In response, Tesco is changing its strategy and accounting policies. It is following Argyll, the UK's number three, in depreciating its stores by 4 per cent a year, leading to a Pounds 36m charge this year. It is also amortising its land premiums - the difference between the price it paid and alternative use value - at 2.5 per cent a year, with a Pounds 32m impact on profits. Finally, it is making a one-off write-down of Pounds 85m on land it has decided to sell instead of using for new stores. Tesco is cutting back its capital spending from Pounds 750m this year to between Pounds 450m and Pounds 500m in 1996-97. It will build fewer large superstores, and more city-centre Metro stores and 'compact' superstores in market towns and city suburbs. It is also investigating new formats. The company unveiled an 11 per cent increase in total sales for the 20 weeks to January 1, and a like-for-like increase of 4.5 per cent - its best performance for some time. Sir Ian said this reflected improvements to stores which had increased customer loyalty and spending, as well as the launch of Tesco Value. 'There is no point in customers' going to an Aldi or a Netto when they can buy the basics as cheaply at Tesco, as well as all the other things Tesco sells,' he said.

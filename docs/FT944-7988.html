			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Ciba/Chiron Ciba yesterday insisted its deal with Chiron was good for both groups. Chiron and its shareholders would not disagree. Financially, the move gives Chiron access to Ciba's capital backing. That means Chiron will be able to fund its best drugs without being as concerned about quarterly earnings results. Industrially, there is an undoubted fit between the companies' operations, while Ciba can also provide development and marketing expertise. The danger of a cultural clash between stilted Swiss management and Californian working practices has been reduced by Ciba's efforts to alleviate such problems. Strategically, the deal also makes sense for Ciba. The management concluded the best hope for its pharmaceuticals business was innovation and the best route to innovation was through the biotechnology revolution. Chiron, the biotech group with the largest drugs portfolio in development, will provide Ciba more than adequate access to that revolution. Doubts about the deal centre on the high premium paid. Ciba has plenty of cash, but claims the purchase is earnings enhancing are at best disingenuous. Ciba, normally proud of its probity in applying accounting standards, has decided not to run Dollars 1.3bn of goodwill through the profit and loss account. Whether the deal makes financial sense depends on Chiron's future earnings growth, a subject about which there is little consensus in the market. However, the potentially extravagant price paid should not tarnish Ciba's strategic boldness.</p>

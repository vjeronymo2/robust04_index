The meeting, sponsored by the  CPC Central Committee Organization Department [CPCCCOD], focused  on how to explore new ways to improve organizational work  through investigation and study under the conditions of  developing a socialist market economy. CPCCCOD Director Lu Feng  and Deputy Director Zhao Zongnai spoke at the meeting.  Principal leading comrades of Jiangsu Province, the Wuxi Party  Committee, and the Wuxi Government attended the meeting.    As reform is deepening in all fields of endeavor, and as a  socialist market economic system is being gradually established,  a large number of new situations and problems have arisen in  organizational work. Appropriate measures desperately need to  be adopted through investigations and studies so as to further  usher in a new situation of organizational work and to provide  organizational guarantees for the establishment of a socialist  market economic system as well as for reform, development, and  stability. To this end, the CPCCCOD convoked the meeting to  specially study how to further improve organization departments'  investigations and studies as well as their macroeconomic  guidance.    At the meeting, Comrade Lu Feng delivered a speech on how to  energetically encourage the practice of conducting  investigations and studies, how to provide better macroeconomic  guidance, and how to practically improve organizational work  under the new situation. First, he pointed out: Organization  departments at all levels must have a clear understanding of the  situation; must familiarize themselves with the overall  situation of the work of the entire party; must proceed from the  overall situation of the work to consider how to improve  organizational work; and must deepen reform of the  organizational and cadre systems through further emancipation of  their minds and changes of their concepts. Energetically  increasing efforts to conduct investigations and studies and to  provide better macroeconomic guidance by organization  departments at all levels is a fundamental measure for the  improvement of organizational work as well as a basic method for  the improvement of work style and for the enhancement of the  level of organizational work.    Lu Feng stressed: While conducting investigations and  studies, and while endeavoring to provide better macroeconomic  guidance, organization departments must always firmly bear in  mind the theme of strengthening and improving party building as  well as party leadership. They must succeed in integrating the  emancipation of the mind by seeking truth from facts under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics; must discuss and handle important  affairs by taking into consideration the overall situation; must  spend time on gaining an in-depth understanding of the real  situation so as to familiarize themselves with the situation,  find out exactly where the problems exist, and come up with  practical measures for improvement; must display initiativeness  and creativeness; and must pay attention to grasping a few  conspicuous problems and dealing with them until they are solved  so as to create new experiences. Leading comrades of  organization departments at all levels must take the lead in  conducting investigations and studies so as to gain the  initiative in carrying out their work.    Lu Feng urged comrades of organization departments to have a  strong sense of responsibility and a strong sense of having  undertaken a mission; to boldly explore, work industriously,  increase efforts to conduct investigations and studies, and  provide better economic guidance; and to usher in a new  situation of organizational work.    At the meeting, Zhao Zongnai delivered a speech entitled  "Study New Situations and Solve New Problems With the Spirit of  Reform in Order To Provide Organizational Guarantees for the  Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System." He  pointed out: An important historical mission of our  organizational work is to provide organizational guarantees for  the establishment of a socialist market economic system. If the  organization front wants to shoulder this historical mission and  continuously usher in new situations, it must make efforts in  many areas. A very important one among them is to increase  efforts to conduct investigations and studies as well as to  provide better macroeconomic guidance. He urged organization  departments at all levels to energetically encourage the  practice of conducting investigations and studies; to integrate  such investigations and studies with the establishment of rules  and regulations; and to turn the achievements scored from  conducting investigations and studies into measures, methods,  rules, and regulations for reform.    At the meeting, 10 provinces and municipalities--including  Shanghai, Beijing, Jiangsu, and Shandong--gave briefings on  their experiences in conducting investigations and studies; they  also conducted extensive exchanges at group meetings. As a  result, comrades attending the meeting gained a further  understanding of the necessity and importance for organization  fronts to increase efforts to conduct investigations and studies  and to provide better macroeconomic guidance; they also decided  on the tasks for their respective studies with full confidence.    Among those who participated in the meeting were comrades in  charge of organization departments of the party committees of  all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly  under the central government across the country; directors of  research offices under the party committees mentioned above;  comrades in charge of or research office directors of  organization departments of party committees of 10 cities; and  comrades in charge of the organization, personnel, or research  departments of the State Planning Commission, the State Economic  Restructuring Commission, the State Economic and Trade  Commission, the Ministry of Personnel, and the All-China  Federation of Trade Unions.</p>

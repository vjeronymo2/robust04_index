			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAG DEFACEMENT  </P> <P> Your article on the May Day parade in Red Square ("Thousands Jeer Moscow  Leaders," front page, May 2) provided renewed hope that the Russian people will  be able to win meaningful freedom of speech. One part of the report, however,  was astounding.  </P> <P> Your reporter wrote: "One Soviet marcher also carried a Soviet flag with the  hammer and sickle cut out as a symbol of his repudiation of Soviet rule."  Apparently this marcher was not arrested. Yet, if he came to this country and  wanted to protest, and he burned an American flag as his symbolic expression of  something, our Congress and President would like to see to it that he is  punished.  </P> <P> Doesn't this article rather dramatically show that defacement of national flags  is symbolic expression? We applaud the Soviet marcher because he is saying  something, symbolically, of which we approve. However, we seem to dislike  burning of the American flag because we don't like what the protester is  saying, symbolically.  </P> <P> Thus, it is clear that our new anti-flag burning law is attempting to control  the content of symbolic expression. If Congress passes and the states ratify a  constitutional amendment allowing the state and federal governments to outlaw  defacement of our flag, then in at least one area of symbolic speech the  Russian people will have greater rights than we. Is this what we want?  </P> <P> SCOTT J. TEPPER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

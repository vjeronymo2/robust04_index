			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Peru set to quit human rights treaty PERU took the first steps yesterday towards withdrawing from the San Jose Convention, the principal treaty governing human rights in Latin America. The move is designed to pave the way for introduction of the death penalty for convicted terrorists, a sanction prohibited by the convention. Mr Oscar de la Puente Raygada, the prime minister and foreign affairs minister, said Peru 'is confronting an exceptional situation' with regard to the actions of guerrilla groups. The government would prefer to renounce the death penalty clause alone, but if the Organisation of American States were to rule this out Peru would withdraw from the treaty in its entirety, he said. President Alberto Fujimori, who has already established summary trial procedures by secret military court for those accused of terrorism, will seek to short-circuit the relatively prolonged period normally involved in withdrawing from international treaties. He has not discounted the possibility of the death penalty being applied to guerrilla leaders such as Sendero Luminoso's Abimael Guzman or Mr Victor Polay, of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, who are behind bars. Mr Fujimori said: 'If they are found politically responsible for terrorist acts committed in the future, then the same penalty could be applied to them.' The prospect of Peru's withdrawal from the San Jose pact has raised fears among local organisations that respect for human rights, always fragile and rudimentary in the country, may suffer further erosion. But the groundswell of support for tougher measures against guerrillas is likely to ensure Mr Fujimori wins widespread popular backing. Meanwhile, round-ups of Sendero militants are continuing in the capital on an almost daily basis. However, counter-terrorist police chief General Ketin Vidal denied earlier rumours that Mr Oscar Ramirez Durand, tipped to succeed Mr Guzman as leader of Sendero, was among a group of nine arrested at the weekend.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / The Japanese Economic Package: Tokyo rises at last to the crisis of confidence THE Japanese government has in the last 10 days rediscovered the lost art of charming the stock market. Starting with Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata's measures to support the banking system announced late on August 18, a steady flow of official and leaked reports about measures to help the economy has risen in crescendo day after day to the delight of investors. This week the reported size of the government's package of emergency fiscal measures to be enacted in October has miraculously leapt from a base point of Y6,000bn (Pounds 24.2bn) by Y1,000bn a day to an official figure announced yesterday of Y10,700bn. That is the largest economic emergency package in Japanese history, even as a percentage of gross national product  -2.3 per cent. The Nikkei stock market average has put on 25.6 per cent in just eight days of trading to close yesterday at 17,970.79 points. Just as important, trading volume, at 850m yesterday, has swollen to a point that securities houses can contemplate making a profit again. After months of dithering, and trying to sweet-talk sceptical investors that the Japanese economy was suffering from nothing more than a lack of confidence, the government finally accepted that Japanese financial markets, and the economy, were slipping into the danger zone. Capital investment and consumer spending have been plunging. Confidence in the banking system, burdened by perhaps Y30,000bn of current non-performing loans, was eroding quickly with each lurch downward of the stock market, which eroded the capital base of the banks. Dangers of a financial crisis were becoming more apparent by the day. Yesterday the government acted, and the reaction in the markets shows enormous confidence that it is finally doing something right. Is it? The government's package can be divided into three areas: fiscal measures, direct measures to help the financial system, and monetary policy. Fiscal measures: The Y10,700bn price tag attached to the package is eye-catching but misleading. It includes Y1,550bn to add property to the government's land bank for public works, a component which contributes nothing directly to the gross national product; the government hopes it will inject sorely-needed liquidity into the property market. Likewise, the economic impact on economic growth of Y2,000bn of increased lending for small businesses, which may or may not be taken up, is difficult to gauge. Direct fiscal spending measures will include Y3,900bn in central government public works spending, Y1,800bn in local government public works. Mr Toshio Koyano, general manager at DKB Research Institute, calculates that all the measures could reliably add Y5,200bn to spending in the fiscal year. Adding in the multiplier effect, he estimates a boost to GNP of 0.6 per cent this year. Other economists put the figure slightly higher. To fund this, the government will issue bonds - it has yet to decide on what scale - which will take money from elsewhere in the economy, possibly pushing up interest rates. 'It should add about 1 per cent to GNP (this fiscal year) if you believe in Keynes, and downward from there if you don't,' says Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities. Most private economists believe the package will not have any significant impact beyond building confidence until the first quarter of the next calendar year, and that economic growth this fiscal year will fall shy of 2 per cent - far short of the government's original target of 3.5 per cent. DKB is estimating 2.9 per cent. 'The package is six to nine months too late,' says Mr Russell Jones, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. It was, none the less, a case of better late than never. Mr Robert Feldman, economist at Salomon Brothers Asia says: 'I think it will work because they are talking about spending a large amount of money in a short period of time.' The point of the package is to kick-start the economy, to halt the spiralling deterioration in demand caused by the build up of inventories and the steady decline of capital spending. The labour market has been softening, personal income growth is weak and consumer spending is down. The package may be slow to be felt, and the stock market, in particular, will be in for many more shocks such as yesterday's announcement (after the market closed) by Nissan Motors that it would incur a pre-tax loss in the current fiscal year, and pass its interim dividend. Mr Koyama says: 'The package will be more than enough to push the Japanese economy back to the normal track (of growth).' None the less, as Mr Jones says: 'The economy is still going to grow below its potential rate for the next two years.' Financial system support: Hanging inside Tokyo subway cars this week was was an advertisement for the Shukan Bunshun magazine, highlighting an article entitled: 'Why does the Finance Ministry only help the banks?' The subtitle: 'Savers face losses.' Bailing out the banks for imprudent lending is a politically charged issue, and yesterday's package said only that measures would be worked out in the coming months. The government cannot be seen to be letting banks off the hook, and use of government money for investment or cheap finance is controversial. But confidence is growing that something will be organised to help banks get bad loans off their books, enabling them to support the expected recovery in the economy. Mr Tsuneo Wakai, chairman of Japan's banking federation and president of Mitsubishi Bank, said this week that the banks themselves were working on a plan to set up a corporation to purchase land currently being held as collateral for bad loans. The banks should do this with their own capital, and not rely on the government, he said. While this is the politically correct attitude, it is also unrealistic, since there is little point in banks simply shifting bad assets to a company which they own. It only works if the government provides subsidised loans or tax breaks. With banks taking the initiative and shouldering real losses, however, preconditions could be set for the government to provide help. Mr Feldman says: 'The rescue has to be organised in such a way that keeps everyone's feet to the fire. It is a nice compromise between moral hazard, and the fact that the financial system cannot be allowed to fail.' There has been talk of subsidised loans from the central bank in the order of Y10,000bn to Y15,000bn yen. However it is done, the willpower to act looks in place, with the Finance Ministry evidently willing to contemplate steep sacrifices in tax revenues. Monetary Policy: To cut or not to cut is the question. Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister of international trade and industry and guardian of the manufacturing sector, recently dismissed the suggestion that interest rates be cut. With the official discount rate cut in late July to 3.25 per cent, a further reduction threatens to provoke a backlash from pensioners who have watched their income decline. Mr Feldman argues that interest rates are not in themselves too high to support a recovery. Lower interest rates would help to boost bank profits and improve liquidity in the banking system, but there are direct ways to help the banks without a general interest rate cut. Mr Koyano also argues that the size of the fiscal package will provide enough of a stimulus so that the central bank can sit and watch. However, Mr Barker argues that the fiscal package will not work unless the central bank accommodates the spending by encouraging greater growth in the money supply, currently at a historic low, by lowering interest rates again. This is needed to reverse the sag in consumer spending. 'It was a monetary inflation that caused the bubble economy,' says Mr Barker. 'It was a monetary squeeze that got us into this (recession). And it will be a monetary relaxation that gets us out again.'

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Arts: Development of the City office block - Architecture The City of London is really an office block that covers one square mile. This fact is rather skilfully, if unintentionally, brought out in an exhibition at the Royal Exchange at the heart of the City called City Changes. The sub-title of the show is Architecture in the City of London 1985 - 1995. The show is organised by the City Corporation and the Architecture Foundation and should be compulsory viewing for anyone interested in the future of London architecture and planning. There is a certain agreeable irony in the fact that this show is being housed in some of the freely available empty office space in the City - especially as the hidden agenda of the show seems to be a promotion of the City as a financial centre for a unified European Community. As Michael Cassidy, the chairman of the Policy and Resources Committee of the City of London, writes in his contribution to the catalogue about the over supply of offices in the City: 'optimistically this now leaves the City with some of the highest quality office buildings in the world available at a price that would tempt new occupiers.' It is a very necessary sales pitch because, if you take the period from 1986 and extend it to the end of 1993, 'the equivalent of one half of the entire stock of office buildings in and around the City will have been rebuilt or created.' I quote from the exhibition's press release. There are currently some 12.6 million square feet of vacant offices in the City alone, not to mention the vacant 40 per cent of Canary Wharf that is available to anyone willing to risk the journey downstream. In Docklands since 1983, of the 9.7 million square feet of offices that has been constructed, some 5.2 million square feet is vacant. There are some 68 proposed office developments in the pipeline amounting to a further 16 million square feet - although whether Docklands can take any more development must seem very unlikely. The whole question of the planning relationship between the City and Docklands is not even glanced at by this exhibition. It seems to me that the exhibition has two purposes, clearly expressed by its design and layout. One is to hype the City as a an ever changing and expanding place and to advance its cause as the potential home for the European Central Bank. The other is to show some of the better architecture that has been built, or is on the drawing board. The first purpose is served by a large illuminated model of the whole City that has subtly toned buildings to show what has been built in three periods; pre-1945, 1945-1980, and since 1980. The model is shown so that you have to look down on it like a bird - it has a rather old fashioned air; now that computer models and videos are available I wondered about the real value of this huge wooden object. It does show clearly where the most recent growth has been and at a glance where high buildings have been permitted; it would have been more interesting if it had been shown in relation to the rest of London, particularly Docklands. As an architectural exhibition it is really about the development of the office block. As a building type that has changed radically since the late 1950's it is well worth examination. It is a difficult building type to examine in purely architectural terms, because what we are really looking at is a built equation that has to balance technological efficiency with commercial and development values. How do you measure architectural success in the light of the balancing act that both the architect and the developer are performing? How do you measure the success of a city without taking into account place making, the mixture of uses and the qualities of the public realm ? It is a fact that the great property boom of the 1980's did not produce much good architecture. The 20 schemes shown in this exhibition, with good models and drawings, are all of some interest, but they are only the tip of the development iceberg. The best total development in the City has undoubtedly been Broadgate - and I think that is not just because of the good standard of its architecture, but also because the developers had the opportunity and seized it to make a place with some life and quality. It may die at night because no one lives there but, seen in combination with the highly successful Liverpool Street Station redevelopment, it has genuinely enhanced the life of the City. It has created new squares and added some good sculpture to the scene - and it is traffic free. The proposals for individual new buildings by famous architects like Sir Norman Foster, Sir Richard Rogers and Peter Foggo in the redeveloping London Wall area may not add as much because they are not part of any serious master plan for a complete area. There is some good and a lot of bad new architecture in the City. It seems to me that the City's weakness is planning. Why is there no comprehensive plan for the area around St. Paul's cathedral? How did the dog's dinner around the Tower of London ever happen? Who is responsible for the traffic madness that is Lower Thames Street? How did that dreadful new building at the bottom of Ludgate Hill on the south side happen to have been just placed to ruin the famous view of St. Paul's? How was the new Alban Gate building on London Wall allowed to rise so high that it damages the view of St Paul's from Blackfriars Bridge? You will not find the answers provided by the architects selected by the Architecture Foundation for this exhibition. Nice new offices do not make a city: with no sensible strategic planning for London as a whole, even the value of the good things in the City will be lost. The exhibition at the Royal Exchange and can only be reached by lift via the back entrance. It runs until August 21, and is free. Open 10 - 5.30 Mondays to Saturdays.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Wellman Without the burden of closure costs this time, Wellman lifted pre-tax profit from Pounds 231,000 to Pounds 681,000 in the year ended March 31. The dividend, however, is reduced from 2.2p to 0.9p. Mr Geoffrey Iley, chairman of this specialist engineer, said activity in all markets was lower but the result was broadly in line with expectations. Margins were under pressure and with no indication of an immediate upturn, the cost base would continue to be adjusted where necessary. The forward order book, he added, was higher than last year but prospective margins had been eroded. Turnover came to Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 24m) and trading profit to Pounds 796,000 (Pounds 1.02m). There was a Pounds 250,000 provision for further rationalisation, while last year's extraordinary Pounds 817,000 for closure costs has been adjusted to above the line under FRS 3. Turnover included Pounds 1.87m from acquisitions (Pounds 1.36m from discontinued operations) and the respective figures in the trading profit were Pounds 101,000 (Pounds 75,000). Earnings per share doubled to 1p. The dividend is reduced to keep in line with earnings; the final is 0.6p.</p>

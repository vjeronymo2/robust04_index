			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Slippery art of central banking IMAGINE THIS scene: US Federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, Bundesbank president-elect Hans Tietmeyer and Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno, huddled together this week in a Washington bar, taking a break from a gloomy International Monetary Fund meeting to compare notes on the art of modern-day central banking. Pleasantries dispensed with, drinks ordered, the conversation would turn quickly to a three-way moan. Never has the art of central banking been so difficult. Mr Greenspan probably has the most delicate task at present: to decide when to raise US interest rates. Some observers argue that the weak US recovery, and the sluggish rate of broad money growth, argue for delay. Others, notably the monetarist Shadow Open Market Committee, fear that double-digit growth of narrow money spells inflationary danger and want higher rates now. In Japan, life is a little easier. All the indicators - falling output, sluggish credit growth, and a badly damaged banking sector - argue for a loose monetary policy, hence Tuesday's 0.75 percentage point cut in the discount rate to a record low. But Germany's situation is again more complicated: rapid broad money growth argues for a tight monetary policy, but almost every other indicator says that this policy is feeding Germany's lingering recession. Erratic behaviour All three central bankers are trying to make policy at a time of exceptional uncertainty in the world economy. Forecasters have consistently missed the strength of world deflationary pressures; analysts have therefore failed to spot how low short-term interest rates would need to go in the US and Japan, or the way in which this fall in the return on cash would feed stock and bond market rallies; and economists have failed to explain the erratic behaviour of monetary aggregates, both in the US and Germany. The normal indicators upon which monetary policymakers rely are, as a result, difficult to understand, let alone use as reliable guides to policymaking. Should Mr Greenspan worry about narrow or broad money growth? How far can estimated real interest rates guide future policy? Does the bond market rally mean that inflation is under control, or that these markets are heading for a fall? Why does the yen fall against the dollar when the Bank of Japan cuts interest rates, but the D-Mark rise when the Bundesbank does the same? Can the Bundesbank be sure that the old relationship between money and nominal output still holds in Germany, despite the shock of monetary unification, when it does not in the US? Eclectic fashion Modern central bankers have never been more aware how damaging their errors can be. But, having chosen or been forced to drop their monetary or exchange rate targets, they appear to have little option except to use a range of monetary indicators in eclectic fashion. Still, there are principles that the three central bankers should bear in mind. First, central banks, especially independent central banks, must explain what they are doing and why. In this regard, Mr Greenspan has been a relatively impressive Fed governor. Mr Mieno's approach has been rather more oblique, while some recent indications by the Bundesbank of its policy intentions have been confusing, at best. Second, central banking is a forward-looking art. Long lead-times mean that policy today must be appropriate for economic conditions in a year or more's time. Mr Greenspan, mindful of parallels with the 1930s depression, was right to cut US interest rates early and aggressively, but the test of his dexterity will be whether he has the courage to raise rates again before clear inflationary signs emerge. The Bank of Japan, stung by its failure to prevent asset price inflation in the late 1980s, has eased policy too late and too slowly. Precedent suggests it will raise them again too late. As for the Bundesbank, still unhappy about the recent terms of monetary unification and very aware of Germany's inflationary history, it must guard against the temptation to fight yesterday's battles today. History can be a useful supplement to current information. It can also be a debilitating straitjacket.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Leading Article: After Hanoi, Havana The Clinton administration deserves applause for its efforts to lift sanctions against Vietnam and should move rapidly to take the final steps to end its embargo. It needs now to turn its attention to another legacy of the cold war: Cuba. If the US can resolve its differences with a country with which it was at war two decades ago, it seems strange that the normalising of relations with Cuba is hardly discussed in Washington. There are several reasons for this. Vietnam did not, at least initially, present such a challenge to America's way of life as Cuba, the former ally on its doorstep that joined the Soviet bloc. Unlike in the case of Vietnam, there has been no important group of US companies arguing for the lifting of sanctions. Businesses have argued forcefully that non-US companies in Vietnam have been the chief beneficiaries of the US embargo, and have wanted equal treatment. There is evidence that some US businesses are becoming concerned about losing out in the Cuban market, but their worries have not been sufficiently developed to bring any pressure on policymakers. Above all, domestic US policy considerations - and in particular the importance of the state of Florida where most Cuban exiles are based - have given the vociferous hardline opponents of the Cuban regime a near veto on the issue. Tied hands These groups may over time be becoming less representative of Cuban opinion in the US. But they have been skilful, winning during the 1992 election campaign the backing of both presidential candidates for the Cuban Democracy Act. This tightened the sanctions against Havana - including extending the embargo to subsidiaries of US companies based outside the US - and tied the hands of any administration to do anything about it. The main objective of the act was 'to seek a peaceful transition to democracy and a resumption of economic growth in Cuba' through the careful application of sanctions. The ultimate objective - to secure a soft landing for a Cuban transition to democracy - is indeed the correct one. The problem is that the embargo is increasing the likelihood that eventual change in Havana will be violent. The embargo is one of Fidel Castro's greatest allies in his struggle to remain in power. It allows him to blame many of the country's economic problems on Washington - blame which should lie squarely on his own shoulders. It permits his regime to charac-terise any opposition as akin to treason. Exile groups The embargo plays into the hands of hardliners on both sides: to those in Cuba who want to avoid democracy at all costs and to those exile groups in the US whose desire for revenge against Castro overcomes all other objectives. The consequences of violence in Cuba will thrust itself on to the US policy agenda. Yet there is no evidence that Washington has a policy prescription to help manage the transition in Cuba. It should begin now to map out in public the process whereby it aims to provide incentives for a return to democracy and the rule of law in Cuba. A policy change is justified by the fact that some of the economic measures already taken by the Cuban government - the partial legalisation of the dollar and the granting of permission for (limited) self-employment - imply political changes. These in turn support a modest relaxation in the embargo. Those parts of the embargo that deal with communications should be ended - allowing the Cuban people to gain some sense of what is going on in the outside world. Restrictions covering basic food and medicines should be lifted - helping to deprive Castro of the charge that the US is either trying to starve Cuba or leave it without the ability to tackle disease. Then Washington should make it clear that - if Cuba complies with the economic conditions for joining the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - it will not object to Cuban membership of those two institutions. This would provide incentive to change economic policies: political changes in Cuba's overarching state are then almost bound to follow.</p>

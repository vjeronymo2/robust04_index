			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Suter at Pounds 12m as Wilkes integration continues Suter, the industrial conglomerate chaired by Mr David Abell, said it was proceeding well with the integration of Wilkes, the Sheffield engineering group it acquired full control of in May. Suter's pre-tax profits were Pounds 12m in the six months to July 2, compared with Pounds 29.6m which included a Pounds 19.1m disposal gain. The group said a better guide to underlying performance was profits before tax and exceptionals, up 14 per cent from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 12m. Sales rose 11 per cent to Pounds 110.1m. Savings of more than Pounds 1m have been achieved at Wilkes, and Mr Abell is seeking closer integration of Avon Transmissions with the group's existing Mitchell Cotts Remanufacturing business. The group intends to concentrate on completing the integration of Wilkes, continuing its capital expenditure programme and pursuing additional opportunities to enhance core activities. Negotiations are continuing for the sale of substantial property assets and certain non-core subsidiaries. Suter's refrigeration business increased operating profits from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 2.7m. The UK and continental European markets had been depressed, but business had picked up strongly in South Africa. Trading profits from the chemicals businesses fell from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 3.6m. Speciality chemicals businesses performed well, but fine chemicals suffered from pricing pressure. The group's automotive and engineering businesses performed well, raising operating profits from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 3.6m. The exception was Floform, acquired from Wilkes, which had disappointing volumes in the first half, but this has been addressed. Consumer products increased operating profits from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 700,000. Mr Abell said: 'If we can - as I believe - expect a period of steady economic growth with low inflation in the UK, our confidence in it as a healthy location for our main manufacturing operations is justified.' Stripping out gains from property, analysts expect full-year profits of about Pounds 22m, which puts the shares - down 11p yesterday at 198p - on a prospective multiple of nearly 16. Earnings per share were 6.6p, compared with 6.3p before exceptionals, an increase of 4.8 per cent. The interim dividend rose to 3.5p (3.4p).</p>

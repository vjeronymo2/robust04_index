			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Bund yields reach their highest for two years Yields on 10-year German government bonds rose to their highest level since September 1992 on fears that the rapid recovery in the German economy would prevent the Bundesbank from cutting interest rates further. The yield on 10-year bunds rose by 10 basis points to 7 1/2 per cent. Most of the activity was in the futures market, where the December bund future fell 0.63 to 89.09. The rise in yields coincided with the Bundesbank's sale of Treuhand 10-year bonds, which is estimated to raise a total of DM8bn. Yesterday, DM3bn was alloted to the federal bond consortium at 100.95 to yield 7.36 per cent. Analysts said the Bundesbank would have to offer a yield of 7 1/2 per cent to ensure a smooth auction today. Worries about the federal elections next month also weighed on the market. Mr Holger Schmieding, senior economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt, said investors who had been anticipating a clear win for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition are becoming nervous following his poor showing in recent opinion polls. They are now hoping this weekend's state elections in the east German states of Saxony and Brandenburg will produce a clear majority for his CDU party. The market is expecting confirmation of the speed of Germany's economic turnround tomorrow when west German GDP data for the second quarter are due. Gilts fell more than a point yesterday, pulled down by the decline in the German market. Volume in the cash market was thin, however, as investors stood on the sidelines ahead of today's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Analysts were divided on whether the meeting would produce a rise in interest rates. Mr Andrew Roberts, at UBS, said: 'The market would be surprised if there were a rate hike - there is very little inflationary pressure just now.' Mr Michael Pratten at Kidder Peabody said any rise in rates would probably be after the Conservative party conference in October. 'We feel the chancellor will hold off,' he said. However, Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers said there might be an early rise: 'The case is there for a rise in rates in September or November. The disadvantage of waiting for November is that it looks political,' he said. On Liffe, the December long gilt future reached 99 7/8 in late trading, a fall of 1 1/8 on the day. There was little change in the yield spread between gilts and German bunds, which was at 141 basis points in late trading. Spanish government bonds were dragged down by the fall in bunds and news of the resignation of the fifth Ministry of Finance official in two months. Ten-year bond yields rose 22 basis points to 11.39 per cent. US Treasury bonds showed further weakness yesterday as a softer dollar prompted traders to follow through on Friday's negative response to August employment data. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was lower at 99 3/8 , with the yield rising to 7.546 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 100 1/16 , to yield 6.198 per cent. With no fresh economic news to offer guidance, traders took direction from the foreign exchange markets, where the US currency lost ground against the yen and D-Mark. With the weaker dollar raising concerns over the value of US-denominated securities, bonds across the board slumped. Traders also remained perplexed by the surprising effect of last week's economic data on bond prices. News of weaker than expected growth in jobs had failed to impress the market, which instead focused on the worrying signs of inflation buried in the Labor Department report. Fears of inflation continued to dominate yesterday, in spite of reassuring comments by Mr Alan Blinder, Federal Reserve vice-chairman. Mr Blinder told the Market News Service that the central bank may have succeeded in putting the economy on a 'glide path' of moderate, non-inflationary growth. Still, traders generally appeared unconvinced, with many preferring to put off any big commitments until the release of producer price data at the end of the week.</p>

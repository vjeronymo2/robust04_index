			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Observer: Sheilas' punch-up Britain has had one and so has Canada. Could a traditionally male preserve like Australia be the next English-speaking country to flirt with the idea of a woman as prime minister? True, Australia's elections are not due until 1996 but women have become hot political properties down under. Carmen Lawrence, former premier of Western Australia, threw her hat in the ring yesterday. She is quitting state politics and wants to take over the relatively safe federal seat of Fremantle being vacated by John Dawkins, 46, the former treasurer. She is already tipped for a job in the government. Lawrence has been urged to make the transition by Prime Minister Paul Keating's advisers, increasingly concerned at the growing popularity of Bronwyn Bishop, an ambitious Liberal party senator from Sydney's North Shore, recently promoted to the opposition's shadow cabinet. Bishop has a gift for offering no-nonsense commentary on the affairs of the day, causing fans and foes alike to draw comparisons with Britain's Baroness Thatcher and even Madonna. Nevertheless, she regularly outpolls her colleagues. With the opposition in some disarray, 'Bronnie' has been tipped to become its next leader. When pressed to explain what she stands for, one old political hand could only mutter: 'Naked ambition'.</p>

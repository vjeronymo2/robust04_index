			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Allied-Signal to sell 39% stake in Union Texas ALLIED-Signal, the industrial technology company in the throes of a major restructuring, announced yesterday that it would be selling its 39 per cent stake in Union Texas Petroleum in a public offering which is likely to raise around Dollars 600m gross. It will raise a further Dollars 355m through the cash redemption of Dollars 200m of preferred Union Texas shares and Dollars 155m of warrants. A spokesman for Allied said the proceeds should translate into a pre-tax gain of about Dollars 350m. Mr Lawrence Bossidy, who took over as chairman of Allied in the summer of 1991, has made no secret of his desire to shed the company's oil and gas interests as part of a slimming and refocusing of the high technology conglomerate. However, until now Allied had deemed the market for energy properties too weak to justify a sale. The company said yesterday the proceeds would be used to reduce debt, accelerate productivity improvements and for other corporate purposes. Costs associated with the productivity action might offset the gains from the sale. Union Texas is the second largest independent US oil company and is particularly active in the UK and Indonesia. It was acquired by Allied, then primarily a chemicals company, in 1962. In 1985 it went through a leveraged buy-out in which Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the buy-out specialist, acquired a 50 per cent stake, and a public offering followed in 1987. A spokeswoman for KKR said yesterday it would be retaining its remaining 39 per cent equity stake, but would be redeeming Dollars 145m of warrants. The Allied offer, expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, is for 33.3m shares of common stock.</p>

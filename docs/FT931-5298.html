			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cookson to raise Pounds 185.6m via rights SHARES IN Cookson Group fell by 14p to 199p yesterday, after the industrial materials company confirmed that it is raising Pounds 185.6m through a 1-for-4 rights issue priced at 170p. The proceeds of the rights, which has been underwritten by Lazard Brothers, will be used to repay debt, fund organic growth and make complementary acquisitions. Cookson raised Pounds 83m through a rights issue two years, after an acquisitions spree in the late-1980s left it heavily burdened with debt. Since then a new management team has undertaken a substantial restructuring of the group, making selective disposals and refocusing it on four product divisions. The company also reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 72.5m for the year to end-December, against a deficit of Pounds 7.9m last time. The comparisons have been restated to conform with accounting rule FRS 3. The 1991 figure was originally reported as a profit of Pounds 34.4m. However, FRS 3 required the restatement of extraordinary items in 1991 to include goodwill previously written off to reserves on sale or termination of operations, and for these extraordinary items to be reclassified as exceptional items. Turnover declined by 5 per cent to Pounds 1.24bn (Pounds 1.3bn). However, like-for-like turnover, adjusting for acquisitions, disposals and exchange rate movements, increased by about 3 per cent. Earnings per share were 9.4p against restated losses per share of 8.4p in 1991. Last year it reported earnings of 1.8p. An unchanged final dividend of 3p is proposed, maintaining the total for the year at 6p. Operating profit before exceptional items increased to Pounds 94.5m, an increase of 26 per cent over a restated Pounds 74.6m in 1991. About 80 per cent of the group's business is outside the UK and the effect of currency translation was to add Pounds 7.5m to sales last year and Pounds 1.1m to pre-tax profits. All four divisions achieved increased operating profits after exceptional items. The electronic materials division showed a 66 per cent increase to Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 12.9m), while the ceramics division posted increased operating profits of Pounds 38.5m (Pounds 31.4m). The engineering products division turned in an Pounds 8.8m advance to Pounds 13.8m, boosted by the acquisition in April last year of the remaining 50 per cent of Stern Leach. The plastics division posted operating profits of Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 9.5m). At the end of December the group had net borrowings of Pounds 341m, including Pounds 77m of convertible preference shares, an increase of Pounds 125m from the end of 1991. The main reasons for the increase were Pounds 55m of additional borrowings arising from the acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent stake in Stern Leach following the exercise of a put option by the former joint venture partner, a Pounds 31m foreign currency translation adjustment, and an increase in year-end working capital. Gearing, which increased from 51 per cent at the end of 1991 to 74 per cent at the end of 1992, will be reduced to below 30 per cent as a result of the rights issue. See Lex</p>

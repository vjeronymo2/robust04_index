			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Savoy Hotel losses increase THE hoped-for improvement in trading failed to materialise at Savoy Hotel in the first half and pre-tax losses increased from Pounds 674,000 to Pounds 1.75m. However, tax credits reduced the losses to Pounds 991,000, against a Pounds 1.24m profit previously. The share price fell 6 per cent, from 473p to 443p. Sales were 10 per cent ahead in the first quarter, but the continuing recession and weak dollar reversed this progress in the second quarter and the interim figure ended unchanged at Pounds 36.8m. Gross trading profit came to Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 2.98m) but depreciation of Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 2.99m) turned this into a trading loss of Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 2,000). Efforts during the period to control costs contained their rise to just 2.6 per cent at Pounds 35m. The same attention will be applied in the second half. The six months ended with losses per A share of 3.5p (4.3p earnings) and per B share of 1.7p (2.2p earnings). The company is majority-owned, but not controlled by Forte.</p>

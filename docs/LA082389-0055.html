			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARIAN PARTY LEADER GROSZ HINTS HE'LL QUIT  </P> <P> Communist Party General Secretary Karoly Grosz, a centrist who has lost ground  recently to reformists, suggested in an interview published Tuesday that he  will step down to prevent a power struggle.  </P> <P> Grosz did not specifically say he would resign, but the official MTI news  agency reported that he did not contradict a reporter for the party daily  Nepszabadsag who asked why he intended to "leave the political scene."  </P> <P> "Many people want to believe that the main cause of the current problems is the  power struggle within the party," Grosz was quoted as saying. "I would not like  to have a power struggle, as it would not do any good to either the party or  the country."  </P> <P> He did not elaborate on his political future or his views on the party  conflict. But he apparently was alluding to expectations that a battle between  reformers and their opponents would dominate an extraordinary party congress  Oct. 6.  </P> <P> Grosz became party general secretary 15 months ago, replacing Janos Kadar, the  leader of 32 years who had become associated with political and economic  stagnation.  </P> <P> Grosz assumed power amid expectations he would lead reforms while maintaining  discipline and good terms with party conservatives. But he was left behind as  reformers forced the pace of political and economic liberalization.  </P> <P> In the past two years, the surge of reformist sentiment within the party has  led to the endorsement of a multi-party system and of free elections, by  mid-1990 at the latest.  </P> <P> A draft manifesto published in Nepszabadsag on Friday reiterated the  Communists' intention to "introduce a multi-party system in which the source of  power is the will of the people manifested in free elections."  </P></p>

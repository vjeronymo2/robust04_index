			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> '88 HOUSING SALES RISE TO 9-YEAR RECORD  </P> <P> Sales of existing houses rose in 1988 to the highest level in nine years, but  climbing costs caused buyers to choose lower-priced houses, a national real  estate group said today.  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Realtors said 3.63 million single-family houses were  resold in 1988 for a 2.9% increase from 1987, the highest level since 3.83  million in 1979.  </P> <P> It said sales of existing houses rose 11.4% in December from November to 4.09  million units at an annual rate.  </P> <P> Demand continued strong, but high prices and an increase in mortgage interest  rates at the end of last year meant that the biggest gains were in lower-priced  houses, the group said.  </P> <P> During 1988, a buying shift occurred in favor of the Midwest and South over the  relatively expensive markets in the Northeast, John Tuccillo, the group's chief  economist, said.  </P> <P> "The demand for home ownership is being fulfilled at the lower end of the  market," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Demand Is There'  </P> <P> "For the most part, people seem to be buying less expensive homes. The demand  is there," said Ira Gribin, president of the association.  </P> <P> Interest rates were moderately higher at the end of the year from early 1988  but did rise significantly from a dip in the spring.  </P> <P> The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said fixed-rate loans were at 10.77% and  adjustable-rate loans 8.49% at the end of December, compared to 10.61% and  7.95% in January 1988.  </P> <P> December rates were up from a drop in early March, however, when fixed-rate  loans were 9.85% and adjustable-rate loans were 7.53%.  </P> <P> The median price of an existing house nationwide fell last month to $87,700  from $88,000 in November but was up from $85,400 in December, 1987.  </P> <P> The median sales price in 1988 rose 4.1% from the previous year to $89,100.  </P> <P> The December rise in house resales was the biggest month-to-month increase  since April, 1986, with the biggest increases in the pace occurring in the  Midwest and South.  </P> <P> </P> <P> South Rises Again  </P> <P> Last month's increase in sales followed three months in which the level was  unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.67 million units.  </P> <P> Sales rose 15.8% in the South, 10.4% in the Midwest, 4.5% in the West and 4.4%  in the Northeast.  </P> <P> Median prices last month rose in the Northeast to $143,300 from $140,700 in  November and rose to $67,800 from $66,700 in the Midwest.  </P> <P> Prices fell to $117,800 from $128,900 in the West and fell to $78,500 from  $80,300 in the South.  </P></p>

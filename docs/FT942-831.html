			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Kohl prepares to abandon Dehaene: Search renewed for acceptable EC president - Italy will attempt to break deadlock German chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday committed himself to finding a candidate to head the European Commission who would be acceptable to all 12 member states, as it became clear that EU leaders were starting from scratch in their search for a successor to Mr Jacques Delors. 'We will talk to everyone involved, and we will work out a proposal,' Mr Kohl said. 'I am not blind. I want to come up with a result.' His comments were taken in Brussels as a signal Germany was preparing to abandon its preferred candidate, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier. Mr Dehaene was vetoed by the UK at the EU's Corfu summit on Saturday. Germany, which takes over the EU's rotating EU presidency from Greece on Friday, has called a special summit in Brussels on July 15 to resolve the dispute. 'The deadline for my efforts will be midday on Friday, July 15,' said Mr Kohl. He added that it was essential to reach agreement before the first session of the new European parliament, which opens on July 18, when the new presidential candidate is supposed to address the assembly. A series of prearranged foreign ministers' visits have placed Italy in the role as a potential broker to break the deadlock. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, is due in Rome today for talks with Mr Antonio Martino, his Italian opposite number. Mr Martino is due to visit London on Wednesday - to be followed on Thursday by Mr Kinkel. Mr Kinkel insisted that Mr Dehaene remained in the running, saying: 'We do not change candidates like we change our shirts.' But the German chancellor would not confirm he was still backing Mr Dehaene, indicating that the selection process was starting with a clean slate. The Dutch premier Mr Ruud Lubbers, who withdrew on Saturday, is unlikely to rejoin the race. Although the Dutch, would like to field another candidate, the collapse of talks in the Hague yesterday on a new Dutch coalition meant Dutch officials could not see any figure of calibre becoming available. The widely canvassed candidacy of Mr Peter Sutherland, the Irish director-general of Gatt, is thought unlikely to prosper because the continental European perception is that he is too close to the UK. Belgium is expected to put forward another candidate, possibly Mr Wilfried Martens, the former prime minister, or finance minister Mr Phillipe Maystadt, both Christian Democrats, or Viscount Etienne Davignon, a former EU Commissioner. An alternative theory circulating in Brussels yesterday was that Mr Giuliano Amato, the socialist former Italian prime minister, respected for his role in steering Italy through its political upheaval, might come to be seen as an attractive candidate. Another Italian name being mentioned was that of Mr Renato Ruggiero, currently a candidate to head the new World Trade Organisation. But the unwritten rules the 12 heads of government had set themselves in the last selection round may have to be torn up. These were that the successor to France's powerful Mr Delors - a socialist from a large country - should come from their own ranks; from a small member state; and from the centre-right. One EU diplomat said yesterday that if all three criteria were impossible to fulfil his feeling was that 'they will try to give it one of the smaller countries'. 'This is now between countries more than personalities,' one senior Brussels official said.

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Head of Siemens in Italy joins list in scandal MR Giorgio Scanavaca, chairman and chief executive of the Italian subsidiary of Germany's electronics giant Siemens, was arrested by Milan magistrates yesterday on corruption charges. The arrest is understood to be in connection with magistrates' broadening inquiry into the payment of bribes to obtain telecommunications contracts. It casts a further shadow over the activities of foreign multinationals in Italy's widening political corruption scandal. The Italian subsidiary of Siemens now joins that of GEC Marconi and Sweden's Ericsson which last week became involved in the same investigation. The chief executives of these two subsidiaries were arrested on May 12 on similar charges. It is the first time in Italy's 15-month-old corruption scandal, concerning the illicit funding of political parties in return for contracts, that so many foreign companies have been linked in a single line of inquiry. The big contracts in the telecommunications sector have been one of the main areas where foreign companies have bid for business in Italy in recent years. It is almost a year since ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering and electronics group, first appeared in the investigations, then still largely limited to Milan. The group was alleged to have paid about L16bn (Pounds 6.8m) in kickbacks to obtain orders for the city's underground railway. The foreign trail went relatively cold thereafter, bar a further embarrassment for ABB, whose chief executive in Italy, Mr Umberto Di Capua, was arrested and briefly jailed on allegations believed to be linked to the metro orders. Mr Di Capua, who only joined the company after the completion of the new line, was released soon after from Milan's San Vittore prison. However, in the past week the foreigners have been making a comeback. Siemens is not a complete stranger to the corruption scandal. In May 1992 investigations into alleged corruption in a local hospital in Pavia, south of Milan, triggered allegations that the company had handed over about L50m in bribes to win a contract. The impact on the standing of foreign companies in Italy is still being digested and public reaction has been limited so far. Officials at Ericsson were unavailable for comment yesterday, while a Siemens official had 'no comment' to make on the arrest of Mr Scanavaca. So far, only ABB appears to have taken its alleged involvement on board. Well before the inauguration of Fiat's new 'ethical code of business practice' last week, the company had moved to tighten up its procedures.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kmart faces defeat over plan to sell share stakes Kmart, the US discount store group, was last night facing an embarrassing defeat in today's vote over its plan to sell stakes of up to 30 per cent in its four specialty retailing subsidiaries. A growing rebellion against the board by Kmart's institutional investors gained another influential recruit when it was joined yesterday by the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), the biggest US public pension fund. The fund said it had decided to vote against Kmart's plan because it could dilute Calpers' holdings and 'may preclude management from considering other better alternatives'. Calpers said it was withholding its support for the re-election of five directors to the board to express its dissatisfaction over the 'persistent poor performance' of the company. 'We have serious questions about who is minding the store for shareholders at Kmart,' it said. Calpers is one of six institutional investors to signal dissatisfaction with Kmart's board and management over the last few days by denouncing the company's plans. The others are the College Retirement Equities Fund, the biggest US institutional investor; the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, one of the 10 largest US pension funds; the Florida State Board of Administration; the Ohio State Teachers Retirement System; and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. They hold a small percentage of Kmart's stock - Calpers holds 2.8m of the 455.9m issued shares - but their hostility could swing other shareholders. Kmart earlier this week said the rebel investors were only a tiny minority of the company's 460 institutional investors, and it hoped for a majority of support.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: Candy agrees to buy two Spanish appliance groups CANDY, the privately-owned Italian white goods group, has reached preliminary agreement to buy MAYC and MEM, two linked Spanish domestic appliance makers, best known for their Otsein brand. The deal, for which no price was given, marks another step in the rationalisation of the European white goods industry in the face of oversupply and cut-throat price competition. The purchase is subject to regulatory approval. 'Last year was especially tough on prices. Up to 1990, competitive pressures were masked slightly by rising demand in eastern Europe. However, that demand has collapsed as a result of credit problems, said Mr Silvano Fumagalli, managing director of Candy. Otsein, based in Vergara in the Basque country, has more than 8 per cent of the Spanish washing machine market and around 50 per cent of that for top-loaders. Combined turnover of MAYC and MEM, which employ about 700, exceeded L130bn (Dollars 108.9m) last year. The companies, which also make other household equipment, produced over 300,000 units in 1991. Candy, controlled by the Fumagalli family, employs 5,000 and is Italy's third-biggest appliance maker. Sales topped L1,200bn in 1991. Pre-tax profits were L50bn in 1990.</p>

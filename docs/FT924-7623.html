			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Belarus steps up sell-offs BELARUS, among the most conservative of the newly-independent former Soviet states, is moving tentatively towards privatisation, writes David Waller, recently in Minsk. The Belarus government has appointed western advisers to help with the privatisation process and plans next year to introduce legislation dealing with the mechanics of the transition to a market economy, officials of the government's State Property Agency said in Minsk last week. So far, fewer than 200 out of 30,000 enterprises - employing just 1.4 per cent of the country's workforce - have been privatised, largely through the sale of vouchers to employees. The government plans to introduce a legal framework next year which will act as a catalyst to further privatisation, for example laying down private property rights. The Uberoi Group of Germany is advising the government.</p>

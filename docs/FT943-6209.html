			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / BSkyB adds Pounds 3 a month to prices Subscribers to British Sky Broadcasting services will have to pay Pounds 3 a month more from the beginning of October. The company began informing its subscribers at the weekend of the price rise, which looks designed to increase the rate of payback of the more than Pounds 1.75bn invested in the satellite television venture. The rise is being added to all four tiers of subscriptions so that the basic multi-channel package will in future cost Pounds 9.99. Multi-channel plus one premium service, such as the Sports Channel or a film channel, will cost Pounds 14.99, multi-channel plus two premium channels Pounds 19.99 and the entire package Pounds 22.99. BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, had 3.45m subscribers at the end of June. If they all continue to subscribe then the gross additional revenue over a year would be about Pounds 125m.</p>

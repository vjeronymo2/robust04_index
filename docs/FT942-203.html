			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / More trains running About 1,600 trains ran on the Railtrack network yesterday, the best level of service on a strike day during the present dispute, William Lewis writes. British Rail, parent of the new train operating companies, said follow-on disruption this morning was likely to be minimal. 'We have had trains running in every region of the country,' BR said. Ten per cent of normal services ran yesterday, compared with 7 per cent a week before and just over 3 per cent during the first 24-hour strike. Trains which ran yesterday for the first time during the present series of stoppages included some from London Paddington to Plymouth; Manchester Airport to Manchester, Bolton, Preston, and Lancaster; Glasgow to Edinburgh and Hull to Beverley and Bridlington. Railtrack said it had been 'not at all a bad service' and that it had been able to open 1,500 route miles for train operators. Commuters to the south of London were worst hit with no trains running in or out of London Waterloo. Problems were also caused when one of the routes expected to have run normally - the Chiltern Line from London Marylebone to Aylesbury and Banbury - had to be closed because of vandalism. The AA motoring organisation reported extra-heavy traffic in the south-east and London during the morning rush hour. By the afternoon there was a big build-up of traffic in many cities including Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow. The Department of Transport reported heavy usage of its special car parking sites except in London's Docklands. BR said its staff used the early morning yesterday to ensure that trains were ready to run straightaway today. 'Railtrack were able to tell us which signal boxes were likely to be open this time, so we were able to plan around it,' it said. There was some embarrassment for the Department of Transport when a special river service from Gravesend to Charing Cross, which it announced on Tuesday, turned out to have been booked by a group of pensioners.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Lowlander in the Highlands: Born and schooled in the Netherlands, Rudi  Verhoeven now lives and works in New Mexico. A first L.A. show includes a group  of interesting and well appointed abstract constructions that pull together  everything from lush paint to bits of paper-thin metal and sail cloth to make  seductive, rough-hewn surfaces  </P> <P> He inscribes all manner of dexterous calligraphic marks that start to look like  arcane emblems with meanings we're not privy to.  </P> <P> He is at his best when his graceful draftsmanship isn't overwhelmed by  smoldering finishes. "In the Rift" features an upper and lower band of layered  color, each robust swath of hue both obliterating and enhancing the one beneath  it. Peeking through this are random, loosely painted patterns so sketchy that  they resemble chair caning or wall paper seen through the drippy, vaporous haze  of a moist shower door. In the middle register, rendered over a chalky white  ground, Verhoeven paints an enormous lobed pod that suggests a giant spore, a  weapon or a distant relative to the Goodyear blimp. (Tokoro Gallery, 320 N.  Robertson Blvd. to Feb. 28.) MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

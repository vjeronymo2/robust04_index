			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) The FMV of such or similar merchandise produced in one or more of the facilities outside the country of exportation is higher than the FMV of such or similar merchandise produced in the facilities located in the country of exportation. (In this comparison, we must adjust the FMVs for any differences between the costs of production in the two countries (including taxes, labor, materials and overhead), pursuant to section 773(d) of the Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the above criteria are met, then the MNC provision instructs the Department to compare USP to the FMV of such or similar merchandise produced in one or more facilities outside the country of exportation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the first criterion, Fuji Photo Film B.V. is wholly owned by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. in Japan. Further, Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. produces the subject merchandise in Japan. Thus, Fuji Photo Film B.V. meets the first criterion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the second criterion, we compared the volume of home market sales of color negative photographic paper to the volume of third country sales of color negative photographic paper, in accordance with section 773(d)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.48(a), in order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of color negative photographic paper in the home market to compare to sales of color negative photographic paper to the United States. We found that the Netherlands home market was not viable for comparison to sales to the United States (see January 11, 1994, memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We determined, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.49, that Germany is the most appropriate third country market for purposes of the comparison of FMVs under the MNC provision because: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Germany is the largest single third country market; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The type of merchandise sold in Germany is more similar to Dutch exports of color negative photographic paper to the U.S. than the type of merchandise sold elsewhere; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The channels of distribution in Germany are most similar to those for color negative photographic paper from the Netherlands sold in the United States (see December 30, 1993, memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the third criterion, we compared German and Japanese FMVs. To calculate the FMVs, we first compared the German and Japanese prices to U.S. price (see the ``Foreign Market Value'' section of this notice for a complete description of how we calculated the German and Japanese FMVs). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once we had calculated the two FMVs, we calculated a comparison adjustment for each product-specific FMV to determine whether any of the observed differences in value between the FMV of products produced in Japan and the FMV of products produced in the Netherlands and sold in Germany were attributable to differences in costs of production. The comparison adjustment included the costs of materials, labor, fixed and variable overhead, general and administrative expense and interest incurred in producing the product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the German adjustment, the Department relied on the submitted cost information except in the following instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) We excluded income from investment grants as this generally relates to income tax credits which are not considered a production cost;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) We did not include foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from sales transactions as they are not related to production costs; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) We reallocated CNPP specific research and development costs to reflect the benefits experienced by facilities in Japan and the Netherlands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Japanese adjustment, the Department relied on the submitted cost information except in the following instances where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) We excluded losses from the disposal of fixed assets as these costs did not appear to relate to the subject merchandise;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) We did not include foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from sales transactions as they are not related to production costs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) We reallocated CNPP specific research and development costs to reflect the benefits experienced by facilities in Japan and the Netherlands; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

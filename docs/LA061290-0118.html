			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> TEACHER SELECTED FOR NASA PROGRAM  </P> <P> Catharine Bly said she was always an adventurous person, eager to travel and  explore. She's already been to many places on earth, but these days she has her  sights set on outer space.  </P> <P> The 37-year-old bilingual teacher at E.P. Foster Elementary School in Ventura,  was recently selected to participate in the NASA Education Workshop for  Elementary Science Teachers. Next month, she will spend two weeks at the  Stennis Space Center in Mississippi to gain in-depth knowledge of aerospace  education.  </P> <P> A devoted fan of the science-fiction television series Star Trek, Bly's dream  is to someday travel in space. "And I definitely think that that will happen,"  she said.  </P> <P> She said her fascination with space travel began with the 1969 moon landing.  But it wasn't until NASA launched a nationwide search for a teacher to be the  first civilian passenger aboard the space shuttle that her interests took  shape.  </P> <P> "I took one of the applications, but I just didn't have enough of the  qualifications, so I never filled it out," Bly said. "Since then, I've been  working to learn more about aerospace and math and science -- I'll be ready  next time."  </P> <P> Among her new list of accomplishments, Bly holds credentials to keep and show  moon rocks at the school. In addition, she has attended shuttle landing  conferences, leads the Young Astronauts Club after school and is a member of  the California Assn. for Aerospace Education.  </P> <P> "Before I started learning about what's in -- or rather what's not -- in space,  I wasn't very environmentally concerned," Bly said. "But the more I learn about  space and how unique and special our planet is, the more I see how important it  is to preserve it." MAJA RADEVICH  </P></p>

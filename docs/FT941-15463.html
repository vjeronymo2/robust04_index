			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Schwab posts 16% profit rise Charles Schwab, the San Francisco-based discount brokerage house, yesterday announced a 16 per cent improvement in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 29m, or 48 cents a share. The strong final quarter took the firm's full 1993 earnings to a record Dollars 118m, up from Dollars 81m the year before. Schwab also announced that it was raising its quarterly cash dividend from 5 cents to 7 cents a share. Revenues totalled Dollars 258m for the final quarter and Dollars 965m for the year, increases of 33 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Schwab said its record-breaking year was due to a big increase in customer assets, which jumped by Dollars 30.2bn over the 12 months to Dollars 95.8bn. Mr Charles Schwab, chairman, said he was confident the firm would have strong 1994, and set a target for customer assets to rise by another Dollars 30bn by the end of the year. He warned, however, that because the first quarter of 1993 had been exceptionally prosperous, Schwab would have difficulty matching that performance in the first quarter of this year. The firm's share price fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 29 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

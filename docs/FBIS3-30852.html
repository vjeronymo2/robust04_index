			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 8 (CTK) -- While the Civic Democratic  Party (ODS) considers military intervention by the international  community in Bosnia only one of the possible reactions to  Saturday's [5 February] massacre in Sarajevo, the Civic  Democratic Alliance (ODA) continues to support resolute military  intervention, according to the two parties' spokespeople, Jana  Petrova and Jan Rejzek.    Petrova said that the ODS unambiguously condemned the side  who caused the massacre. "This event shattered us. However, it  would be neither suitable nor responsible to use overly strong  words regarding military intervention, which the Czech Republic  would not participate in nor bear its consequences," Petrova  told CTK. It is necessary to consider other measures and  solutions to the situation as well, she added.    Rejzek said that the word "to condemn", only poorly  expressed  ODA's reaction to the massacre. The ODA has been supporting  resolute military intervention in Bosnia for some time, and has  been criticized for this.    "The Black Saturday of Sarajevo definitively opened  everybody's eyes and proved that mere words mean nothing in  solving the situation in the former Yugoslavia," Rejzek added.    Pavel Hirs, chairman of the Liberal Social National Party  (LSNS), told CTK today that the massacre must be condemned as  sharply as possible, and if the offender will be found, he  should be tried and exemplarily punished.    Hirs said that neither the United States nor NATO want to  take a risk, since any military intervention in the region would  mean extended operation of armies, including air forces, and  considerable losses would have to be expected. That is why it  is necessary to seek a political solution acceptable for all  three parties involved in the conflict, as only their political  compromise can lead to reinstalling peace, Hirs said.    Jiri Dienstbier, chairman of the Free Democrats (SD) and the  former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister, said that humanitarian aid  to the wounded and crippled people in Bosnia was necessary, but  it would be more humane to create conditions to prevent people  from being crippled.    Dienstbier, currently visiting Houston, United States, told  CTK through his secretary Vera Uhrova that bombing as well as  any other isolated act or effort toward a partial solution to  the situation would be fruitless.    If the international society wants to take any serious step,  it has to set a clear political goal, no matter if it is  installing peace in multinational Bosnia or the country's  division, Dienstbier said.    However, the community must gather all means and forces  necessary to support its political conclusions, including its  willingness to intervene on the ground to install peace.  "Bombing would make sense only as part of a consistent  strategy," Dienstbier said.</p>

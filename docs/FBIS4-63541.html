			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Kishkin report: "Complaints Against the </F> Government"]    [Text] The latest briefing by Vyacheslav Kostikov, the  Russian Federation president's press secretary, was held  yesterday; it was devoted to current events. He reported in  particular that an important conference is to be held next week  with the government leadership in order to analyze the process  of economic reform and identify weak points in it. The  president had collected a number of sharp criticisms of and even  complaints against the government, the press secretary reported.  He he had already expressed these in a six-hour discussion with  the prime minister a few days ago and now intended to obtain  answers to the questions he had raised. Rumors about an imminent  radical government reshuffle, in particular about the  resignation of A. Chubays, were refuted. Rumors circulated by  certain mass media about the imminent resignation of  Presidential Administration Head S. Filatov were also resolutely  refuted.    The president places a high value on the results of the  signing of the Treaty on Social Accord, V. Kostikov said, which  made it clear that political forces which advocate civil peace  undoubtedly can prevail over the forces of confrontation and  political revenge. The events of 1 and 9 May have shown that  the forces of the hardline opposition are extremely  insignificant. The degree of animosity and the "verbal  extremes" to which certain leaders have resorted testify that  they have no public support and their tactics can increasingly  be compared with those of the Bolsheviks. Naturally this does  not mean that the president cannot see the danger of political  extremism. The tactics of bombing and arson always lead to  destabilization. But the president believes that the extreme  opposition's hopes of revenge are illusory. Russia is already  learning to distinguish politicians from political buffoons. As  for the moderate, constructive opposition, normal discussions  will be conducted with it. A number of meetings with factions  have been scheduled.    As far as relations with the State Duma are concerned, the  president assesses them as favorable and is prepared for  compromises in the spirit of accord, as he has in fact  demonstrated by signing the Law on the Status of Deputies. At  the same time, he cannot fail to see the trial balloons intended  to test the president's tolerance. Some effort by the State  Duma to interfere in matters that are the executive's  prerogative can be observed. Here, V. Kostikov said, we need not  cherish any illusions: The president will not tolerate any  changes in the division of power which is enshrined in the  Constitution. This is not a threat, V. Kostikov stressed, but a  statement of the political experience which the president has  gained from the events preceding October 1993.    Answering journalists' questions, the press secretary  reported that when the president made the decision to relieve S.  Shakhray of his ministerial post he was proceeding on the basis  of the idea that he should concentrate his efforts on  coordinating the numerous areas of political work already under  his control as vice premier -- which is why his resignation from  that post was not accepted. At the same time, V. Kostikov said,  he had instructions from the president to comment on S.  Shakhray's style of work, in particular his tendency to  accumulate too many posts and thus reduces the benefit accruing  in his work. Furthermore, distressing observations have been  made that S. Shakhray's personal political calculations for the  future will never accord with the interests of Russia's  stabilization.    In answer to a question about the prospects of stabilizing  the situation in the North Caucasus, V. Kostikov did not rule  out the possibility of B. Yeltsin's meeting with D. Dudayev.</p>

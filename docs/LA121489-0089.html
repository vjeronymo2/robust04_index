			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS COUNCIL TO VOTE ON GRAFFITI LAW  </P> <P> An ordinance authorizing the public services director of Beverly Hills to  combat graffiti on public and private structures was introduced at Tuesday's  City Council meeting.  </P> <P> The ordinance calls for city crews to remove graffiti from city or public  agency facilities within three working days of its appearance. It also would  authorize the city to remove graffiti from private property between seven and  14 days of sighting if the owner has not eliminated the graffiti.  </P> <P> Councilman Bernard Hecht said: "We've had graffiti in 80 public locations since  December of 1988. That's a lot for any city, and it's surprising to see it in  our city." He added that there had been about 300 incidents of graffiti on  private property in the same period.  </P> <P> The council will vote on the ordinance Jan. 9.  </P></p>

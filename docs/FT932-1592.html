			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Steaming into Bristol THE BULK carrier Pytchley yesterday became the largest ship to enter Bristol's Royal Portbury dock when it delivered 37,000 tonnes of coal to National Power, the electricity generator, at the company's new import facility. The facility, built at a cost of Pounds 80m, is likely to handle much less than its 7m tonnes capacity this year. The government's decision to subsidise output from at least a dozen British pits means that National Power will import only about 1m tonnes this year and a similar amount next year. But the company says the facility has already paid for itself by forcing British Coal to reduce its prices in five-year contracts. The port will also be used to import cars and commodities such as timber and agricultural products. Unloading can take place at 4,000 tonnes an hour compared with a previous rate of 4,000 tonnes a day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential </F> candidate of the Arnulfista Party in the 8 May presidential  elections, in Panama City on 11 May -- recorded]    [Text] Good evening, dear reporters. This evening, I  gathered the Arnulfista Party's National Directorate and  Consultative Board to discuss with them the offer made to me by  Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares of two cabinet ministries in his  administration.    The National Directorate and Consultative Board have issued  the following statement in response to the offer made to the  Arnulfista Party. It is a unanimous decision, and it states:    The National Directorate and Consultative Board of the  Arnulfista Party, faithful to the doctrine and thinking of Dr.  Arnulfo Arias, categorically and definitively reject the  proposal to occupy ministries in the next administration.    The Arnulfista Party's ever upright position will be to  defend, to the utmost consequences, the freedom and democracy  the Panamanian people are enjoying today under the leadership  and guarantees of an Arnulfista administration.    I reiterate that our glorious party's position will be to  carry out a clear, constructive, and patriotic opposition, thus  giving content and solidity to the authentic democracy for which  the civic-minded fought and of which we are the most legitimate  guardians.

I. Dmitriyev, S. P.

The  quasi-stratified medium is considered to be a conducting  structure consisting of homogeneous layers of variable  thickness. Outside the local anomalous area the medium is a  plane-parallel stratified medium with a normal electric  conductivity distribution. When the algorithm is used in  magnetotelluric sounding, the impedance of the field at the  Earth's surface is measured over a wide range of frequencies.  Thus, the electrodynamic problem must be solved for a large  number of wavelengths, which takes a great deal of processor  time. A method is presented to reduce this by a factor of five.  The algorithm is written in FORTRAN 77 for an IBM PC/AT  computer. Figures 2; references 14: 10 Russian, 4 Western.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> WHAT REFORMS IN EAST GERMANY MEAN FOR BUSINESS;  </P> <P> ECONOMICS: SOME ANALYSTS ARE PREDICTING A 'SECOND ECONOMIC MIRACLE' SIMILAR TO  THE POSTWAR RECOVERY. BUT THERE COULD BE SHORT-TERM PROBLEMS.  </P> <P> What does it mean for business that the Berlin Wall is down, figuratively  speaking, and East Germans are free to travel to the West?  </P> <P> There was not much doubt among German economic and financial analysts on Friday  that the end of the Wall promises a great boon to the economy of West Germany  and by extension to all of Europe and the United States.  </P> <P> But there was also an awareness that freedom to travel did not mean  reunification of Germany -- the Soviet Union has ruled out a change of borders.  And there was recognition too that the poverty and backwardness of the 17  million people who live in Communist East Germany pose short-term problems for  West Germany -- the nation of 61 million that, since World War II, has become  one of the world's most prosperous.  </P> <P> Mostly, the hopes ran high for "a second economic miracle," as one financial  analyst put it, recalling the original miracle of West Germany's postwar  recovery. "It means the 1990s will be politically and economically the most  rewarding decade of the 20th Century," said a German banker.  </P> <P> Few mentioned it specifically but for many West Germans the end of the Wall,  like the whole recent process of change in the Soviet Bloc, means the end of  fear. For all its prosperity -- and the presence of American troops -- West  Germany has been the most insecure country in Europe. West German businessmen  became infamous in the 1970s for secretly sending money out of the country,  because they feared an ultimate Soviet invasion. The wealthiest West Germans  built their houses near the autobahn -- to allow for a fast getaway.  </P> <P> Lately such fears have been fading. And they were nowhere in evidence Friday as  traders on the Frankfurt stock exchange eagerly bought up stocks of department  store chains and cement companies, reckoning that newly arriving East Germans  meant a housing and retailing boom. There were predictions that the West German  economy -- the world's fourth largest at $1.8 trillion in gross national  product -- would grow by about $80 billion more in the next year.  </P> <P> Volkswagen will benefit, said some analysts, because East Germans can now  replace their Brebant cars -- "They have a small engine, like a motorcycle,"  sneered a West German.  </P> <P> Just where East Germans would live and do their spending, however, posed an  interesting question. The end of the Wall could mean a slowdown in refugees,  said Heiko Thieme, investment strategist for the Deutsche Bank, West Germany's  largest financial institution. "They will be able to commute to jobs in West  Germany and go home at night to the East," he said. Indeed, officials of East  and West Germany have begun to negotiate increased bus and subway service  between the two zones of Berlin -- the divided city of 3 million.  </P> <P> So sunny prospects of East Germans as new consumers was the dominant theme in  West German reaction.  </P> <P> But there were minor chords of caution too. One was that the problem of  subsidizing and housing East German refugees -- many of whom whom are now  sleeping in West German schools -- would increase inflation in the West German  economy. In fact, while German stocks rose on the Frankfurt exchange, the West  German deutsche mark declined on world currency markets Friday.  </P> <P> Nobody doubted the East Germans were eager to buy -- "some of them come to West  Berlin just to buy bananas and M&amp;Ms," said one observer. But whether they  had the money was another question. So many East German marks are flooding into  West Germany that their value has declined by half in recent days -- from the  equivalent of 6.5 U.S. cents to 3.3 cents.  </P> <P> And as a pool of new labor for the West German industrial machine, the  Easterners have surprisingly few skills, said Hauke Andresen, a vice president  of DG Securities, an arm of the largest West German savings bank. "I know a man  who hired a plumber from the East, but he couldn't work with copper pipes  because they don't have them in East Germany," Andresen said.  </P> <P> Still, there was an underlying confidence that a historic process was under way  and would not be turned back.  </P> <P> Politics and economics were working in tandem to see that that was so. The fact  that money would be needed to help the East Germans meant that the West German  Bundesbank -- and by implication other Western central banks -- would not  tighten money supplies, said a banker. "High interest rates could cause a  setback here."  </P> <P> And several West German financial analysts said the fact that President Bush  was meeting Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on Dec. 2 meant that progress would  continue. "Gorbachev is broke," said a German banker, "he can't admit it but he  needs Bush's help."  </P> <P> But in another sense the thousands of East Germans who have already crossed to  the West and the hundreds of thousands who have marched in East Berlin and  Leipzig tore the openings in the Wall that were being formally dug by West  Berlin municipal employees Friday night. And they also provided the spark that  may make the 1990s a "politically and economically rewarding decade."  </P></p>

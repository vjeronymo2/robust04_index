			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE DEBATES FLAG PROTECTION AMENDMENT  </P> <P> The Senate on Monday debated a constitutional amendment against flag burning  that was killed by the House last week but remained alive with possible  political consequence.  </P> <P> Flag burning, like pornography, was "beyond the Founding Fathers' understanding  of freedom," said Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), calling on the Senate to help send  the amendment to the states for ratification.  </P> <P> "If we tamper with the Bill of Rights on the 200th anniversary of our  Constitution, then we are ultimately diminishing every flag in America," said  Sen. Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.)  </P> <P> Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said  the Senate was engaged in "an attempt to enmesh the flag in politics in the  November elections" rather than in an attempt to protect it.  </P> <P> The House voted 254 to 177 in favor of the flag amendment, 34 votes short of  the two-thirds majority needed. Two-thirds approval is needed in both houses to  send a proposed amendment to the states for ratification.  </P> <P> Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) led the opposition, which portrayed the  amendment as an attack on the Bill of Rights.  </P> <P> Foley said last week he planned no more House votes on the amendment this year.  </P> <P> Still, Senate proponents led by Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) insisted that  their chamber vote on the amendment.  </P></p>

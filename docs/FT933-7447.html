			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Markets rule, OK, for now WHILE WORLD stock markets have bubbled merrily this week, brokers have been looking for historical yardsticks against which to measure the valuation of equities. For what it is worth, history seems to suggest that prices are higher, in relation to earnings, than they were at comparable stages after the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s. But in reality the yardsticks are distorted. These earlier recessions were about a combination of stagnation and inflation. The present stock market surge has everything to do with disinflation and falling interest rates. All instinct suggests that the markets will become still more overvalued by historic standards before they run into a correction. This assertion is based on the working assumption that the downward trend in interest rates has further to go, at least in Europe, and that the penalty for holding cash in a low interest rate environment will continue to encourage people to divert savings into equity markets. But can the present level of markets be justified on a longer-term view of economic prospects? The trouble here is that conflicting signals are emerging from the bond and equity markets. Traditionally, rising bond prices signal expectations of deflation, while rising equity prices anticipate economic growth. Yet bonds and equities have been rising together in recent months. The implication might be that, while equities are behaving in orthodox fashion at the start of an economic upturn, fixed-interest bonds are going through a sea-change in the basis of valuation. Long bond yields in Britain, the US, France and Germany are all in a narrow 6-7 1/2 per cent band, which suggests a remarkably uniform and sanguine view of inflation. The message is that investors believe that the world is heading for a period of sustained, non-inflationary growth. What is more, the market prophecy is partly self-fulfilling. Power shift Consider the inflationary side of the equation. After a decade in which ideologically inclined governments have removed one constraint on markets after another, political and economic power has shifted between different groups within society. The retreat from the commitment to full employment, together with the political assault on trade unions, has undermined the power of organised labour to the point where wage inflation has virtually ceased to exist in the tradeable goods sectors of most developed world economies. At the same time the ability of governments to monetise debt - in the vernacular, to print money - has been eroded by the liberalisation of global markets. If the threat of default by inflation looks remotely real, currencies weaken, bond prices fall and the cost of government financing goes up. This pre-emptive shock treatment does not mean that governments will cease in future to inflate their way out of trouble. But because the deterrent exists, it imposes a starker choice on politicians between the current low inflation and the very high inflation that would result if the markets shunned public sector IOUs, so forcing governments to turn to the banking system for inflationary financing. The point is that the policing activity of the bond markets tends to eliminate the inflationary middle ground. Not infallible As for growth, the markets' ability to impose their will on economic policymakers was once again in evidence this week. The pressure of a soaring yen, which was temporarily reined in after intervention by the US Fed on Thursday, has forced the ruling Japanese coalition to contemplate further fiscal loosening. It is also embracing structural reforms to ensure that the ill-used Japanese consumer derives some benefit from the falling cost of imports. This case of market-induced growthmanship follows the earlier assault on France's franc fort policy, which opened the way to lower interest rates and reflation in continental Europe. The snag in all this is that markets are not infallible. If, for example, the world is moving towards an economic boom based on rapid industrialisation in China and other parts of Asia, commodity price inflation could easily return. Union power is invariably weak in a recession; in an economic recovery it may emerge that the strength of organised labour has been underestimated. The markets' judgment about the pressure on public finances and the readiness of individual countries to default on their debts through inflation may prove over-optimistic. The markets are unquestionably right in their judgment that liberalisation has changed the rules of the economic game. But what has not changed is the age-old truth that interest rates can go up, as well as down. Until there are more tangible signs that monetary policy is tightening, or alternatively that governments are failing to validate market assumptions about looser policy by cutting interest rates, the stock market party still has some zest in it. The risks may be high, but the cash alternative looks unpalatable.</p>

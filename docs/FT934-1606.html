			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Pinault-Printemps in FFr540m sale Pinault-Printemps, the heavily indebted French retail group, is continuing its capital raising programme by raising FFr540m (Dollars 91.8m) through the sale of its property interests to Unibail, one of France's largest property and leasing concerns. The two companies have agreed terms for a complicated deal whereby Unibail will pay FFr540m to take a 60 per cent stake in Societe Immobiliere Provence, a subsidiary of Pinault-Printemps that owns a number of the group's properties. The properties controlled by Societe Immobiliere Provence include one of the buildings at the flagship Printemps department store on rue Caumartin in the 9th arrondissement of Paris and the neighbouring Prisunic store. Pinault-Printemps has for two years been trying to reduce the debt incurred when Pinault, the industrial group led by Mr Francois Pinault, mounted a controversial FFr5.3bn partial bid for Au Printemps, the prestigious retail group that includes the La Redoute mail order business as well as its eponymous department stores. The debt reduction programme has included aggressive asset sales and complex deals to restructure Pinault-Printemps's loans negotiated with Credit Lyonnais, the group's main banker. The Unibail transaction brings the total raised from asset sales by Pinault-Printemps in 1993 to over FFr5bn, thereby reducing its net debt to around FFr13bn by the year end. However, the group's operations have been affected by the French recession. It recently confirmed that it expected a fall in operating profits to FFr2bn in 1993 from FFr2.8bn in 1992. Despite the pressures on Pinault-Printemps, Mr Pinault has continued to pursue personal deals, including this summer's FFr690m acquisition of Chateau Latour, one of the finest Bordeaux wines. He has also expressed interest in Fnac, France's leading books and music retailer.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / ITT to raise Dollars 4bn by sale of financial subsidiary ITT, the US conglomerate cited as a possible buyer of General Electric's NBC television network, is planning to raise up to Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) by selling its financial services subsidiary. Although ITT refused to comment publicly, it is believed that the company has decided to fund a big push into the leisure and entertainment industry by selling ITT Financial, a middle-ranking US finance company. ITT hopes the sale will bring in between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn. That would go a long way towards matching the sum of nearly Dollars 5bn that Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, is reported to have offered GE for NBC. Alternatively, ITT could offer GE its financial services division in part exchange for NBC. GE might be interested because its financial services arm, GE Capital, is in some of the same business areas as ITT Financial. ITT Financial offers a range of financial services to businesses and individuals, including commercial equipment and real estate loans, small business loans, home mortgages, consumer loans and related insurance products. Last year it made net profits of Dollars 205m on revenues of Dollars 1.44bn. The parent company is understood to be selling ITT Financial because it wants to achieve a more even balance between its financial services operations - also comprising the Hartford insurance group, which is not being sold - and its other two main activities: leisure and entertainment, including the Sheraton hotels group, and manufacturing, including an auto parts business. ITT's reported interest in NBC follows a series of moves aimed at expanding the group's leisure and entertainment interests. Last month, in partnership with Cablevision Systems, a US cable television company, it bought the Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment complex for Dollars 1.1bn, and the company is in the process of taking over Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group. Other recent moves include the unveiling of plans earlier this year for a Dollars 750m, 3,500-room casino and hotel complex called the Desert Kingdom in Las Vegas. ITT is one of a number of suitors reported to be interested in buying NBC following the recent disclosure that GE had had talks with Time Warner, the US information and entertainment group, about a possible sale of all or part of the television network.

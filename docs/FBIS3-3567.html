The director, a  cool-headed and fast-talking official, readily consented.  "Thanks to the kind attention and support of the regional party  committee and regional government as well as relevant  departments, and through the joint efforts of all tax officers,  Tibet has carried out tax reform in an orderly way and achieved  some initial success," said the director with a big smile. He  pointed out: Last year Tibet collected a record 210 million  yuan in tax revenue. Despite this gratifying achievement, we  should not be optimistic. We have to work still harder in order  to keep our tax reform in step with the reform of the economic  structure nationwide.    The director said: The ongoing reform of the industrial and  commercial tax system is an important measure aimed at meeting  the requirements for establishing a socialist market economic  structure and introducing separate central and local taxation  systems. Tibet's existing industrial and commercial tax system  was generally based on the structure and mode of industrial and  commercial consolidated tax from the fifties. While the  national tax system has already undergone major changes on  several occasions, only minor changes were implemented in the  regional system. As a result, the system in Tibet was confusing  for laymen and experts alike. The system, which is neither  rational nor standardized, was divorced from the national tax  system and hindered Tibet's participation in the nationally  unified market and international economic activities. In order  to make tax reform a success, the Regional Taxation Bureau began  preparations for drafting a regional tax reform program last  July by organizing tax officers to go down to grass-roots units  to investigate the results of experimentation with separate tax  systems at selected enterprises as well as tax burdens of  individual industrial and commercial units. After in-depth and  systematic analyses of the investigation results and a dozen  revisions of the draft with arduous efforts for several months,  a regional tax reform program was produced.    When asked by the reporters about the features of the  regional taxation reform, the director spoke with fervor and  assurance: 1) While sticking to the basic framework of national  tax reform, the regional program has made appropriate  adaptations in light of Tibet's realities, specifically  differing in terms of the scope of individual tax categories;  postponing, retaining, and canceling tax categories; expenses  and deductions; taxable amounts and tax rates; and tax  reductions and exemptions. The number of tax categories has  been cut back by 50 percent from 18 to nine to show special  consideration for the ethnic region. 2) After reform, the tax  categories are more in line with the requirements for  establishing a socialist market economy. For example, the  existing industrial and commercial tax is separated; state  enterprises are required to pay taxes plus a percentage of  profits; income tax rates for enterprises are lowered; the  regulatory tax and collection of funds for construction of  energy and transportation projects are cancelled; and the  original individual income tax, individual income regulatory  tax, and individual industrial and commercial household tax are  merged as one individual income tax, which is levied on every  member of society. Furthermore, the scope of resource tax is  broadened; and the original wool and woolen fabric purchase tax  is expanded to cover animal products and timber, medicinal  herbs, and other farm, forestry, and animal husbandry products.  These reform measures can promote fair competition and meet the  requirements of market economy. 3) Under the new tax system,  though the number of taxable items has increased, the original  preferential policies are retained. As a result, the overall  tax burden remains the same, thus ensuring the vested interests  of peasants and herdsmen. By not adding even the slightest tax  burden on peasants and herdsmen at large, the tax reform program  reflects the feature of broad-range but low-rate taxation  system. 4) The new tax system reflects the continuity of some  previous preferential policies. The regional government's  preferential treatments to foreign-funded enterprises remain  unchanged; and except for a few items, tax exemptions for  private enterprises and individual industrial and commercial  units set up by peasants and herdsmen as well as village and  town enterprises in farming and pastoral areas will continue  until the end of this century. Tax reductions and exemptions  will continue to be granted to urban collectively-owned  productive and processing enterprises; to collective enterprises  set up by surplus personnel, disabled people, and the aged; and  to certain qualified enterprises of tertiary industry. 5) As a  result of the tax reform, the regional people's government has  granted some benefits to prefectures, cities, and counties,  thereby readjusting their financial revenue structure and  building up their capability to become financially  self-sufficient. As the reporters wound up the interview,  Director Ci Nuo declared with confidence: "So long as all tax  officers heighten their spirits, the new tax system can be  smoothly implemented in Tibet."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Anto Djapic, Croatian Rights Party vice </F> chairman, by Vlado Vurusic at Djapic's office in the Croatian  Assembly building; date not given: "`Mladen Tuta Naletilic Is  Responsible for Destruction of the Mosque in Livno!'"]    [Text] Anto Djapic, Assembly deputy and vice chairman of  the HSP [Croatian Rights Party], who together with Karlo  Varjacic, chairman of the HSP Supervisory Committee, and Velimir  Kvesic, an official from party headquarters, was severely beaten  on Sunday, 1 May in Siroki Brijeg, which he accuses soldiers of  the controversial Herzegovinan commander Naletilic of doing,  alleges in an interview with GLOBUS that Mladen Tuta Naletilic  is responsible for the destruction of the mosque in Livno.    Mladen Tuta Naletilic is the commander of a unit known as  the  "Legion of Honor." He and the semiliterate General Ivan Andabak  take orders from the top leadership of so-called Herceg-Bosna,  but they in turn get their orders from Zagreb: This is the  Zagreb-Herzegovina vertical. The Herzegovina police has not  dared even to launch an investigation into the attack on the HSP  leadership. If it were not for General Roso, Herzegovina's UDBA  [former Yugoslav State Security Administration] and KOS [former  Yugoslav Counterintelligence Service] agents and criminals would  have recommenced the war with the Muslims.    The recent brutal attack on the leadership of the HSP--at a  rally in Siroki Brijeg--when Karlo Varjacic (chairman of the  party's Supervisory Committee), Velimir Kvesic (official from  headquarters), and HSP vice chairman Anto Djapic were beaten  black and blue with baseball bats, mallets, and pistol handles,  has elicited a great deal of interest, especially since Djapic  has said that the government of Herceg-Bosna, the Croatian state  leadership, and the Croatian minister of defense are responsible  for the attack.    We spoke with Anto Djapic about this occurrence and about  his  opinion on the situation in Herceg-Bosna at his office in the  Assembly building. Anto Djapic walks cautiously; the  consequences of the beating are obvious....    [Vurusic] What happened at your party's rally in Siroki  Brijeg?    [Djapic] That was an example of an assassination attempt.  One  slap is enough to qualify it as that, given our position in the  Assembly, let alone when the attack is carried out by 50 armed  people, some of whom were in uniform. The attack was  painstakingly planned and has a strong political background. I  believe that an explanation of this incident is due from not  only the government of so-called Herceg-Bosna, but also, and  most of all, from the Croatian state leadership. If they do not  speak up, that I will feel like "he who remains silent agrees  with what happened."    For days, we were warned by Tuta Naletilic's people not to  go  to Siroki Brijeg, that we could go there but that we would not  leave alive, and so on. Nor does that surprise me about him.  Ruffians from his unit (which, ironically, is known as the  "Legion of Honor") frighten and terrorize the local population.    We decided precisely for that reason to go and hold a rally  there, to restore the people's hope, but we knew very well who  was waiting for us there and what all could happen to us. We  wanted to dispel the fear among the local population, fear that  has insinuated itself into them because of the precarious  conditions under which they live.    [Vurusic] What is happening in Herzegovina?    [Djapic] A dictatorship in power there. Especially in Siroki  Brijeg. UDBA and KOS agents are still wreaking havoc. There are  only two people in the government of so-called Herceg-Bosna who  were not employees of those two notorious services.    We arrived there as an alternative, which naturally bothered  them, so they wanted to frighten us and other potential party  leaders who were planning to go to Herzegovina. The situation  there--and the attitude of the people toward the local  authorities--is such that I have the impression that any  alternative political option would win if elections were held in  Herzegovina today.    Herzegovina today is fertile ground for crime, smuggling,  wartime profiteers.... They have arrived from all directions,  and against the will of the vast majority of Herzegovinans. All  the political riff-raff from the former regime has remained in  power there. However, to make things worse, nothing in  Herzegovina happens by accident.... The Herzegovinans are  despondent!!!    [Vurusic] Are the people in Herceg-Bosna opposed to  implementation of the Washington agreement on a federation  between the Croat and Bosniak nations?    [Djapic] The people want the agreement to be implemented.  This policy of various Tutas and Andabaks in so-called  Herceg-Bosna represents a desire to dash the Washington  agreement. Because the smugglers and criminal structures there  do not want peace between Muslims and Croats; peace means that  there will not longer be as much lawlessness (and you must know  that some people have managed to turn over hundreds of thousands  of German marks a day) and that all the facts will finally be  learned, because of which they want to channel the people's  dissatisfaction toward the Muslims, not toward eradicating crime  of unseen proportions.    They accuse us in the HSP of having come to scheme against  the Washington agreement, which is ridiculous. The HSP has  always advocated an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina and opposed the  fighting between Croats and Muslims, and that is even the core  of the HSP program principles. They want to block implementation  of the agreement, because it is clear to them that as soon as  the federation comes to life, Tuta and his ilk will be put on  trial for war crimes. They are steeped in blood and there is no  turning back for them!    Herzegovina is the backbone of our nation-building ideal and  that is why they had to impose a reign of terror there, to  compromise both the Herzegovinans and the nation-building ideal  itself. They have indeed been partially successful in that, so  that in some parts of Croatia a certain animosity has arisen  toward Herzegovinans. We must not be duped by the tricks of a  handful of UDBA and KOS agents! These people are "as thick as  thieves" with Karadzic and Vucurovic, with whom they trade and  smuggle.... The other 95 percent of Herzegovinans are for the  agreement, democracy, and peace.    [Vurusic] You said that the policy of the HR [Croat Republic  of] Herceg-Bosna is being guided from Zagreb?    [Djapic] Yes. But it is not that simple. Actually, our  policy  is turned around and refracted in Herzegovina, it is the key to  the solution to our problems there. If things were put in order  in the so-called HR Herceg-Bosna, if the current group of  politicians were to leave, things would change in Zagreb too! We  must undertake the transfiguration of Herzegovina for the sake  of our own lives.    The top-most state leadership in Croatia, and thus even  President Tudjman, is answerable for the fact that it is not  disassociating itself from these sorts of occurrences that are  rocking Herzegovina. I expect both President Tudjman and  Minister Susak to say something about the attack on us in Siroki  Brijeg, because the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] is in  power there!    [Vurusic] You mentioned Mladen Tuta Naletilic and Ivan  Andabak as the men who ordered the attack. Why?    [Djapic] Ivan Andabak is a semiliterate man with the rank of  general, Naletilic is an executioner. Mladen Tuta is a so-called  emigre with a dubious past and employer. I say "so-called  emigre" because after the first elections many people returned  who had been sent abroad by UDBA. The majority of emigres who  joined the Croat government--both here and in Herzegovina--are  former UDBA agents, previously infiltrated into Croatian emigree  circles.    Moreover, Tuta was also directly involved in the murder of  our knight, HOS [Croatian Defense Force--armed wing of HSP]  commander Blaze Kraljevic. He has built a house above Siroki  Brijeg worth several million German marks. Where did he get that  much money? He gives orders to Andabak, the leadership of  so-called Herceg-Bosna gives orders to Naletilic, and they get  their orders from Zagreb. This is the Zagreb-Herzegovina  vertical!    This Naletilic is an officer (but no gentleman) in the HVO  [Croat Defense Council]. The fact that the Ministry of Defense  reported the attack on us to the HVO clearly indicates their  involvement. Why is the local police not saying anything--it has  not even begun an investigation, much less dared to undertake  anything concrete.    [Vurusic] Do you think that the HVO leadership is behind the  attack? Are you also accusing General Ante Roso?    [Djapic] No, Gen. Roso is not connected to this. He is one  of  the rare people in the leadership of the so-called HR  Herceg-Bosna who genuinely supports implementation of the  Washington agreement. If it were not for him, these KOS and UDBA  people would have already recommenced the war with the Muslims.  Moreover, I think that Tuta is also responsible for the  destruction of the Livno mosque 10 days ago. Tuta is the lord of  Herzegovina, the lord of life and death in that region of ours.    [Vurusic] You said that Naletilic and Andabak are only the  executors of someone's orders? Could you be more specific and  say whose orders?    [Djapic] It is no secret that Tuta is a favorite of Mr.  Gojko  Susak! Still, I do not want to prejudice the matter. That is why  I call upon the minister of defense of the RH [Republic of  Croatia] to make a statement. Let him confirm or refute my  suspicions. We spoke on Monday, right before the press  conference. Her asked me what was going on. I told him that he  was in a better position to tell me what was actually going on.  And why! He had no answer for me!    I will raise this question at the next session of the  Assembly. I have already asked the president of the Assembly  House of Representatives, Stipe Mesic, to put this subject on  the agenda of the next session.    [Vurusic] You always call the HR Herceg-Bosna "so-called  Herceg-Bosna." How did the people attending your rallies  throughout Herzegovina react to that?    [Djapic] Our rallies in Tomislavgrad and Grude were  extraordinary, well-attended, and we got an exceptionally warm  reception. The people know our positions, they know that we  support the Washington agreement. It is a little ridiculous that  we, as an opposition party, have to go around Herzegovina  promoting the agreement that Tudjman signed while his people  attack and kick us. Moreover, why would the prefix "so-called"  offend them? Since the Washington agreement the HR Herceg-Bosna  has no longer existed, there are only cantons or zupas and  velezupas. They signed the Washington agreement that abolishes  this entity, and now they are acting as if it still exists. It  is ridiculous that we from the HSP are working on promoting the  Washington agreement, instead of Vukojevic or Milas, and the  so-called HDZ right wing. But ultimately we must ask ourselves:  Is the Washington agreement Croatian state policy? I hope that  it is, but after everything that has happened to us I am  beginning to doubt that. But we were there and we will go back.  Our rally in Siroki Brijeg was not finished, and I am someone  who finishes all his business. We have to go down there without  fear, even if it means getting hurt. Because I know that they  will not stop at beating us. We must not lose Herzegovina! Let  Budisa and Racan go to Herzegovina, if necessary--at the same  time! We must show that there is an alternative, that democracy  and a multiparty system must ultimately come there too.    At the rally, I managed to say: "Gentlemen, we have come  here  to show you that we are not afraid. We have shown that we are  even willing to die for the Independent State of Croatia." We  cannot open fire on Croats, even though they wanted to provoke  us into doing that.    [Vurusic] You have brought up the suspicion that Minister of  Defense Gojko Susak is behind the attack on you and your party  colleagues. However, in the Assembly you recently defending him  when the opposition sought his dismissal because of the  explosion in Duboki Jarak.    [Djapic] I said that he is responsible until he makes a  statement. That is disinformation by news commentators,  including yours at GLOBUS. This is a question of principle. The  opposition must unite around key questions, not around less  important ones.    [Vurusic] There are reports that now, after the split in the  HDZ and the departure of Stipe Mesic and Josip Manolic from the  party, the HSP will become a coalition partner of the HDZ,  because you are close to its right wing, which is now in the  majority....    [Djapic] That is fantasy. Moreover, I no longer even know  what the HDZ is. We have a neutral stance toward the conflict  within the HDZ.    [Vurusic] Do you think that the Washington agreement is in  danger and that the fighting between Croats and Muslims could  resume?    [Djapic] I am afraid that that could happen. The people in  power in Herceg-Bosna are the same ones who initiated the  fighting. Because of their whims, our young people perished at  Vakuf and Vitez, instead of fighting the Serbs with our combined  forces, instead of defending the corridor, which was closed.  What would there be of so-called Krajina and the so-called  republic of Srpska today if the corridor had remained in our  hands? We would be at the Drina today! The bombing of the mosque  in Livno and the attack on us, as representatives of a party  that has supported the alliance with the Muslims the whole time,  is the best indication of how much individual leaders of  so-called Herceg-Bosna do not want the Washington agreement to  succeed.... They are defending their positions, not the position  of the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They are thwarting  the multiparty system in Herzegovina! But they will not halt the  arrival of democracy to Herzegovina with one beating. We must  settle scores with this gang. The entire government of so-called  Herceg-Bosna is responsible for this situation.    [Vurusic] Does the thing that is conditionally called the  Herzegovinan lobby exist?    [Djapic] I do not believe such reports. That is an erroneous  expression, which compromises Herzegovina. The leadership of the  HDZ is behind the attack on us, the ones who formulate policy  toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Because we are their stained  conscience.    If they are for the Washington agreement, why not dismiss  those people who are undermining it? Or rather, why does Tudjman  not go to Herzegovina to promote the agreement? That would  reassure the local population, which is not guilty of anything,  but is living in fear.    I would clip the wings of that gang of criminals that is in  power. The government of so-called Herceg-Bosna was not able to  prevent the bombing of the Livno mosque, but it was able to  prevent--in hooligan fashion--our rally in Siroki Brijeg. We  have had enough of the Herzegovinans paying the price of flawed  policies, lost wars, suffering at Bleiburg. We do not need  another Bleiburg!</p>

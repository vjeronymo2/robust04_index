			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurer sells Zeneca WORRIES that Zeneca's Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, which closes on June 21, could yet run into more turbulence were heightened yesterday when the mighty Prudential insurance group revealed it had reduced its stake in the recently-demerged bioscience arm of ICI to below 3 per cent. Marketmakers were poised to shift their quotations as the news spread through the dealing rooms but very little selling pressure in fact ensued. Zeneca 'old' shares, which dipped to 614p before the Prudential news was known, eventually closed a fraction easier at 616p on turnover of 4.5m. The 'new' nil-paid shares, in which the Pru was said to have carried out most of the selling, eased 2 to 18p, after 17p, with 6.5m shares changing hands. It later emerged that the Pru had sold less than one per cent of Zeneca stock, or some 5.8m shares. Mr Hugh Jenkins, chief executive of Prudential Portfolio Managers, said 'Some of the investment funds managed by the Prudential have been rebalancing their portfolios in the health and household sector. This has resulted in a reduction of their Zeneca nil-paid rights. However the Prudential will be taking up the majority of its rights and is supportive of the issue.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP) cannot come to agree with the ruling coalition on key  policies that would bring the party back to the coalition fold,  SDP [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] General Secretary  Wataru Kubo said Friday [24 June].    Kubo told reporters the SDP handed down its position in a  second round of meetings with coalition parties held Friday  evening.    Kubo said the SDP and the coalition parties were unable to  reach agreement on tax reform despite detailed discussions, with  the ruling coalition calling for a consumption tax hike while  the SDP is opposed to such a move.    Although it is not impossible to find ways to reach an  agreement on tax reform, kubo said it is difficult considering  the time limit under the current political situation.    The SDP and the ruling coalition parties also remained at  odds over the resignation of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and the  formation of a new government, he said.    "We heard that the leaders of the ruling coalition parties  agreed earlier in the day that the cabinet's resignation is  unnecessary," Kubo said.    "We consider that to mean that they cannot accept SDP  demands" for the cabinet to resign en masse and to then form a  new coalition government, he said.    Kubo said it is "truly regrettable" but the SDP has reached  a  conclusion that it cannot agree with the ruling parties on  policies that are crucial for the SDP's return to the government.    He said, however, that the SDP and the coalition parties  will  hold talks again later in the day, after the coalition side  meets to discuss the SDP's stance.    "But our stance is final," Kubo said.    Asked whether the SDP will support a no-confidence motion  against the Hata government, which was submitted Thursday by the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Kubo said the party is undecided.    Hata indicated Thursday that he is ready to resign with his  ministers if it is necessary to bring the second largest  opposition SDP back to the coalition. The SDP left the  coalition in April.    Hata told a news conference he will leave everything,  including his resignation, to the negotiations between the  coalition parties and the SDP.    Hata also met SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama Thursday night  in an unsuccessful attempt to tide over the political crisis.    The two-month old minority coalition and the SDP held two  rounds of negotiations Friday in the morning and in the evening.    Meanwhile, LDP President Yohei Kono vowed to pass the no-  confidence motion against Hata's government and bring his party  back to power.    The LDP lost its nearly four-decades-long grip on power last  August.    At a general meeting of parliamentarians from both houses of  the Diet, Kono blasted the coalition, saying it has lost  international respect for its "irresponsibleness."    He said the coalition government has not implemented any  policies and leaves everything to the bureaucrats.</p>

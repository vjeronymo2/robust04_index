If the credit losses were excluded from the results, SEB said it would have lifted profits by SKr1.625bn to SKr7.86bn. SEB's rate of return on equity after tax was 7.6 per cent last year, down from 11.8 per cent in 1990, while earnings per share dropped to SKr4.50 from SKr7.61. The dividend for series A and C shares is rising to SKr3.35 from SKr3,30 within the framework of an unchanged dividend cost to the company of SKr883m. Credit losses were SKr4.76bn last year, 1.5 per cent of all loans and a 144 per cent increase over the SKr1.95bn of 1990. Year-end unsettled claims were SKr5.5bn.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Evolutionary, not revolutionary, approach at Elf - Philippe Jaffre has run the oil group for a year, guiding it through the first stages of privatisation A tanker cannot turn on a sixpence, and it takes time to steer a new course at one of the world's leading oil groups. That is the message from Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman of Elf Aquitaine, France's largest industrial concern, after one year at the helm and seven months after having guided his charge through privatisation. That is also the message from first-half results, which showed a decline of 10 per cent in net profits to FFr1.2bn (Dollars 222m). A boost from the company's chemicals activities in the second quarter meant the result was better than expected after a profits warning in June. But Elf is still looking at another year of relatively meagre pickings, compared with the FFr10.6bn at which net profits peaked in 1990. Part of the explanation for the decline in profits lies in adverse conditions which have confronted all of the international oil majors - the fall in the oil price which continued into the first half of the year, pressure on refining margins and, for non-US groups, the weakness in the dollar. But Elf also faces structural problems which have sapped its powers of resistance. 'When you have any structural problem, it takes time and a lot of effort to remedy,' says Mr Jaffre. The problem is the legacy of an expensive and ambitious expansion strategy in the early 1990s, which included the acquisition of the North Sea assets of Occidental of the US and stakes in diverse companies such as Bidermann, the textiles group. The strategy left Elf with a rising debt burden, which totalled FFr52bn at the end of last year, increased financial charges and a declining return on capital, which fell from 13 per cent in 1989 to 4 per cent at the end of last year. In an attempt to reverse the trend, Mr Jaffre is pursuing a strategy of debt reduction, tighter controls on investments and a focus on the group's three core business areas - oil, chemicals and healthcare. But he is implementing his strategy through an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary approach, avoiding announcements of aggressive cost-cutting. The approach has prompted impatience among some investors. 'I think that a lot of people who bought shares in Elf when it was privatised were buying for the upside potential of a big restructuring similar to what has happened at companies like BP,' says one analyst at a US securities company. 'There is a feeling that Mr Jaffre is moving in the right direction but they haven't heard much to convince them of a big rationalisation effort.' Mr Jaffre is aware of such sentiments. 'I know that Anglo-Saxon investors adore it when big cost-cutting plans are announced,' he says. However, the Elf chief argues that such an approach is inefficient in the case of French industry and that the measures being implemented at Elf, without fanfare, are beginning to bear fruit. On the first count, Mr Jaffre claims that the best way to prevent a restructuring plan in a French company is to announce it in advance. 'If I was to declare a big cost-cutting plan then there would be resistance.' The Elf chairman argues that French industry has made significant progress in reducing costs and increasing efficiency in recent years without high-profile restructuring announcements. He cites Renault, the automobile group, and Saint Gobain, the glass and building materials company, as well as Elf's own chemicals opera-tions, which saw profits treble in the first half of the year. For Elf as a whole, he argues that significant reforms have also been put in place over the past nine months, attacking the company's cost base and improving efficiency. Investment spending this year is to be reduced by 20 per cent to FFr32bn. The FFr15bn spent in the first half shows the company is on course to reach this objective. Elf's participation in the Leuna refinery project in eastern Germany has been cut from a majority stake to 43 per cent, after a test of strength with the Treuhand privatisation agency. The company has also embarked on an asset sale programme aimed at realising net receipts of FFr5bn this year. Mr Jaffre says the target is within reach. Receipts in the first half amounted to FFr1.5bn, including the sale of Elf's stake in Havas, the media and publishing group. Another FFr2bn should be realised by the end of this quarter, and a further FFr3bn or so by the year-end. Against this could be offset about FFr1bn through an investment in Renault, a close partner of Elf, should the vehicle group be privatised. The sale of assets will help ease Elf's debt burden, which Mr Jaffre says has stabilised and should start to decline from next year. But although he is a former head of Credit Agricole, one of France's biggest banks, he denies he is taking a purely financial approach at his new charge. 'I didn't start by saying I must cut debts at the group, which would have been a bit reductionist. I started by saying that we must re-establish the profitability of the group and to do this we must concentrate on our core businesses. As a consequence we can sell assets and reduce debts.' Financial charges are expected to start falling from 1995, when most analysts see the potential for a healthy rise in profits. Until then, the debt burden and the weakness in the dollar will offset, partly at least, the gains from a higher second-half oil price and stronger profits from chemicals and healthcare operations. Measures are also being taken to increase the emphasis on profitability among the company's 90,000 employees. Mr Jaffre denies that radical measures are needed to shake up the culture of the group. 'Elf already has a taste for performance and development which is shown by the fact that it has gone from nowhere 50 years ago to rank among the world's 30 biggest companies today.' However, he says he is seeking to add a bit of 'mustard' to staff attitudes through expanding employee share ownership and introducing stock options for senior executives, a scheme which is being discussed by Elf's board. Such Anglo-Saxon measures, he feels, will sharpen Elf's competitive edge. For British and US investors, however, it is a trace of mustard at the bottom line which is awaited.</p>

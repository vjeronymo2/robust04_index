			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SOME BEST FRIEND: Canine relations are part of a mail carrier's lot, but a San  Fernando Valley postman took matters to extremes when he shot a dog on his  route (A29). . . . Orange County mail carriers, who aren't allowed to carry  guns, sustained 75 dog bites in the last year, most from small dogs. . . . The  biggest hospital bill ever paid for an injured carrier was $16,000. . . . At  least two local carriers have become permanently disabled because of bites and  were entitled to at least two-thirds of their annual pay in disability pension.  Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

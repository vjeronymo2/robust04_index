			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Horsing about with ecology Sir, Does Mr Richard Stead (Letters, July 27) feed his two horses coal? Do they drink petroleum and breathe natural gas? The carbon dioxide that upsets the balance of the atmosphere is from fossil carbon that has been out of the atmosphere for millions of years. The carbon dioxide his horses exhale is just returning to the atmosphere carbon extracted from it by growing hay and grain only a few months earlier. Before Mr Stead disparages 'ecologists' concerned about climate change, he had better learn some ecology. Walt Patterson, Garden Court, Hervines Road, Amersham, Bucks HP6 5HS</p>

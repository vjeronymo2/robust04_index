			<p>CSO     [Text] As of Fiscal Yearend 1993, First Decline in  Loans and First Increase in Deposits in Three Years Recorded by  City Banks    According to the flash report of deposits and loans issued  by  the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan on the 11th,  the total loans of the 11 city banks outstanding as of the end  of fiscal year 1993 (end of March 1994) was 221.9725 trillion  yen, reflecting a drop of 0.6 percent from the prior year. This  was the first decline since the survey was started in 1954.  These figures clearly indicate that demand for funds have  remained in the doldrums both on the corporate and private  individual level owing to a decline in capital investments and  consumption because of the recession. Some quarters also point  to the reluctance of banks to issue new loans.    Aside from city banks, the seven trust and banking  companies'  loans outstanding stood at 25.4258 trillion yen, an increase of  4.1 percent over the prior year. The three long-term credit  banks' loans outstanding stood at 47.4462 trillion yen, a drop  of 0.2 percent from the prior year. Even the combined loans  outstanding for city banks, trust and banking companies and  long-term credit banks showed a 0.1-percent drop from the prior  year, the first such decline since initiation of the survey.    On the other hand, deposits at the 11 city banks as of the  end of fiscal year 1993 stood at 196.168 trillion yen,  reflecting a 2.0-percent increase from the prior year, the first  increase in three years. Time deposits centered around large  accounts declined, but corporate deposits and individual demand  deposits increased.    Preliminary estimates of outstanding debentures issued as of  the end of fiscal year 1993 by long-term credit banks reflected  a balance of 51.3323 trillion yen, a 0.9-percent decline from  the prior year. Trust and banking company deposits outstanding  stood at 10.919 trillion yen, an increase of 4.9 percent from  the prior year.</p>

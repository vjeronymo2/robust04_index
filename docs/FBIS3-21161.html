			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takeshi Masaki, Production Engineering Lab, </F> Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.]    [Text]  <H5>  Abstract </H5>   Micro-electro-discharge machining (micro-EDM) is used for  micro-processing in many fields, mainly for high precision  boring of microholes in the nozzles of ink jet printers, etc.  Recently we developed two new models, the ultramicro-EDM MG-ED71  for boring and MG-ED51 for shaft processing. Using both machines  we can bore microholes up to 5m in diameter with highly  precise positioning resolution of 0.1m.    The boring machine is mainly for high precision boring of  microholes, but it also has 3-axis NC functions and can be used  as a milling machine to form three-dimensional microshapes. The  shaft processing machine was developed for the purpose of  automatically forming the tool electrodes for the boring  machine. It uses wire electro-discharge grinding (WEDG), and can  form microshafts as small as 5m thanks to its high precision  positioning mechanism and highly stable microwire feed control.    In addition to its high precision micro-EDM capability, the  MG-ED71 can easily penetrate sheet thicknesses up to ten times  greater than the hole diameter, although an aspect ratio of more  than five times greater than the hole diameter has been very  difficult to bore in the past. In addition, boring of holes  0.1-0.3mm in diameter, which has been quite time-consuming in  the past, can easily be accomplished with high precision in a  relatively short period of time. Surely, the applications of  micro-EDM will grow in the field of micromachining.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Electronic equipment such as AV equipment and computer  peripheral devices are becoming smaller and smaller. This  equipment is not only becoming more compact, but users are  demanding high-quality performance such as greater accuracy and  density at the same time. The micronization of mechanical parts,  which has lagged behind the micronization of electronic parts,  and the development of high-precision technology to manufacture  these mechanical parts have become urgent needs.    Machining dies at an aspect ratio of 5-10 times has become  necessary to provide both micronization and strength. Moreover,  although drills were used before, micro-EDM has become  increasingly popular for boring of holes 0.1-0.3mm in diameter  because of its high quality since it does not produce burrs, and  because it is very accurate in terms of roundness and proper  degree of taper.    Moreover, the development of micromachines has begun in  earnest in recent years as a dream technology for the future.  Most attempts at manufacturing micromachines have relied on  applications of LSI technology, but micro-EDM has shown great  promise because of its greater capability to form  three-dimensional shapes.    To respond to the needs for this kind of microprocessing, we  have developed ultramicro-EDM machines that provide greater  precision and micronization than the micro-EDM technology  previously developed by the Matsushita Research Institute in  Tokyo.    In this article I will explain the features, specifications,  and precision obtained by this ultramicro-EDM equipment, and  discuss in detail ultramicro-processing, deep hole boring at  high aspect ratio, and micromachining of three-dimensional  shapes.  <H5>  2. Characteristics of Micro-EDM </H5>   The characteristics of micro-EDM can be summarized as  follows:    (1) Any conductive material can be processed--especially,  hard materials such as quench-hardened steel and sintered hard  alloys can be easily processed. Furthermore, it is possible to  machine silicon, which may crack under conventional  electro-discharge machining.[.sup]1[/]    (2) High precision machining of curved surfaces, slanting  surfaces, and thin materials is possible because processing  takes place without applying mechanical force to the workpiece.    (3) Machining of shapes with high aspect ratios is possible,  and in the case of hole boring, depths as great as five times  the hole diameter are easily obtained.    (4) Because the processing units are very small, this method  provides an excellent surface smoothness of up to 0.1m  Rmax.[.sup]2[/]  <H5>  3. Structure of Ultramicro-EDM Machine </H5>   The shaft processing machine (MG-ED51) and the boring  machine  (MG-ED71), which is shown in Figure 1, are required for  ultramicro-EDM. Table 1 shows the main specifications for each  machine, and Figure 2 shows the basic structures common to the  ultramicro-EDM machines. The basic structures can be roughly  divided into a machining head member, a positioning mechanism  member, and a micro-ED circuit and NC control member.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-48A>           Fig. 1 Photo of Micro-EDM Boring Machine MG-ED71 </FIG>       3.1 Machining Head Member and Z-Axis Mechanism    The machining head member has a mandrel attached to it that  incorporates the tool electrode. It consists of a V-bearing made  of ceramic material to provide rotary support and a DC motor  that provides rotary drive for the mandrel.[.sup]2[/]    In previous models the mandrel slid vertically in this  V-bearing when it was positioned on the Z-axis, but there were  disadvantages such as a stroke distance of only 3mm. Therefore,  we modified the design so that the whole machining head would  move on the Z-axis. The Z-axis has a range of 70mm and is moved  in 0.05m increments by a stepping motor and a ball screw. A  machining range of 10mm is shown in Table 1 because the range is  dependent on the depth of the processing tank. The machining  depth also depends on the shape to be machined, so not all  microholes can be bored to a depth of 10mm (See 4.2 below).    The outside of the mandrel is in contact with the V-bearing  via a belt, and its upper end is attached to a steel ball. It is  supported so that it receives thrust at the contact point on its  top. It is connected to the discharge circuit via the contact  point. This bearing system features high rotary precision, there  is almost no centering misalignment when the mandrel is attached  or removed, and it is easy to handle. Because both the boring  machine and shaft processing machine use exactly the same  bearing system, it is possible to measure and check the  dimensions of the tool electrodes made by the shaft processing  machine under a microscope and then install them directly in the  boring machine, which facilitates machining quality control.    3.2 Discharge Circuit and Discharge Control    The shaft processing machine is a machine designed to  automate electrode forming, and to do so the discharge energy  conditions from rough processing to finishing must be set  automatically. To achieve micromachining on the order of 0.1mm  or less, it is necessary to reduce the single pulse discharge  energy to the range of 10[.sup]-7[/] J, so an R-C circuit was  chosen as the discharge circuit. Moreover, a layout was selected  to keep the floating capacitance in the circuit and the tool  electrode at a minimum.[.sup]2[/] The discharge energy can be  set by adjusting the voltage of the R-C circuit and capacitor  capacitance. The voltage can be selected with high precision in  1V units with a D/A converter, but setting the capacitance of  the capacitor is very complex. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 2.,  we chose a format in which four types of capacitors can be  switched by relays. By moving the capacitor switching circuit  and the position of the resistor as close as possible to the  tool electrode, we can suppress the floating capacitance.    Control of the discharge is accomplished by a simple system  that uses a charging current detector on the R-C circuit to  determine whether it is discharging or there is a short, and if  there is a short, it opens the gap.    3.3 Structure of Shaft Processing Machine    The shaft processing machine is a device for automatically  forming the tool electrodes used on the boring machine, and it  uses the wire electro-discharge grinding (WEDG) method proposed  by professor Takahisa Masuzawa, Institute of Industrial Science,  University of Tokyo.[.sup]3[/] Figure 3 shows the principle  of WEDG. The wire that forms the tool electrode is fed  continuously over the wire guide, and at a place where it is  supported by the wire guide, a processing micro-ED is generated  between the wire and the shaft being processed.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-49B>           Fig. 3 Principle of WEDG </FIG>       The wire guide is on the X-axis, and it is positioned in  0.1m units. The wire material bobbin, takeup bobbin and the  wire drive mechanism are all on the X-axis, and variations in  wire tension are eliminated as positioning takes place on the  X-axis. The wire drive uses a constant-rate takeup, and the wire  is given uniform tension by constant-current control of a DC  motor connected to the wire material bobbin on the other  end.[.sup]4[/]    Because the range of movement is only 0.5mm or less, we use  an open control system with a stepping motor and ball screw for  positioning on the X-axis. Errors due to backlash are controlled  by making the positioning movements constantly in the forward  direction.    Because it is not equipped with a function for calculating  mandrel rotation, rotational symmetry is the basis for shapes  that can be processed on the shaft processing machine. As shown  in Figure 4, it can process microshafts with tapers, shapes with  a spherical radius, and various combinations of these. Because  100m diameter brass wire was used, a radius of 50m is  left  at the step.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-50A>           Fig. 4 Shapes Machined by Micro-EDM MG-ED51 </FIG>       As shown in Table 1, the boring machine has five operation  modes. The machining modes include the AUTO mode, in which  equally spaced holes are machined continuously in a row, and  REMOTE mode, which operates on commands from an external  computer.    In AUTO mode automatic processing can be achieved merely by  inputting machining conditions and hole position data with very  simple programming on the NC controller. However, machining  shapes are limited to holes or slits made from combinations of  holes.    With REMOTE mode it is possible to easily machine large  shapes with more complex data. An RS-232C port is used for  command communications, so any computer can be used. REMOTE mode  has a function to detect all the settings for conditions  relevant to machining; that is, discharge voltage, choice of  capacitor, feed rate setting, movement designations, machining  movement designations, and machine status (coordinate values,  processing status). It is possible to machine shapes at will by  combining these various parameters.    The X and Y tables each have a glass scale origin. By using  the mode that automatically returns them to their origins  (RETURN), it is possible to take them back to their original  positions with high precision after interrupting an operation in  progress.    As far as the shape of the tool electrode is concerned,  reversed-polarity discharge can be performed on the boring  machine using block electrodes, etc., independent of the shaft  processing machine. Some methods other than WEDG are better for  forming relatively long tool electrodes. Figure 6 compares the  WEDG and the block methods. Because WEDG uses a single point for  machining, it is not efficient in terms of time for forming long  electrodes. Moreover, with the tungsten that is normally used  for tool electrodes, there is a problem because if the cut made  on a single pass is too deep, the material tends to bend after  machining due to internal strain. Block forming, on the other  hand, is efficient because the length to be machined can be cut  with a single discharge, and the electrode does not bend easily,  most likely because the material is removed uniformly and slowly  over its whole length. In the past block forming was done  manually and required considerable skill, but this task has now  become rather easy if the movements are programmed into a  computer.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-51A>           Fig. 6 Comparison of WEDG and Block Methods </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-51C>           Fig. 8. Example of 5m Diameter Bored Holes </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-52A>           Fig. 10. Method for Forming Tool Electrode for Microslot </FIG>       4.2 Deep Hole Machining    With micro-EDM it is possible to machine a hole to a depth  up  to five times the diameter of the hole, and for boring deeper  holes with a higher aspect ratio methods such as using a tool  electrode shaped like a half moon have been devised. Wear is  extensive, however, when using a half-moon shaped tool  electrode, so longer electrodes are necessary. This causes a  problem because long electrodes tend to bend after they are  formed and vibrate during machining, which makes boring accuracy  difficult to control.    It is difficult to bore holes more than five times deeper  than their diameter because the insulating oil does not easily  reach the tip of the electrode and it is difficult to remove  machining dust. Moving the workpiece relative to the tool  electrode is one way used to bore deep holes without using a  special tool electrode. On this boring machine we have installed  a brand new machining mode so we can set the vibrational  amplitude in 0.1m units for either the X- or Y-axis and feed  the tool electrode as it vibrates at several Hertz. This  machining mode forms an oblong hole, so we use it for rough  machining. We then finish the workpiece to obtain a straight,  deep hole.    Amplitude is an important parameter in this mode since the  tool electrode vibrates as it processes. I will explain this  more specifically using the experimental results of machining at  an aspect ratio of 10 as shown in Table 2. The tool electrode  diameter and amplitude were set so that the hole would be  2.5m long and 1.0m wide when ready for finishing.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2 Machining Conditions for Experiment                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hole Diameter            |100m                |20m                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Workpiece                |Hardened Alloy t=1mm     |Stainless Steel t=0.2mm  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tool Electrode Diameter  |90m &amp; +/-2.5m      |14m &amp; +/-2.5m |  |&amp; Vibration           |                         |                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |85m &amp; +/-5m|9m &amp; +/-5m |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |80m &amp; +/-7.5&amp;mg-|                         |  |                         |r;m                      |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |75m &amp; +/-10|                         |  |                         |m                        |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |70m &amp; +/-12.5&amp;m-|                         |  |                         |gr;m                     |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Set Voltage              |110 V                    |100 V                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Capacitor Capacitance    |3300 pF                  |100 pF                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Figure 11 shows experimental results of wear length when the  vibration is in the horizontal direction and machining is in the  vertical direction. In the experiment at 20m it was not  possible to form a straight electrode of the required length  less than 10m in diameter. In both trials, the electrode did  not penetrate when the amplitude was 2.5m, so those values  are not accurate.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-52B>           Fig. 11 Wear Length and Vibration Amplitude with Vibration </FIG>       As the data shows, penetration is possible with an amplitude  of 5m or more, and we can easily bore deep holes. As the  amplitude increases, the wear length also increases uniformly in  proportion to the volume removed.    It appears that the limit of deep holes bored with this  method depends on the workpiece material and how long a tool  electrode we can form.    This method is not only used for deep hole boring, but it is  also effective for rapidly boring holes greater than 0.1m in  diameter with high precision.    4.3 Making Microparts    With the features I have noted, micro-EDM offers a method  other than a semiconductor manufacturing process for realizing  micromachines. Below I will show some examples of machining  potential microparts for use in micromachines.    Figure 12 is an SEM photo and a schematic diagram showing  the  mechanism and dimensions of a microspring formed on a silicon  wafer. This process penetrates the silicon wafer to form a  parallel spring mechanism as shown by the two thin sheets  20m  thick. Micro-EDM can easily create high aspect ratio microshapes  on a wafer that cannot be penetrated by photolithography.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-53A>           Fig. 12. Silicon Microspring Mechanism </FIG>       Thus, the ultramicro-EDM machines can machine miniature  shapes on miniature parts with great precision.    Figure 14 shows a metal die for molding a 0.033 modular  involute gear with a pitch diameter of 0.3mm. The material is  100m thick stainless steel. In this case the involute form  was created using a 20m diameter tool electrode after a  combination of holes was bored for rough machining.[.sup]4[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-53B>           Figure </FIG>    <H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>   In this article I have explained the technical features of  the ultramicro-EDM machines. It is now possible to do machining  that was difficult in the past such as ultramicromachining of  holes to 5m in diameter, boring deep holes with an aspect  ratio of ten, etc. I believe these machines can be used to make  a variety of microparts for micromachines. I believe that  ultramicro-EDM will be important in the future as a  manufacturing technology where more micronization and greater  precision are required.    In closing I deeply thank professor Takahisa Masuzawa,  Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo for his  valuable leadership in developing this technology.  References    1. T.

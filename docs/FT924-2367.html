			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A risky escape route - A couple who bought an island complete with hotel IF YOU are running a successful London fashion business but are pushing 50 and thinking about a change, what do you do? Escape to an island, maybe. That is what Tony and Beatrice Porter did eight years ago when they took the biggest risk of their adventurous business lives by deciding to snap up a chunk of near-deserted rock known as Burgh Island off the south Devon coast. Its sole assets were a near-derelict 1930s hotel, and a shale-and-mortar pub, the Pilchard Inn, built in 1336 Seven years and several million pounds later, the hotel has been refurbished to reflect its original art decoratif splendour and has enjoyed a vigorous trade, thanks to good timing, imaginative entrepreneurship, and the support of several banks willing to back a long-shot. The Porters first visited the village of Bigbury-on-Sea on a winter's day in 1985. One sight of the island, despite its parlous state, was enough: they would become hoteliers. An added fillip, was that the hotel had a history: Agatha Christie used it as the setting for two of her novels, And Then There Were None and Evil Under the Sun. Christie was close friends with the man who built the hotel, Archibald Nettlefold, founder of what is now GKN. He also owned the Comedy Theatre in London, which regularly staged Christie whodunnits. The hotel enjoyed pre-war notoriety as a playground for Christie, Noel Coward, the young Louis Mountbatten and even Edward and Mrs Simpson. Ownership had long since passed from Nettlefold's hands; and on December 5 1985 it became the Porters', who bought it outright from Landstone Estates, a small development company, before it was put up for auction. The total outlay, including a two-year restoration, ran into millions, Tony Porter recalled recently. Rewiring, for example, cost Pounds 50,000 and roofing Pounds 60,000. The motivation, Porter said, was to take on a new challenge, particularly as Burgh Island came up for grabs just as his 50th birthday was approaching. Porter spent most of the 1960s in Nigeria working for ICI; in the 1970s he and his wife moved into London fashion consultancy. 'We could see that another 10-15 years would slip by with nothing really to show for them but a pile of scrap books full of press cuttings promoting other people's clothes,' he said. Once the decision about Burgh Island was made, the challenge was to persuade bank managers to go along with the plans, first with the bridging loan that would allow them to clinch the deal while the sale of their London house went through; the second to provide the long-term finance to restore the property. Help came from Allied Dunbar, which agreed to lend enough money to up the deal before the auction. Contracts were exchanged on December 4 1985, and 'we completed the deal the following January 6, by which time all these sales, our property in London and four small properties on the island, were either completed or set up.' A South Devon branch of Barclays Bank agreed to finance the refurbishment, no easy task given the deterioration of the masonry, electrics, heating and steel fittings, although the structure was sound. Much of the art deco furniture had been damaged beyond repair or destroyed. The hotel's self-catering flatlets were kept going while room-by-room refurbishment got under way. The self-catering was gradually phased out and, the hotel went back into full-time business on March 12, 1988, complete with a scene out of a Coward play. 'Our first customers turned up in striped blazers and beaded dresses, and the ballroom sprang to life with the charleston and the tango.' 'We were advised that 28 bedrooms would be far more profitable than 14 suits with their own sitting room,' said Porter, 'but were dedicated to style in every area, and the suites suited that perfectly. 'Little by little, as we found more period furniture, more experienced staff and marvellous food, we were able to inch up the tariff to the current level of Pounds 85 per person per night, including breakfast, dinner, a suit and, of course, VAT. To the delight of Porter's bank managers, Burgh Island enjoys an occupancy rate of 90 per cent in the five-month peak season and around 30 per cent in the winter. The restaurant operates to a fashionable London standard and attracts customers on its own. The hotel has a staff of 30 and is open all year. Porter acknowledge that it was not always smooth sailing. 'There were a number of occasions when we worried about the wide gap between expenditures and income on the project, and this kept us awake from time to time. But with our occupancy rate now having climbed, we are confident we have turned the corner. As well, our time and investment has enhanced the value of the property as a whole.' 'The worst of the financial challenges behind us,' said Porter, 'there is no reason why we should not persist in trying to create one of the best small hotels anywhere.'

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When section 404(b)(5) is properly interpreted, these problems evaporate. The term ``reassigned tonnage limits'' refers to the total allowance allocations made, in every substitution plan, to the Table A and substitution units under the plan and not simply to redistributed allowances. Thus, section 404(b)(5) requires that each substitution plan must result in ``the same or greater'' reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions as would have been made by the Table A and substitution units without a substitution plan. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  42 U.S.C. 7651c(b)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters relied on Senate Report No. 101&hyph;228 (at 307 and a floor statement by Senator Baucus (136 Cong. Rec. S16980 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1990) to support the claim that section 404(b)(5) requires consideration only of the emissions reductions that would be achieved by the Table A unit, and not those by the substitution unit, in the absence of the plan. Such reliance is misplaced because section 404(b)(5) explicitly requires that the emissions reductions at both the Table A and the substitution units without the plan be considered. 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency concludes that section 404(b)(5) must be interpreted to take into account, and avoid allocating allowances to the substitution unit for, reductions that would otherwise have been made at the substitution unit since 1985 in the absence of a substitution plan. The Agency maintains that there are two categories of reductions that would otherwise have been made and that therefore should be excluded from the allocation of allowances to substitution units: (1) emissions rate reductions that were made voluntarily, for economic or other reasons, by a substitution unit after 1985 and before enactment of title IV; and (2) emissions rate reductions by a substitution unit between 1985 and 2000 that were mandated by federal or State law as of the enactment of title IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. 1989 or 1990 SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=4 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> emissions rate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to the first category of emissions reductions, EPA is modifying the January 11, 1993 regulations to provide that substitution units will not be allocated allowances for voluntary emissions rate reductions made before enactment of title IV: i.e., reductions before title IV's enactment that were not mandated by federal or State law and that were made for economic or other reasons. To the extent a unit's emissions rate reductions are caused by economic or other factors that would have existed in Phase I even if the unit did not become a substitution unit, such reductions would have occurred without a substitution plan and therefore must be taken into account under section 404(b)(5) and excluded from allowance allocations. In theory, any reductions made by a unit between 1985 and 1999 could potentially be in response to such factors and, if so, could be considered as reductions that would have occurred without the substitution plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency maintains that there must be a bright line drawn to determine whether a unit's voluntary reductions in emissions rate would occur even if the unit were not a substitution unit. It would be difficult to make accurate case-by-case determinations, concerning a large number of units, as to whether the owners and operator of a particular unit took actions after 1985 to reduce its emissions rate in anticipation of the unit becoming a substitution unit. Such determinations would require analyzing economic and other factors that may be involved (e.g., fuel costs, the timing for retrofitting of pollution controls, and the regulatory benefits and risks of becoming a substitution unit), balancing the factors favoring or disfavoring action to reduce the emissions rate, and judging what the owners and operator would have done in the past concerning the unit's emissions in the absence of substitution plans. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments of Environment Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council at 16 (submitted Feb. 10, 1994). Similar determinations would presumably have to be made for each approved substitution unit, and allowance allocations might have to be adjusted, each time the owners and operators of the unit take actions after approval of the substitution plan that reduce the unit's emissions rate in Phase I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, particularly where there are a large number of units involved, the Agency does not agree with those commenters that claimed that a showing that post-1990 reductions would not have occurred in the absence of a substitution plan would be ``easily'' evaluated.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Agency concludes that the best approach to developing a reasonable approximation of what a unit's emissions rate would be in Phase I in the absence of a substitution plan is to treat all voluntary emissions rate reductions after 1985 and through 1990 (the year in which title IV of the Act was passed) as reductions that would have occurred in Phase I in the absence of a substitution plan. Prior to enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, utilities had no reasonable expectation that emissions reductions would generate nationally tradable allowances under the Act. The reductions were not made in response to the availability of allowances under substitution plans. December 31, 1990 (rather than November 15, 1990, the specific date of title IV's enactment) is used as the cut-off point for determining what reductions that would have occurred without the plan because emissions rate data is available on a calendar year basis. Even though some reductions after 1990 perhaps would have occurred without the plan, it would be difficult to sort out, for a large number of units, the impact of the availability of substitution plans for the period after the substitution provision was enacted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, reductions reflected in a unit's 1989 or 1990 SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate will be treated as representative of reductions that would continue to be made up through 1999. In the November 18, 1993 proposal, the Agency proposed to use the 1990 actual SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions rate as the measure of emissions reductions made before passage of title IV. The 1990 rate was proposed because, as the emissions rate closest to November 15, 1990, it is more likely to reflect all the reductions made prior to passage of title IV. The rate for an earlier year is less likely to reflect all reductions made before passage of title IV. However, several commenters expressed concern that a unit's emissions rate for a single year (i.e., 1990) might be unusually low and therefore unrepresentative of its emissions rate prior to the passage of title IV. These commenters suggested that, if post-1985 emissions rates are used, the Agency should use a formula that allows consideration of actual emissions rates for 1988, 1989, and 1990.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments of Utility Air Regulatory Group at 45 (submitted Feb. 10, 1994); Comments of Northern States Power Company at 6 (submitted Feb. 10, 1994). Other commenters claimed that the 1990 emission rate may be lower than the 1985 emission rate because of normal variability in the sulfur content of coal or in scrubber performance. They suggested a case-by-case determination of whether such variability accounts for the lower 1990 emissions rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

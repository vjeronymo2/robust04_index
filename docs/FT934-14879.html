			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Starmin facing legal battle STARMIN, the troubled quarry products group now chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former Cabinet minister, was yesterday facing a legal battle with a former director who resigned a month before the company said pre-tax losses were millions of pounds deeper than previously published. Mr Osman Abdullah, who controlled the company from 1989 with his brother Raschid, is believed to be suing the company over the termination of his service contract following his resignation in July. Mr Raschid Abdullah, who also resigned as an executive in July, was last month reappointed as a non-executive director and speaks for about 30 per cent of the equity. He declined to say whether he now planned to take action against the company and said that his brother was on holiday. The resignations by the brothers, who first gained a public profile for their work at the Evered aggregates company, coincided with Starmin's announcement of a review of accounting procedures which led to the company rescinding its dividend and announcing 1992 pre-tax losses had been understated by Pounds 3.8m, deepening them to Pounds 11.9m. The review of accounting policies focused on profits booked on asset swaps. Starmin said at the time that there was no suggestion of fraud. No one at Starmin was prepared to comment. However, note 29 of the company's 1992 Report and Accounts flags the possibility of claims and the board's intention to resist them: 'The company will strenuously resist any such claims and the board considers that adequate provision has been made in the accounts at 31 December 1992 for any such liability,' the note says.</p>

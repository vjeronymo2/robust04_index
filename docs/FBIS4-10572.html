			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The controversy between the weekly magazine SEMANA  and Julio Mario Santo Domingo over alleged wiretapping has not  ended. SEMANA issued a communique today saying that it will wait  for a ruling from the Colombian judicial authorities as this is  not merely a case of gossip but a serious crime.    Santo Domingo had previously issued a communique denying a  report published by the magazine linking him to an alleged case  of wiretapping.</p>

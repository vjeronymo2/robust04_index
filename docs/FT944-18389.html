			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / People: Greene King brews new roles for chairman and chief executive Greene King, the East Anglian brewer, has split the roles of chairman and chief executive. Simon Redman, who has held both posts since 1990, has become interim non-executive chairman until a successor is appointed early 1995. He will then leave the company. Tim Bridge, right, managing director since 1990 and descended from the King family, has become chief executive. 'The board believes the preferred structure is a non-executive chairman and chief executive,' Bridge said. The jobs have been split before. Most recently, Redman was chief executive and Bridge's father John was chairman until 1990. 'There is no strategic change for the group,' Bridge added. Redman will have more than two years left of his three-year contract when he leaves next year. He earned Pounds 118,000 in salary and pension last year and his departure terms will be set later. Under Redman's stewardship Greene King has grown steadily but has also suffered a couple of setbacks. Most notably, its hostile takeover bid for Morland, the Thames Valley brewer, failed in 1992. Greene King sold its 28.8 per cent stake in Morland last month for Pounds 28.7m but incurred several million pounds in costs for the abortive bid. Bridge said decisions such as the Morland bid had been made by the whole board and were not a factor in yesterday's management changes. The company is looking for a non-executive chairman with 'a known profile in the City and financial press', but it has 'an open mind' whether the successful candidate comes from manufacturing or retailing. Bridge, 45, joined Greene King in 1970 and has held a variety of posts. No other Bridges are currently in the company, although members of various families connected to the founders hold some 15 per cent of the equity. The Redmans have been linked to the group since 1961 when Greene King bought Wells and Winch, the Biggleswade brewer. Simon's cousin Tim relinquished executive duties earlier this year but will remain a Greene King non-executive director for three years.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] NEC and Bull, the largest computer manufacturer in  France, have made a basic agreement on joint development of  mainframe computers. A formal decision will be made at a  top-level meeting of the two companies to be held in early June,  and the outlook is for commercialization in 1995 or 1996. Since  expansion of demand for mainframe machines is not anticipated  with the advancement of downsizing (shift in demand to small  machines), the burden of cost is becoming heavier for design and  development such as a processing unit appropriate for high-speed  processing.    Both companies, which will cooperate in the capital aspect,  etc., will embark on sharing development in the mainframe field  which is their main product, and hasten to rebuild the computer  business.    There will be joint development of the highest grade machine  type, the large "System 3900" (NEC product name) which NEC is  OEM [original equipment manufacturer] supplying to Bull. The  details of sharing design and development will be decided later,  but it seems that the CPU (central processing unit) and board  that carries the CPU which are the heart will be the object. NEC  and Bull will respectively commercialize the jointly developed  machine.    A CPU with a bipolar structure in which it is easy to  increase processing speed will be used in the jointly developed  machine. Furthermore, it is anticipated that there will be  future study of cooperation in development of a parallel  mainframe that will raise processing performance by lining up  several CPU's with a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide  semiconductor) structure which is easy to plan 0 costdowns.    In development of mainframe computers, it is said that it  costs about 10 billion yen for a new machine type and several  billion yen for an improvement. Both companies see that they can  greatly alleviate the cost burden by sharing development.    NEC agreed at the end of 1993 to cooperate with Bull, whose  business has seriously worsened, in a wide range of fields such  as computers, communications, and electronic parts on the  occasion of providing an additional investment of about 7  billion yen (4.43 percent stockholding rate after increased  investment), and has proceeded with specific discussions. This  sharing of development in the field of mainframes will be the  first shot and also implies Bull support.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW GROUP IS FORMED BY BIRTCHER  </P> <P> Birtcher said Friday that it has joined two of the company's development teams  to form a new group called Birtcher Business Communities, which will acquire  and develop major real estate projects combining shops, offices and hotels.  </P> <P> The two teams are Birtcher Equities, headed by Baron R. and Brandon R.  Birtcher, grandsons of the company's founder, and Birtcher Campbell Properties,  headed by Robert M. Campbell.  </P> <P> The new entity will be responsible for Southern California, Arizona, Nevada,  Colorado and Texas.  </P> <P> The Laguna Niguel-based developer said the two groups were combined to achieve  greater efficiencies and not as a result of the real estate slump.  </P> <P> The new group will employ the same number of people -- 75 -- as the old, a  spokesman said.  </P> <P> The new unit will be able to grab a larger piece of local markets and react  more quickly to business opportunities, the company said.  </P> <P> Birtcher, one of the nation's largest developers, builds offices, warehouses  and stores across the U.S.  </P></p>

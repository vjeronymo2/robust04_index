			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> If you set out to find the Person of the Century, the names Mark Spitz, Donald  Trump and Michael Jackson might not come immediately to mind. Well, at least  not Spitz and Trump.  </P> <P> But they are among the 89 personages nominated by the Walt Disney Co., which  will survey customers at its amusement parks over the next decade in what it  calls "the longest-running poll ever conducted" to find "the individual who has  made the greatest impact on the 20th Century."  </P> <P> The candidates, which Disney said were compiled from a list of recommendations  by college presidents, represent a curious mixture of world leaders,  politicians, scientists, executives, athletes, entertainers and literati  (including writer Virginia Woolf, whose name was spelled "Wolfe" in the  announcement).  </P> <P> Alas, L.A.'s most famous entertainer/politician -- Ronald Reagan -- was left  off the list.  </P> <P> While the Disney company forbids mustaches or beards among its employees --  four members of the staff at the Queen Mary were recently fired for such  offenses -- it did accept the nominations of such proponents of facial hair as  Walt Disney (mustache) and George Bernard Shaw and Andrew Carnegie (beards).  </P> <P> It's difficult to tell who the favorite would be in the Person of the Century  balloting. Disneyland visitors, after all, may have a unique perspective. How  many 8-year-olds, for instance, will choose Albert Einstein or Thomas Edison  over, say, Michael Jackson?  </P> <P> One more question: Will Elvis vote for himself?  </P> <P> Newspapers in the state of Washington have taken to decrying the trend of  fleeing Angelenos who purchase beautiful spreads in the Pacific Northwest.  </P> <P> The panic seems to be mounting there. Now, Washingtonians are turning on  themselves.  </P> <P> Seattle Times columnist Erik Lacitis recently discovered that many residents  have advertised properties in the L.A. Times. He added facetiously: "Of course,  we Northwesterners could never be accused of such a thing as being hypocrites  when it comes to all our regionalism."  </P> <P> The city of Paramount, which recently acquired a radar device that flashes the  speed of passers-by on a screen, employed the machine during a 10-K race over  the weekend. The fastest runner, William Musyoki, won the 6.2-mile race with an  average speed of 12.6 m.p.h. No problem with the local gendarmes. As the  machine points out, the "speed limit is 25."  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston has seen his ratings in the popularity polls fall in recent  weeks as a result of reports of his involvement in the Lincoln Savings &amp;  Loan scandal. The 75-year-old Cranston, a quarter-miler in his collegiate days  at Stanford, didn't post great numbers at the Sunkist indoor track meet at the  Sports Arena the other night, either. He finished fifth and last in the  50-meter Legends race.  </P> <P> Nonsense, Joe Brito says, to reports that Santa Monica has no official city  ditty.  </P> <P> He writes: "I bring your attention to a song which came out in the 40s:  </P> <P> "When Veronica Plays Her Harmonica on the Pier at Santa Monica."  </P></p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (8): Peace pays a fair dividend - Profile: Raychem THE JOKE about defence-oriented companies facing the 'threat of peace' began in the mid-1980s soon after the coming to power of Soviet President Gorbachev. But at the time, it was no laughing matter for one of Swindon's leading manufacturers, Raychem, a US-owned materials technology company, heavily dependent upon military procurement for much of its business. Thanks to a sustained drive to find new markets and to reduce its costs base, Raychem recently turned the corner - its sales to the civilian market now exceed those to the military, demonstrating that there can be a peace dividend for defence industry companies. The turnaround has been achieved with minimum jobs losses among employees. Some 70 out of 1,200 jobs in Swindon were cut two years ago and there were about 800 cutbacks worldwide out of a total workforce of 11,000, effected mainly via early retirement and voluntary redundancy. But otherwise, the company has been riding out the recession with relative ease, thanks to buoyant export markets which now account for 70 per cent of the company's sales. Raychem's expertise is in materials science in general and radiated materials in particular. Many of its products are based on the discovery, made in the 1950s, that materials bombarded with radiation create links between the molecules which give it 'elastic memory'; that is, the ability to return to the shape in which they were radiated when heated. Raychem was the first company to take a commercial interest in the phenomenon and has been running with it ever since producing a big range of products and applications which last year resulted in worldwide sales of Dollars l26bn. Raychem in Swindon operates on two sites. One is dedicated to wire and cable and research and development for the company's five European manufacturing centres, and the other to Thermofit tubing, shrinkable tubing for wiring and environmental seals. In seeking to develop civilian markets for its expertise, Swindon concentrated initially upon small-size, lightweight wire insulations for the aircraft manufacturing industry which, in turn, led to low fire hazard technology. Many military applications can be switched. A tank harness (wiring system), for instance, can be adapted to a civilian aircraft. However, the specification for a harness for commercial use is very different from one for the military. 'The thinner you can make the insulation, the better the aircraft engineer likes it,' Mr Jim Webster, the divisional manager, explains. The demands of the civilian aerospace industry opened the way for orders for new wire and cabling products for the Channel Tunnel rail carriages and motor vehicle manufacturers. Raychem was recently awarded A grading by Renault and Citroen, a quality standard which covers all aspects of a company's operations and which will become a compulsory requirement for component suppliers to these French motor manufacturers from 1993. Similar technology has been used to develop a wide range of environmental closures Raychem reckons to be the biggest single supplier in the world of cable accessories; its products have replaced solder, for example, in many cabling applications. Environmental considerations have imposed themselves in the company's dealings with Volkswagen. The German motor manufacturer is interested in how environmentally-friendly a component will be, once it comes to the end of its useful life and has to be discarded. However, successes would not have been possible had Raychem not also been addressing costs. In the manufacturing areas, the costs base has been reduced by 20 per cent, mainly by changes in the way things are done. The old hierarchical management structures have gone. In their place is a flattened management structure in which staff have been empowered and trained to work as a team. The net result is that the Swindon plant now produces more cable in two shifts than it used to produce in three. Japanese-style Total Quality Management and Just-in-Time techniques have obviously played their part. So, too, has a big emphasis on quality improvement training and vocational education. As a measure of its importance within the company, Raychem recently received a national award for a technical operator training scheme aimed at people on the shop floor who had learned everything and whom the senior management felt could do more. It has also just received another award for language training for its staff who between them put in a total of 3,500 hours of learning a year. Raychem has also become a partner company in Warwick University's manufacturing faculty which involves 15 members of staff spending one week in six in Warwick training as project leaders. In short, for Raychem in Swindon, the end of the Cold War is already paying a handsome 'peace dividend'.</p>

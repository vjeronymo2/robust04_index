			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Rover taken over by BMW in Pounds 800m deal with BAe: Honda shocked by UK partner's sale; Tory MPs join in criticism Britain's last volume carmaker yesterday passed into foreign control when BMW of Germany seized Rover in an audacious deal, buying the 80 per cent stake in the UK company held by British Aerospace for Pounds 800m. The deal, which will create a group producing more than 1m cars a year with 100,000 employees worldwide, took the rest of the world motor industry by surprise and delivered a humiliating defeat to Honda, Rover's partner for 14 years, which was only told of the takeover talks last Friday. The acquisition is the latest in a series over the past few years which have recast the shape of the world motor industry. Concluded just 10 days after BMW made its formal offer in secret, the deal was greeted with shock and dismay by Honda, which owns the remaining 20 per cent of the British group. 'Now our partner has been acquired by a competitor we must start to reassess our entire operations in Europe,' Honda said in Tokyo. The end of British-owned volume car production also provoked a sharp reaction from British MPs, who claimed it showed that Rover had been sold too cheaply when privatised six years ago. BAe paid Pounds 150m for the whole of the group, and has since sold parts of it, including its share of Daf Trucks. Conservative backbenchers were among those voicing concern at the sale. Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East) regretted it had been carried out without Honda's consent. But Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said the ownership of Rover was a low priority compared to its profitability. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, trying to calm union unease, said in London that jobs at Rover would be safeguarded, provided volume went up, and that some defunct Rover marques might be resurrected. The City welcomed the deal for the scope it gives BAe to further its aerospace interests ranging from Airbus airliners to fighter aircraft. Its shares closed up 55p at 499p. BAe said yesterday it was first approached by BMW last October. BMW also approached Honda, but there was no response. On January 19, BMW held an extraordinary meeting of the supervisory board - the first in its history - and agreed an offer to BAe. BMW executives yesterday said the decision was the most important taken since the company's formation. The formal offer was delivered last Wednesday. The BAe board met last Thursday and took less than five hours to accept the deal, and Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman, flew immediately to Tokyo to inform Honda. On Saturday, Honda responded by offering to raise its stake in Rover to 47.5 per cent, but was rebuffed. Honda has consistently opposed taking a majority stake in Rover. Mr Simpson said yesterday: 'Honda's position has always been that it did not want to own Rover. BAe wanted to exit, so the position of the two was such that we had to find another way.' Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said: 'The deal gives us the opportunity to focus on the strategy the board undertook 2 1/2 years ago, to focus the business on defence and aerospace.' He rejected claims that BAe had made a large profit. 'It's totally unreasonable to draw a direct comparison between the Pounds 150m and the Pounds 800m,' he said. 'Our total investment is many times Pounds 150m.' In 1993 Rover made an operating profit of Pounds 56m but a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds 4.3bn. Its net assets were Pounds 1.4bn. Its sale will also relieve BAe of Pounds 200m of net debt and a further Pounds 700m off balance sheet financing. Rover's revival has been based on Honda technology and working practices. Asked what would happen if Honda pulled out, Mr Simpson said: 'It depends how fast it happens. It would clearly be in everybody's interest if it happened in an orderly fashion over the next four or five years.' Mr Shojiro Miyake, president of Honda Motor Europe, said it was too early for Honda to make strategy decisions - 'it has been too big a shock'. Neither Mr Simpson nor industry analysts expected existing collaborative projects or component supply arrangements to be dismantled.

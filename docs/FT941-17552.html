			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / HK plans to cut powers of airport body The Hong Kong government yesterday published proposals for the reconstituted Airport Corporation, reducing the powers of the body responsible for developing and operating Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok. The White Paper outlines controls aimed at making the reconstituted body more accountable to the government, in a move seen as seeking to appease China. Beijing was concerned that the previous body - the Provisional Airport Authority - had too much autonomy. Mr Gordon Siu, secretary for economic services, said the bill provided for monitoring and controlling the work of the organisation in areas such as strategy, provision of information and financing and investment. He said further checks existed outside present proposals restricting the way the corporation exercises its powers, uses public money and discharges its international obligations. Progress on the HKDollars 22.5bn (Pounds 1.97bn) airport - which was agreed in a memorandum of understanding signed by the Chinese prime minister, Mr Li Peng, and his British counterpart, Mr John Major in 1991 - has been scuppered by a deadlock over the financing arrangements. China has rejected financial packages put forward by the Hong Kong government on the grounds that they will leave a financial burden on the post-1997 government. Any financing for such a big project would straddle 1997, when the colony reverts to China. The draft legislation published yesterday turns the Provisional Airport Authority into a corporation, to be run along the same lines as the government-owned Mass Transit Railway Corporation, which also started life as an authority. Mr Siu said: 'This is a delicate balance to strike between commercial freedom and accountability to government. We obviously cannot create a government-owned corporation without controls, but neither can we fetter the corporation to such an extent that it is unable to raise funds in international markets, attract investors in airport facilities, and operate commercially and flexibly.' The government hopes to have the bill before the Legislative Council before the summer recess in July. A public consultation period stretches through to February 28, after which the bill will be discussed with the Chinese side and, if necessary, redrafted. The Chinese yuan, which was in effect devalued by 33 per cent on Saturday after the government abolished the official exchange rate, yesterday closed virtually unchanged from Friday at 8.71 to the US dollar on the Shanghai market. With the passing of the official rate, all currency transactions now take place at what Beijing terms a floating rate, determined by supply and demand. This is fixed daily by the central bank according, it says, to market conditions. It was set at 8.7 to the dollar on Saturday. Transactions are carried out through foreign exchange centres, of which Shanghai is much the largest. Transactions which would previously have taken place at the official rate - some 20 per cent of total transactions, according to Chinese sources - would have gone some way to boosting volumes, but Hong Kong economists reckoned tight controls left little room for speculators. Beijing's move to unify exchange rates took place ahead of sweeping reform plans that will embrace trade and the financial and banking sector. Also coming into effect this month is a revamped indirect taxation system, which streamlines the old consolidated industrial and commercial tax into a consumption tax, targeting luxury goods; value added tax; and business tax. Economists in Hong Kong reckon China's central bank will retain strict control to keep the yuan stable.</p>

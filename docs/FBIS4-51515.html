			<p>BFN     [Text] On the launching of the Hata government of minority  parties, the bureaucrats of Kasumigaseki, Tokyo, in general  think: "With its fragile base, the cabinet will have trouble  pursuing reform policies." The political situation is likely to  become insecure, and there is spreading concern regarding  matters like North Korea over which the ruling and opposition  parties are expected to differ. According to an official of the  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF]: "Now  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has returned to the  opposition camp, the bureaucrats' power might become weaker than  under the Hosokawa government." An official of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] admitted: "If the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ get together, the  Diet will become shaky; it will be difficult to implement  policies."    The Hosokawa government, which had the SDPJ on its side, was  able to actively pursue policies on rice market liberalization  and programs on the taxation system and pension reform, led by  bureaucrats, but under the new government there is concern  because "it is unclear how the SDPJ will act," as an official of  the Ministry of Health and Welfare noted.    Another official of the MAFF said: "It will become difficult  for us to work not only on opposition parties but also on ruling  parties; it will not be easy to implement policies." There are  also many who think that with the birth of the new coalition  government a change will occur in the present trend of  "bureaucrats having more power than politicians."    But as far as such issues as Japan-U.S. relations--an area  where there are almost no policy differences between the ruling  and opposition parties--are concerned, an official of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] said: "All we have to do is  continue to do the things we were doing." Officials of MOFA are  pleased to have Koji Kakizawa as their new minister, saying, "It  should be easy to work with him since he is familiar with  foreign affairs."    Likewise, the Economic Planning Agency has many expectations  of its new director general, Yoshio Terazawa, who is well versed  in economics and known for his "fine background" including his  time as president of Nomura Securities U.S.A. (according to a  senior official of the agency). Meanwhile, the Ministry of  Finance, which has the task ahead of reforming the taxation  system, is happy that its minister will remain in post. Vice  Minister Jiro Saito said: "He is my senior as a bureaucrat, and  we can work like one man."    The views of ministries differ regarding the fact that the  Hata government strongly favors Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  members.    In MITI, which experienced the "incident of intervention" by  former MITI Minister Kumagai to remove a senior official, the  general response was: "The man whom the vice ministers have to  watch closely has changed from Kumagai (known to be close to  Ozawa) to Hata (known to be close to Prime Minister Hata); we  should be able to work with him better."    In the case of the Ministry of Transport, which has a new  minister from Komeito, the picture was one of relieved ministry  officials. The officials said: "If we had someone from  Shinseito, we would have the difficult problem of what distance  we should maintain with Shinseito on the one hand, and with the  LDP on the other."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "U.S. President Makes `A Mess' of It"]    [Text] A report by the London-based International  Institute of Strategic Studies uses the term "a mess" to  describe the U.S. President's foreign policy. We believe this  description has not aroused controversy in the United States or  the world.  <H5>  The Result of Talking Irresponsibly </H5>   The report vividly points out that Clinton seems to proceed  without a "steady compass." In other words, he does not have an  orientation in his work but fluctuates from side to side. This  description is quite correct.    Take his Haiti policy for example. Some people estimate that  Clinton has changed it four times, and he is now pursuing his  fifth Haiti policy. On Haitian refugees, for example, at first  he said the United States would accommodate all Haitian  refugees, but later pointed out that Haitian refugees should all  be repatriated. Now he has changed his mind by saying that  Haitian refugees should be screened at sea and only genuine  political refugees will be accepted. If the current UN embargo  does not work, Clinton will decide whether the United States  should dispatch troops. It would not be strange at all for him  to change policy.    There are many reasons why Clinton's foreign policy is  changeable. Before Clinton became president, he was the  governor of remote Arkansas, without any experience of  diplomacy. But during the presidential campaign against  President Bush, who had rich diplomatic experience, he  irresponsibly made one commitment after another to show that he  had his own views on diplomacy. Facing the political realities  of the country and overseas, he has now discovered that the  situation is not as simple as he expected. It is only too  natural for him to revise his policies after hitting a wall.  His policies toward Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, and China are  always changeable. An analyst summed it up: It is not hard to  know what Clinton's next step is; if he makes a left now, he  will make a right next.  <H5>  Several Tests He Will Face </H5>   Some critics point out that Clinton is not good at diplomacy  and is unwilling to spend time studying it. Naturally, he has  made "a mess" of diplomacy. But in the weeks to come, Clinton  is likely to have no alternative but to spend effort and time on  diplomacy. There are some knotty problems, including China's  most-favored-nation status, nuclear inspections in Korea,  whether or not force will be used against Haiti, whether or not  the embargo on Bosnia's muslims should be lifted, and how to  reopen economic dialogue with Japan, all of which require  decisions. Diplomacy is a time-consuming job. Next week,  Clinton will go to Europe to attend the 50th anniversary of the  Normandy landings, and in July he will go to Europe again to  participate in the G-7 summit. In the past, Clinton avoided  conscription, but now he is going to Europe to attend a World  War II commemoration as U.S. President. This has been  criticized by people. People also compare his participation  with Reagan's presence 10 years ago at the 40th anniversary of  the Normandy landings. How many points he will get has drawn  people's attention.  <H5>  More Than Half Are Dissatisfied With His Diplomatic </H5> Performance    A recent public opinion poll suggests that only 40 percent  of  Americans find Clinton's diplomatic performance acceptable; 53  percent are dissatisfied. But this is not Clinton's worst  aspect. He got his lowest approval scores for his character.  After consecutive disclosures about sex and private investment  scandals, only 56 percent of people said he had the loyalty and  honesty required to be President. This was a 20 percent drop  compared with the period just after he became President. But  this may not be his lowest point. If the sexual harassment case  filed by Paula Jones is pursued and the President stands in the  dock, no one can dare say how much further his reputation will  decline.</p>

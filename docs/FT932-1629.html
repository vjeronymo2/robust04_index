			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Canberra criticises beef tariff Canberra is to lodge a complaint with Gatt over Canadian moves to impose a 25 per cent tariff on Australian beef imports, Emilia Tagaza writes from Melbourne. Canada is Australia's fourth biggest and fastest growing beef market. Sales were expected to reach ADollars 150m (Pounds 67.5m) this year. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation had earlier challenged the tribunal finding and had lodged an appeal with the Canadian court of appeal. The two countries are leading members of the Cairns group of agricultural exporters lobbying against protectionist moves.</p>

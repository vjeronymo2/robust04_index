How can we get out of the power  shortage bottleneck that lasted over the past 23 years?    We believe that a much more in-depth reform is required in  order for us to take an extraordinary path.    To take a so-called "extraordinary" path is to depart from  conventional wisdom in order to achieve goals and objectives of  a socialist market economy. We will have to be determined to  deal with fundamental issues affecting the growth of our  electric power industry. Major breakthroughs are needed in  teaching new concepts, straightening out the production system,  pushing for a standardized shareholder system, separating  government from business and converting to a business enterprise  structure, and establishing a modern electric power industry.  Particularly, we have to intensify our macroscopic control to  raise large sums of domestic or foreign capital to invest in  power plants, accelerate the cost structure, improve our ability  to repay debt, promote for conservation and efficient  utilization, significantly improve the profitability of the  industry, and further unleash the production capacity of the  industry in order to create the condition for the electric power  industry to grow in a healthy environment. Therefore, an  "extraordinary" path not only implies a jump in quantity but  also in quality, not only in terms of speed but also in  revamping of mechanism.    1. Electric power industry will never get out of the  bottleneck by conventional approach    While the electric power industry can grow following our  conventional approach in a developing nation such as China, it  will never be able to catch up with economic needs and personal  demand. In 1949, mainland China had a total installed capacity  of 1,860MW and produced 4.3 billion kW of electricity annually.  Since the founding of the present government and after 40 years  of hard work, China ranked fourth worldwide in terms of  installed capacity and annual power production in 1987. By the  end of 1993, it is estimated that China will have a total  installed capacity of 180,000MW that produces 800 billion kW of  electricity annually. The amount of power generated in days now  is equivalent to that produced in the entire year of 1949.    Nevertheless, as the electric power supply increases, the  power shortage is worsening in most regions in China. The  constraint imposed by the power shortage is hampering our  modernization effort. Areas that are prospering usually have the  fastest development in power supply. However, those are often  places of severe shortage.    It is untrue that government has ignored the electric power  industry in the past 40 years. Nor can it be attributed to lack  of substantial investment. We should not underestimate the  effectiveness of the management system overhaul in the past  decade. However, in all fairness, these steps did not break away  from the routine pattern of growth. Most of the reform policies  and measures are based on the old planned economy system.  Unavoidably, we are affected by the old framework and cannot  possibly eliminate all the shortcomings in the old system. These  shortcomings are preventing the electric power industry from  taking a leading role.    The deficiencies of the old system show up in the structure.  Primarily, there is no separation of government and industry.  The electric power industry is affiliated with the government.  In a planned economy, macroscopic control is always subjective.  This led to an insufficient level of investment in the electric  power industry. The development was inadequate in scale. World  Bank experts believed that a developing nation should invest  more than 2 percent of its GNP in electric power. However,  between 1980-1992, we only invested 1.24 percent per year. Past  experience showed that the normal electric equipment to power  generator capacity ration is 2:1. However, it has been far  greater than 2 in China for years. Not only is the actual ratio  greater than 2 but also the increment is more than 2. Second,  energy conservation is never a priority issue. There are no  policies and measures adopted and no energy conservation  mechanisms and structures established. Society, as a whole, does  not have a sense of necessity for energy conservation. This  makes it difficult to promote energy conservation. A serious  power shortage and a huge waste of electric power exist at the  same time. Third, ownership is unclear and responsibility and  authority are not consistently defined. Industry is a part of  government and employees take industry for granted. For a long  time, the government has been responsible for collecting and  paying utility bills. Collection and payment are made by  different branches of the government. Even after adopting a  contract system, this has not changed. More than 90 percent of  the profit of an electric utility goes into the treasury in the  form of taxes and fees. On the one hand, the electric utility is  situated between local and central government treasuries. On the  other hand, industry does not have the ability to invest or  borrow money. In other countries, some utility companies raise  more than 50 percent of the funds for basic construction. In  some cases, it is as high as 90 percent. In China, it is less  than 5 percent. Because the electric utility is not a truly  independent producer and operator, and there is no competition,  the fact that the industry has an excessively large number of  employees has become a major problem.    The old system produced an extremely distorted price  structure for electric power. It neither reflects its cost nor  its supply and demand. This irrational cost structure made us  ignore the fact that electricity is a commodity. The electric  utility industry competes unfairly with other industries. There  is no way to establish a fully functional business management  mechanism. This not only makes it hard to raise money to invest  in construction, but also hampers efforts to conserve energy and  suppress excessive demand. It also makes it more difficult to  reorganize industry to raise foreign capital to build more power  plants.    From the standpoint of the electric power industry,  conceptually it has been bound by tradition for a long period of  time. Its understanding of the market economy is lagging.  Concepts such as market, competition, profitability, investment  and output are weak and need to be reinforced.    2. Extraordinary development requires us to dedicate  our efforts on deeper reform, mechanism conversion, structure  optimization and improved profitability.    As early as 1975, when Deng Xiaoping [6772 1420 1627] was in  charge at the State Council, he stressed the need to speed the  buildup of the electric power industry to meet the demand of a  growing economy, and to leave some room for the unexpected. To  implement Deng's instruction is the objective of the electric  utility industry today. We plan to install more than 15 million  kW of large and medium generator units annually between  1995-1997 and to add 20 million kW annually between 1998-2000.  In addition to expanding our installed capacity, other issues  related to power generation and power grid technology and  education will be addressed at the same time. By the end of this  century, our total installed capacity will reach 310 million  kilowatts. Assuming a GNP growth rate of 8-9 percent and a  reduction of power demand per unit product value of 8-10  percent, power shortage can be alleviated nationally. Every  county will have power and more than 95 percent of the rural  areas will have electricity. To accomplish this goal, in-depth  reform and the taking of "extraordinary" steps are required.    The "decision" adopted at the Third Central Committee  Meeting  of the 14th Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party signified that  our economic reform had entered an overall, accelerated and  coordinated phase. The recently held national economic workshop  accelerated the pace of reform and introduced a large number of  measures. It is an excellent opportunity for the electric  utility industry to take "extraordinary" steps. To take  advantage of this opportunity, the main strategy is that the  industry must actively reorganize to a corporation structure and  operate as a business.    A corporation structure is a beneficial tool to build a  modern electric power industry. The core is to build a modern  electric enterprise system that can adapt to the need of a  market economy, has a clear ownership, responsibility and  authority, and separates government from industry, and is  managed scientifically. The eventual outcome in a market economy  is that the electric power industry must operate as a business.  The core is centered around the concept of electricity as a  commodity. We have to create a competitive environment and allow  the industry to operate independently in accordance with laws  and regulations. It will become an economic entity that is  responsible for its own profitability, growth and control. This  is also a way to standardize a shareholder ownership system.    A shareholder ownership system is a better way to organize  and operate a business that suits the needs of a  product-oriented society and requires a great deal of  investment. It is widely used around the world. It is an  organization that also meets the basic requirement of public  ownership in a socialist society and is an effective way for the  electric utility industry to grow in an "extraordinary" manner.  On the basis of the status and mission facing the electric power  industry, it is far more urgent to try out the shareholder  ownership system. The first objective is to convert the  mechanism. The key to its success depends on how strictly  standardization can be done. A standardized shareholder  ownership system, in essence, must take our special situation  into account. It has to follow the normal rules and regulations  of a socialist market economy and our unique situation that  production, supply and sales happen simultaneously. It must be  consistent with the general requirements concerning shareholder  ownership and obey the "20-Word" policy governing the reform and  development of the electric power industry. It should  fundamentally liberate the productivity of the entire power  industry.    In 1987, the State Council issued the following guideline  and  principle for the reform and development of electric utilities;  i.e., separation of business and government, using provincial  grids as operating entities, connecting all grids, centralizing  power dispatching, collectively raising capital for  construction, and taking individual special situations into  consideration. In practice, this turns out to be an excellent  guideline, consistent with our unique situation and existing  pattern in the electric power industry. It systematically  unveiled the approach to solve our power shortage problem in  steps. In a socialist market economy, separation of business and  government is a direction we must insist on in order to reform  and develop the industry. "Using the provincial power grid as an  entity to connect all power grids" is a product of the objective  pattern in industry growth and actual economic management in  China today. Essentially, it stresses that an inter-provincial  or provincial power grid must be an independent economic entity.  At the same time, it is also a collective body of mutual  interest for a number of parties. "Centralized dispatch" is  determined by the internal power production pattern. The  complete concept should be "centralized dispatch and layered  management." Raising money to invest in power plants is a major  accomplishment in the reform of our electric power industry. To  build up the electric utilities ahead of the game requires us to  take full advantage of capital available both domestically and  internationally. Fundraising must also be perfected toward a  higher level, such as joint ventures and standardized  shareholder ownership, within a socialist market economy  structure. A standardized shareholder ownership is a better way  to raise money to build up the industry. It is more powerful  than making an investment or arranging a loan because it can  effectively attract domestic and foreign funds. It can clearly  sort out the ownership of a complicated production entity  through a standardized shareholder system. Legally, it ensures a  true separation of ownership and operating authority to protect  the legal rights of the investors and the legitimacy of the  operator. This move will help standardize the way investment in  power plant construction is made and the way foreign investment  is treated. It will facilitate the government to authorize other  parties to operate its business to improve efficiency and thus  secures the appreciation of existing nationally owned  enterprises. "Do what is suitable to the occasion and place" is  a principle we must follow in implementing the reform and  development plan for the electric power industry. As long as we  insist on being practical, we ought to be able to find a way to  standardize the ownership of the local power grid to place the  industry on a healthy growth track.    Under the "20-Word" guideline, a standardized shareholder  ownership may be in a variety of forms. However, regardless of  the form, all participants must be voluntary. For example, in  addition to a standardized shareholder ownership-based  provincial power grid, with the approval of a higher authority,  a number of power plants managed by investors themselves or by  other industries may be allowed to operate in parallel on the  grid as well. Nevertheless, they must sign an agreement with the  power grid that protects their rights and specifies their  responsibilities. Furthermore, on the basis of local economic  growth conditions and with the approval of a higher authority in  charge of electric utilities a more flexible shareholder  arrangement may be experimented in a limited region, such as  cities and counties along the eastern seaboard. This region may  be called the electric utility "developing region." Hopefully,  local governments will provide certain incentives to encourage  power plant construction as well. Investors should take  advantage of such incentives and invest more in power plant  construction to produce a higher annual growth rate and create a  mechanism for future projects. This is an important measure that  will encourage an economically growing region to build up its  own electric power and perfect its own power grid.    3. Strong leadership, daring experimentation and steady  pace are required to march toward a standardized shareholder  ownership system.    After a decade of reform and open market policy, there is a  solid foundation for a standardized shareholder ownership  system. However, as a whole, our reform is still very primitive  and unbalanced. Shareholder ownership should be experimented in  more competitive and higher quality industries first to produce  the desired results. The experience gained can then be used to  guide the rest of the nation. Other industries must be patient  to create the necessary conditions. We must proceed steadily and  prevent a stampede.    Industries that are earmarked as test points for shareholder  ownership must rigorously follow the procedures and regulations  issued by the government and proceed step by step according to  plan. On the basis of the "20-Word" policy and the "suitability  to occasion and location" principle, an industry must find a  format that suits its specific situation. The focal point is to  study the organization of the shareholder structure.    Every electric utility must have a solid organization as a  modern business. The organization must function perfectly for  the purpose of conducting business. We must make sure that the  State Council set aside a certain amount of our national  infrastructure investment fund for a national electric utility  industry corporation as its capital in order to strengthen its  ability to borrow money elsewhere. It will be part of the power  grid construction fund that will be loaned to the electric  utility corporation to build key grids. It will handle the  borrowing, repayment of principal and interest, and the  construction and management of key power grids. Key power grids  must be 100-percent controlled by the electric utility  corporation and loans will be directly obtained from the  national development bank. Existing government-owned capital in  electric utility needs to be liquidated. For example, after  adopting a price structure that pays back principal and  interest, the money collected should be reinvested in other  projects managed by the industry. Existing and added capacity of  the power grid must be managed by the electric power industry.  Investment in large key power plants built for peak-saving and  load leveling, including water pumping storage power plants and  nuclear power plants, should be made by the electric utility  corporation with government funds so that the utility company  can effectively control and directly manage such plants on  behalf of the government. On this basis, a national electric  utility corporation should be established.    We must insist on the principle of having a single grid  control system and many electric utility companies. Under the  premise that safe operation of the grid is ensured, other  internal standardized shareholder ownership systems may be  explored. Domestic and foreign investors will be encouraged to  build power plants either with controlling interest or as a  shareholder. However, investment and loan must be separated. If  it is an investment, then it is entitled to dividends. If it is  a loan, then its principal and interest should be repaid. The  investor has an option to choose.    In the next seven years, the electric power industry needs  $25 billion. This corresponds to importing 45 million kW of  equipment. To this end, in addition to loans obtained from  foreign governments, international monetary agencies and  commercial credits, it is also necessary to attract direct  foreign investment, free up tied-up capital and encourage joint  ventures and other collaborative effort to construct more power  plants. We have to establish and perfect rules and regulations  that govern the use of foreign investment on power plant  construction and strengthen our control over this matter. Our  own national interest should always come first. We must provide  solid leadership and rigorous supervision to make sure that  risks are shared. We should avoid paying an excessively high or  a fixed rate of return to put us in a disadvantageous position.    Reform is the driving force behind liberation and  development. In order to liberate and develop the output of the  electric utility industry to put it in the lead, we must fully  mobilize the resources in our central and local government. This  is the key to a successful reform.    To realize such an "extraordinary" growth in the electric  utility industry, and to better serve our economy, we must work  together as a whole under the leadership of the Party Central  and the State Council and be persistent until our objectives are  met.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DOMESTIC TROUBLES TOPPLE SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT;  </P> <P> ANTELOPE VALLEY: A ONCE-POPULAR HIGH SCHOOL OFFICIAL WAS OUSTED AND THREE  INCUMBENTS LOST IN THE KEPPEL ELEMENTARY DISTRICT.  </P> <P> The major changes wrought by school board elections in the Antelope Valley were  the ouster of three incumbents in the small Keppel District and the defeat of  the president of the Antelope Valley Union High School District, a former top  vote-getter who became involved in a domestic scandal.  </P> <P> Almost complete, semi-official returns showed that about 9.5% of the region's  voters -- well below the countywide turnout of 13.2% -- cast ballots Tuesday in  eight Antelope Valley school district elections in which 44 candidates sought  22 seats.  </P> <P> Four years ago, county probation officer William Olenick got more votes than  any other school board candidate in the Antelope Valley to win a seat on a high  school board.  </P> <P> But he finished a surprisingly distant fifth among seven candidates following a  much-publicized arrest in July on a complaint by his now-estranged wife that he  had struck her. The district attorney's office declined to prosecute him, and  his opponents did not make an issue of the arrest in their campaigns.  </P> <P> In the region's other major upset, incumbents Patricia Conner, Jerry Freeman  and Robert Jones were ousted by challengers who complained of poor educational  standards and other problems in the Keppel elementary school district, which  covers Pearblossom and Littlerock.  </P> <P> In the 9,800-student Antelope Valley Union High School District, with three  seats at stake, the top finishers were Parent Teacher Assn. president Sophia  Waugh with 22.2% and advertising executive Steve Landaker with 21.4%. Larry  Rucker, the only victorious incumbent, won the third seat and a third term with  20%.  </P> <P> Trailing them were school police officer Daniel Fricke, 10.6%; Olenick, 10.4%;  phone company superintendent Phil Maher, 9.1%; and court financial officer  David Von Buskirk, 6.4%.  </P> <P> In the nearly 3,000-student Keppel Union School District, three incumbents and  four challengers competed for three seats. The challengers winning office were  school principal R. Michael Dutton, 20.7%; homemaker Valorie Gorny, 20.2%; and  parks supervisor Richard Sanders, 14.4%.  </P> <P> The ousted incumbents finished fourth, fifth and sixth. Freeman got 11.9%,  Conner 11.2%, and Jones 11.1%. Trailing them was homemaker Claudia Moore with  10.5%. Challengers had complained the district was suffering from high teacher  turnover, low test scores and excessive administrative spending.  </P> <P> In the 8,600-student Antelope Valley Community College District, two incumbents  and two challengers sought three seats. Incumbents James Du Pratt Jr. and  Herman Kicenski won reelection with 30.8% and 25.4% tallies. Former college  spokeswoman Betty Lou Nash took the third seat with 28.9%, while insurance  executive Felix Le Marinel trailed with 14.9%.  </P> <P> In the 10,700-student Lancaster School District, all three incumbents on the  ballot won reelection, fending off four challengers. Incumbents Melinda White  and Michael Huggins, who both took office as a result of a February recall  election, won new terms with 24.2% and 21.7%, respectively. Board President  Richard White (no relation to Melinda White) won a second full term with 19%.  </P> <P> Three challengers lost, led by air traffic controller Joseph Starling, who  received 11.6%. Maridelle Wright, the wife of a former district superintendent  who was ousted earlier this year, got 9.2%; Parent Teacher Assn. President  Jacki Pendleton received 9%, and aircraft mechanic Keith Wilde, 5.3%.  </P> <P> In the 11,500-student Palmdale School District, Sheldon Epstein, a teacher in a  sheriff's detention facility, topped two opponents to win a two-year term.  Epstein got 45.1%, besting retired aerospace engineer Dan Hunter's 34.7% and  the 20.1% tally for general contractor F. Don Linde. The seat belonged to  former board member Susan Moulton, who resigned in June, leaving the four-year  seat available for the remaining two years of the term.  </P> <P> In the Eastside Union School District, incumbent Martha Johnson won reelection  with 28.3%, while newcomers Larry Lake and Lee Doughty took vacant seats with  votes of 25.4% and 21.4%, respectively. Lake is a rancher and businessman.  Doughty is an educational consultant. Trailing them were Michael Terry with  13.2% and Gary Holmes with 11.8%.  </P> <P> In the Westside Union School District, homemaker Sandra Engebretson finished  first with 22.1%. Two incumbents, Lynne Murley and Charles Strole, won  reelection with 21.8% and 20.5%. The losing candidates were Larry Lindner,  17.7%; Chuck Brandel, 9.6%; and Howard Brooks, 8.3%.  </P> <P> In the Wilsona School District, challengers Frank Donaldson Sr. and Michael  Brown finished first and second with 23.7% and 22.5%, respectively. Incumbent  Sue Stokka was defeated, finishing last with 16.7%. Incumbent Luis Easterwood,  with 18.6%, clung to a two-vote lead over Richard Foster in semi-official  returns.  </P></p>

This is one of  the issues that was blocking the EU [European Union] enlargement  negotiations.    Speaking in Brussels, Javier Solana described the agreement  as reasonable although he admitted that it is not all that Spain  had asked for. The Spanish foreign minister highlighted that  the quotas are not the main point this agreement. The end of  the transitory regime in 1996 instead of in the year 2003 is  more important [Spain will be able to fish in all EU waters in  1996 instead of waiting until 2003].    For his part, Vicente Albero told this radio station that  Spanish companies can establish joint ventures in Norway and  thus fish on the Norwegian quota.    He added that Spanish fishermen will have access to the  Norwegian fishing grounds and that the fishing quota has finally  been increased.    On another hand, next Tuesday [22 March], the EU will have  to  solve the institutional dispute about the voting system in the  Council of Ministers. According to the Greek presidency, this  will be the last chance if blocking the EU enlargement is to be  avoided.    Despite a long meeting, the Community foreign ministers were  unable to reach an agreement on how many votes will be needed in  a 16-member Council of Ministers to block a decision.    Spain and the United Kingdom want, for very different  reasons, the blocking minority to stay at 23 votes while the  rest of the countries favor increasing it to 27 votes when the  four new members join.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Jennifer Weir has her wedding ring back -- three months after it vanished down  a toilet at her home in Union City. Weir, 25, called the Union Sanitary  District after she lost the diamond ring during the Easter holiday and a crew  came out and probed the sewer line. "It wasn't in any of the stuff that came  out," Weir said. Crew chief Manuel Terra told her it might take a few months  for the ring to be washed from the house plumbing into the 8-inch line in the  street. Earlier this week, she called Terra, who came out again. The crew sent  a water-powered cleaning ball through the line from one manhole to the next. "I  was losing hope," Weir said. All of a sudden, Weir said, "the guy in the  manhole was yelling, 'You struck gold!"' "It was just luck," Terra said.  </P></p>

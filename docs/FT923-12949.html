			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Europe dents Maytag MAYTAG, the US household appliance group, yesterday said deteriorating business in Europe offset improved North American sales and resulted in a slightly lower operating net for its second quarter, Reuter reports. The group reported a net profit of Dollars 23.3m, or 22 cents a share, compared with Dollars 18.8m, or 18 cents, after a charge of Dollars 10m, or 6 cents for a plant closure. Maytag said results were slightly lower when compared with year-ago net before the charge. Sales edged down to Dollars 770m from Dollars 778m a year ago. The company's North American appliance group had sales of Dollars 567.4m, against Dollars 566.8m a year ago. But operating income of Dollars 46.3m was off 10 per cent because of start-up costs for a new dishwasher plant and several new electric range models, and the cost of discontinuing operations at its previous dishwasher facility.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Senada Cumurovic on a news conference by Ejup </F> Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, after talks  with Douglas Hogg, minister of state at the British Foreign  Office, in Sarajevo on 3 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Cumurovic] Dr. Ejup Ganic said that the discussion  on the implementation of the Washington Agreement was the main  topic on the agenda at the talks at the Presidency:    [Ganic] I informed our esteemed guest that we were working  together with the representatives of the Croatian people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina on the implementation, and that it has been  going well so far. I do not see any major problems here. In a  month's time we will [word indistinct] complete the bulk of the  work, I think. On the other hand, I said that this is an open  concept -- that is how we see it -- and for the Serbs who are  not [word indistinct] in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This federal  arrangement offers equal opportunities for all.    I also said that we (did not expect) the UK Government to  insist on a solution that would accept the results of ethnic  cleansing as this would be a precedent, a kind of virus that  would remain and would later give a chance to someone else in  another country to cause such a tragedy. I said that their  [word indistinct] influence on the Serbs is completely dormant,  and that we expect them to take a stricter line with the Serbs.  The Serbs seem to think that they have (support) from London.  These were our talks.    At the same time we said that we were cooperating with the  contact group. However, we cannot give away something that does  not belong to us, something that belongs to the people. We  politicians have only a limited mandate when it comes to private  property. We particularly spoke about cities, as most of the  cities that have been occupied [words indistinct] were inhabited  by Bosniaks as the majority nation. This is [word indistinct]  entire infrastructure, cinemas, post offices, sewage system,  roads, streetlights, all that belongs to the people who live  there. Everyone knows what is whose. We want a solution to be  reached in that context.    [Cumurovic] I consider the implementation of the Washington  Agreement an important step in halting the war here, Douglas  Hogg, UK Foreign Office minister, said. [passage indistinct]</p>

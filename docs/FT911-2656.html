			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Arts: The Stick Wife - The Gate Theatre The staging is terrific; the lighting is pretty good, too. And, of course, this being the Gate Theatre, the acting and direction are superb. There are some doubts, however, about the play. The Stick Wife by the American playwright Darrah Cloud is set in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963, a pregnant year in US politics. The stage action takes place outside a suburban white lower middle class house, where the washing is hung out to dry in the days before drying machines took over. Since most of the washing consists of white sheets, the message is clear enough from the start. 'I'd never realised how much white shows up the dirt,' says one of the female characters later on. There are three wives and three husbands. The men are involved in the bombing of a black church which results in the death of four children. The women are in varying degrees and at various stages opposed to the violence, which the men call war. One of the wives informs the federal authorities that the husbands are members of the Ku Klux Klan. This is a true, or at least true-ish, story, documented by the New York Times. In the end, however, the women stick to their men. The crowning blow, as you might have guessed from the date, is the assassination of President Kennedy. 'Oh my Lord,' the women wail in unison, 'who's going to take care of us now?' No point in shooting their husbands, as they had once seemed prepared to do, if there has been a collapse of authority in the White House. They may not have stuck to their guns anyway. There are some good moments: for example, in reference to war - 'Where's Vietnam?' 'Africa.' And Marty Cruickshank, as the leading wife, comes dramatically close to pulling the trigger. One half-expected a section of the audience to rise up in protest that she does not. Ms Cruickshank is marvellous in her intensity, as indeed is the whole production - down to the sound of the crickets - by Nancy Diuguid. Written 20 years ago, this would have been a stunning piece. Now it seems a bit dated: the women's movement looking for roots.</p>

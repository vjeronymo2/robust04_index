			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Stonecipher plays a difficult hand - The McDonnell Douglas chief knows how to gamble Harry Stonecipher likes to play cards. 'Poker and gin rummy - gin rummy is a good game,' he smiles. Unfortunately, poker sessions these days are a little limited. 'It's difficult to get five or six people together for a game, but a group of us do tend to play poker in hotel rooms after aerospace association meetings and conferences.' Mr Harry Stonecipher, the new chief executive of McDonnell Douglas, will have less time for cards in smoke-filled convention rooms, but he may still play several difficult business hands there. The US defence industry has been consolidating rapidly as military spending has plummeted. The challenge is to rationalise in the face of far lower production runs. Even big companies such as IBM and Ford have sold their defence arms. General Dynamics has dismembered itself at auction and Lockheed and Martin Marietta have merged. McDonnell Douglas had to stand apart from such deals. Its finances were too weak for the company to become a buyer, while pride prevented sales. The result is that the once-unrivalled group is steadily being caught. Its policy of splendid isolation may not be an option for much longer. McDonnell is constrained by its mix of products. New aircraft are the lifeblood of the aerospace business, yet McDonnell has no part in the Dollars 71bn F-22 next generation fighter for the US air force. Some of its aircraft are getting long in the tooth: the F-15 is the company's top fighter, but it first flew in the early 1970s. The only new military aircraft McDonnell has is the C-17 transporter, which is late and heavily over-budget. McDonnell has already written off about Dollars 1bn in cost overruns on the C-17. Production may be stopped at 40 aircraft next year unless deliveries speed up and the price tag drops from the current Dollars 280m each. Mr Stonecipher is the first person in the history of the St Louis-based aerospace company to be chief executive without the benefit of his name over the door. He is neither a McDonnell nor a Douglas - he is an outsider. He will have to win the backing of the board and the workforce for changes, without the benefit of a lifetime of McDonnell Douglas company politics. However, he is cheerfully upbeat about prospects. 'This company has a great portfolio of products, the Apache (attack helicopter), the F-15 and F-18 (fighters) and the Delta (rocket), they stand us in good stead. I would rather have existing products which we can develop and make more affordable, than very expensive future programmes which stand a good chance of being being cancelled outright.' The objective is to persuade the US government and potential overseas buyers that McDonnell's current technology is a better bet. To do that the company is evolving its designs and introducing small-batch manufacturing techniques to cut the cost of each aircraft. An F-15 costs about Dollars 45m. If that could be cut to Dollars 35m, it would look very attractive against projections of Dollars 165m for each F-22  -an estimate that analysts think will rise. Mr Stonecipher has short-term objectives, or 'must-wins' in the jargon. 'Getting the C-17 right is absolutely my top priority . . . we must make the aircraft affordable and deliver it on time. I am looking for many more than 40 aircraft for the USAF and if we can get its cost below Dollars 200m each, then I think there are substantial export opportunities.' For the C-17, the crunch comes next July when a month-long trial, partly in simulated war conditions, will determine whether the programme lives or dies. The other short-term priority is the civil division, Douglas Aircraft. It is limping behind Boeing and Airbus, and Mr Stonecipher is looking for strategic alliances - 'but not for financial reasons like the deal with Taiwan', a proposed joint venture which eventually fell apart. 'We are financially stronger now and are looking for partners in Europe and the Pacific rim who can give us access to markets,' he says. That increased financial strength may also increase the potential for acquisitions. But have all of the best opportunities already gone? Buying Boeing's defence business would make sense. It would give McDonnell a stake in the F-22 and consolidate two of the players in the splintered helicopter industry. But Boeing has little reason to sell. Northrop Grumman may be too large to swallow and faces a similar shortage of new products. Lockheed has married another. If McDonnell's board has any worries that it has missed out, Mr Stonecipher betrays no sign of them. He is a cheerful and engaging character, a trait which plays well to the workforce. The habit of wandering in to talk to the 5.30am shift also encourages the image of a man of the people. Mr Stonecipher has the great advantage that much of the worst bloodletting has already been done at McDonnell. With the workforce down to 65,000 from 135,000 in three years, and the C-17 and commercial aircraft operations back on an even keel, the new chief executive can afford to talk of motivation and building the business. However, the challenge for his tenure, is to bluff his way out of a strategic problem with a hand which has weakened, against other companies which have drawn some good cards. It will not be an easy task.</p>

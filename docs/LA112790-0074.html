The home will include four  cottages, nursery, medical clinic, administration building, school, gymnasium,  dining room and recreational areas.  </P> <P> Organizers hope to select a final architectural plan for the facility in  December, Burke said. The groundbreaking is planned for the summer of 1991, she  said. MAJA RADEVICH  </P></p>

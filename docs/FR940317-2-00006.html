Agency review and approval in accordance with 9 CFR 309.17 and 381.75 are required before these transgenic research animals may be slaughtered for human food use at official establishments. In addition, persons who intend to slaughter transgenic research animals or their progeny for human food use at official establishments may obtain a copy of the Points to Consider document, and follow the voluntary guidelines set forth in that document. Persons who follow both the applicable regulations cited above and the Points to Consider document should note that the inspector in charge (IIC) may still deny or withdraw the approval to slaughter transgenic research animals for human food use when the IIC deems it necessary to assure that products prepared at the official establishment are not adulterated, in accordance with the FMIA and the PPIA. The approval to slaughter commercially produced, nonresearch transgenic animals will be handled separately at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, trangenesis is usually conducted by injecting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into fertilized eggs to achieve desired genetic and/or physical changes. This procedure results in only a small proportion of animals being born with genetic changes. Animals born without genetic change may be used for human food under current policies set forth in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) June 26, 1986, policy statement published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (51 FR 23336) which states that existing regulations would be applied to food animals involved in biotechnology experiments. Also, USDA's policy for the inspection for human food use of livestock and poultry which are involved in biotechnology research but which are not genetically modified products of biotechnology, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 67054) on December 27, 1991, concerns transgenic research livestock and poultry in which genetic change has not occurred. Due to the small number of transgenic research animals produced in biotechnology experiments, such transgenic research animals have not been presented for slaughter in the past. However, FSIS anticipates that production of such transgenic animals will increase. This notice reaffirms USDA's June 26, 1986, and December 27, 1991, notices, specifically with regard to animals involved in biotechnology experiments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the high level of public and Congressional interest in biotechnology, FSIS is advising in this notice the actions it will take to ensure that meat, meat food products, and poultry products derived from livestock and poultry involved in biotechnology experiments are safe, wholesome, and accurately labeled. This document also provides guidance to those using biotechnology to produce genetic changes in livestock and poultry and offering the same for slaughter at official establishments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

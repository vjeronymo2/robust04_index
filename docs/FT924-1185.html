			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / American Express Bank curbs loans AMERICAN EXPRESS Bank has suspended unsecured lending above Pounds 2,500 to its 40,000 green card UK customers because of rising bad debts and the recession. Customers whose overdraft exceeds Pounds 2,500 have been told that their facility has been suspended and that cheques made after receipt of the letter will not be honoured. A spokesman at the bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of American Express, said its write-offs for bad debt provision during the past two years had been 'fairly harsh'. The bank's after-tax profits last year fell to Dollars 60m (Pounds 39.40m) from Dollars 111m. American Express bank halved the overdraft facility for its gold card customers earlier this month to Pounds 5,000. It has now reduced the overdraft limit for green card holders from Pounds 7,500 to Pounds 2,500. American Express says the decision follows a strategic overview which has concluded that unsecured lending should be left to customers' primary banks. It is reviewing its lending policies worldwide. Green card customers were told that the decision reflected several factors, including the recession and 'uncertain economic conditions in the UK'. The overdraft facility will be reviewed in six months' time. The move has angered customers expecting to be able to use their overdraft facility in the run-up to Christmas. American Express acknowledged that the timing of the decision may not have been the best. One customer said he was 'staggered' by the bank's attitude, which he described as autocratic and arbitrary. 'I've been an American Express cardholder since 1984 and have never had a dent in my creditworthiness with them,' he said. 'They've aggressively sold me other cards and this higher overdraft facility and now I'm suddenly told my cheques will be bounced.' He said he would be cancelling his gold card because of the measure.</p>

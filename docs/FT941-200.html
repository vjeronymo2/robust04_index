			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Court toughens product liability stance A Japanese court yesterday ordered Matsushita, the leading electronics group, to pay damages to an Osaka construction company in a landmark case which could have an impact on product liability legislation Japan is considering adopting. The Osaka district court ruled that a fire which destroyed the office of the plaintiff originated in a television set manufactured by Matsushita. The ruling is the first ever in Japan to acknowledge a consumer electronics manufacturer's liability for its products. Under Japanese law the burden of proof in product liability cases lies with the consumer. Presiding Judge Takeshi Mizuno said in his ruling that 'if a maker bearing the high responsibility of guaranteeing the safety of its products does not prove specifically that there was no defect, it cannot escape responsibility for the error'. The ruling was expected to trigger further debate about the need for a product liability law in Japan. Hitherto, Japan has lagged behind the US and other industrialised countries in introducing this form of consumer protection. A draft law is expected to be presented to parliament in April. Product liability legislation is expected to be finally introduced in fiscal 1995.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Japan launches first rocket Japan's much delayed H-2 rocket finally made its maiden voyage yesterday, delivering an unmanned prototype space shuttle into orbit, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The H-2, plagued by technical problems which put back the programme some two years, was launched after two delays this week because of bad weather and a faulty air duct. The successful launch opens up prospects for Japan to enter the lucrative commercial satellite-launching business.</p>

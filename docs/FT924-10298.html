			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: Shell Oil advances and announces more job cuts SHELL OIL, the US arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, yesterday reported a rise in third-quarter earnings from Dollars 28m to Dollars 42m and announced further reductions in its labour force as part of a significant cost-cutting programme. Shell, which previously announced it planned to cut its 31,500 US workforce by 10 to 15 per cent, mainly through attrition and early retirement programmes, said that it now expected to reduce it by more than 20 per cent by early next year. However, a spokesman said most of the increment would come from workers who left the company through the sale of businesses, including its credit card processing operations and the planned sale of its coal mining business to Ziegler Coal Holding. Excluding special items, its quarterly operating results rose Dollars 102m, which the company said reflected its extensive cost reduction programme. However it was now taking additional cost reduction steps because of the difficult industry environment, and aimed to realise by year-end some two-thirds of its Dollars 800m cost-cutting target, originally scheduled for completion at the end of 1994.</p>

Lobskiy: "Admiral I. </F> Kasatonov: `I Side With These People and I Am Ready To Defend  Their Interests'"]    [Text] A group of officers from the Navy's Joint  Chiefs of Staff headed by Admiral Igor Kasatonov, deputy  commander of the Russian Navy, has paid a three-day visit to the  Baltic Sea Fleet.    The inspection was aimed at organizing combat, tactical, and  command training for the new year, as well as to examine issues  connected with the withdrawal of fleet units from the Baltic  states.    Summarizing the results of the inspection, Adm. Kasatonov  emphasized that the Baltic Sea Fleet positively distinguishes  itself among other Russian fleets. The final grade received by  the fleet -- "good."    Nevertheless, Igor Vladimirovich [Kasatonov] devoted the  main  part of his speech to an analysis of shortcomings and  oversights. After all, as one of the officers pointed out,  "Kasatonov would not be Kasatonov if he were less adamant."    In the opinion of the admiral, there are many shortcomings  in  the organization of command, the headquarters' performance in  the development of naval combat tactics is poor, many officers  are not sufficiently acquainted with documents regulating their  responsibilities, and the work at headquarters is improperly  organized.    However, I dare say that the most important part of the  inspection on the Baltic Sea Fleet was Kasatonov's visit to the  city of Liepaja, where he met with Latvian Navy Commander G.  Zeibots. In the course of the meeting, they discussed issues  connected with the transfer of Russian Navy facilities to the  Lithuanian side. According to Zeibots, the Lithuanians feel  resentment toward Russian servicemen who, in his opinion, do not  properly prepare the facilities for the transfer, which makes it  impossible to use these facilities. As an example, he cited a  building in Bolderaja, a suburb of Riga, which had been handed  over to Latvia half ruined. Yet, the Russian side refuted such  accusations. Providing two Liepaja military schools as an  example, they proved that facilities are transferred in suitable  conditions, however, following the transfer, they are left  completely unprotected which leads to pilferage.    G. Zeibots admitted that such complications really exist,  but, he believes that the main problem is the lack of  appropriate transfer procedures.    Also discussed at the meeting was the possibility of  Russia's  using the Liepaja and Riga ship repair yards. The commander of  Latvian Navy requested that Adm. Kasatonov sell two signal  cannons which are essential for Latvia to conduct protocol  ceremonies. According to the former's words, although this issue  has already been discussed for more than two years, it has not  been resolved.    Assessing the results of the meeting, G. Zeibots noted that  in general it was conducted in a business-like, constructive  atmosphere. He also emphasized that the complex problems, which  appear in connection with the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Latvia, are solved more constructively in cooperation with the  Russian Navy leadership than the Command of the Army.    The same day, Adm. Igor Kasatonov met with Liepaja  administration representatives. Imant Vismins, head of the  administration, requested the Russian Navy Command complete the  pullback of naval units from Liepaja by 10 May 1994. In his  opinion, this is necessary to stabilize the political situation  in the city on the eve of municipal elections scheduled for the  end of May.    Admiral Kasatonov stated that the deadlines for the  withdrawal are defined by a special timetable, which takes into  account the capabilities of the railroad system, accessibility  of new facilities for moving troops, and coordination of  timetables for the withdrawal of Russian troops from other  Baltic republics, Germany, and Poland. He also emphasized that  the Russian Navy Command may fulfill the request of the Liepaja  Administration, if the necessity of doing this is convincibly  motivated and the rights of the Russian-speaking population are  guaranteed and protected.    Leaders of the trade union committees of the Liepaja Naval  Brigade and representatives of veteran organizations who  participated in the meeting recalled facts testifying that  civilian personnel of Russian military units are discriminated  against in terms of housing and certain other issues.    "I entirely side with these people," stated Igor Kasatonov  adamantly, "and I am ready to defend their interests."    According to Vismins, the Liepaja branch of the Department  of  Citizenship and Immigration is not subordinated to the City  Administration. Nevertheless, he promised to apply measures for  assuring compliance with Latvian law if it is violated.    Having heard reports by commanders of Russian units deployed  at the Liepaja Naval Base and examined the timetable for their  withdrawal, the first deputy commander of the Russian Navy noted  that the timetable for withdrawal of equipment, property, and  personnel had been thoroughly cross-examined and is completely  realistic.    In a conversation with a STRAZH BALTIKI correspondent, he  agreed that it is possible to complete the pullout of the  Liepaja naval brigade by 1 June 1994. The greatest difficulty,  which cannot be definitely solved at the moment, is housing for  the families of servicemen.    At the same time, Adm. Kasatonov emphasized that the issue  of  the Navy's withdrawal will be solved in the context of Russian-  Lithuanian relations and based on government agreements.    Yesterday, the officers' group headed by Adm. Igor Kasatonov  departed for St. Petersburg.</p>

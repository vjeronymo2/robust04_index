			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Heron's plight coming under close scrutiny  -Pounds 100m loss estimated and restructuring on the cards Not an easy year for the company or for me personally. Saying this Mr Gerald Ronson observed that 'it will be seen as a time from which we at Heron all move forward together'. It is not hard to understand why, in March 1991, Mr Ronson said in the annual statement of his property and finance company Heron International that he wanted to put the past behind him. Heron had suffered the worst year of its history, and Mr Ronson had just completed a six-month term in Ford Open Prison for his part in the Guinness scandal. His wish for a better commercial year has not been granted. A year later, for the financial period ending tomorrow, Heron is likely to declare a its first-ever pre-tax loss, which some estimates put as high as around Pounds 100m. On Friday Mr Ronson will ask his banks to reschedule some Pounds 1.3bn of debt and bonds. It would be easy to throw back at Mr Ronson his comments in last annual report: 'We have always borne in mind the possibility of cyclical changes in the economy . . . we have always pursued . . . the prudent management of . . . borrowings'. But the restructuring has surprised many Heron observers who shared its chairman's view that it was cautiously managed. They point out that Mr Ronson is hardly known for flamboyance. Now 53, he took over the business that he and his father, from a Russian jewish immigrant family, had developed together. He retains a tough-talking style and London accent unsoftened by his financial success. His small long-serving team of executives has been picked over the years from those who share his taste for working a six and a half day week. He and Mr Alan Goldman, the 48-year old chartered accountant who is deputy chief executive, and has worked for Heron for 18 years, share a view of commercial life as an unceasing battle. Fond of pugnacious metaphors in their comments to the press - Mr Ronson described working in America as swimming in a shark pool - they have not given the impression that they were carried away with delusions of omnipotence. Bankers have been comforted too in the past by Mr Ronson's own 15 per cent stake in the business. Of the balance 40 per cent is held by Ronson family trusts, and 45 per cent by the Ronson Foundations, which give to a wide range of charities. How then did Heron miscalculate? The company has said that the biggest factor in the need for financial rescheduling was the damage done to its net worth by its ill-fated US expansion - a decision made 12 years ago. In 1980 it paid Dollars 23.5m for Pima, a US savings and loan business, similar to a building society. Pima, based in Tucson, Arizona, had then around Dollars 400m of loans on its books, but these rose to some Dollars 3.3bn by 1987. However, like several savings and loans associations in the South West of America, it fell into heavy losses after a collapse in the property market. From mid 1987 Heron tried, unsuccessfully, to find a buyer. But Pima was eventually given away to the US's Office of Thrift Supervision, a regulatory authority, in March 1990, and Heron wrote off Pounds 193m in its accounts for that year. But clearly that 12-year-old decision is not all the story behind the call for Friday's meeting. Writedowns on its development property portfolio have played a large part too. Heron will present its banks on Friday with what it coyly describes as a 'different' assessment of its net assets from the Pounds 585.1m shown in last year's accounts - and banks are expected to scrutinise the assumptions for last year's valuations closely. The financial assessment is being carried out by Price Waterhouse, the accountants, although the company said yesterday that Ernst &amp; Young, the auditors, were being retained. However some Heron watchers are also asking whether an underlying past weakness - which may have contributed to the US expansion - is Mr Ronson's dependence on a small number of long serving directors. Heron has brought in several outsiders to manage divisions over the past decade. But Ronson-watchers point out that not all were long-lasting - in particular the appointment of Mr Hugh Jenkins in 1984, to oversee the US operations - in retrospect then at a critical point in their fortunes. Mr Jenkins stayed only for 18 months, before leaving to return to investment management in the UK. He is now chief executive of Prudential Portfolio managers. However charges of introversion must be lessened by a series of senior appointments in the last few years; at present only six of the top 15 executive directors and managers have been at Heron more than 10 years. The question of how the blame for financial rescheduling should be distributed between the recession and Heron's management will come under scrutiny at next Friday's meeting. One banker last week described Heron as 'intensely private in both senses - not just as Britain's second largest privately - owned company, but in Mr Ronson's character.' The restructuring may cost him some of that privacy.</p>

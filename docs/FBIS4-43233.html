			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Stella Rimington, director general of the British </F> secret service, MI5, as part of the "Richard Dimbleby Lecture  Program" in London--live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] As a nation, we have always  been fascinated by the so-called secret services. English  literature contains a long line of spy fiction from Kipling's  "Kim" through John Buchan, to John Le Carre, and many more  besides. It's exciting stuff, and it's led to the creation of  many myths and some lurid speculation about our work. I must  admit that it's with some hesitation that I set out tonight to  shed some daylight. I have a sneaking feeling that the fiction  may turn out to be more fun than the reality.    I want to explain what MI5--or the security service--does,  why it's needed, and how it's accountable. I shall show that a  security service is an important plank in the defense of a free  society and of its civil liberties and basic values.    A security service does not conflict with democracy, even  though it must work largely in secret--provided it's properly  overseen and controlled, as it is in this country. Britain has  three different security and intelligence services. The  security service, MI5, is the service I lead. MI6 is the secret  intelligence--also known as SIS--and the third is the Government  Communications Headquarters, GCHQ.    I blame George Smiley [character from television series] for  some of the confusion. In his role as the mole hunter, he was  clearly doing MI5's work, but recruiting foreign agents behind  the Iron Curtain placed him firmly in MI6. In fact, we are  three separate organizations with different functions. We work  closely together, and we have the highest regard for each  other's professionalism.    So what do we all do? The primary role for both SIS and GCHQ  is to collect the foreign intelligence which is needed to  protect and support British interests. The security service,  MI5, on the other hand, is the defensive service, the national  security intelligence agency, and it's the security service I  shall be talking about tonight. Our role is to safeguard the  survival and well-being of the state against substantial threats  which are covertly organized and purposeful.    Throughout history governments have insured that they get to  know about matters affecting the security of the state. The  first documented security service in England was in Queen  Elizabeth's time, under Sir Francis Walsingham. He successfully  uncovered a number of plots against her, although she paid him  so poorly that he was driven to the verge of bankruptcy. There  is no innuendo in that observation. Sir Francis probably did  very much as he was ordered.    Today our functions are formerly set out in the act of  parliament--the Security Service Act--which is our mandate. But  why do we need a security service in 1994? The modern security  service was founded in 1909 to counter the threat of German  espionage. Both before and during the First World War, large  numbers of spies were rounded up. During the second war, the  service had the leading counterespionage role, and it played a  central part in the double- cross operation designed to mislead  Hitler about the D-Day landing sites. During the Cold War, much  of the service's effort again went to countering the  sophisticated and well-resourced intelligence services of the  Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies as they searched for  this country's secrets. But since the collapse of communism,  the threats to national security and the tasks they generate for  us have changed greatly. Countering espionage now takes less  than a quarter of our resources--half what it was three years  ago, and a far cry from the position at the height of the Cold  War.    The fall of the communist regimes and the disintegration of  the Soviet Union were fundamental changes, and the service moved  rapidly to respond to them. We developed links with a number of  countries in the former Warsaw Pact once we were satisfied that  democracy had taken hold and espionage against us had ceased.  Together with our sister service, SIS, we provided advice and  support for the reorganized and reoriented security services,  particularly to help them establish a democratic framework for  their work. We also began to exchange information on areas  where there were shared concerns, crucially encountering  terrorism.    This was an exciting time for officers from both sides of  the  old Iron Curtain, and there were many intriguing encounters  between former adversaries. But the development of these links  to our newly democratic counterparts in Central Europe was an  important success. Last year, for example, a joint operation  involving a number of agencies halted a large consignment of  weapons originating in Poland and destined for so-called  loyalist terrorists in Northern Ireland.    The situation in Russia is different. Considerable progress  has been made towards democratic reform. We no longer need fear  the intense military related espionage against us associated  with the Cold War. The cataclysmic threats of the nuclear  exchange or of an attack have receded, but the process of reform  is still vulnerable, and in the Russian security and  intelligence services it's less far advanced.    Both in this country and abroad there has been clear  evidence from the sort of threats from espionage which we still  need to counter. The case of Aldrich Ames, the CIA officer in  the United States who recently pleaded guilty to spying, is one  example. Although a year or so ago the Russians reduced the  number of their intelligence officers here, the total has now  begun to creep up again. We must, therefore, remain on our  guard. A spokesman for the Russian intelligence service has  said recently: There are friendly states, but no friendly  intelligence services. I don't believe this. It should be in  our interests to establish the same sort of professional liaison  with the Russian services that we successfully established  elsewhere--including in the former Eastern bloc--but there's  still a considerable way to go. Of course, the Warsaw Pact was  not the only source of foreign espionage, and other countries do  still pose a threat, but it is by and large of a different and  lesser order.    The other significant change in the service's work since the  collapse of Soviet communism has been in relation to subversion.  This is a much misunderstood and contentious area, largely  because everyone has their own definition. The word subversion  itself doesn't appear in the Security Service Act, although the  sense is conveyed in the phrase: activities intended to  overthrow or undermine parliamentary democracy by political,  industrial, or violent means.    The intention to undermine democracy is what subversion  means  to us. It does not include political dissent. Many of those  whom the service had to investigate were members of parties and  organizations which made no secret of their wish to undermine  parliamentary democracy. There were others who kept their true  objectives secret. Some, such as the communists, were loyal to  the Soviet Union and its allies. Others--for example, the  Trotskyists--were fiercely critical of what they dubbed state  capitalism. That made no difference to their determination to  replace the democratic system with one of their own choosing.  The service set out to identify all the members of these  subversive groups and to investigate their activities. This was  particularly necessary so that they could be denied access to  secret information through the vetting system which Mr. Atlee  introduced in 1949.    In its rise to power, the Communist Party of the Soviet  Union  set great store by infiltrating and manipulating organizations  such as trade unions. The Communist Party of Great Britain  followed this doctrine enthusiastically, with the aim of  bringing their influence to bear covertly and in a way that was  far out of proportion to the negligible support they could  achieve through the ballot box. Activity of this sort was of  concern to successive governments and was a legitimate subject  of attention by the security service. The allegation that the  service investigated organizations that were not in themselves  subversive is quite untrue. Our interest was in the  subversives, not in the organizations they sought to penetrate.    I've spoken in the past tense because over the last 10 years  the threat from subversion has diminished dramatically. It now  requires less than 5 percent of our time. Some of that is now  devoted to groups on the extreme right for seeking to undermine  democracy through the exploitation of racial hatred and  xenophobia. But the service's overwhelming focus today, three  quarters of our work, is concentrated on terrorism--terrorism  originating both from within the United Kingdom and from abroad.  For the past 20 years or so, the security service has been  responsible for coordinating intelligence work against terrorism  carried out from overseas and with the potential to affect this  country's interests anywhere in the world.    In countering this international terrorism, we work closely  with others, including SIS and GCHQ, and of course the police  forces and other agencies in this country and abroad. Over the  past two years, and leaving aside the UK, terrorist attacks have  taken place worldwide at the rate of nearly one a day. This  illustrates the extent of the problem, and there are clearly  limits to what could be done to prevent attacks which are  planned and launched from abroad, even when many services work  closely together.    Nevertheless, we have together had many successes, most of  them I'm afraid necessarily unsung. But, as one example, we've  helped to prevent the intelligence services of a number of  Middle Eastern states from carrying out sustained campaigns of  murder against their opponents in this country and elsewhere.  Members of Islamic terrorist groups and terrorists from the  Indian subcontinent have been identified and their plans  disrupted. The service played a major part in the investigation  of the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie in December 1988, to  the point where the atrocity was laid firmly at the door of  Libya. As a result, Libya came under further significant  international pressure to cut its support for  terrorists--including the Provisional IRA--and, of course, to  surrender the accused for trial.    The threat to British interests from terrorism of  international origin is lower than it was in the 1980's. This  is partly because we have in place better means of exchanging  intelligence than before, both nationally and internationally.  But, in the foreseeable future, I expect there to remain a  significant threat to British interests, although the sources of  it will vary from time to time. For example, the determined  efforts to locate and kill the author Salman Rushdie seemed  likely to go on.    Extremists from North Africa and also Kurdish groups pose  an increasing threat of violence, including to British tourists,  and the conflict in former Yugoslavia could well spill over into  acts of terrorism in Europe and elsewhere. But the services  most important task--and one which takes up nearly half our  resources--is mounting intelligence operations to counter Irish  terrorism. The Provisional IRA, in particular, is a  sophisticated and ruthless terrorist organization and poses the  most serious threat to our national security. As they talk of  peace, the IRA continues to carry out terrorist murders in  Northern Ireland. At the same time, they plan and mount attacks  in mainland Britain, as we saw at Heathrow. In parallel, the  so-called Loyalist paramilitary groups have continued with their  own brand of indiscriminate violence.    Intelligence gathering against terrorists is difficult and  dangerous. Some of my staff and many of those who work closely  with us risk their lives to do it. They do it from a sense of  public service and a firm belief in the rule of law and the  democratic system. It's an anxious life for their families, who  support them because they, too, believe in the importance of  their work. When tragedy strikes, as it did on such a scale  with a helicopter crash on 2 June, they suffer their losses  silently and with dignity. We have much cause to be grateful to  them all.    Intelligence work against Irish terrorism is closely  coordinated, but it is complex, and I should make it clear what  the security service does and does not do. In Northern Ireland,  the security service provides extensive support for the Royal  Ulster Constabulary, who take the lead in gathering and  exploiting intelligence relating to terrorism there, in addition  to their police work. Outside Northern Ireland, the security  service has the main responsibility for intelligence  investigations into all aspects of Irish terrorist activity  anywhere in the world. We investigate IRA plans for terrorist  attacks against British military personnel in Europe or  elsewhere, or into their efforts and those of the so-called  Loyalists groups to obtain arms and funds from abroad. Many of  our counterparts in Europe and further afield give us unstinting  support and assistance.    Until the autumn of 1992, our responsibilities for  operations  against the IRA did not cover the British mainland, where the  Metropolitan Police Special Branch coordinated intelligence work  against all republican terrorism. Then, in October 1992, the  security service was also given this responsibility. This made  sense as far as intelligence operations were concerned, but the  service has not assumed any of the executive powers of the  police. And, of course, we continue to work closely both with  the Metropolitan Police and with other police forces. They all  play a central role in countering Irish terrorism. These new  arrangements have achieved a sharper focus, as well as a greater  concentration of resources.    All the agencies involved in countering terrorism in the UK  cooperate closely and effectively, but counterterrorism is not  an exact science. In an open and democratic society, the  initial advantage will always lie with the terrorists. We will  never be able to obtain 100 percent advance information of  terrorists' plans and intentions. There are successes. Many  terrorist operations planned and begun are stopped through  advanced intelligence. Whenever it's possible, the perpetrators  are brought to court. Over the past 18 months or so, more than  20 Irish Republican terrorists have been arrested in Great  Britain and charged. In Northern Ireland, the security forces  prevent four out of five terrorist attacks which are attempted.  All totaled, some 700 terrorists--both Republican and  Loyalist--have been convicted and are currently serving prison  sentences. Many others are awaiting trial.    The Security Service Act makes clear that the work of the  service must be strictly limited to countering only threats to  national security. We are not involved in countering drug  trafficking or organized crime, and we would only become  involved if they came to pose such a threat to this country.    One new task which the service has recently taken on is  helping to counter the spread of weapons of mass  destruction--nuclear, biological, and chemical. This is not a  new threat, of course, but it's been made more immediate by the  collapse of the Soviet Union. General instability there has  resulted in the loosening of controls over both sensitive  materials and related expertise. Some two dozen governments are  currently trying to obtain such technology. A number of these  countries sponsor or even practice terrorism, and we can't rule  out the possibility that these weapons could be used for that  purpose. Some governments try every means--including enrolling  their students at British universities--to bypass international  agreements to obtain what they want. We're now working closely  with others to identify and prevent their efforts.    I've described some of the threats which we currently face,  but what does protecting national security actually mean? How  do we do it? Those people who wish to damage the state will  naturally organize themselves and make plans in secret, so we  have to use secret means to investigate them. With the proper  legal authority, we may need to tap their telephones, open their  letters, or eavesdrop on their conversations to find out their  intentions. We may have to observe their movements secretly or  recruit members of those organizations as agents to tell us from  the inside what's being planned. Then we have to analyze and  assess the information and use our findings to counter the harm  which is intended.    MI5 has no executive powers, so we pass on information to  others and discuss with them what action they can take--to the  police, for example, so that arrests can be made, or to the Home  Office or the Foreign Office so that terrorists or intelligence  officers can be deported or expelled. Of course, it's also  possible to protect whatever is threatened, so we advise on how  to make the target more difficult to attack. We might, for  example, suggest measures to protect a building or the people in  it from terrorist attack or measures to protect data if there's  reason to think that secret information is at risk.    I should also like to clear up a fairly widespread  misunderstanding. I've heard it said that the service is  responsible for monitoring the activities of people with a high  public profile on the off chance--so the argument goes--that  they might either be at or even pose a risk. We do not do it;  such interference would not be justified. I and my staff  believe deeply that, as a matter of principle, the very serious  step of intruding into people's private lives must be strictly  limited to what is unavoidable in the interests of national  security and must, of course, be properly authorized.    The question is also asked, following the ending of the Cold  War: Are we using our peace dividend to turn our attention to  the general public, or for that matter, anyone else about whom  we or perhaps the government feel uncomfortable? The idea is  quite frankly quite ludicrous, just as ludicrous as the  allegation I once heard made that the service carries out  murder. But these ideas, unfounded though they are, bring me to  the key question of accountability for a security service.    Accountability lies at the heart of the tension between  liberty and security, and I'm going to say something about  oversight and controls, without which a security service could  put in jeopardy those very rights and liberties which it has  been set up to protect. A delicate balance must be struck within  the framework of government in determining how far the security  service should be allowed to go in invading the privacy of the  few in the interests of the nation as a whole.    How to insure that a service such as ours does not exceed  its  remit? The need for such a balance is reflected in  international law, and particularly in the European Convention  on Human Rights. The convention recognizes that a state has a  duty and a right to protect itself. In doing so, it may set up  a security service to provide a covert response to covertly  organized threats, but the convention also makes clear that the  state must respect individual rights and liberties. It must put  its secret services on a clear legal basis, and it must  establish independent oversight to ensure that these services  never abuse their powers. There is, of course, much room for  debate about how best to regulate and control the activities of  a security service.    This raises difficult issues. What does control actually  mean when what we're talking about is activity which must  necessarily be carried out in secret. How close should the  relationship be between the government and the security service?  In a totalitarian state, such as the old Soviet bloc, the  security service, in effect, becomes an arm of the ruling party  and the government. Its purpose is to keep them in power by  ensuring virtually complete control over all aspects of life.  They see the people themselves as one of the main threats to  the state, and so the political thought police watch everyone to  ensure that all dissent is stamped out. One only has to think  of the all-pervasive East German secret police, the Stasi, with  its thousands of informants, for a horrific modern example.    In a sophisticated democracy, the relationship between the  government and the security service is completely different.  The security service must operate within a clear framework of  law. Its activities must be limited to countering genuine  threats to national security, and controls are needed to govern  how it may use but not abuse its powers. But, and this is  equally important, there must also be political independence.  The government must not be able to pressure the service to do  anything which is not directly concerned with genuine threats to  national security. Neither must the service do anything which  would favor one political party over another. To carry out its  functions, the security service clearly has to conduct its  operations in secret, so in the future, as in the past, there  will be little opportunity for the public to find out in any  detail what we are doing. Mechanisms for oversight and  accountability are therefore vital in providing reassurance as  well as control.    The legal authority for our service is the Security Service  Act of 1989. The act puts the controls contained in the  directive issued to the service in 1952 and endorsed by the home  secretaries of all subsequent governments on a formal statutory  footing. As director general, Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm fully  conscious of the overriding importance of proper accountability  for our service. Members of the service at all levels regard the  legal framework which the Security Service Act provides as  fundamental to everything we do, and we welcomed it warmly. The  framework of controls provided by the act involves  ministers--principally the home secretary, independent members  of the judiciary, and senior civil servants in Whitehall. The  main plank of the system is the relationship with the secretary  general and the home secretary. I am accountable to him for the  operations of the service and for its efficiency. I'm  personally responsible under the act for ensuring that the  service remains independent of any party political influence and  that it does nothing beyond what is permitted under the act.    One of the most important aspects of my role is to ensure  that the services investigations are always proportionate to the  threat. The most intrusive techniques may only be used to  counter the most serious threats. No officer may carry out any  investigation unless it falls within strict rules and  guidelines. There's a wide range of controls in place within the  service. They cover all levels of activity. Those governing  investigations which may invade the privacy of the individual  are particularly important. Let me give you an example.  Applications to the secretary of state for warrants to  intercept letters or telephone conversations or to interfere  with property are rigorously examined by the service's legal  advisers and by the most senior levels of management and again  within the Home Office. We in the service and the civil  servants and ministers who work with us are fully aware of the  power we wield when we carry out secret investigations. We  recognize that this power must be exercised reasonably and  responsibly, and it's certainly not something which is taken  lightly or for granted by any of us.    There are commissioners who scrutinize the propriety of  warrants signed by the secretary of state, and there are  tribunals to investigate any complaints from the public about  our work. These external oversight bodies, set up under both  the interception and the Security Service Acts, are comprised of  experienced and independent legal figures who can and do read  any papers they wish and interview staff. Their powers  represent a substantial check and also a significant  disincentive for anyone to flout the rules.    The service works totally within statute and within the law,  and we never subcontract operations to get around the rules or  to evade oversight and control. On the contrary, we give  absolute priority to ensuring that everything we do is carried  out with the proper authority.    I've described the existing systems of oversight and  accountability which are provided for the service, and I've  explained that we regard them as vital in providing a vigorous  and independent check on everything we do. In exactly the same  way, I and the service wholeheartedly welcome the new oversight  committee of parliamentarians which is provided under the new  Intelligence Services Act. This committee will play a  significant part in ensuring that the work of the three  intelligence and security agencies have the confidence of both  Parliament and the public. We shall give it our full support  and cooperation.    A cynic may ask: How can I know that what you are saying is  true? Well, it is difficult for an organization which must work  in secret to talk about what it does and to satisfy its critics.  This dilemma is one of the prices of our constant efforts to  maintain the right balance between security and democracy. One  result is the tendency for completely untrue conspiracy theories  to emerge. These may have a certain populist market value, but  they sidetrack and obstruct serious consideration of the issues.  One of the most persistent came from the well-publicized claims  of Peter Wright that MI5 plotted to undermine the then Prime  Minister Harold Wilson. No such plot existed--as ministers  stated and as Peter Wright himself finally admitted. But, this  was a very damaging assertion, particularly so, as it called  into question the services political impartiality which we are  so determined to uphold. Now, in this sort of case the service  finds itself in something of a catch-22 situation. But the  point is this: We are a service of some 2,000 people working  everyday with a wide range of contacts both inside and outside  government. How likely is it that we are all in the grip of  what I can really only call institutional corruption. Part of  the answer--and also to the point I raised just now about our  credibility--lies in effective oversight and control, but it  also touches on integrity and the sort of people we are.    I remember on one occasion, shortly after I became director  general, someone I met for the first time appeared genuinely  surprised that I wasn't more like Rosa Kleb, one of James Bond's  rather less than democratic counterparts. We are, of course, a  service of ordinary people drawn from a variety of backgrounds  and with a wide range of qualities. About half of us are female  and half are under 40, and there is a strong independent input  to the recruitment of our staff. Fortunately, it's no longer  necessary for anyone to pass one of the tests which was imposed  on recruits to the service in 1914. Then staff had to show that  they could make notes on their shirt cuff while cantering on  horseback, but our staff have other skills relevant to our work  today. They are selective because of their judgment,  impartiality, and integrity, all of which contribute to a strong  ethos within the service. As in all organizations, there  may--very occasionally--be the odd rotten apple. And I  certainly wouldn't claim that we are infallible, but I am  certain--not least because of the closely integrated way in  which we all work--that there is no group of mavericks in our  service pursuing some private agenda of their own.    Well, that's who we are and how we are accountable to others  for our secret work. But, inevitably and unavoidably, almost  all oversight is carried out within the so-called ring of  secrecy, but my colleagues and I know very well that we must  also have the confidence of the general public. We know the  importance of explaining, as much as we can, what the service  does, and I'm delighted to have this opportunity to so. It  certainly wasn't open to any of my predecessors, although I'm  sure they would have welcomed it.    We are, of course, obliged to keep information secret in  order to be effective, but this is not to say that we should  necessarily be a wholly secret organization. Secrecy is not  imposed for its own sake; it's not an end in itself. There have  been a number of steps over the past number of years to increase  the level of information available, and not only about the  security service. The fact that I'm talking to you this evening  following the publication last year of a booklet about the  service is evidence of the continuing commitment to this process.    The media, of course, have an important role to play in  shaping public perceptions of what we are and what we do. The  press in this country has, over time, developed a particular  interest in security and intelligence affairs. I hope that, by  means of greater openness and by making more facts available, it  will be possible to portray the work of this service in a rather  more sober light and, above all, much more accurately than is  sometimes the case now. I have no doubt that more information  about what we do will emerge over time, particularly because of  our increasing involvement as witnesses in criminal trials  where, incidentally, we also have to account for what we have  done. I welcome these developments, but we need to make it  quite clear that there must be strict limits.    The service cannot do, or say anything which would endanger  our staff, our sources, or our operations. Many people outside  the service, some of whom will be watching this evening,  regularly provide us with vital assistance and often put  themselves in danger by doing so. I would like to say, here, in  public, how grateful we are. You play a valuable role in  helping to look after the safety and security of the country,  and we thank you very much. Nothing will be said or done to  compromise your safety or the work you are doing on our behalf.    Ladies and Gentlemen, I've set out in this lecture to show  that a security service such as MI5 is compatible with personal  liberty within our democracy. It does not conflict with it but  enhances it. I've explained why the service is still needed in  the post Cold War era, how it is controlled and made accountable  for what it does. We are a modern, efficient, and law-abiding  service to the nation. Our principle task today is to help to  counter the threat from terrorism to this country. We've  changed with the times. We're still changing and will continue  to change. We have a young, enthusiastic, and disciplined  staff. They are positive, forward looking, and flexible and  work hard to defend this country and its citizens against  threats against its security. They need and deserve your  support. I've demonstrated that, in everything we do, we are  acutely aware of the fine balance between national security and  the democratic process. Working in the strict accordance with  the rule of law, we will continue to exercise our powers  reasonably and responsibly and with a strong respect for  individual rights and privacy. After all, Ladies and Gentlemen,  it's the right of the individual to participate freely and  safely in our democracy that we are here to protect. Thank you  very much.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Gutierrez A.] </F>   [Excerpt] With the capture of 19 presumed drug traffickers,  agents from the Attorney General's Office, in counternarcotics  operations conducted in Baja California State, seized five tons  and 639 kg of dried, packed marijuana with a black market value  of $30 million, or 90 million new pesos. The large confiscation  makes this state appear to be a "drug paradise."    During the action taken by members of the Federal Judicial  Police and the National Institute To Combat Drugs, several  collection centers for the grass that arrived from various parts  of the country were dismantled. Included was a shipment brought  in by charter from Mexico City, which those responsible were  preparing to send to the United States. Also seized were seven  vehicles outfitted to transport the marijuana.    Arturo Ochoa Palacios and Commander Rodolfo Garcia Gaxiola,  the institution's representative and the Federal Judicial Police  deputy commissioner in the state, respectively, gave a detailed  account of the operations.    The largest seizure took place in the town of Tijuana, where  federal agents confiscated a shipment of 2,966 kg of the grass,  distributed in 369 rectangular packages concealed among  perishable products. They were found in a warehouse of the  Olivos Industrial Center, situated on Extension Road, lot 100,  which was being guarded by Eleazar Ruiz Diaz and Ruben Alfonso  Chavez Baez.    In another warehouse located at 10 Sancho Panza Street in  the  La Mesa precinct's Los Espanoles subdivision, of the same town,  the public poisoners had hidden 1,401 kg and 900 grams. There,  Noe Covian Sandoval, Alberto Maciel Benitez, and the brothers  Cuauhtemoc and Cipriano Covian Garcia were arrested. They had  unloaded the drugs from a tractor trailer truck of the Kenworth  make, with a tanker, that had arrived from Guadalajara, Jalisco,  driven by Jose Manuel Armendariz Torres.    Captured in the same town were Eusebio Rodriguez Quintero,  Eugenio Hernandez Hernandez, and Luis Garcia Rodriguez, who had  in their possession a marijuana shipment weighing 1,319 kg and  400 grams, distributed in 455 packages.    The drugs were to be marketed at a machine shop located in  the town's central section. Hence, a surveillance operation was  mounted, until the aforementioned individuals were caught while  setting the price. They had extracted a package of the drugs  from a moving van, to show as a sample.    Later, with the information given by those in custody,  another accomplice, Victor Hugo Garcia Elvira, who had been  assigned to carry the drugs to Tijuana, was captured. [passage  omitted]</p>

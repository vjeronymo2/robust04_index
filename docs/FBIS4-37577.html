			<p>BFN     [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat this evening threatened  to put off his visit to Gaza and Jericho due to the announcement  issued by Rabin's bureau whereby the prime minister and the  foreign minister instructed their aides to sever their contacts  with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi. Dr. al-Tibi, an Israeli citizen, played  a prominent role in the contacts between Israel and the PLO as  'Arafat's adviser. According to a legal opinion drafted a few  months ago by Yo'el Singer, the Foreign Ministry's legal  adviser, al-Tibi cannot take part in the negotiations because he  is an Israeli citizen.    Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen has learned that  there have been no official contacts with al-Tibi over the last  few months anyway, and that today's announcement came after it  was learned that al-Tibi and elements in the foreign minister's  bureau continue to be in contact.    Al-Tibi argued this evening that he met a few weeks ago with  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in the latter's home despite  Singer's legal opinion. Officials in the prime minister's  bureau explained that anybody may speak to al-Tibi, but that he  is not an official address for negotiations.</p>

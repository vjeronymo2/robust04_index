			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Observer: Lawrence's stock in trade Perhaps it is just a coincidence, but Michael Lawrence, the new chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, has followed the same sort of career path as his luckless predecessor, Peter Rawlins. Both have spent the bulk of their careers in big accountancy firms and tested their business skills in the insurance industry. Rawlins, ex-Arthur Andersen, came from insurance broking and Lawrence, ex-Price Waterhouse, was hired by the Prudential as its first finance director as recently as 1988. However, there the similarities end. Lawrence is a good deal older, and hopefully wiser, than the abrasive Rawlins and has first-hand knowledge of the problems of the stock exchange's customers. He was an outspoken critic of the stock exchange's Taurus settlement fiasco. His connections as chairman of the 100 group of top finance directors also mean that he will be listened to in boardrooms that matter. That said, it is unusual for an accountant cum insurance man to take such a risk with his career. After all, there could be very little left of the stock exchange in three years, whereas if he stayed at the Pru he might have been in the running to succeed Mick Newmarch as group chief executive. Perhaps he decided that the Pru would never appoint two non-actuaries in a row to the top job there.</p>

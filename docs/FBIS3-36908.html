			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Summary] Omsk RV-49, one of the biggest radio stations  beyond the Urals fell silent for the first time today.    Correspondent Mikhail Shakhnovich reports that the  communication workers have one and the same reason -- acute  financial crisis. The country's television and radio companies  owe Omsk over 600 million rubles and, as a result, there is no  money to pay for electricity, and employees of relaying centers  have not received their wages since November. But the switches  have been turned off not just at RV-49. A VHF station and  television transmitters have stopped working on the oblast's  territory.    Communications workers intend to strike until all their  demands are met. A government telegram that arrived in Omsk  this morning unfortunately does not give answers to any of their  questions, including the main one, namely when the debt will be  settled. To all appearances, the switches on transmitters are  not going to be turned on very soon, although local television  and radio channels are continuing work, because the Omsk  communication workers have no complaints against the Irtysh  television and radio company. They are not taking part in in  the information blockade. Radio relay and cable links are  working. All the oblast's radio transmitters relay the Moscow  channel.</p>

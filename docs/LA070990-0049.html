			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH MUSEUM SAFEGUARDS  </P> <P> Electronics has revolutionized museum security in the last two decades.  According to Warren Danzenbaker, chief of security systems for the Smithsonian  museums, a variety of high-tech detectors are now used to monitor storage areas  and, when the museum is not open to the public, display rooms.  </P> <P> * Passive Infrared Sensors: Known in the industry as PIRs, these small sensors  detect the body heat of humans. If a person walks into a room covered by  activated PIRs, a signal should go out.  </P> <P> * Ultrasonic Sensors: These fill a room with inaudible, ultrasonic frequency  sound patterns. If the patterns are disturbed by movement, an alarm is  triggered.  </P> <P> * Microwave Sensors: Because microwaves travel through walls, these detectors  can be hidden out of sight. They aim a microwave field into a space to detect  movement.  </P> <P> Also in use are vibration, glass break and pressure sensors and magnetic  contact switches that set off an alarm if a door or display case is opened.  </P> <P> Because a tiny wireless transmitter is affixed to every object on display at  the Gene Autry museum, an alarm can be instantly localized, according to the  designer of its security system, Joseph Chapman. If an object is disturbed and  the alarm tripped, a digital read-out in the control room identifies the object  and its location.  </P> <P> Security consultant Steven Keller, who designed the system for the Armand  Hammer Museum now under construction in Westwood, said he is experimenting with  a system that can trace the movement, on a screen, of any object as it is  transported around a museum. He got the idea from an article he read about  electronic chips embeded in the wrist bands of Alzheimer's patients. The  electronics enabled the staff of a residence home to keep track of the  patients.  </P> <P> Another of the newer security tools is video motion detection, which is  especially appropriate to museums such as the Gene Autry where more than 80  cameras are in use. The cameras designated for motion detection are trained on  specific objects, be they paintings, sculptures, or display cases. Back in the  control room, the outlines of these objects are traced with an electronic  pencil on the video screens.  </P> <P> A guard in the control room, which has enough high-tech equipment to resemble a  small NASA outpost, doesn't have to keep constant watch on the screen. If any  of the outlined objects is moved from its electronic boundary, the screen gives  out audible and visible alarms.  </P> <P> Another camera used by both Chapman and Keller comes hidden inside what appears  to be an ordinary fire sprinkler.  </P> <P> Chapman said his company generally charges, as a fee, between 1% and 2% of the  architect's fee. Additionally, he said, equipment costs will be $2-$4 a foot,  depending on the system.  </P> <P> The fees and equipment costs can total between about $300,000 and several  million dollars, Keller said, according to the size of a museum and the  sophistication of its system.

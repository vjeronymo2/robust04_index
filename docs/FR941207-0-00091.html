			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, with respect to the procedures required for closed meetings applying to CARP deliberations, we agree with Copyright Owners that application of those procedures is neither desirable nor appropriate. We are therefore amending &sect;251.14 by adding a new subsection (d) which provides that ``[t]he procedure for closed meetings in this section and &sect;251.15 shall not apply to the internal deliberations of arbitrators carried out in furtherance of their duties and obligations under this chapter.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Subpart C_Public Access to and Inspection of Records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No comments were received regarding subpart C. However, section 251.22(c) has been amended to delete the &sect;.40 per page charge for photocopies of CARP or Copyright Office records. Because such charges change from time to time, the section now reads that photocopies are available at the ``applicable Office charge.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Subpart D_Standards of Conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Financial conflict of interests.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When we originally proposed financial conflict of interest rules, our main concern was with their proper scope. Did we propose rules that did not cover enough situations, and therefore miss some very real conflicts of interest, or, on the other hand, did our proposed rules go too far, and eliminate qualified persons for inconsequential reasons? In an effort to reach the proper scope, we not only proposed rules, but we also asked for comments on certain hypothetical situations that went beyond the scope of our proposed rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Copyright Owners' response reflects the difficulty of drawing the proper line. While they offered opinions about the hypothetical situations that indicated a belief that our proposed rules did not go far enough, ultimately they did not ask to expand the rules, but proposed handling the gray area questions on a case-by-case basis, using the disclosure procedure to the parties described in section 251.32(b)(2) as a method to decide whether the conflict is disqualifying. The Copyright Owners stated:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Copyright Owners believe that decisions about the financial conflicts of potential arbitrators must be made on a case-by-case basis, with no single application of the rules being dispositive on a specific case.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. The screening of arbitrators for any panel ought not to occur through rote application of the rules *&blank;*&blank;* If the Librarian finds a question arising as to whether a conflict exists as to a particular arbitrator, further information should be made available to the parties so that they may determine whether the person should be disqualified or whether the potential conflict might be waived.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Copyright Owners, comments at 21.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with the Copyright Owners that this is the proper approach. Therefore, we have not modified the scope of the financial conflict of interest rules, but we have made a change in the disclosure rule, section 251.32(b)(2). Whenever a potential arbitrator has a conflict of interest as defined by our rules and has indicated that he or she wants this conflict to be disclosed to the parties, or whenever a potential arbitrator has an interest beyond the specified scope of the rules which raises our concern, section 251.32(b)(2) provides we will list these interests anonymously in an order issued to the parties to each upcoming proceeding at the time the Librarian establishes for precontroversy motions, and we will request that the parties indicate within 30 days which conflicts or potential conflicts they believe are disqualifying. For those interests within the scope of our conflict of interest rules, the indications of the parties will be dispositive. For those potential conflicts outside of the scope of our conflict of interest rules, the indications of the parties will aid the Librarian in his decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, arbitrator X has a spouse who is employed by one of the parties to the proceeding. Because that is a interest within the scope of our rules, the response of the parties will be dispositive. That is, if any one of the parties objects, arbitrator X may not serve. On the other hand, if arbitrator X has a parent who is employed by one of the parties, that would be an interest outside of the scope of our rules. In that case, if one or more of the parties objects, that objection will be taken into account when the Librarian makes his decision, but the objection will not automatically disqualify arbitrator X.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There was, however, one area in which the Copyright Owners commented that the scope of the conflict of interest rules was too broad. Section 251.31(d)(3) imputes the financial interest of the arbitrator's general partner to the arbitrator. The Copyright Owners believe that section 251.31(d)(3) means that each potential arbitrator would have to inquire of each of his/her general partners about their personal investments. The Copyright Owners consider this an unworkable burden and doubt that any potential arbitrator would be influenced by the personal holdings of a general partner, especially if that general partner's financial interest is unknown to the arbitrator. The Copyright Owners ask that an exception to the rule on imputation of interests be made in the case of a general partner's personal financial holdings. Copyright Owners, comments at 24&hyph;25. We agree, and section 251.31(d)(3) has been modified to reflect this exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ex parte communications.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In our proposed interim rules, distinctions were made among four classes of persons concerning ex parte communications: (1) the Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights, (2) the selected arbitrators, (3) the listed arbitrators, and (4) the Library and Copyright Office personnel. In particular, we drew a distinction between selected arbitrators who are subject to a total ban on contact between them and interested parties in their controversy, and listed arbitrators who are not subject to a total ban on contact, but who may not communicate with any interested party about the merits of any past, pending, or future proceeding relating to CARP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the Copyright Owners and James Cannings state that they believe no distinction should be made between selected and listed arbitrators, and that there should be a total ban on contact with all arbitrators. The Copyright Owners argue for the highest standard concerning selected and listed arbitrators because of ``the substantial financial interests at stake.'' The Copyright Owners, however, would mitigate the severity of a total ban to permit nonsubstantive pleasantries between arbitrators and parties. Finally, the Copyright Owners note that the restrictions concerning arbitrators are against contact with any interested ``party'' and would prefer that it be changed to ``person'' because of what they believe to be the ambiguous meaning of the word ``party.'' Copyright Owners, comments at 15&hyph;18.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Having reviewed the comments of the Copyright Owners and James Cannings, we continue to believe that the distinction between selected and listed arbitrators is valid. In any given year, 75 persons will be listed to be available to serve as arbitrators. A total ban on contact with all 75 persons would be unworkable, and unfair to the persons offering their services. For the remote chance of being selected, they would be giving up a degree of personal freedom, not for any actual impropriety but for the avoidance of the appearance of impropriety. However, we believe it is fair and highly necessary that listed arbitrators understand that they may not engage in any actual impropriety, that is, discuss the merits of any royalty proceeding, past, present or future. This is a much narrower and more appropriately tailored limitation on their activities. Once selected, the total ban on contact with the three selected arbitrators is essential. It assures fairness to all parties by guaranteeing that no opportunity for influence can possibly occur. Procedural requests of the selected arbitrators should be routed through Library or Copyright Office personnel who are assigned to support the arbitrators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

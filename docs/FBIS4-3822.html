			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The early release from prison of democracy advocate  Wang Juntao calls into question the continued detention of other  1989 activists and is raising the level of both hope and  indignation from the families of jailed dissidents.    "Theirs was the same case. Why not let Chen Ziming free?"  said Wu Yongfen, the mother of Chen, who like Mr Wang was  sentenced to 13 years in jail for allegedly being one of the  "black hands" behind what the Chinese Government calls an  attempt to topple the Communist Party five years ago.    On Saturday, China announced the release of Mr Wang,  allowing  him to travel to the United States for medical treatment.    "It was a deal for MFN [Most Favoured Nation trade status],"  Ms Wu said of Mr Wang's release. She said her family would  press for the release of Chen. "We want more foreign pressure,"  she said.    The Chinese Government says the nation's laws make provision  for the release of prisoners on humanitarian grounds but, in  fact, China has used these legal provisions primarily as an  excuse to make human rights concessions when it sees a political  advantage from doing so.    While Mr Wang's wife Hou Xiaotian, had single-handedly  launched a tireless campaign for the release of her husband,  frequently meeting with the foreign press in on-the-record  interviews, the families of Chen and other dissidents have kept  a far lower profile.    Since the beginning of Chen's imprisonment almost five years  ago, he has contracted a series of ailments, including a skin  disease, high blood pressure, and heart trouble. His hair is  falling out and his teeth are coming loose. Chen, ex-head of  the Beijing Social and Economic Sciences Research Institute is  being held in the Beijing No. 2 Prison.    "We want him to get the same as Wang Juntao. The case was  the same. Wang Juntao was ill, so is Chen Ziming. Why let one  go abroad and not let the other out on parole for medical  treatment in China?" said Ms Wu.    "My concern is, who is the next?" said Bao Pu, the son of  Bao  Tong, the principal secretary of ousted Communist Party leader  Zhao Ziyang. The elder Mr Bao is serving a seven-year sentence  for allegedly "leaking state secrets." Mr Bao has had 17 polyps  removed since being imprisoned in Qincheng Prison in 1989. The  authorities say the polyps have so far been benign. His white  blood cell count is well below normal and his carcinoembryonic  antigen level has been increasing to well above normal,  suggesting cancer. Doctors say Bao has thyroid tumours and  suffers from salivary gland atrophy.    Recently Bao has been transferred to a hospital for  treatment. While on the face of it, the principle of fair  treatment would suggest that Chen, Bao, and other political  prisoners should be released, analysts said the Chinese  authorities might well decide to keep them in jail if they saw  the release of Mr Wang as being enough to sway U.S. opinion  towards renewing MFN.</p>

Those accusations are  groundless, Front leaders told Interfax in Baku on Thursday. The  National Security Ministry has declined to comment on the  statement made by the two government officials.    In the meantime, police searches are under way of the  Front's  headquarters in Baku, now into their fourth day. The measure  comes after the police found military uniforms, ammunition and  petrol bombs in the basement of the building.    But deputy Front leader Arif Aliyev said all of this had  been  deliberately put there to discredit his organization.</p>

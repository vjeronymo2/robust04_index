			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] The press center of the Latvian government reported  to Interfax that the Cabinet of Ministers had prepared an  official answer regarding Russia's proposals on the conditions  of troop withdrawal set forth at the interstate negotiations in  November 1993.    IF Note: The Russian party expressed its readiness to  withdraw Russian troops from Latvia by August 31, 1994, under  the provision that the radar station in the village of Skrunda  would be preserved for 6 more years until a comparable facility  was built in Russia. The radar station in Skrunda was built in  1967. It consists of four space tracking antennas, each 250  meters long, which allows monitoring of practically all of  Europe and the North Atlantic.    The Latvian government has commissioned the state delegation  at the negotiations with Russia to agree to the time of the  troops' final withdrawal, namely August 31, 1994. However, it  believes that the treaty on the status of the radar station must  provide for conditions of its exploitation only during its  dismantling, but this is not reflected in the draft document  prepared by the Russian party.    The governmental press center reported that the Latvian  party  insists that dismantling of the reinforced concrete building of  the station start immediately after the agreement is set into  force, at the same time the station's major functional element,  the detector, would continue its work.    The government has also decided to propose an alternative  time to use this site, however it will officially announce its  proposal only by the beginning of the next round of  Latvian-Russian talks. In addition, Latvia will propose its  rent payment for the exploitation of the station.    The government's press secretary, Sergey Antsupov, declared  to Interfax that "the presence of alternative proposals and  additional issues should not be viewed as Latvia's intention to  torpedo Russia's initiatives."    Meanwhile, Latvian scientists and biologists believe that  the  republic must present a report to Russia due to the harmful  influence on people and the environment exerted by this  strategic radar station in Skrunda.    A report of the scientific council of Latvian Academy of  Sciences' Biology Institute points out that "the detector's  electromagnetic radiation adversely affects people's nervous  system, disturbs their sleep, and results in a state of  depression and lowering of people's working abilities." The  report also enumerates data testifying to the detector's  negative influence on flora and fauna. The scientists believe  that further existence of the radar station on Latvian territory  is inadmissible.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Arts: London Philharmonic - Royal Festival Hall For Tuesday's LPO concert Christoph von Dohnanyi chose a piquant programme: Webern's temperate little Symphony op. 21 before Beethoven's first and least-favoured piano concerto, the so-called 'Second', and then Schoenberg's Five Orchestral Pieces, op. 16, as prelude to the Fourth Symphony of Schumann. But for the Webern, it worked surprisingly well. In Beethoven's B-flat Concerto, Emanuel Ax outdid himself. Operating in something like the Schiff/Uchida mode - pearly and unforced, but digitally super-articulate - he found chiaroscuro delights in even the most surface-routine passages. None of that sounded imposed on the music; as interpretation it was knowingly pawky but never arch, and always elegant. I do not remember hearing the delicate humours of the piece so wittily spelt out. Ax maintained the illusion of keeping the pianistic scale within period limits, but after a notably subtle, tender Adagio he attacked the Rondo with tingling brio. Dohnanyi's orchestral accompaniment - for with such an engaging soloist, that was what it became - was a model of alert tact and sweet reason. In the Schoenberg pieces after the interval he gave full value to their far more lurid palette, but also the most judicious attention to their harmonic sense: strong confirmation of Schoenberg's claim, cited by Eric Mason in his programme-notes, that there was 'a remorseless, if unconscious, logic in the harmonic construction'. Among the Five Pieces Dohnanyi realised 'Vergangenes', the second, with lovely cogency, dovetailing its soft overlap of voices with a sure hand. He did as much for the final 'Obbligato Recitative' too, revealing much more intricate musical argument than we usually hear. The orchestral balance was scrupulously gauged. The Schoenberg tuned our ears very well for Dohnanyi's close-focus examination of Schumann's 'Fourth'. Though it wasn't a particularly tender reading - some other conductors make it sing more affectingly - it had sterling dramatic proportions, and sovereign clarity. His main executive feat was to render the freehand 'development' of the first movement entirely compelling, not just a profusion of amiable ideas; but the darkling hues of the Romanze were remarkable too, and the brusque cut-and-thrust of the Scherzo, much steelier than mere bucolic fun. For such a sharp-eared reading Schumann's leaner original orchestration, without his second-guess doublings, would have been a further asset. It pre-dated his 'Second' and 'Third' symphonies; this one counts as his 'Fourth' only because the revised version was made after them. There is surely a musical case - as against musicological fussing about 'authenticity' - for retaining the tauter structure of the later version, but trimming its adipose instrumental tissue back to the clean lines Schumann first imagined.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium leads further rise in metal markets London Metal Exchange base metals prices yesterday built on their recent rally, with aluminium, which had been lagging the field somewhat, taking its turn in the lead. Having shrugged off news of a further 3,900-tonne rise in LME warehouse stocks to a fresh record of 2,395,450 tonnes, the three months delivery aluminium price managed to break down the technical resistance around Dollars 1,090 a tonne at which its rise had stalled on Tuesday before moving on to a peak of Dollars 1,116 a tonne. The advance was trimmed in late trading, however. The price closed at Dollars 1,108.75 a tonne, still Dollars 20.50 upon the day, and a further Dollars 2.25 was surrendered in after hours dealings. Dealers said the performance was particularly encouraging to the bulls as by holding above Dollars 1,090 the market had indicated that further gains were possible, while removing the immediate threat of a significant downward reaction. The three months aluminium price has now recovered by Dollars 70 from the eight-year low reached at the beginning of November. Other notable performances yesterday included three months nickel's Dollars 90 net rise to Dollars 5,037.50 a tonne - though that was Dollars 82.50 below the 4 3/4 -month high reached early in the day. Lead's recent surge also continued in the morning, with the three months delivery price touching a 1993 high of Dollars 475 a tonne at one point. The price was trimmed back by the close to Dollars 461.50 a tonne, up Dollars 4.25 on the day, but that still extended its upward run over the past eight trading days to an impressive 10.7 per cent. The zinc market was in an equally buoyant mood as traders looked forward to Friday's meeting of European producers to discuss proposals for co-ordinated output cuts. An early breach of chart-based resistance around Dollars 976 a tonne for three months metal primed the market for an assault on the psychological Dollars 1,000-a-tonne barrier. That hurdle was cleared with some ease and the price sped on to Dollars 1,010 a tonne. But the advance quickly ran out of steam in that rarefied atmosphere and by the close the three months position was back to Dollars 998.25 a tonne, up Dollars 24.75 on the day. Three months copper extended its five-day, Dollars 44 upward run with an early jump to Dollars 1,714 a tonne before running into expected stiff resistance. It recoiled to Dollars 1,700.75 a tonne at the close and at the end of after hours trading was back to Dollars 1,699.50 a tonne, up Dollars 5.75 on the day. 'There is a general round of euphoria in the (base metals) market,' commented GNI, the London trade house, in its daily commodity report, 'and a degree of 'call option' mentality.' It explained that a speculator believing that prices had already seen the bottom could buy a metal and place a stop-loss selling order below its recent low, creating what it described as 'a synthetic call option - ie the risk is limited and the potential upwards huge'. 'This mentality has been cultivated by the low 3.5 per cent US dollar based interest rates available at the moment,' GNI said. 'For example, to fund a nickel position with a stop below Dollars 4,000 (a tonne) will accrue just Dollars 35 a tonne in funding costs for a year, low for a market where historically prices have shot up to Dollars 20,000 in the not so distant past.' Russia, blamed by western producing nations for the glut of aluminium on the world market, does not plan to cut its production if other producers do not lower their own output, deputy prime minister Alexander Shokhin declared yesterday, reports Reuter from Moscow. He also told a news conference that recent quotas imposed by the European Union on Russian aluminium exports had had no effect because producers were finding ways to avoid them. 'Russian exporters find other ways to go round these quotas,' he said. 'So far, our aluminium industry has not felt any negative consequences of the EC (EU) quotas.' A flood of Russian aluminium has undermined Western markets since the Soviet Union's collapse. Russia's non-CIS primary aluminium exports rose to 1.11m tonnes in the January-October period from 735,000 in the corresponding period of 1992, official statistics show. Mr Shokhin said there was no agreement at last week's talks in Washington, where industry officials from Russia, the US, Canada, Australia, Norway and the EU discussed the worldwide oversupply of aluminium. The next round of multilateral talks is scheduled for January 18-19 in Brussels. Mr Shokhin said Russia was against any sharp production cuts that would hurt its producers. 'There are limits to a compromise,' he said. 'We are not going to restrict output to the extent that our enterprises have to close down. We're ready to cut production, but we have our own criteria for such cuts. Russia is not going to cut output on its own.' He said further talks were needed with the EU and the US to find a solution to the problem. 'A lot will depend on whether the EC and the United States manage to agree between themselves first,' he said. Washington trade officials fear that increasing flows of Russian aluminium will flood the US market after the introduction of EU restrictions. The EU curbs, announced early last week, extend for another three months quotas initiated in August on imports of unwrought aluminium from the former Soviet Union.  -------------------------------------------              LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS             (As at Monday's close)  ------------------------------------------- tonnes  ------------------------------------------- Aluminium        +3,900 to 2,395,450 Aluminium alloy    -140 to    49,060 Copper           +1,925 to   592,425 Lead               -675 to   298,075 Nickel             +960 to   119,904 Zinc             +6,050 to   870,575 Tin                +130 to    19,125  -------------------------------------------</p>

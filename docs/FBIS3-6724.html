			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] held  a special meeting of its Board of Governors at 1900 Korean time  [1000 GMT 21 March] this evening, and concluded that North  Korea's noncompliance with the nuclear accord is very serious  [maeu simgakhada]. The IAEA adopted a resolution calling on the  UN Security Council to work out means for applying sanctions  against North Korea.    Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna:    [Begin Cha recording] This is the second resolution  referring  the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council,  following one in April last year. The resolution calls for  working out measures for applying sanctions regarding the North  Korean nuclear issue, which is still pending in the UN Security  Council.    The key point in the resolution adopted at today's special  meeting of the Board of Governors on North Korea clearly  expressed the restricted position [hangyejogin ipchang] of the  IAEA that it cannot verify North Korea's diversion of nuclear  materials and stressed it is urgent that the Security Council  work out countermeasures. This resolution, however, keeps the  door open for dialogue by urging North Korea to allow additional  full-scale inspections.    The report on the results of the inspection submitted to the  Board of Governors special meeting before the resolution was  adopted revealed that the inspection team inspected nuclear fuel  rods which were (?used) in the five-megawatt nuclear reactor.  Thus, experts observed that North Korea might have replaced some  nuclear fuel rods in the nuclear reactor during the past one  year.    In addition, the report listed in detail the six  radiochemical laboratory facilities that North Korea refused to  allow inspections, thus leading to the conclusion that internal  construction work in the reprocessing facility had advanced more  than the already-known 40 percent.    The report also pointed out that the continuity of the  recent  inspection can be maintained only if another inspection of the  nuclear reactor is conducted within one month and 15 days. Thus,  the period of one month and 15 days will be the time limit for  the Security Council to discuss practical sanctions against  North Korea. [end recording]</p>

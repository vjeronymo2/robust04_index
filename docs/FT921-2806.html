			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Gatt disquiet at slower world trade growth  -Frances Williams on a report showing the smallest volume increase for nearly a decade THE GROWTH of world trade in goods slowed to 3 per cent last year from 5 per cent in 1990, the smallest volume increase for nearly a decade, according to estimates published today by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Though there are signs a modest recovery may be under way, the world trade body expects growth to remain depressed in 1992, with volume rising by perhaps 4 per cent. The meagre 1.5 per cent rise in the value of world merchandise exports to a new peak of Dollars 3,530bn in 1991, after a 13.5 per cent jump in 1990, was because of weaker volume growth, the dollar's rise against European currencies and lower commodity prices, Gatt says. But trade in commercial services - transport, telecommunications, tourism, financial and professional services - has proved more resilient. 'Very preliminary estimates' for 1991 suggest growth by value of 5 per cent, compared with 17 per cent in 1990, to a record Dollars 850bn. This, Gatt cautions, is likely to be an underestimate. Surging merchandise exports, against the general trend, enabled the US to regain from Germany the top slot in the world export rankings last year. The value of US exports rose by 7.5 per cent, while German exports slipped by 4.5 per cent in dollar terms. The US and Germany have alternated in first place since 1986, followed last year by Japan in third place, France and Britain. Even more impressive was the trade performance of the six leading Asian developing country exporters (Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand) which in 1991 increased the value of their exports by between 10 and 20 per cent and imports by between 8 and 30 per cent. This 'was by far the most dynamic element in world trade last year', Gatt says, more than offsetting a slowdown in exports from Japan. Asia, already North America's main trading partner, became western Europe's principal export market last year, as well as its biggest supplier. By contrast, Gatt's economists estimate that the former eastern-bloc countries may have suffered a 20 per cent fall in the value of exports and a 25 per cent drop in imports, with imports into the former Soviet Union slumping by 42 per cent. Last year marked the third consecutive year of declining growth in the volume of world output and trade, Gatt notes, as recession gripped North America and much of Europe. Trade growth of 3 per cent, down from 8.5 per cent in 1988, was the lowest since 1983, though it continued to outstrip world production. Commenting on these developments, Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, said a successful conclusion to the stalled Uruguay Round of trade talks would 'make a tangible contribution to an improved economic outlook for the world economy' by providing predictable and stable trading rules for investment decisions. In his accompanying review of developments in the international trading system last year, Mr Dunkel notes several disquieting trends. They include: a near-doubling of notified anti-dumping actions to 175 from 96 the year before, led by the US and Australia; a proliferation of 'grey area' measures such as 'voluntary' export restraints and other discriminatory trade barriers that bypass Gatt rules; and a growing reluctance of countries, notably the major traders, to abide by Gatt dispute panel decisions. Mr Dunkel's report also highlights Gatt anxieties over a growing interest in regional trading arrangements. These are permitted by Gatt as long as they do not raise trade barriers to outsiders. Yet the working party on the US/Canada free trade agreement that reported last year was just the latest in a series of more than 50 working parties which have been unable to decide whether such arrangements are Gatt-compatible. While the increased involvement of countries in various types of regional initiatives 'is to be welcomed', regional agreements need to be firmly anchored in Gatt, Mr Dunkel says. On the plus side, 11 countries have joined Gatt since the launch of the Uruguay Round in 1986, bringing the total to 103, and another eight are in various stages of joining. The three Baltic states, Ecuador, Syria, Taiwan, Vietnam and some members of the Commonwealth of Independent States have expressed interest in eventual membership. In addition, 16 more countries announced unilateral trade liberalisation measures last year, bringing the total since 1986 to 63 of which 51 are developing and transition economies. At the same time, the increased competition and structural change resulting from market opening and greater economic interdependence 'make it urgent to conclude the Uruguay Round,' Mr Dunkel concludes.</p>

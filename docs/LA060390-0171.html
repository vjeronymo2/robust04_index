			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MARINERS DISCOVER KNACK FOR FINDING YOUNG TALENT  </P> <P> The Seattle Mariners have the two youngest players in the major leagues, and  they're not both named Ken Griffey Jr. -- although it sometimes seems like it.  </P> <P> The other 20-year-old Mariner is pitcher Brent Knackert, more or less stolen  from the Chicago White Sox via the New York Mets.  </P> <P> Griffey, American League Player of the Month for April, is slightly younger.  He'll be 21 on Nov. 21, Knackert on Aug. 1.  </P> <P> "It's still sinking in," Knackert said. "I've pitched to great players like  Dave Winfield and Don Mattingly."  </P> <P> The Mariners claimed Knackert on waivers April 5 from the Mets, who selected  him off the White Sox roster in the Major League Rule V draft on Dec. 4.  </P> <P> Since Knackert was on the White Sox Triple A roster when the Mets drafted him,  major league rules say he must spend the season with the big-league Mariners or  be offered back to the White Sox.  </P> <P> "The White Sox didn't think anybody would take a 20-year-old kid because they  would have to keep him in the major leagues," he said. "They wanted to teach me  a lesson. They were shocked when they lost me. They admitted it was a stupid  thing not to protect me after my third year."  </P> <P> Especially with the kid-happy Mariners out there. The White Sox played right  into the Mariners' hands.  </P> <P> "We think Brent has a great future," Mariner General Manager Woody Woodward  said. "It was our decision to stick with the youngster.  </P> <P> "We feel certain if we offer Brent back to the White Sox, they will take him."  </P> <P> Knackert was a second-round pick of the White Sox in 1987. He spent his third  pro season with Class A Sarasota last season.  </P> <P> This season, Knackert (1-0) has pitched 18 innings over 12 games and has a 3.50  earned-run average.  </P> <P> "If I only pitch 20 innings this year, it's a great experience," Knackert said.  "I'll take this any day. I'll stay here. It's very exciting."  </P> <P> Knackert's victory came in relief against California on May 3 in the Kingdome.  That was special for him because he was born in Los Angeles and still lives in  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> He's watching and learning while Griffey dazzles fans, opponents and teammates  with his spectacular offense and defense.  </P> <P> "He's just amazing," Knackert said. "He's a natural. It's unbelievable the  pitches he hits. It's incredible the plays he makes. I've never seen anything  like it."  </P></p>

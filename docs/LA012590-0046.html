			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S GAMES  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE  </P> <P> OREGON (9-7, 4-3) at No. 23 UCLA (12-3, 6-1), 7:30.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KMPC (710).  </P> <P> Freshman Tracy Murray will make his first start at Pauley Pavilion after making  nine of 10 shots and scoring 25 points Sunday against California at Berkeley in  his debut as UCLA's No. 1 center. Murray is only the third Bruin freshman to  score as many as 25 points in a game, joining teammate Don MacLean and former  Bruin Rod Foster. "It gives opposing teams less of an opportunity to  double-(team) down on MacLean and (Trevor) Wilson," Coach Jim Harrick said of  his decision to move Murray into the starting lineup. "It opens some outside  shots for (Gerald) Madkins and it opens the lane for penetration by (Darrick)  Martin. So, it gives us a completely different look." Also sporting a new look  is Oregon, which uses three starters who weren't even on the team last season.  Guard Terrell Brandon, who sat out last season after failing to meet the  academic guidelines established by Proposition 48, is averaging 17.3 points a  game to lead the Ducks. The other newcomers in the starting lineup are  6-foot-11 freshman Bob Fife and junior guard Kevin Mixon, a transfer from El  Camino College. Oregon has already surpassed its victory total from last  season, including a 68-63 win over Arizona, but the Ducks are 0-5 on the road.  </P> <P> No. 17 OREGON STATE (14-2, 7-0) at USC (6-8, 1-6), 7:30.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KNX (1070).  </P> <P> The Trojans will try to find a way to stop Gary Payton, the Beavers'  All-American point guard, who is averaging 26.3 points, 8.9 assists and 4.8  rebounds a game. "In the 15 years I've been in this conference, I don't know of  any guard who's been able to do what Payton has done," USC Coach George  Raveling said. "He's a winner and he makes those around him a winner. And he  does so many things well. You may hold him to 10 points, but then he grabs 10  rebounds, has 10 assists and gets 10 steals. He's the type of guy if you're  playing on the playground, whoever picks him is going to win." Oregon State is  off to its best start since 1984-85, when the Beavers won 15 of their first 16  games. They have won nine consecutive games, their longest streak since they  won 10 in a row in 1984-85. Raveling hasn't decided whether to start Robert  Pack or Rodney Chatman at point guard. Pack started the Trojans' first 13 games  before he was replaced by Chatman for Saturday's game at Stanford. Chatman had  eight points, six assists and a rebound in a 74-61 loss to the Cardinal. USC  center Chris Munk has made 27 consecutive free throws.  </P> <P> WEST COAST CONFERENCE  </P> <P> No. 22 LOYOLA MARYMOUNT (13-3, 4-0) at PORTLAND (5-12, 2-2),  </P> <P> 7:30.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KXLU-FM (88.9).  </P> <P> After beating Portland and Gonzaga last weekend by an average of 34.5 points,  the Lions take a six-game win streak into the Northwest to play those teams on  their courts. Loyola has passed Oklahoma in the national scoring race and has  raised its average to 120.2 points. Bo Kimble continues to lead the nation in  scoring, averaging 35.5. Loyola beat Portland, 131-106, last Saturday, moving  Coach Paul Westhead into second place in victories by a Loyola coach with a  92-45 record in four-plus seasons. Bill Donovan won 107 games in 1953-1961.  Portland forward William McDowell scored 30 points against Pepperdine and 29  against Loyola last week to raise his average to 13.3. Guard Josh Lowery leads  the Pilots in scoring, averaging 14.6. His brother, Terrell, is averaging 14.5  for Loyola. Portland last beat Loyola in February 1987.  </P> <P> PEPPERDINE (8-9, 2-2) at GONZAGA (5-11, 1-3), 7:30.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KWNK (670).  </P> <P> Pepperdine trailed Gonzaga, 56-41, with 8:34 remaining last Saturday in Malibu,  but came back to beat the Bulldogs, 68-67. Doug Christie scored a team-high 19  points for Pepperdine, 13 in the second half. Tom Lewis returns to the Waves  after a three-game suspension for missing curfew after a road game. Lewis  apparently will come in off the bench, but Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said he  plans to give the senior forward "a fair chance to earn his starting job back.  Tom can really give this team a lift if he is playing up to his abilities at  both ends of the floor." Gonzaga's Jim McPhee, who scored a career-high 42  points in last week's 144-100 loss at Loyola Marymount, is averaging 22.8  points a game.  </P> <P> BIG WEST CONFERENCE  </P> <P> CS LONG BEACH (11-5, 4-4) at UTAH ST. (11-7, 5-2), 6:30 PST.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KORG (1190).  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach has lost three of its last four games, mainly because of  erratic shooting. The 49ers shot only 37% Monday night in losing to Nevada Las  Vegas, 86-77, and have been below 40% in three of their last five games.  Forward Kenny Jarvis, who broke into the starting lineup five games ago, led  the 49ers with 18 points against the Rebels. Freshman guard Lucious Harris  continues to lead the team in scoring, averaging 12.6. Utah State has won eight  of its last 10 games and has defeated the 49ers two years in a row at Logan.  The Aggies have four players with double-figure scoring averages -- Kendall  Youngblood (14.3), Randy Funk (12.7), Rich Jardine (12.3) and Darrel White  (10.2).  </P> <P> UC IRVINE (2-15, 0-8) at CS FULLERTON (9-7, 3-4), 7:30.  </P> <P> TV -- SportsChannel. Radio -- KMNY (1600), KORG (1190).  </P> <P> With another loss, Irvine will tie the longest losing streak in school history  -- 11 games. That streak was set under Tim Tift in January and February of  1980, the season before Bill Mulligan became coach. The closest the Anteaters  have come to victory since Dec. 16 is a one-point loss to Cal State Long Beach  on Jan. 11. Mulligan has had only one losing season at the school, last year's  12-17 mark. But a losing record is already assured this season with 11 games  remaining. Center Ricky Butler, who scored in double figures in 11 consecutive  games, scored only two in a loss to UC Santa Barbara last Saturday. Butler did  not start because he was late for a team meeting. Reserve Elgin Rogers, who  scored 24 points in the last two games, is doubtful with a sprained ankle  suffered in practice on Monday. Fullerton, undefeated in six home games but  only 3-7 on the road, plays seven of its final 11 games in Titan Gym. Leading  scorer Cedric Ceballos has made 40 of 69 shots (58%) in his last four games,  and is averaging 22.1 points and 11.8 rebounds. Mark Hill is averaging 20.8.  </P></p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Ukraine goes to GPA for jets GPA, the Irish-based aircraft leasing company, is negotiating a Dollars 400m deal with the new Ukrainian government to re-equip its national airline with between five and seven modern narrow and wide-bodied jets, reports Tim Coone from Dublin. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, met senior GPA executives at the company's Shannon headquarters yesterday during a stopover en route to the US. Negotiations are apparently at an advanced stage with two other republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States to supply one Boeing 757 and one 737 on leasing contracts. Lithuania and Hungary have already received nine jet aircraft from GPA.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> World map -- In a map in Monday's editions, accompanying text boxes, listing  countries under various regions, located a number of places in the wrong  geographical areas. Colombia should have been listed as being in South America,  Oman in the Middle East, Belize in Central America, Mexico in North America and  Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean. Turkey, most of which is considered part of  Asia, was included under Western Europe because it is listed there in the  Pentagon's figures on worldwide personnel strength.  </P></p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Manufacturing probe urged COMPANIES SUCH as Swan Hunter and Leyland Daf are being allowed to collapse while the government does nothing, Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the MSF technical union, said yesterday. Opening a debate on manufacturing at the union's annual conference in Blackpool, Mr Lyons called for a royal commission to do the work that the government had failed to do. He said: 'We are dealing with a long-term problem that requires long-term solutions and a change in attitudes. We need a new consensus in support of manufacturing industry. 'In addition to the campaigns we are waging now on behalf of our members, I am writing to the prime minister and the leader of the opposition, Mr John Smith, to propose the establishment of a royal commission on manufacturing. 'I know that royal commissions have their critics. I am therefore proposing that this one operate in a radically different way. It would meet in public. 'It would take evidence in public. Its membership would be drawn from across the political and industrial spectrum, including the trade union movement, and it would be asked to report by the end of 1995 - just in time for a new Labour government to consider its recommendations.'</p>

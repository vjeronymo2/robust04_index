			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / National Savings brings in Pounds 249m NATIONAL Savings contributed Pounds 249m to government funding in April, although most of this - Pounds 162m - came from accrued interest. Net sales were just Pounds 87m, with gross sales of Pounds 660m being offset by repayments of Pounds 573m, Philip Coggan writes. In the 1992-93 financial year, National Savings contributed Pounds 4.36bn and provoked complaints from some building societies about unfair competition. The First Option Bond, which was particularly singled out, was relaunched at a lower rate and raised just Pounds 48m in April. Last year it raised Pounds 880m in four months.</p>

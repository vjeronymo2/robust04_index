The meeting, unlike past  ones, will place a greater emphasis on political themes. The  news was revealed by Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi who  unveiled the G-7 logo in Naples today.    Ciampi stressed that there is no reason to believe that  there  will be Russian participation at the heart of G-7. He also made  it clear that there has been no UN request for Italy to take  part in operations in Bosnia.</p>

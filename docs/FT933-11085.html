			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: Jobless total sees further rise FRENCH unemployment rose by 44,600 in June to a record 3,185,000, the labour ministry announced yesterday. The increase takes the unemployment rate to 11.6 per cent, compared with 11.5 per cent in May. The figures were largely in line with expectations. The gloom over rising joblessness and the currency crisis was partly tempered by news of a slight improvement in business confidence in the latest monthly study from INSEE, the state statistics institute. Although sentiment remains weak, according to INSEE, there are signs that confidence has reached its nadir. Industrial output has continued to fall, apart from in consumer goods. The only other positive sign was the publication of provisional figures by the Customs Office showing that France's external trade surplus rose to a record FFr7.65bn in April, from the previous record of FFr7.44bn in March. However, the chief cause of this healthy surplus was the continuing fall in imports, reflecting weak domestic demand. The value of imports fell to FFr83bn in April, a reduction of 3.2 per cent on March and of 19 per cent on April 1992. Exports also continued to fall, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.</p>

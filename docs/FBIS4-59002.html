			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime </F> minister and minister of higher education, in Amman, by Shihatah  Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo, from the "Dialogue From Afar" program;  date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] How can the Yemeni crisis be contained?    [Al-Tall] It is truly regrettable to see the sons of the one  homeland fighting one another. This must be solved by dialogue,  which helps people reach full and final solutions to their  problems. Taking up arms to resolve their problems is rejected,  regretted, and unacceptable at the national Yemeni and pan-Arab  levels.    Moreover, Jordan fully believes that Arab problems should be  handled within the Arab family. Hence, Arab efforts should be  consolidated as soon as possible to tackle the Yemeni issue to  avoid any chance of intervention by non-Arab parties, which  would further complicate the problem. Therefore, I appeal to  our brother Yemenis to stop fighting at once and to return to  dialogue to solve their problems. There is no problem in the  world that cannot be solved through dialogue as long as the  collective goal of all parties is the higher national Yemeni  interest.    We appeal to Arab states to quickly make the necessary  efforts to resolve the existing problem in Yemen as soon as  possible.    [Abu-al-Majd] You hosted a meeting with Yemeni leaders in  Amman to sign the Pledge and Accord Document. Are you prepared  to invite these leaders to Jordan again to solve the problem?    [Al-Tall] Jordan spares no effort to help any Arab state  solve its problems. However, I believe that Jordan has already  done all it can. I believe that the problem has deteriorated so  much that now a collective Arab effort is needed. I think that  the Arab Republic of Egypt, the major state in the Arab world,  can play a role in finding a solution. Jordan will spare no  effort to cooperate with its big sister Egypt. All other Arab  states must assist in this matter. They have to stop the  infighting among brother Yemenis as soon as possible.    [Abu-al-Majd] Egypt has proposed an urgent meeting of the  Arab League to discuss the Yemeni developments. The League has  responded and the permanent delegates will be meeting at the  League headquarters today. Does Jordan have any specific  proposals to submit to this meeting in coordination with Egypt  to resolve the crisis?    [Al-Tall] Actually Jordan's previously announced proposals  are clear and frank. Jordan has stated that the Yemeni brothers  should solve their issues through dialogue and end their  problems so that this predicament which has gripped fraternal  Yemen for the past few months will disappear.    Of course the Arab League's meeting at the delegate level is  a positive step in this regard, but I hope the meeting will be  quickly followed by other meetings, coordination, and contacts  at a higher level to resolve this problem as quickly as  possible. The issue has regrettably developed regrettably to a  serious point and there is fear, God forbid, that it might  escalate and forces from outside the Arab region might intervene.    Jordan firmly believes Arab issues should be handled by the  Arab nation itself without intervention by any force from  outside the region.    [Abu-al-Majd] Do we understand from your statement that you  are demanding, for example, a summit meeting or at least one at  the level of foreign ministers to resolve this issue?    [Al-Tall] When the Arab League meets at a higher level, it  will mean there is interest in the issue. I believe that the  issue is of a magnitude that requires a meeting at the highest  level and as soon as possible. I believe that if the mediation  efforts are concerted, Arab efforts are rallied, and leaders of  all Arab countries agree on a certain decision on Yemen, the  Yemeni brothers will respond.    [Abu-al-Majd] There is a proposal to send Arab forces to  disengage the forces. If the measure is agreed upon do you  believe it will contribute to resolving the crisis?    [Al-Tall] I believe that an Arab meeting at the highest  level  would discuss all alternatives. If such a proposal has been  submitted, why shouldn't it be implemented? However, I believe  there still are some options that might prompt the Yemeni  brothers to end the fighting and resume a dialogue.    [Abu-al-Majd] What options?    [Al-Tall] A joint Arab effort, led by Egypt.</p>

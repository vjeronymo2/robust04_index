			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Technology: New well goes round the bend Horizontal drilling, one of the more advanced areas of oil exploration and production technology, takes a step forward next month on the sand dunes north of Aberdeen. The International Drilling and Downhole Technology Centre (IDDTC) will be drilling an experimental well which will be made available to the equipment and services industry as a testing ground. The IDDTC claims it will be the first facility of its kind in the world. The well will descend 1,000 feet. It will then be turned through a nine degree per 100 foot angle, and continue for another 500 feet horizontally. The total length of the well will be 2,440 feet. The Pounds 900,000 cost will be borne partly by the oil services industry and partly by the local regional council, Scottish Enterprise and Grampian Enterprise. Although this sounds a lot of money, David Curry, the IDDTC's managing director, says it is one twentieth of the cost of drilling a similar well offshore. He describes horizontal drilling as 'the emerging technology, the technology of the 1990s'. One purpose of the well is to test compressed air drilling techniques which are still being developed. These techniques are thought to be more efficient than traditional liquid mud systems, providing higher penetration rates. Horizontal wells are perceived to have several advantages over conventional deep well drilling. They enable drillers to approach a reservoir from a fresh direction and, usually, achieve higher recovery rates than by traditional means. Although horizontal drilling is more expensive, a successful well can pay for itself many times over. Several wells in the North Sea are now being drilled horizontally, such as the Hyde, Forth, Captain and Anglia fields. 'They're more costly, but you can achieve more,' said Alan Miller, BP's drilling superintendent for the southern North Sea region. BP has ambitious horizontal drilling plans for its Wytch Farm field in Poole Harbour, Dorset. Rather than place a drilling rig offshore, BP will reaching out to the underwater field from an onshore site. This will not only be cheaper than building an artificial island but also, the company likes to point out, more environmentally friendly.</p>

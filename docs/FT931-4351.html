			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hanson link adds to Shanks landfill HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, has taken a 4.7 per cent stake in Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management group, and has granted in return additional rights at existing landfill sites. The deal, worth Pounds 18m in shares and Pounds 2.2m for the assumption of certain liabilities, will give Shanks access to an additional 21.7m cu m of void at four sites in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Cambridgeshire. Mr Roger Hewitt, chief executive, said the acquisition would provide a continuity of landfill operations at two of the sites into the next century. It is unusual for Hanson to take minority stakes in companies, but it is not the first time the conglomerate has been on Shanks' register. In 1986 when it sold London Brick Landfill to Shanks, Hanson retained a 20 per cent stake in the business which it held until 1991. Mr Hewitt welcomed Hanson back as a shareholder. The deal will be dilutive for Shanks in the first year as it is issuing 8.73m ordinary shares to Hanson. Shanks will also be paying 15 per cent of revenues to Hanson from disposal of waste in the acquired void. The company handles more than 7m tonnes of waste a year and now has 85.2m cu m of consented landbank, after the addition of 9m cu m just acquired from Hanson. Shanks has an option to buy a unconsented void from Hanson in Bedfordshire for an additional Pounds 7.25m cash.</p>

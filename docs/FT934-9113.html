			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Venezuela poll leader vows to scrap reform THE LEADING candidate in next month's presidential elections in Venezuela, Mr Rafael Caldera, announced a policy platform yesterday that rejected market reforms introduced in Venezuela since 1989. He also called for talks to ease the terms of the country's 'oppressive and unjust' public sector foreign debt. Mr Caldera, 77, said his 'first step' as president would be to address the fiscal deficit by reducing spending in the 1994 government budget. However, this would not be achieved by firing public employees or cutting wages, he added. The candidate, president from 1969-74, said he would raise government revenues by improved tax collection. In addition, 'Those who earn more and have more will pay more taxes'. A recently-introduced value added tax, which the candidate called 'unfair' to consumers, would be repealed, he said. Referring to business appeals for reforms in rules governing employees' accumulated severance pay benefits, Mr Caldera said any changes accepted by the workers would be approved by his government. Venezuelans are scheduled to vote for a new president, National Congress and state legislatures on December 5. Mr Caldera, running as an independent with the support of 16 small political parties, has been in the lead over the last few months in most published public opinion polls. However, political analysts say a large number of voters are still undecided, and that these votes could change the election's outcome. In other policy areas, Mr Caldera said he would: Call for reforms of the constitution, including the establishment of referendums to approve leading policies and remove public officials (including the president) from office. Reform government, including public administration, the justice system, education, health and agriculture. Continue the process of decentralisation, but only if it produces greater efficiency in government.</p>

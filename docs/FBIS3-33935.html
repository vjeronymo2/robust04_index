			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi by Samir </F> Tawfiq; place and date not given]    [Text] [Tawfiq] Which countries finance terrorism in Egypt  and when will they be named? Not naming them causes confusion.  Defining them is important so that we know the countries that do  not want stability for us.    [Al-Alfi] We have some good information about the financing  and training places and the planners and their locations. But  there is an advantage in not revealing all the facts about this  issue, because there are continuing efforts and intense contacts  under way with numerous countries to cooperate with us. Indeed,  several fugitive terrorists have been arrested and others have  been handed over. I hope you will not ask for the names of  these countries and any figures right now, so that we will leave  them in the dark.    [Tawfiq] But the minister told a news conference he would  name these countries.    [Al-Alfi] Yes, but I said I would do that at the proper  time.  When I announce a specific location and say we brought in  someone from there, his colleagues will go elsewhere or flee the  country and thus we will have done them a service by warning  them.    The same thing applies to terrorist operations. Sometimes we  ask that news of such operations is not published and  journalists start asking in whose interests is this secrecy. I  tell them: Yes, there is an advantage, that of the  investigation.    There are two examples: First, when we arrested the first  suspect and banned the publication [of news] on the attempt to  kill the prime minister. Then, we arrested nine suspects in  subsequent measures.    The second example was the Hulwan movie theater incident.  After news was published of two arrests, the others escaped  after reading the newspapers. We had pinpointed their locations  but found nothing except that day's newspapers.    [Tawfiq] Are the people required to live with terrorism for  years to come? When will we eliminate this phenomenon that is  alien to our society?    [Al-Alfi] I am not required to coexist with terrorism and it  must be eliminated.    Egypt has always been a safe country, where people are  extremely friendly and loving and religion is tolerant. Egypt  is home to al- Azhar and Islam is a religion that follows a  middle course; it knows no extremism and does not advocate  violence. All these criminal incidents are the ideas of  renegades with particular beliefs who live in some Islamic and  Arab countries. But the Koran, the main source of our  legislation, contains straightforward verses renouncing  terrorism, violence, and killing.    The entire nation now knows that those who say some people  are the infidel and sanction their killing and confiscation of  their property are fakes. They are not Muslims. They even  commit crimes against Islam and against the country.    It is not only Egypt that faces terrorism, because it is  apparent that there is a plot to strike at every Arab and  Islamic country in the name of Islam. Training in implementing  this plot takes place abroad, where they assemble personnel of  every nationality in one place. The methods of arming,  training, and financing are the same. I saw pictures of  incidents carried out by terrorists abroad and found them  compatible with what happens in Egypt. The bombs have the same  materials; they put nails and ball bearings in the bombs and use  the same detonator. Weapons here and abroad are used in the  same way and the training is the same.    Thus, the target is every Arab and Islamic country. Everyone  has begun to realize this. We will eradicate terrorism because  we are right and the people support us. The end of terrorism is  certain.    If we had wanted to eliminate terrorism fast, we could have  done so by resorting to extraordinary measures. But we are  confronting terrorism with law and democracy, not resorting to  extraordinary measures.    In addition to aborting the plots that were prepared during  the new year, Christmas, and police day celebrations, we aborted  other plots, arrested the plotters, and seized documents  containing the names of some personalities. But I will not name  names. All these are now cases, which will be referred to the  court. The trials will be public. But secrecy will be  maintained during the interrogation period.    [Tawfiq] Have antiterrorism steps been developed?    [Al-Alfi] Most important for us, the security men, is that  we  adopt a scientific course and sound planning and train on the  highest level, in addition to acquiring weapons. The police  department has been supplied with the most modern weapons.  Police missions travel abroad. Technicians and experts arrive  in Egypt to train us. The whole department has undergone such  training.    I want to say something: Our action is no longer a  tit-for-tat response. The initiative now is in the hands of the  police. This has produced better results. We are searching for  the terrorists' hideouts. We have arrested many terrorists and  seized their equipment, explosives, and weapons. Thus, we have  foiled several incidents before they took place.    If the terrorists are targeting policemen to get at the  morale of the entire police department, I tell them: Every  incident against a policeman, security man, or any citizen  increases our determination to eliminate these terrorists. It  also deepens our faith because we uphold justice and defend  religion and the homeland. The initiative is in our hands and  will remain so, despite the sacrifices.    [Tawfiq] You have referred 20 officers to the inspection  department for investigation for mistreating citizens. You have  confirmed that you are following up these investigations  personally. Is this a standard policy? How can a complainant  reach the minister personally?    [Al-Alfi] My office is open to everyone. There are  instructions to the police commanders and the ministry's  officials to open their offices to all citizens. No one is lax.  We accept no insult against citizens. If there have been  excesses, they are isolated incidents; they are not part of a  policy toward citizens.    There is periodic, sudden, and continuous inspection of  sections, centers, and services departments, such as the traffic  department, the passport department, the work permits  department, and the civil status department.    Soon there will be a public relations officer in every  section, center, and department. The public relations officer  will receive the citizen, look into his problem, and advise him  what to do. There are also instructions that officers should be  present in the service departments day and night.    You may remember a complaint by a tourism college graduate,  which was published in the newspaper AKHBAR AL-HAWADITH. I said  at the time that the complainant should come to my office  immediately. We receive complaints but we also seek to identify  the shortcomings. I ask people outside the police department to  submit fictitious complaints without identifying themselves.  For instance, they may say their home has been burgled or they  have been attacked. They see how the duty officer reacts and  the way he treats the complaint. Afterward, the complainant  reveals his identity, investigates him, and decides on the  punishment. There are many officers who behave positively.  Some behave negatively. But more officers behave positively  and are rewarded. Those who behave negatively are punished  while those who behave positively are rewarded.    [Tawfiq] Terrorist incidents take place in broad daylight  in crowded places in Upper Egypt's governorates. How do you  explain the people's failure to resist the terrorists? Is this  due to the negative attitude of the Upper Egypt resident to some  customs and traditions that prevent him from intervening or to  the police's bad treatment of citizens?    [Al-Alfi] One thing manifested in these crimes is the custom  of taking revenge. This custom still exists. In some cities  and villages in Upper Egypt, the people take their own revenge  and do not surrender the criminal to the authorities. They do  not even receive condolences for their own dead until they have  taken revenge. Some families teach their children to take  revenge as soon as they are old enough to use firearms. The  mountains on both sides of the valley in Upper Egypt also make  it easy for criminals and accused people to escape.    I can say the police do not get involved in ill treatment.  But there is no doubt that like other police forces, there are  violations.    [Tawfiq] Why, when owners of licensed weapons apply to renew  their licenses, are weapons being withdrawn? This is happening  more and more. And why have stringent measures been adopted  when it comes to granting new licenses?    [Al-Alfi] It is not an issue of making things easier or more  difficult. The firearms law is clear. There must be  justifications and reasons, as stipulated by law, for granting a  firearms license. What is happening is that some people are  carrying weapons without any legal justification. But when  there is a justification, the license is issued immediately.  Many incidents happened in Upper Egypt in front of people  carrying licensed weapons; they did not attempt to intervene.  The issue here does not relate to licensed or unlicensed  weapons, but to customs and traditions.    In the past few months we seized about 18,000 unlicensed  weapons. We also discovered many weapons manufacturing shops and  stores illegally trading in weapons. These stores' licenses  have been canceled and their owners brought to trial.    [Tawfiq] Has the attempt to combat terrorism overshadowed  the  attempt to combat corruption, deviation, and narcotics?    [Al-Alfi] Our task is to implement the law and prevent  crime.  No one is above the law. Corruption, bribery, fraud, damage to  public property, narcotics trafficking, and the exploitation of  power must be checked. We investigate every report or every  piece of information about such crime and the perpetrators are  arrested and brought to trial. This is what is happening and  has been happening recently.    [Tawfiq] Why were violations in Madinat al-Nasr only  revealed  10 years after they were committed?    [Al-Alfi] The government tackles corruption and implements  the law. The government--the Interior Ministry and the state's  administrative control departments--uncovered the violations in  Madinat al-Nasr. We investigate any information we receive or  any report submitted to us to uncover the truth. In the Madinat  al-Nasr case, the government control departments uncovered the  violations, on which no reports were submitted. The government  control departments cannot turn a blind eye to violation. Our  position is known.    Repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, whose story was  published by AKHBAR AL-HAWADITH, deserves every honor. He is  indeed a brave man and bold and I wish everyone was like him.  He deserved every honor bestowed upon him. AKHBAR AL-YAWM  editor Sabir Shawkat also did a courageous job. It was a bold,  great step by AKHBAR AL- HAWADITH.    [Tawfiq] Do you have anything else to say?    [Al-Alfi] No. Thank you.</p>

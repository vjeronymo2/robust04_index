			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Italy fears renewed attacks ITALY yesterday prepared for possible further terrorist attacks after Thursday's car bomb explosion in Florence which killed five people and seriously damaged one of the two main wings of the famous Uffizi gallery. The Italian government yesterday said the mafia was behind the attack, but did not exclude the possibility that other organisations could also be involved in a determined campaign of terror to destabilise the country. In yesterday's parliamentary debate a number of senators questioned whether dissident elements in the security services and former members of the P2 secret masonic lodge, behind terrorist acts during the 1970s and early 1980s, were involved in the incidents. The authorities believe they are up against a group or groups with a well-defined strategy, unafraid to take lives or attack priceless artistic treasures. Mr Nicola Mancino, the interior minister, told parliament the mafia had a hand in wanting to create a climate of tension. Their aim was to distract the authorities from their increasingly successful battle against organised crime. He did not rule out links with international organised crime The Italian cabinet yesterday agreed to provide L30bn (Pounds 13.16m) in immediate funds to ensure the Uffizi could open to the public as soon as possible, albeit on a limited basis. The authorities have revealed no hard proof of mafia involvement in this bombing or that in Rome on May 14. Mr Mancino said links existed between the car bombing in Florence and the one n Rome which injured 23 people. In both instances forensic experts have found traces of the same explosive material also used in another unexplained act of terrorism, the bombing of the Naples-Milan train on December 23, 1984 killing 15 and injuring 200. The interior minister said the Rome explosion occured on national police day while the Uffizi bomb went off on the day interior ministers were meeting to discuss combating the drugs trade. The Rome bombing was a message primarily directed against an Italian audience, while the Florence explosion was intended to produce reverberations world-wide, he suggested. He also maintained the bombings were too close together to be coincidental. The car used to carry more than 100kg of explosive was apparently stolen the day before, as was a second get-away vehicle. Mafia experts said this was contrary to normal mafia practice. In the four major terrorist acts since 1974, the courts have failed to pin final responsibility on anyone. Only this week the 50,000 page file was closed on the May 28, 1974 bombing in Brescia (8 dead, 90 injured) after eight separate inconclusive trials since 1978. In Florence yesterday unions organised a protest and a crowd of over 100,000 heard calls for people to refuse to be cowed by the threat of terrorism. Elsewhere in Italy stoppages were staged in solidarity with the victims.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Italian polls set to test old parties MUNICIPAL elections yesterday and today in 55 Italian cities and towns will provide the first serious test of electoral opinion in the country since the April general elections. The main focus is on the towns of Monza and Varese in the Milan industrial belt, where opinion polls show the populist Lombard League is likely to consolidate its position as the main political party in northern Italy. At the small town of Fiumicino, near Rome, the first trial cross-party alliance is being tested with reformist elements of the Christian Democrat Party headed by Mr Mario Segni, a progressive sector of the Socialist Party loyal to Mr Claudio Martelli, justice minister, and sympathisers among the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). All the parties are in a state of flux, the main ascendant being the anti-Rome Lombard League which has burst on the scene in the past 18 months with limited funds but profiting from public disillusion with a corrupt political establishment. The extent of the slippage in support for the Christian Democrats and Socialists will demonstrate how far the electorate has decided to desert these two parties.</p>

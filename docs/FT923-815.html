			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Arts: A candle-lit gala and student workshop - Music in Italy / Palladio provides the venue for Paul Driver while in Ischia David Murray enjoys opera and exotic plants IN THE Euganean Hills lies the little town of Bagnolo di Lonigo, and hard by, but not so very easy for even a seasoned coach-driver to find, one of Andrea Palladio's earliest villas, built between 1542 and 1544 for the most powerful family on the Veneto mainland, the Pisanis. It is not to be confused with the celebrated, sublimely palatial Pisani residence on the Brenta Canal at Stra. The Lonigo property is by comparison a bluffly domestic proposition, a cubical construction with rusticated triple arch entrance. The River Gua, hedged off, flows past the doorstep. Alone of Palladian villas, this one has remained with the family for which it was designed, but until recently has been mouldering in disuse. Now the present owner, Marchesa Lepri, has seen to an accurate restoration of the building and the 16th century frescoes (by an unknown artist) which adorn its fine central sala. The Queen Mother paid a visit there a couple of years ago, and the public has at last been let in, albeit paying some Pounds 200 for the privilege. The occasion was a gala concert given in aid of the United Nations' 'Decade of the Disabled', the second (sponsored by Tamoil) in a series of annual events under the artistic direction of the violinist Andrea Cappelletti and named 'The Lost Palaces of Europe' in reference to the public inaccessibility of its chosen venues. The villa proved difficult of access in the purely physical sense - no outing, this, for the disabled - but if it could not quite count as a palace, it certainly offered an image of magical resplendency, candle-lit as it was in the balmy twilight at the head of a great sweep of candle-lit lawn. From the point on the lawn at which we had scramblingly entered, the refurbished, illuminated frescoes were already - and breathtakingly - visible through the semi-circular 'thermal' window of the sala. That room proved to be of more than domestic size and consequence - an interestingly cruciform and barrel vaulted structure, whose frescoes seen close-to were charming but no more, and whose acoustics were awkwardly reverberant. The concert suffered also from poor lighting, except when made periodically over-bright by the television crews. But the audience was there as much for the sense of place and the anticipation of a handsome candle-lit supper as for the concert itself, which, by a familiar law of the gala event, became something that might almost have been left out. Nevertheless, it made its plea. The young players, notable for eager sonorous freshness rather than finesse, of Interpreti Veneziani and their conductor Paolo Cognolato gave us a brashly arresting Rossini overture - Il Signor Bruschino - and accompanied Signor Cappelletti in Mozart's A major concerto, K. 219. He produced a lustrous stream of sound from his 1727 Stradivarius, the instrument's historical interest and great price nicely fitting in with the tone of the evening. Finally came Domenico Cimarosa's Il Maestro di Cappella (1791), a little one-act lampoon of the conductor's role, and effectively the first-ever young person's guide to the orchestra. Baritone Maurizio Muraro, costumed in brocade, goaded and cajoled his unruly musicians and skilfully entertained us. Then followed a couple of not too long speeches - and a shimmering supper. MORTELLA means 'myrtle', which as a name for the late Sir William Walton's garden-estate on Ischia is a kind of joke. There is myrtle, along with other Mediterranean natives - citrus trees heavy with fruit, waves of bougainvillaea, a secret alley of camellias; but also hibiscus and cactus and strange Antipodean shrubs, banana-trees and luxuriant palms, eerily cylindrical trees with bark that feels like living hide. Where paths cross there are fountains, and down a main artery trickles a slender watercourse, Alhambra-style. Amid the heady scents of this densely exotic mondello, one might expect tropical birds too. Instead there are the distant cries of sopranos in rehearsal - at least in September, when the Fondazione Walton funds an intensive master-course for chosen young singers. Lady Walton is no less intent on making La Mortella a nest for musical development than upon cultivating her marvellous garden, onward and (especially) upward. It burgeons from a long chasm in the lava-based ground, rife with horticultural vitamins. In horizontal terms the acreage is not enormous, but obliquely it stretches up and up. The Walton house is built into the cliff, like the more recent Walton museum cum recital-room and the Tea-House; thence paths ascend toward Sir William's memorial rock, a serene 'Crocodile Pool' and a topmost pond inhabited by a single, gigantically swollen lotus plant. For students and lucky guests there is also a swimming-pool with a matchless view from a great height - echoing the crater-lake atop the extinct volcano in the middle distance. The hard-working students need it, for their course is strenuous. Last year it was devoted to Lieder, especially Hugo Wolf's Italian Songbook. This year the group was chosen through auditions in Florence and London to make up a cast of six for Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto. They were outnumbered by their teachers, led by the producer Colin Graham and Glyndebourne's distinguished Head of Music Staff, Martin Isepp. While they were coached rigorously in Italian diction as well as singing, rehearsals for the Cimarosa proceeded. I watched Graham getting them to extract the maximum dramatic sense from the recitatives, instead of gabbling through them. It wasn't exactly a process of discovery, for he told them repeatedly what their characters were feeling; but it was an object lesson in faithful, practical attention to the text. Earlier there was a concert in the gardens which let the young singers show their paces. It included a performance of Walton's Facade, brightly conducted by Susanna Pescetti, and declaimed with the utmost verve and clarity by Lady Walton herself with Graham. The promising Rossini bass on the course, Antonio Abete, had to sing in a Parma competition that night; but the singers' complement was made up by a remarkable new contralto, Anna Maria di Micco. Her confident, impassioned delivery of a Tancredi aria foretold a brilliant Rossinian future for her. In Donizetti and two of Roger Steptoe's 'Chinese Lyrics', the soprano Anna Maria Panzarella sang with as much skill and charm as in the Royal College's Fille du Regiment this summer. Also from the RCM, the mezzo Susan Legg was staunch and affecting in Walton and Jonathan Harvey. The Guildhall's Simon Thorpe, whose English 'Count' in the Cimarosa was developing nicely, shone in Vaughan Williams (less in Wagner); Maurizio Dalena, from Bari, displayed a stylish tenor that wants more variety of colour yet. Maria Angela Spotorno wields not only a well-formed soprano, but the knowing allure of a much more experienced performer; we shall see much more of her. As summer schools go, the one at La Mortella is sui generis, not least because of its extraordinary setting. The gardens are open to the public several times a week (ring Ischia 081-986220). Meanwhile, La Mortella's Matrimonio segreto will have a British performance on October 14, in Lady Aberdeen's Haddo Hall.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 17-YEAR-OLD ENTERS NOT GUILTY PLEA IN DEAF MAN'S SLAYING  </P> <P> Joey Paul Bellinger, a 17-year-old Long Beach boy accused of shooting and  killing a deaf man and injuring the man's brother during a traffic dispute in  Granada Hills last January, pleaded not guilty Friday in adult court to murder  charges.  </P> <P> The arraignment in San Fernando Municipal Court came after a Juvenile Court  judge ruled last week that Bellinger was unfit to be prosecuted as a juvenile  because of the seriousness of the charge. A preliminary hearing was set for  Sept. 24.  </P> <P> Bellinger allegedly shot and killed Cesar Vieira, 30, and wounded Edward  Vieira, 25, during the confrontation that began when Bellinger and other youths  exchanged insults with the brothers at an intersection, police said.  </P> <P> Bellinger, who would have been released at the latest by his 25th birthday if  convicted in juvenile court, now faces more than 30 years in prison if  convicted of the murder and attempted murder charges and allegations that he  used a firearm and inflicted great injury.  </P> <P> However, because Bellinger allegedly committed the crimes while a juvenile, a  judge may impose the juvenile sentence if he is convicted -- meaning he would  be released when he turns 25 -- or could order him sent to state prison after  serving time in a California Youth Authority facility, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> In the event of a conviction, a third option, though a less likely one, would  be to send him to prison from the beginning of his sentence, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Commissioner Gerald T. Richardson, who presided over Friday's arraignment,  ordered Bellinger held without bail at Central Juvenile Hall despite his  attorney's request that bail be set. Richardson indicated that Bellinger  presented a flight risk because he sought refuge with a family friend in  Upstate New York after the Jan. 28 killing.  </P> <P> The youth was arrested at the friend's house on March 2 after FBI agents  received a tip about his whereabouts.  </P></p>

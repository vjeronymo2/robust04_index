			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Rejection" issued by the spokesman for the National Army </F> of Democratic Kampuchea on 31 January; place not given]    [Text] I. Because of their difficult, desperate, and  defeated position, (?the puppets) have spread a premeditated  rumor that the wife of a high-ranking commander in the National  Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] was killed during fighting  in Anlung Veng and that this high-ranking commander then fled to  Takeo Province.    We would like to confirm that the Vietnamese communist  puppets' aggressive attack forces are very far away from Anglung  Veng. As a matter of fact, the aggressive attack forces  stationed in the eastern part of Samraong are over 50 km away  from Anlung Veng; those in the area north of Sre Noy are over 80  km away; and those in Kulen are over 100 km away. Elsewhere,  the Vietnamese communist puppets' aggressive attack forces are  under attack and are pinned down by the NADK and the Cambodian  people.    II. This is a despicable lie on the part of the Vietnamese  communists, their puppets, and their alliance. They are bogged  down in the military, political, diplomatic, and social fields  -- both in the countryside and in Phnom Penh. This is an  attempt by our enemies -- who are facing an impasse and are  suffering serious defeats -- to fool others.    The purpose of this psychological propaganda is: To threaten  and frighten those who seek business contacts with Democratic  Kampuchea [DK] in this zone; and to encourage the Vietnamese  communist ringleaders and their troops, who are being routed and  demoralized on every battlefields across the country, especially  the Samraong-Anlung Veng battlefield.    But this self-deceiving propaganda by the Vietnamese  communists, their puppets, and their alliance cannot encourage  the Vietnamese communist puppet commanders and their troops. On  the battlefield, the aggressive attack forces that launched  operations against the DK's liberated zone were counterattacked  during January by the NADK and the Cambodian people. They  suffered heavy defeats: Over 400 of them were killed or  wounded; over 700 others deserted; and 36 tanks, armored  personnel carriers, and military trucks (?were seized). The  Vietnamese communist puppets' aggressive attack forces are  currently being smashed to pieces by the NADK and the people  [words indistinct]. Under these circumstances, these savage  elements are suffering from a shortage of food, ammunition,  [words indistinct].    III. During the January fighting, dozens of the Vietnamese  communist puppets' military commanders were killed or wounded.  These included over 30 commanders between the rank of colonel  and first lieutenant as well as six generals.    General Prum Samen of the Vietnamese communist puppets'  General Staff was seriously wounded and his tank was totally  destroyed by a mine explosion east of Samraong. Gen. Nhoek  Bunchhai, first deputy chief of the Vietnamese communist  puppets' General Staff, was wounded during the fighting in  Samraong on (?24) January. On 25 January, Gen. Long Sopheap,  chief of the Vietnamese communist puppets' 4th Military Region,  was seriously wounded as his tank was moving from Ba Noem to  Samraong. He was quickly sent to a hospital by helicopter.    To summarize, the situation on Route 68 -- covering  Samraong,  Siem Reap, Anlung Veng, Kulen, Choam Khsan, Rumchong, and Ampil  Districts -- shows that the puppets are suffering serious and  successive defeats on this battlefield. It shows that the  puppet commanders and their troops are being encircled; cut off  from each other; and cut off from their supplies of food, [word  indistinct] and assistance from the outside. They are in a  serious state of desperation, and are waiting only for their  doom.    [Dated] 31 January 1994    [Signed] NADK spokesman</p>

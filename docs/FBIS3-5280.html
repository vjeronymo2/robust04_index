Mazda is among major Japanese carmakers that have been  mapping out individual parts-purchase programs in the wake of  the collapse in February of "framework" trade talks between  Japan and the United States.    Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's top automaker, is also expected  to unveil by the end of the month a "voluntary target" to  purchase parts worth some 6 billion dollars in fiscal 1996.    Under the "voluntary" plan, scheduled to be announced in  mid-  March, Mazda will import 400 million dollars worth in parts from  the U.S. and its U.S. plant, Auto Alliance International, will  procure another 2 billion dollars worth.    Mazda officials said the planned purchases include 2.3  billion dollars worth in parts Mazda had intended to buy in  fiscal 1994 in line with its plans unveiled in January 1992  during then President George Bush's visit to Tokyo.    The initial plan for fiscal 1994, starting in April, calls  for 1.9 billion dollars worth in purchases by its U.S. plant and  400 million dollars worth in imports by the parent Mazda.    Mazda decided to postpone implementation of its initial 1994  plan, however, due to the prolonged car sales slump in Japan.  Instead, it will put off the purchases by three years and add  slightly to the total planned purchases, the officials said.</p>

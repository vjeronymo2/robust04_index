			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Teodato Hunguana, the government's number two man on  the Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, told Radio  Mozambique today that the reduction of UN forces in this country  must occur hand in hand with the coming into being of the new  armed forces. Reacting to the UN Security Council's plan to  reduce the UN peacekeeping forces in Mozambique, Teodato  Hunguana noted that the UN contingent is in this country to  carry out a mission which will be over when the Mozambique  Defense Armed Forces, FADM, have started operating. Teodato  Hunguana said that to withdraw or reduce those forces before  their mission is over could have negative consequences for this  country.    In turn, Jeronimo Malagueta, Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] political affairs officer, says that Renamo is not  against the United Nations reducing its contingent, as long as  this occurs simultaneously with the arrival of a UN police  contingent.</p>

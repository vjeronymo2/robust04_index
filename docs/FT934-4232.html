			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Markets: Clever, yes. Simpler, no - Serious Money / The Budget and You Kenneth Clarke's Budget may have gained the thumbs up from the gilt and equity markets, but on one important criterion, it deserves the thumbs down. Simplicity is an important part of the tax system, and is not just of academic interest. When chancellors add layers of complexity, taxpayers have to devote more time to coping with the rules. Investors' decisions become determined not by the nature of the investment, but by the nature of the tax rules which apply to it. It is much easier for individuals to plan their finances if the tax system is governed by consistent principles. If government changes to the tax rules are arbitrary, confusion results. Nigel Lawson's reform made large strides in the direction of simplification; by the end of his chancellorship, for example, we had just two rates of income tax, 25 and 40 per cent. His three successors - Major, Lamont and now Clarke - have tinkered with the rules to make matters worse. Let us start with tax reliefs. There was logic in limiting all reliefs to the 20 per cent rate of tax. This appeared to be the direction in which the government was heading in the last Budget when it reduced three items to 20 per cent; the tax credit on dividends, mortgage interest relief and the married couple's allowance. Now, we have an additional 15 per cent band at which reliefs will apply from April 1995; on Miras and on the married couple's allowance. There is no 15 per cent income tax band, so this new relief does not fit the system. It means there will be four rates on which tax reliefs will apply - 15, 20, 25 and 40 per cent. An alternative approach would have been to reduce the amount of the married couple's allowance from Pounds 1,720 and to limit the size of loan on which mortgage interest relief was granted to, say, Pounds 25,000. The Treasury argues, however, that reducing the loan limit would have the greatest effect on those with the biggest mortgages. Reducing it to 15 per cent spreads the pain. Once a 15 per cent relief had been established for Miras, then it was logical to apply it to the married couple's allowance. Again, there appears to be a contradiction. It might seem the Treasury's clear intention to phase out the married couple's allowance, as an anachronism in an age of independent assessment of men and women. However, the Treasury is increasing the married couple's allowance for those over 65 in each of the next two years. So is the married couple's allowance going or not? Then we have the changes to capital gains tax. The old system of CGT was fairly complex, but it at least had some kind of inner logic; investors should not pay tax on gains which merely represented compensation for inflation. The new system, explained by Scheherazade Daneshkhu on Page III, means indexation cannot be used to create losses. So if you invest Pounds 10,000 and, after five years, prices have doubled, you will not have a CGT loss of Pounds 10,000 to offset against gains elsewhere. If you make a nominal loss of Pounds 10,000, however (which would, in our example, mean the company going bust) you will still be able to offset that against other gains. What seems particularly arbitrary and unfair is that the change applied immediately from Budget day. Investors will have based their planning on the rules applying at the start of the tax year. If, for example, they had already made gains of over Pounds 5,800, they might have planned to sell loss-making investments (under the old rules) to eliminate their tax liability. As one reader has written: 'The goal posts have been moved in the middle of the match.' Then we have the 'son of BES'. The Business Expansion Scheme will be abolished from the end of this year. It has had a chequered history. It was designed to encourage investment in small businesses; unfortunately, many of the businesses failed. Then it was turned into a scheme for encouraging private rented property and ingenious sponsors devised ways of making it a rewarding tax break. BES is being replaced with the Enterprise Investment Scheme, designed to encourage investment in small businesses. Private rented property is excluded. The rules are slightly different; relief is limited to 20 per cent, the amount which can be invested has increased from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 100,000, and paid directors will qualify for relief. Nevertheless, we appear to be going around in circles. One lesson is to beware of Budget predictions. Full tax relief on personal pensions is still in place, the BES was not abolished one month early; investors were therefore wise to ignore the 'buy now while stocks last' pre-Budget hype. Decisions can now be taken in a calmer environment, although not, alas, in a simpler tax regime.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Arts: Jordan - Theatre in London Matthew Arnold used to advise against literature which presented suffering unalleviated by incident. Jordan at the Lilian Baylis Theatre challenges Arnold: a dramatic monologue based on the life of Shirley Jones, the woman who killed her son, Jordan, was acquitted of murder in the winter of 1987, and took her own life on the day she was released from court. This makes grave and compelling theatre. If Anna Reynolds' stage-writing debut seems over-emphatic, it is everywhere blessed with a superb, strong performance from co-writer and solo actor Moira Buffini as Shirley. She has enough self-consciousness to know her own desperation and enough madness to self-destruct; and she has the intelligence to puncture her environment. Also, Fiona Buffini's directing is meticulous. The action takes place in a cell beneath the crown court, and flicks backwards, like some film noir, into Shirley's past: childhood in Morecombe, motherhood in Portsmouth, remand in Holloway. Gradually, the details of Shirley's deprived existence emerge. A violent father gives way to a savage, promiscuous boyfriend who beats both Shirley and their baby. When the boyfriend leaves, she takes to prostitution, turning nights with clients into fluffy toys for Jordan. Out of money, and in desperation, she smothers her child and attempts suicide; unfortunately she survives to face the rigours of the legal system. Then follow the psychiatric ward and the court scenes - played from an oversized chair - which manage both pain and wit. The prosecutor declaims, 'She thinks psychiatrists are a load of crap . . . She is definitely fit to plead.' Everywhere the play exalts the ordinary in Shirley's home, the patterns of survival, in prison the patterns of privilege. Real community exists only in the maternity ward. As a women's play tackling women's issues, Jordan needs more acuity; as a play about imprisonment, this is powerful and knowing. Jordan is never enjoyable, but always challenging and often enlightening. Remember this is a true story: Shirley Jones' wonderful bravery deserves to be seen. Lilian Baylis Theatre (071 837 4104) until 16 May</p>

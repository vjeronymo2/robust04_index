			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS;  </P> <P> YOSEMITE; THE EMBATTLED WILDERNESS BY ALFRED RUNTE (UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA:  $24.95; 271 PP., ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> In the last weeks of its first century, Yosemite National Park captured the  nation's attention with great fires. It will be tragic irony if these  lightning-generated pyrotechnics, as natural to the Sierra Nevada as waterfalls  and granite, deflect our thoughts from the real, man-made threats facing one of  America's most beloved places.  </P> <P> A visit to Yosemite Valley this year will overwhelm you with souvenir tributes  to the park's centennial. Alfred Runte's dark history stands in stark contrast:  His celebratory effort broods over the past century's battles between the  forces of vision and those of exploitation. Runte calls himself an  "environmental historian." Author of "National Parks: The American Experience"  (1979), this academic-without-portfolio offers a free-wheeling, controversial  and scholarly critique of Yosemite's first 100 years.  </P> <P> The official touchstones of Yosemite's history are its discovery by whites and  the rapid extirpation of the native Ahwahneechees led by Tenaya in the mid-19th  Century; the Yosemite Park Act of 1864 establishing a protected reserve of the  Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias; its expansion and full-fledged  establishment as a national park in 1890; John Muir's heroic but failed  campaign to save Hetch-Hetchy Valley from damming in 1913, and lastly the  establishment of the National Park Service in 1916. But although he  acknowledges these historical markers, Runte is after subtler, and ultimately  more important, game.  </P> <P> "Among all of the debates affecting America's national parks, the most enduring  -- and most intense -- is where to draw the line between preservation and use."  Runte's first sentence signals his anthem. His improbable heroes are a line of  scientists tracing their heritage to Joseph Grinnell of the University of  California's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology in Berkeley.  </P> <P> In Runte's eyes, these men -- beginning with Grinnell himself in the early days  of the national park -- saw Yosemite as a great reserve of wild nature, a  source of scientific information and understanding. They used reason to  campaign patiently for what we today would call the "wilderness ecosystem"  model of a national park. "And so to Berkeley professors, students and alumni  went the honor of founding Yosemite's 'university of the wilderness.' From its  graduates, Grinnell now looked forward to the evolution of a new public  consciousness of the importance of national parks as refuges for biological  diversity."  </P> <P> Runte's villains are an even longer line of despoilers and developers who saw  money to be made in Yosemite and largely accomplished their mission. Their  progenitors were the first to build hotels and plant orchards to service  Yosemite's pioneer visitors in the 1860s, and fought tirelessly to maintain and  expand their claims on park land. Runte sees an unbroken line of concessioners  leading to the mighty Yosemite Park and Curry Co., Yosemite's sole proprietor  of bed, drink and lodging, today a wholly owned subsidiary of the Music Corp.  of America (MCA). Runte hyperventilates between his lines when he reports  Edward C. Hardy, president of the Curry Co., calling Yosemite a "destination  resort."  </P> <P> And just where does the National Park Service and its predecessor stewards of  Yosemite fit in Runte's scenario? They are the largely unimaginative pawns of  politics, conservation's eunuchs, seeking always for compromise drawn from the  seemingly contradictory aims of the National Park Service Act: "to conserve the  scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to  provide the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will  leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."  </P> <P> Every compromise, finds Runte, has taken Yosemite further from its wild  beginnings. Referring to Horace Albright, the Park Service's co-founder: "Park  Service tradition, Albright confirmed, leaned heavily toward public works . . .  in Albright's estimation, development was a given and therefore became a basis  for comparison instead of an object properly targeted for exclusion. . . . The  point he refused to acknowledge was that development itself, whether modern or  crude, perhaps should never have been allowed inside Yosemite National Park."  Runte effectively uses a long, detailed section on the history of bear  management in Yosemite to illustrate how natural resources have suffered,  rather than inconvenience visitors or proprietors.  </P> <P> There is, oddly enough, a minor fourth element in "The Embattled Wilderness" --  park visitors. In the grand play between preservationists and developers, both  of whom claim to be serving some public, the Park Service ineffectually acting  as umpire, Runte's grandstands are largely silent. In truth, none of the  principals in this heroic drama can claim to represent the real wishes of  Yosemite's millions of annual visitors, or the values of its 200 million  owners.  </P> <P> The park concessioners, Curry Co. back through its predecessors, have had no  trouble filling their rooms, bars, restaurants, and tour buses, nor selling  their trinkets. There is more than a year's wait for room reservations as I  write this -- surely, by some standards, an argument for more accommodations.  On the other hand, when the Park Service queried its public in the 1970s for a  revision of its General Management Plan, it found strong sentiment for  de-urbanizing Yosemite Valley, for the reduction of structures and services.  </P> <P> As an ecologist, I am pleased by Runte's focus on natural resources, and the  long relationship between UC Berkeley's field biologists and the evolving  management of Yosemite. True enough, Joseph Grinnell, Joe Dixon, George Wright  and A. Starker Leopold exhausted half a century trying to instill the notion of  a wild biotic reserve upon the Park Service. Equally true, Yosemite's waters  still are befouled by introduced trout; its bears still trapped and sometimes  killed to pay for visitors' sins; its forests deflected from their ancient  rhythms by the need to protect people and their possessions from fire. Yet the  words of Yosemite's ecological sages have -- however belatedly -- largely found  their way into contemporary policy and practice.  </P> <P> Runte makes a relentless case that overcrowded, overprostituted Yosemite must  be rationed; therefore why not reduce its amenities, and in so doing reduce the  attraction to those who seek pleasures that can be purchased elsewhere?  </P> <P> In his tough treatment, Runte conveniently ignores the larger world in which  Yosemite National Park must function and always has functioned. It is a social  and a political construct; it and its stewards always have reflected the  context of their times. Grinnell and his students weren't merely ahead of the  Park Service; as academics they were free to be visionaries and properly  outraced social values.  </P> <P> Today, Yosemite faces new perils that Runte fails to address: air pollution  attacking its ecosystems; development on its boundaries making it a biological  island; political limits on the fires its forests demand, and the likelihood  that climate change may yet destroy the nearly intact ecosystem painfully  conserved thus far.  </P> <P> Without the best scientific effort and intense social commitment, Yosemite will  not survive its second century.  </P> <P> BOOK MARK: For an excerpt from "Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness," see the  Opinion section, Page 4.  </P></p>

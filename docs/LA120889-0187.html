			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FROST TAKES LEAD IN S. AFRICA TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> South African David Frost fired a 6-under-par 66 today and took a three-stroke  lead after the second round of golf's most lucrative tournament, the Million  Dollar Challenge.  </P> <P> Frost, winner of the World Series of Golf this year, ended the  storm-interrupted round with a 36-hole score of 133, eleven strokes under par.  </P> <P> American Tim Simpson, with a 69 today, fell to second place, and Scott Hoch,  with a 72, dropped six strokes off the pace to third place.  </P> <P> The three began the round tied for the lead at 67.  </P> <P> The purse for the four-day, 10-player event is $2.3 million, including $1  million for the winner. The last-place finisher will get $70,000.  </P> <P> Trailing Hoch were three more Americans: Chip Beck at 142 after a 70; Don  Pooley at even-par 144 after a 71, and Scott Simpson at 147 after a 75.  </P> <P> Scotland's Sandy Lyle shot 73 for a two-day total of 148; American Ken Green  was at 149 after a 77; defending champion Fulton Allem of South Africa shot 75  for a 151 total, and American Andy Bean continued to struggle with a 74 to  follow his opening-day 81.  </P> <P> Play on the back nine of the 7,665-yard course at the Sun City  gambling-and-sports resort was halted for nearly an hour by a heavy  thunderstorm.  </P> <P> Frost, with 33s on both the front and back nine, came within one shot of the  course record held jointly by Seve Ballesteros of Spain and Fuzzy Zoeller.  </P> <P> Ballesteros won the Million Dollar event in 1983 and 1984. But he, like many  other well-known players, decided to pass up the tournament as pressure mounted  to support an international sports boycott protesting South Africa's racial  segregation policies.  </P></p>

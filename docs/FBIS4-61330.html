			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with IMF representative in Lithuania P. Cornelius </F> by ELTA under the "Loans" rubric; place and date not given:  "IMF Does Not Waste Resources"]    [Text] In October of 1993, the IMF Executive Council  approved a program for Lithuania which is comprised of two parts  -- the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum (continuous  financial assistance) and the so-called system transformation  loan. These resources are allocated to support Lithuania's  economic reform which will be conducted for a year and a half --  from the middle of 1993 to late 1994. IMF representative in  Lithuania P. Cornelius has commented on this assistance rendered  by the IMF to an ELTA correspondent.    [ELTA] What is the difference between an IMF loan  extended according to the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum  from that of system transformation?    [Cornelius] According to system transformation loans,  Lithuania can receive its quota of 50 percent, while according  to the memorandum -- 25 percent (Lithuania's quota in the IMF is  about $145 million). This money is paid in separate  installments, that is, the total is not paid in bulk.    The IMF extends system transformation loans mostly to those  countries which are experiencing a so-called trade shock.  Lithuania had this situation when oil and gas prices jumped to  the world level. According to this loan, Lithuania's 25-percent  quota, which is about $26 million, was paid out in October of  1993. The country received another $36-million quota according  to the system transformation loan several weeks ago -- on 8  April. These finances must be utilized to settle payment  balances.    [ELTA] What about loans under the Lithuanian economic  policy memorandum?    [Cornelius] These are extended to Lithuania to enlarge its  fund for stabilizing the national currency. Your country will  receive this money in five installments. Lithuania received 5  percent of its quota -- $7 million -- in October of 1993. It  will get the remaining 5-percent installments if it meets  certain economic requirements.    According to the requirements that Lithuania had to fulfill  by late March of this year, another 5-percent installment must  be paid out to Lithuania in mid May, while the remaining two --  in the middle of November, and in February of 1995. Lithuania  can use this money in exceptional cases as domestic loans. Its  key goal now is to enhance our trust in the newly established  Currencies Council.    [ELTA] IMF loans directly depend on the situation in  the Lithuanian economy. How does the IMF Executive Council  assess it?    [Cornelius] Lithuania's great progress in stabilizing its  macroeconomic situation is noticeable, particularly concerning  inflation which has dropped to a monthly rate of 3-4 percent.  There are very many signs proving that the economic operation  of the state sector is reviving. Tendencies that make the  entire economy more dynamic have intensified, and the private  sector is developing and expanding rapidly.    Before the establishment of the Currencies Council,  Lithuanian banks toughened their monetary policy and noticeably  reduced inflation. The fiscal policy is also very strict, and  Lithuania's state budget is balanced. This also contributed to  the stabilization of the macroeconomic system. One must also  mention progress in terms of structure. Lithuania's move toward  reform of import and export tariffs -- when import duties were  abolished or reduced to a minimum -- is welcome. This will  enhance the level of Lithuania's economic reliability and  productivity. The replacement of the general excise tax with  the value added tax, and the establishment of the Currencies  Council will also have a favorable effect on the state budget.    In our opinion, all these prominent changes ensue from  economic progress and the correctly chosen economic policy, even  though we must remain cautious. There are some spheres,  however, on which Lithuania should focus more. These are  privatization, reform in the financial sector, and the personal  income tax.    [ELTA] The Lithuanian economic policy memorandum is  valid until the end of this year. We have heard that there are  plans to draft another program for three years.    [Cornelius] Discussions on the drafting of a new program for  Lithuania are already under way. The Lithuanian Government has  expressed a desire to draft this program according to the  so-called extended IMF loan which would embrace three years of  Lithuania's economic policy. Its key goal is to focus on  structural issues. Thus far, we have discussed general  guidelines with the Lithuanian Government, which could serve as  the basis for providing an extended loan. An IMF mission is  scheduled to arrive from Washington this Wednesday [20 Apr].  Its representatives along with the Lithuanian Government will  specify the economic policy measures that Lithuania intends to  adopt with the aim of receiving this loan.    We believe that the IMF can provide an extended loan  immediately after the term of the current economic policy  memorandum expires. However, the drafting of a new program  requires at least two IMF missions so as to discuss all the  details in developing Lithuania's economy.    [ELTA] What does the Lithuanian economy lack most of  all to make its reform more rapid?    [Cornelius] More attention should be devoted to the  so-called  structural reform and spheres that must be strengthened more  rapidly. This is reform in the financial sector, laws on the  Lithuanian Bank and commercial banks and their implementation,  and the supervision and auditing of Lithuanian banks. We would  like to see more favorable changes in privatization.  Undoubtedly, the system of taxes and their collection must be  considerably upgraded.    [ELTA] When can the IMF suspend its assistance to  Lithuania?    [Cornelius] All changes in the Lithuanian economy are  observed according to requirements that are set for each year  and its quarter. This is the requirement to possess a certain  amount of hard currency in the Lithuanian Bank, to repay foreign  debts by fixed deadlines, and to settle the fiscal deficit.  Lithuania is not allowed to possess a so-called growing debt to  foreign countries.    If these requirements were not satisfied, it is very  unlikely  that the IMF would continue its loans according to the  Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, because the IMF Executive  Council reviews and assesses a country's economic situation  before every payment. However, there is no such threat to  Lithuania.    [ELTA] The Lithuanian Government is sometimes  reprimanded for executing the principles of the economic policy  memorandum dictated by the IMF too blindly....    [Cornelius] I would like to stress that this is a program of  the Lithuanian Government rather than of the IMF economic  reform. We only assessed the economic situation in Lithuania and  proposed the IMF Executive Council to back such economic reform.  The fund has pledged to extend resources that would help to  implement the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, because the  Executive Council has noticed great economic progress and  successful reform in Lithuania. Therefore, the fear that  Lithuania is fulfilling the IMF requirements alone is unfounded.</p>

The Russian diplomat who broke  this news to INTERFAX said, however, that "the talks are  difficult and there is no telling when the remaining documents  will be signed."    The talks which are underway in the Russian Embassy in  Zagreb  center on a cease-fire and troops separation. Special envoys of  the Russian and U.S. Presidents Vitaliy Churkin and Charles  Redman are attending them as mediators as are officials of the  UN and the International Peace Conference on Former Yugoslavia.</p>

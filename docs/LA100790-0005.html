			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE LIVES: THOUGHT FOR FOOD ;  </P> <P> YOU'RE NO LONGER JUDGED BY WHAT YOU WEAR OR DRIVE; NOW IT'S WHAT YOU EAT  </P> <P> SO WHAT WILL it be? Dim sum? Greek? Mexican? Thai? Ethiopian? Punjab?  Decisions, decisions. New York Pizza? Chicago Pizza? California Pizza? A person  could starve to death in the time it takes to decide where to go to dinner.  </P> <P> It's not just a matter of having a lot of choices. Food has become everyone's  3-D Rorschach test, an edible tool for self-definition and social judgment.  </P> <P> Take my friend Katie's latest warning bell. "I never thought a man's eating  habits would affect the way I perceived him as a potential partner," says  Katie, a vegetarian. But recently she accepted an invitation to the Hollywood  Bowl. "I was doing the picnic," she says. "But when I asked what he liked, he  said, 'There's something you better know. I don't eat vegetables or fruit.' I  asked about pasta salad. He said no. Coleslaw, no. Potato salad, no. Finally, I  asked, 'Well what do you eat?' And he said, 'Meat. Just meat.' "  </P> <P> What is he, a crocodile?  </P> <P> There's always something objectionable about another person's diet. If it's not  animal fat, it's Milano cookies, or too much garlic. Or worse, it's some  politically incorrect foodstuff that anybody with half a social conscience is  boycotting. (Why do they always boycott tasty products such as tuna and grapes  instead of things I'd never miss -- such as turnips?)  </P> <P> Personally, I'm hoping for ecological sanctions against the fryer, my sworn  food enemy, which follows me wherever I go. On a recent trip to the Southwest,  it seemed that kitchens had thrown away the broiler and the conventional oven  and replaced them with giant vats of bubbling lard. "All I want is a baked  potato," I feebly insisted as the waitress recited the specials: deep-fried  chicken, chicken-fried steak, French fries, hush puppies, fritters, doughnuts.  "Have you tried the Indian fry bread?" she asked.  </P> <P> I'd also like a moratorium on restaurants that flaunt live originals of what  you're about to eat. I've learned to avert my eyes when I walk into Chinese  seafood restaurants and see the doomed fish swimming around the tank. But does  the management have to put a guy in a chicken suit beckoning outside California  Chicken Burger? Of course, it's better than in Spain, where animal legs with  hair are an essential part of the decor. I don't eat meat, but I still have  nightmares about the place in Asturias where my husband scarfed a huge plate of  cold cuts under a ceiling full of dangling carcasses.  </P> <P> "Do you have a baked potato?" I asked meekly.  </P> <P> Actually, I'm not a finicky eater compared to a lot of folks. I wouldn't dream  of issuing verbal or written instructions to prospective hosts before I go out  to lunch or dinner. I'm not kosher, hypoglycemic, an ova-lacto vegetarian, or  doing Pritikin or Optifast. And I'm not a food snob either, unlike my husband,  Duke.  </P> <P> He views eating as an grand adventure, whereas I just see it as a way to stay  alive. We could land in a foreign country late at night, after not having eaten  for 12 hours, and still Duke would troll the streets scrutinizing restaurant  menus, seeking out the peak gastronomical experience. I wouldn't dare suggest a  coffee shop.  </P> <P> "For the same price, you can have something awful or you can have something  really good," Duke says. Of course, his idea of really good is more evolved  than mine.  </P> <P> I learned this early on in our relationship. One morning, I found him standing  in my kitchen, scowling at the contents of my refrigerator. There were apples,  a pitcher of Good Earth iced tea, a tub of yogurt -- my usual food staples --  plus bagels and cream cheese that I'd bought because I knew he was coming over.  "Don't you have a red onion?" Duke asked accusingly.  </P> <P> In an effort to score gourmet points, I went to a designer produce store and  asked for the best onion God ever made. Five dollars bought a Maui onion the  size of a grapefruit, packaged in a net sheath with everything but a biography  and a diploma. Duke was mollified -- briefly. Then he started looking for the  capers.  </P> <P> These days, you can't be too much of a culinary sophisticate. "It's gotten into  regions now," my sister Laurie complains. "People who can't find Florida on a  map know the difference between Sichuan, Hunan and Mandarin."  </P> <P> Frankly, I've never awakened in the middle of the night with a hankering for  Middle Altitude Andean food. If I have to pick a restaurant, a modern day act  of courage, I automatically head for my favorite sushi or salad bar. Needless  to say, I'm not asked to pick very often.  </P> <P> "You're lucky," Laurie says. "There's nothing worse than being responsible for  a bad meal. You sit there all evening muttering lame excuses like 'I swear  there were more specials the last time.' "  </P> <P> Doesn't bother me. Just give me a baked potato.  </P></p>

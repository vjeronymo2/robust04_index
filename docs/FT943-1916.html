			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Budapest corruption inquiry Hungary's new Socialist-led government has launched an inquiry into corruption in the privatisation of state companies under the previous conservative administration. State auditors said recently only Ft78bn (Pounds 466m) of the Ft120bn in privatisation revenue projected for 1993 had been collected. The government has set up a committee, which met for the first time yesterday, to examine in particular the 320 companies whose privatisation was rushed through between April and June, just before the change of government. The Interior Ministry, which is overseeing the inquiry, said 70-80 companies were already under investigation following complaints from the public and deputies but that the number was likely to rise. Privatisation officials said typical cases of corruption involved misuse of public funds, tax fraud, under-valuation and sales to preferred purchasers.</p>

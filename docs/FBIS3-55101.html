Analysing the current political and economic situation in  Georgia, Shevardnadze listed three principal factors which he  believes should determine joint activities within the CIS  framework. These are strengthening the economy, fighting  separatist sentiments and averting a threat of dictatorship.    The Georgian leader said the Commonwealth of Independent  States is presently charged with a historical mission, and "if  all the countries work in agreement in these three directions,  if we efficiently fight these evils, all citizens of  newly-independent states will feel the goodness resulting from  our unity."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 19 Apr (INA)--The INA international affairs  editor has denied Tehran radio's report that Iraq has sent  persons to Iran to carry out acts of sabotage.    The editor said these accusations are ridiculous and part of  a tendentious media campaign against Iraq.    Tehran radio today announced that a huge explosion of a  booby- trapped car occurred in central Tehran today.    Some time after this false accusation by the Iranian  regime's  organs, REUTER and the international news media said an Islamic  group opposing the Iranian regime has claimed responsibility for  the explosion, and that this group's headquarters is in Pakistan.</p>

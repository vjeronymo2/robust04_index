			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chang Yun-yong] </F>   [Text] A new government building in which to hold  South-North talks will be built in Ilsan, Kyonggi Province in  preparation for full-fledged South-North negotiations.    In addition, large-scale construction of public projects --  such as a new airport based in the southwestern area of the  country, an international exhibition hall in Taegu Airport, a  direct Kyongju-Chonju railway, a new port in Yongil Straits of  Pohang, and new state bypasses -- will begin on a full scale  next year. At the same time, Kimpo Airport will be enlarged.    The International Vaccine Institute of the Seoul National  University and a management organization for practicing  employment insurance system will also be established next year.    The Economic Planning Board's report "Status of Major New  and Ongoing Projects for 1995," reports that government offices  are planning the above projects for next year.    According to this report, the National Unification Board  plans to build a large government building in which to hold  South-North dialogue in Ilsan with a total fund of 80.2 billion  won in preparation for future activated South-North dialogue  because the existing South-North dialogue office located in  Samchong-tong, Seoul is too small and on lease.    The Ministry of Transportation will survey the propriety of  building a new airport in the southwestern area with the people  of Muan, South Cholla Province, where it will likely be built.  Next year it will also begin full-scale construction of various  public projects, including state bypasses, which will be  completed by 2000 and for which a total fund of 6,509 billion  won will be invested.</p>

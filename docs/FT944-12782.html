			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Observer in Lebanon: Cool by name Beirut's only English language publication, the weekly magazine Monday Morning, is a little turgid, leavened by the occasional titbit. 'A lively, blue-eyed glance, an infectious laugh, aristocratic manners - such is the European Union's head of delegation' (actually charge d'affaires) 'in Beirut, Harold Cool.' Cool, a Belgian, apparently likes wearing a cloak in winter, while 'in summer he carries, quite unabashed, a scarlet red fan. 'I acquired the habit when I was posted to Africa. It was so hot that I took a fancy to it.' '</p>

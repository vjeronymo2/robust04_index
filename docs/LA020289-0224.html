Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> STATE BOXING OFFICIAL ON LEAVE PENDING INVESTIGATION'S OUTCOME  </P> <P> ing official Martin Denkin lost his power to approve or turn down bouts in  California when he was placed on administrative leave today by the state  Consumer Affairs Department.  </P> <P> Denkin, assistant executive officer of the state Athletic Commission, will  remain on leave pending the outcome of a Los Angeles County district attorney's  investigation into accusations of extortion, said Shirley Chilton, secretary of  state and consumer services.  </P> <P> The action came less than a week after the San Jose Mercury News reported that  Denkin is being investigated for allegedly extorting money from boxing managers  in return for furthering the careers of their fighters.  </P> <P> Chilton, a member of Gov. George Deukmejian's Cabinet, has authority over the  Consumer Affairs Department, which oversees the Athletic Commission.  </P> <P> Neil Fippin, chief of the division of administration for the Consumer Affairs  Department, said Denkin will continue to receive a salary. Denkin is also being  investigated by the Consumer Affairs Department.  </P> <P> "Not one person yet has faced me," Denkin told the Mercury News in a telephone  interview from his home outside Los Angeles. "I've been crucified throughout  the world."  </P> <P> Denkin also said the leave will allow him to rest. "I'm physically sapped by  the work I've been doing," he said.  </P> <P> Denkin has supervised the commission's office and staff in Los Angeles since  1986.  </P></p>

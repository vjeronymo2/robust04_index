			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>   Johannesburg Bomb Blast `Bloody Madness' -- "Madness. Sheer,  bloody madness" is how Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 25  April in its page-6 editorial describes the bomb blast in  central Johannesburg on 24 April. "Since the explosion was near  both the ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional  and Pan-Africanist Congress offices, we can safely assume that  it was intended as an attack on one of them, probably the ANC."  Ultimately, the explosion was "a futile" deed since "the  election will go on. Nothing will stop it."  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   `Wild Men' of Right Need To Be Addressed After Election --  Referring to the bomb explosions that have shaken the country  since Sunday, 24 April, Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 26  April in a page-18 editorial says: "We should have expected the  merciless actions of the wild men of the Right. Now that this  stage is upon us, let it not drag the country off its momentous  course." Firstly, the bombers should be tracked down and  brought to justice. Secondly, they should be made to understand  that "they achieve nothing." "There is a belief among such  people that they can blast their way to the future security they  seek. In reality, they do the reverse." "Reason cannot speak  to the wild men themselves; but it can speak to their families  and friends, the confidantes and advisers upon whose tacit  support the bombers depend." In conclusion, the paper warns "it  is clear that the concerns of the right wing -- both inside and  out of the constitution -- have not been met. We have,  miraculously, come to this election without them. In the early  aftermath, our leaders must turn with utmost sincerity to  finding the rightists, too, a place in the sun."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Bomb Blasts; FF Needs To be Addressed After Election --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 26 April in a page-16  editorial says the rash of bomb blasts since 24 April should be  viewed as "a desperate but doomed last ditch flourish  perpetrated by a dying movement." BUSINESS DAY believes the  "dissident, non-participating right wing has been reduced to two  groups. First there is a small coterie of ineffectual CP  [Conservative Party] politicians, centred on Ferdi Hartzenberg.  Second is the more dangerous -- though often clownish -- group  of shadowy mini-armies, numbering perhaps a thousand  individuals. Given effective police intelligence work, this  guerrilla threat is far from unmanagable. Compared to the now  disappearing prospect of civil war in Natal, the bombers are a  minor problem." South Africa faces a period of "vicious though  limited terrorism" which may intimidate voters, but the best  response would be to "go out and vote in the new South Africa.  The more these brutal elements are isolated, the better." The  government is also warned "not to treat the Freedom Front  lightly once the election is over. To do so would invite a  mushrooming of the dangerous right."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Bomb Blasts Attempt To Cause `Panic' -- We are outraged at  the senseless killing of innocent people through the use of car  bombs," declares a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 26 April. "We urge our people to make it their  business to go out and vote instead of being frightened off by  these enemies of progress. They are out to cause as much panic  and fear as they can to disrupt the elections. The opposite  will in fact become the truth."  <H8>  CITY PRESS </H8>   ANC's Mandela `Head and Shoulders' Above Other Parties --  "We, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and  the world to know that as from Wednesday [27 April] a truly new  South Africa will be born," declares a front-page editorial in  Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 24 April. "While there  are many men and women of vision who made this day possible, ANC  President Nelson Mandela undoubtedly stands head and shoulders  above all who finally took us to this glorious and momentous  day. We thank God almighty. Let us go to the polls on  Wednesday and vote for a party we can trust with our lives."</p>

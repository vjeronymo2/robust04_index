			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Bishop at the heart of the struggle: Roots of Mexico's revolt Hailed by some as a saviour of Mexican tribal people, and attacked by others as subversive radical, Bishop Samuel Ruiz of San Cristobal de las Casas has emerged as the central figure in the search for a negotiated solution to the uprising in the southern state of Chiapas. A short man with thick glasses and grey hair, and fluent in tribal languages, Monsignor Ruiz has been bishop at San Cristobal for the past 34 years. His passionate fight for the rights of indigenous people has pitted him against the government, powerful local landlords and - most recently - the country's conservative Catholic hierarchy. Over the years, Bishop Ruiz, 69, has filled his diocese with a team of radical priests, deacons and lay teachers fervently committed to the welfare of indigenous people. A close-knit group which likes to communicate by private radio, the bishop's followers are the most organised and powerful force in the Chiapas indigenous community. The federal government, which first attacked Bishop Ruiz for fuelling the uprising, now sees his co-operation as critical to a long-term solution. Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the government's new commissioner for peace in the area, last Friday accepted him as the mediator with the rebel Zapatista guerrillas. The bishop was nearly removed just two months ago. Mr Girolama Prigione, the conservative papal nuncio in Mexico City, alleged that the diocese of San Cristobal was 'full of friction - and not just now, but for the past 20 years, because Don Samuel Ruiz is responsible for grave pastoral, doctrinal and government errors that conflict with the ministry of the church and offend the Pope,' according to reports in newspapers. The nuncio's demand for Bishop Ruiz's resignation was widely held to have been pushed by Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, a hardliner and then the interior minister. He is a former governor of the state of Chiapas. The resignation demand brought protest letters from abroad and vociferous opposition from the tribal people whom Bishop Ruiz has defended. Now that the pacification of the rebels has become Mexico's top priority, the bishop's position is secure. He has been endorsed by the country's leading bishops; Mr Gonzalez was asked to resign last Monday. The bishop's radical views and his group's influence across the region has raised questions over his involvement in the uprising. Many find it difficult to believe that a group so well connected in the local community could not have participated in the revolt. Bishop Ruiz, while denying any involvement with the rebels, has called the Chiapas uprising a 'historic opportunity' to address the oppression of impoverished indigenous people. In his sermon last Sunday, he referred to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation as 'brother insurgents'. 'Samuel Ruiz, like any revolutionary, has a way of thinking. It is not Christian. It is the ideology of a revolutionary Christ, a fighting Christ,' says Mr Gustavo Armendaris, a prominent businessmen and former minister in the Chiapas state government, reflecting the view of many well-off people in San Cristobal. 'He tells the Indians that we stole the land from their fathers and grandfathers. He has stirred them up.' Soon after the uprising, the local state government stated that the 'first-hand versions from residents in Ococingo and Las Margaritas indicate that some Catholic priests and their deacons are tied in with the rebels and help them with the system of radio communication from the San Cristobal diocese.' In the coffee town of El Bosque, two hours drive from San Cristobal, the local authorities arrested and jailed several lay preachers who they believed were planning an attack on the town. These work under Father Herve Camier, a bearded and bespectacled French priest who supports liberation theology. Mr Julio Cesar Gonzalez, the town mayor, said: 'We began to hear rumours that people were going to arrive from the villages where they back liberation theology and start a revolt, so we started to organise ourselves, and put the (lay preachers) in jail. 'A few hours later, hundreds of them came running with machetes, knives and sticks, and freed the prisoners.' Fr Camier dismisses such accusations, but says of the rebellion: 'It is legitimate if the results compensate for the loss of life. We would not choose this road but we do not judge those who do.' He says the catechists - mainly indigenous lay people - may have kept their support for the rebels from the priests, so as not to compromise their superiors. In another town, the local priest, who preferred not to be named, sympathised more explicitly with the rebels: 'They felt that the only answer to their problems was to take up arms. They put on a military outfit and declared war. It was their solution and it was a legal one.'</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Sunday trading row looms for MPs GOVERNMENT ministers are bracing themselves for fresh controversy over Sunday trading as the issue is expected to return to the Commons within the next year, Alison Smith and Ivor Owen write. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, told MPs yesterday that there was a 'real possibility' that the judgment by the European Court of Justice on whether existing UK law was in conflict with that of the European Community would result in the Commons having to decide the matter. The European court ruling is expected early next year. In that event, he said, the government would have to 'face up to all the arguments'. In spite of pressure from some Tory MPs, Mr Clarke refused to be drawn on whether the government would introduce a measure or how it would handle any legislation. One option being considered is organising a debate that would enable MPs to express a view on how present restrictions should be revised, and then incorporating in legislation the approach that had the widest support. While the original question would probably be the subject of a free vote - so that MPs could make their decision without intervention from party whips  -that decision might then be adopted as government policy and be enforced by a three-line whip. Ministers remain acutely conscious of the sensitivities of revising the Sunday trading laws. Mr Clarke recalled yesterday that the move to full deregulation introduced by the Thatcher government was rejected on second reading by the Commons after it had been approved by the Lords. The government hopes to spell out its course of action before MPs debate the 'Keep Sunday Special' trading bill proposed by Mr Ray Powell, a Labour MP sponsored by Usdaw, the shopworkers' union. However, the earliest decision from the European court is likely to be in February or March next year - about the same time as Mr Powell's bill is due to be debated. Mr Clarke said that he appreciated that the controversy cut across party lines. He underlined the complexity of solutions based on provision being made for the sale of certain types of goods, or of trade being restricted to specified times. 'We want a law under which all retailers can compete on level terms,' he stressed.</p>

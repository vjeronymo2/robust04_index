			<p>BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], has told the MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION AGENCY,  AIM, that he could ask for the UN Security Council to intervene  if the General Peace Accord's Supervision and Control Commission  [CSC] does not resolve the problems allegedly arising from the  preparations of the October elections.    AIM cites Dhlakama as saying the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo] is already involved in fraud, and his organization is  worried about and will refer the matter to the CSC. Dhlakama  added if the CSC cannot resolve the problem, Renamo will write  to the Security Council asking it to deal with the matter. The  Renamo leader alleged that fraud began when electoral  registration teams included Frelimo Party members instead of  ordinary Mozambicans as had been planned. Dhlakama also accused  the government of not providing food to members of the  opposition parties monitoring the registration of voters.    Meanwhile, Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana says Dhlakama's  accusations are worrisome because they cast serious doubts over  the National Elections Commission's role.    Jose Estevao Muchine, director of the Elections  Administration Technical Secretariat, said Dhlakama is not  telling the truth. Muchine said electoral arrangements are being  jointly made with Renamo and other party officials, adding that  the Secretariat has never received reports of such allegations.</p>

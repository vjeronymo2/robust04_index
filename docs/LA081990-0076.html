			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 15 SHIITE TERRORISTS ESCAPED FROM KUWAIT JAIL, EX-INMATE CLAIMS  </P> <P> A Lebanese Shiite Muslim who claims he escaped from prison in Kuwait during  Iraq's invasion said Saturday that 15 convicted terrorists linked to kidnapers  in Lebanon also fled from jail.  </P> <P> Earlier, unconfirmed reports speculated that the 15 had been taken to Baghdad.  </P> <P> A pro-Iranian Shiite faction in Lebanon, Islamic Jihad, which has been holding  Americans Terry A. Anderson and Thomas Sutherland for more than five years, had  demanded the release of the 15 prisoners in return for freeing the two  Americans.  </P> <P> The Lebanese who said he escaped, Abdulaziz Krayyem, said he was imprisoned in  1985 on charges of cooperating with the 15, mostly Iraqi Shiites, who were  convicted in the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait as  well as Kuwaiti installations.  </P> <P> Krayyem said he was among 1,600 prisoners who overpowered their guards and  escaped when they heard about the invasion. He said the 15 were among those who  got out.  </P> <P> "I saw them climbing into taxicabs with Kuwaiti plate numbers," which then sped  away, Krayyem said. "That's all I saw."  </P> <P> However, the report could not be independently verified.  </P> <P> Krayyem said he has no idea of the current whereabouts of the 15.  </P> <P> He said he hid out for 10 days with Kuwaiti inmates who got their families to  collect them after the jailbreak. The Lebanese Embassy issued a new passport  for him, and he joined a car convoy sponsored by the embassy that passed  through Saudi Arabia, then Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, he said.  </P> <P> Krayyem, 35, arrived Friday in his hometown of Yater, 56 miles south of Beirut.  </P> <P> Krayyem said "chaos broke out immediately" after Kuwaiti prison guards told the  inmates about the invasion.  </P> <P> "The prisoners started shouting at the guards," he said. "The guards fired at  them, killing an Iraqi and an Afghan prisoner.  </P> <P> "After a few hours of fighting with the guards, the prisoners were able to  occupy the prison and overthrow the guards."  </P></p>

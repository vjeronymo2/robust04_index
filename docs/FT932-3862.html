			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait stands aside from Opec deal to roll over output ceiling MINISTERS OF the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in Geneva, last night agreed to roll over the official output ceiling but were forced to leave Kuwait outside the agreement. The emirate will thus be free to go ahead with its plan to raise its production by 400,000 barrels a day, putting more pressure on the depressed oil market. Earlier in the day, as ministers tried to battle out a compromise that would give a positive signal to the market, Kuwait came under increasing pressure to back down on its demand for a large increase in its share of Opec oil production. The insistence by Mr Ali Ahmed al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister, that the emirate see a rise in its share of output to 2m b/d from the present 1.6m b/d had already weakened prices. But Mr al-Baghli had his hands tied by Kuwait's newly-elected parliament, which was committed to a quota increase. Iran headed the opposing camp and was strongly resisting any increase in production because of price weakness. At the same time, Tehran was reluctant to agree to a deal that would set a precedent for giving one country preferential treatment. Behind a lot of the negotiating lay the fear that any precedent set at the meeting could be exploited by Iraq when it returned to production. Fears over Iraq's re-entry into the market had also prompted ministers to push for a high market share now so that they could cut back from as high a level as possible when Baghdad returned. Iran was not alone in resisting a production increase for Kuwait but others such as Venezuela and Nigeria were prepared to tolerate a moderate rise of 140,000 b/d to 170,000 b/d. Kuwait, however, was making no concessions on its demands, which meant that the emirate ended by being left out of the final agreement. That is likley to weaken sentiment in the market and push prices down, but any fall could be shortlived. Mr Vahan Zanoyan, senior director at the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington suggested before the meeting closed that with a good agreement, West Texas prices would swiftly rise up to Dollars 20.50 to Dollars 21 a barrel until the first signs that the agreement was not holding and then they would slip. But with a bad agreement, he said, prices would fall initially to Dollars 19 (from the present level of about Dollars 19.60 a barrel) and stay there. 'It's just a question of where the psychology takes you before it brings you back to earth,' he explained. A Saudi Arabian official said the kingdom was 'strongly committed' to the agreement and added that it believed that 'everyone will respect it". Output is already running much higher than the 23.582m b/d ceiling at 24.2m b/d and analysts believe it will rise still further to touch 24.8m b/d in the third quarter. Prices are unlikely to rise substantially in coming months and North Sea Brent crude oil is trading at Dollars 18.30 a barrel with not much lift in sight. While oil demand in the Far East remains strong, European consumption has shown few signs of picking up and US demand looks more uncertain. The market fundamentals will keep the pressure mounting for Opec's ministers.</p>

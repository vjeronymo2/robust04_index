			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME WALTZES TO 28-0 WIN  </P> <P> What can we say of North Hollywood's home opener against powerful Notre Dame  High on Friday night?  </P> <P> Well, they've installed some nice, new lights at the field. Which is  significant, considering that the dim, yellow lighting in the past made it  difficult to read a game program, much less a pass pattern.  </P> <P> And about the game itself?  </P> <P> Hey, those lights are really nice.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the Huskies, though, the lights exposed to all present an  outmanned and overmatched North Hollywood team that, try as it might, could do  little in a 28-0 loss to Notre Dame.  </P> <P> And try the Huskies did, outhitting the Knights at every turn with an  aggressive, angry defense.  </P> <P> Alas, such defensive emotion translated into little offensively as North  Hollywood (0-2) finished the evening still scoreless in 1989.  </P> <P> Notre Dame (3-0), meanwhile, was resting its starters by the fourth quarter.  They were not, however, resting on any laurels.  </P> <P> "We played lackluster," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said. "But North  Hollywood played us tough. They hit hard."  </P> <P> Having that relayed to him, Husky Coach Fred Grimes sadly pointed at the  scoreboard. But that's just the coach in him.  </P> <P> The Huskies just flat couldn't match up with the bigger, more skilled Knights  -- especially tailback Errol Small, who rushed for 108 yards in 21 carries, and  quarterback Greg Andrachick, who completed six of 12 for 128 yards.  </P> <P> Despite North Hollywood's efforts to concentrate on Small, the senior tailback  was able to run for three first-half touchdowns on runs of three, two and six  yards.  </P> <P> Two Notre Dame turnovers near the end zone -- Husky defensive back Larawn Moore  intercepted a pass at the 13-yard line and recovered a fumble at the 17-yard  line -- allowed North Hollywood to trail only 21-0 at halftime.  </P> <P> Andrachick hit Kirk Miller with a 57-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter  to close out the scoring.  </P></p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: NFC shock A profits warning from NFC together with the shock resignation of the company's chief executive sent shares in the freight group tumbling in heavy volume. By the close, the shares were down 14 1/2 at 185 1/2 p, making it the day's biggest retreat among FT-SE 100 constituents while turnover of 15m shares made it the most heavily traded stock of the day. Analysts downgraded full year forecasts for the group by around Pounds 10m to Pounds 110m after third quarter profits of Pounds 76.6m fell short of expectations of around Pounds 80m. NFC also disappointed the market in June with lower than expected interim figures. The resignation of the chief executive after only 18 months in the job took the market by surprise but market watchers welcomed the decision of Mr Robbie Burn, the head of the group's UK transport and logistics arm, to withdraw his resignation. One analyst said: 'This is all a bit of a shock but I believe the management changes at NFC will counter the negative impact of the lower than expected figures.' Shares in leisure group Thorn EMI recovered from early lows to close 9 down at 1054p, on volume of 2.2m, after the company reported an 18 per cent decline in first quarter figures. Profits fell Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 40.4m and dealers moved quickly to sell the stock sending the shares to a low of 1046p. However, later in the day, the spotlight moved away from the headline profit figure and analysts focused on the 25 per cent increase in operating profits, helping the shares claw back some of the earlier losses. Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court commented: 'The underlying figures and statement are encouraging but the shares have had a good run.' An analysts tour of some of the group's operations begins next week. Tobacco group Rothmans International shed 9 to 393p as Smith New Court issued a bearish note in the light of a price war in Australia. The securities house estimated that the potential lost profits from the Australian situation amounted to five per cent of the group's total. Worries about property prices following the Hong Kong government's decision to pull one of its land auctions sent Hong Kong related stocks lower yesterday. HSBC fell 8 to 710p and Cable &amp; Wireless slipped to 455p but rallied to close 2 off at 460p. Barclays was actively traded as Hoare Govett pushed a bullish line on the bank's prospects. The house believes that the bank has some Pounds 20bn in low profit lending which it wants to cut out or restructure. The argument is that much of the cash will be liberated in the form of higher dividends and possibly a share buy back. Hoare predicts a 25 per cent rise in the dividend every year for the next few years. The shares rose 2 to 568p with volume heavy at 9.3m. Composite insurer Commercial Union lifted 7 to 547p as Smith New Court reiterated its long-term buy recommendation on the stock. The house believes that although the purchase of Groupe Victoire will knock CU's asset value down to 580p a share initially the NAV will rise 2 per cent a year more than it would have done previously as a result of the acquisition. A weak oil price was countered by optimism over refining margins and, in the case of Shell Transport, over the dividend. Shell is to announce its first half dividend on September 15. Because of the weakness of sterling against the Dutch guilder it could, according to some analysts, boost its UK payout by 16 per cent. It is unlikely to be that high but some houses were apparently mooting the idea of rises as high as 12 per cent - the current prejudice remains in favour of 8 per cent. Shell improved 4 to 718p while BP was firm at 406p. Chemicals group Courtaulds slipped 6 to 527p as institutional investors reacted to a cautious note from BZW. The investment bank argues that the hope value invested in Tencel, the company's new fibre, was already discounted by the shares' 27 per cent premium to the FT-A All Share Index. A clutch of broker's recommendations powered industrial group Charter, which on Monday declared its bid for welding equipment supplier Esab unconditional. The group is expected to win the 90 per cent acceptances it needs to achieve a complete takeover. The shares jumped 26 to 796p, with Kleinwort Benson and NatWest Securities among brokers recommending the shares. British Steel put 4 3/4 to 155p, after stainless steel group Avesta Sheffield, its Swedish joint venture, returned to profit in the first half of the year. Holiday group Airtours had a volatile day. The shares were down 15 early in the session on rumours that the group was about to issue a profits warning. Calls to the company from anxious dealers and analysts met with a 'no comment' reply which initially increased the market worries. However, mid-session bargain hunters started a recovery and, together with the dismissal of the early rumours by many analysts, the shares closed 4 ahead at 449p. The early negative sentiment weakened rival Owners Abroad which gave up 1 1/2 to 104 1/2 p. Printing group Wace jumped 16 to 270p after announcing interim profits up 57 per cent.</p>

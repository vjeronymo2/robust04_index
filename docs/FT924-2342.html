			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Drink: Wonderful whisky - and cheese tasting of old tyres - You can eat and drink well in Orkney, says Giles MacDonogh, but you have to know where to look ORKNEY has been in the news a lot this year, and for all the wrong reasons. If you can bear the caprices of the weather it can be a pretty good place. During the day at least, Kirkwall buzzes and St Magnus has a surprisingly magnificent, red sandstone, romanesque cathedral. If you prefer something older, there is the eery Neolithic tomb at Maes Brae or the prehistoric village at Skara Brae on the west coast. Nor is Orkney to be sneezed at for its food and drink. Meat is good here. As the old saying goes the Orcadians were farmers with boats while the Shetlanders were fishermen with crofts. There is delicious lamb from South Ronaldsay (though not quite the equal of Shetland lamb - possibly the best in the British Isles) and excellent beef. Much of the cheese is disappointing - as one Orcadian told me: 'Orcadians like a good squeaky cheese.' By 'squeaky cheese' they mean Dunlop. Nine times out of ten I would prefer to chew the homonymous tyre than a Dunlop cheese. Fortunately for the islanders Mrs Hilda Seator (tel: 0856-76318) makes a simple, lightly pressed curd cheese from raw milk on her farm at Grimbister in Firth. The cheese is sold in its natural state or flavoured with chives, garlic or walnuts. It is best from May to October. On the site of the old airfield in Kirkwall, Bill Jolly and his sister, Liz Johnson, run a smokehouse which uses a traditional cure and kiln (tel: 085687- 2417.) Orkney also possesses a good restaurant; the most northerly to receive a full entry in this year's Good Food Guide. The Creel (tel: 085683-311) is in St Margaret's Hope on South Ronaldsay. It is approached by crossing one of the 'Churchill Barriers' constructed by Italian POWs during the war to keep marauding German U-boats out of Scapa. In their spare time the Italians built the charming Roman Catholic chapel on Lamb Holm. At The Creel Alan Craigie produces a remarkably soignee menu using the best of the islands' produce. The evening I dined there we had an exquisite fish soup and some rather under-hung teal. One of Caraigie's specialities is the 'bere bannocks' he makes from Orkney 'bere' barley. He needs to pay a little more attention to his wine list. The restaurant opens only on Friday and Saturday from November to March. There are rooms. If all this were not enough, Orkney has the Raven Brewery making real ales and two distilleries: Allied's Scapa and Matthew Gloag's Highland Park. Scapa's production is minute and mostly used for blending, though Gordon &amp; Macphail bottled a 1979 (Pounds 20.59 from Augustus Barnett) which has a light, creamy style. Bottles of Scapa tend to lurk round the back of the fruit cordials in Orkney pubs, while the rival Highland Park rides high on the optics. The whisky has a distinct, 'island' character largely as a result of the heavy peating of the malt produced from the distillery's own kilns. Unlike most of the other Scottish distilleries, which still kiln a part of their malt requirements, Highland Park uses manual labour to turn the damp barley. It is notoriously backbreaking work and after days at work with a spade the workers get a particular form of cramp called 'malt monkey.' I took a turn with the spade and decided it was not for me. It was more pleasant to stand with the malt in the kiln - until I came out smelling like a kipper. Highland Park kilns about 20 per cent of its malt and that part represents the only malt to lend its smokey 'phenolic' character to the whisky. The rest of the malt comes in from the mainland. Having so much barley lying around makes the distillery prey to rodents. Highland Park fights them off with three cats called Peat, Malt and Barley. At Laphroaig on the island of Islay they claim the job is done by a family of stoats. Highland Park's stills are rather squat. The distillery manager Jim Robertson, caught me giving them the once over: '. . . and we haven't got the lightest and blandest whisky either,' he quipped. The whisky is run off at a comparatively low alcoholic degree, giving a richer, more 'phenolic' character. A certain amount of sherry wood houses the young spirit to round it off with some fruit notes. Highland Park's bread and butter is the 12-year-old (Pounds 19.99 from Oddbins) a superbly balanced malt with just a hint of peat behind the heathery nose. For around Pounds 80 a bottle, Highland Park releases a small amount of 1967  -retailed through specialists only. It has a far heavier peat character, a touch of seaweed overlaying the crystallised fruit and heather, and excellent proof against the vagaries of the Orkney weather.</p>

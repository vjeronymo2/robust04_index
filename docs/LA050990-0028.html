			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The renaming of UC San Diego's Third College for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther  King Jr. will be proposed to campus governing authorities, it was announced  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The college, one of five that make up the undergraduate program at UCSD, was  established in 1970 out of the caldron of 1960s political activism, with the  goal of setting a more socially conscious academic agenda for students.  </P> <P> The current name reflects the college's position as the third established at  UCSD, after Revelle and Muir colleges.  </P> <P> Third College Provost Cecil Lytle, who oversees the curriculum requirements for  the college's 3,000 students, has been eager for a name change to symbolize  more closely the college's academic philosophy.  </P> <P> The selection of King's name resulted from several months of meetings among  students and faculty associated with the college, and after students selected  the name of the slain civil rights leader during an advisory vote during  student elections last month.  </P> <P> The recommendation will now go to a university committee that advises UCSD  Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson on names for all campus buildings and programs.  Should Atkinson approve the change, he will submit King's name to the statewide  UC Board of Regents for final approval.  </P></p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hewlett buys minicomputer unit from Texas Instruments HEWLETT-PACKARD is to acquire Texas Instruments' minicomputer business in a bid to expand its customer base in the commercial Unix minicomputer market. The companies said they have signed a letter of intent and expect to complete the transaction this autumn. Terms of the deal were not revealed. However, the annual revenues of the TI business unit are said to be about Dollars 200m, according to industry estimates. TI said the unit had operated profitably for the past two quarters. 'This is the latest step in our strategy to aggressively expand our position in the commercial Unix market,' said Mr Lewis Platt, H-P executive vice-president. H-P is the leader in the Unix minicomputer market. The acquisition will enable H-P to accelerate sales in a slow growth market by tapping into TI's base of 125,000 customers worldwide and gaining access to market segments such as retail and wholesale distribution in which it has not previously participated. Also attractive to H-P is TI's network of value added resellers (VARs). TI has traditionally sold its computer systems almost exclusively through VARs that include leaders in vertical markets such as car dealerships, services, and health care. H-P said that there is very little overlap between its own customer base and that of TI, so it expects the acquisition to provide incremental business. The planned sale give Texas Instruments an opportunity to focus more sharply on its key businesses. The electronics and semiconductor manufacturer will, however, retain other parts of its information technology group. H-P said it will continue to support TI's minicomputer products and will offer the products for as long as there is market demand. The company's goal, however, is to gradually transfer TI's customers to H-P minicomputers. The acquisition will lead to layoffs. H-P plans to employ approximately 450 of the 1,600 employees currently working for the TI computer systems and services business unit. Mr John White, TI vice-president and president of TI's information technology group, said: 'The planned sales is consistent with TI's strategy in information technology to concentrate our investment and emphasis on software productivity tools, as well as on hardware where we have a sustainable competitive advantage.' Mr Bert Roberts, 49, was yesterday named chairman of MCI Communications, the US long-distance carrier. Mr Roberts, who was named chief executive of the company in December, succeeds Mr William McGowan, who died on June 8.</p>

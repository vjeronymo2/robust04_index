			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / People: Adman turns to leisure Reorganisation within Granada's leisure division brings in Roger Mavity from the advertising world to run one of the two new divisions, Granada Leisure Development, comprising hotels, theme parks/tour operations, and UK and Irish travel businesses. Mavity, 47, had built up his own advertising agency Mavity Gilmore, the bulk of which he sold to FCA Group in 1988. He stayed on, however, until the end of last year as chairman of FCA Mavity, running the UK business, and also sitting on the international board. But his years in the business had increasingly convinced him that 'advertising is not the solution to every problem', and he also felt ready, after running his own show, to work within a larger group. Charles Allen, recently appointed chief executive of the leisure operation, is a fellow Irishman and colleague, from their days at Compass, of Gerry Robinson, the Granada boss. He had got to know Mavity when the latter had done some assignments for him at Compass, and had been struck by his combination of 'management ability, sales and marketing know-how and entrepreneurial skills. They don't normally come together in one person,' remarks Allen. At the same time, John Williams, chief executive of Granada Studio Tours, becomes managing director of Granada theme parks and hotels. Starting out as a management trainee at the Horserace Betting Levy Board, he managed Sandown Park before joining Granada Television in 1978.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> POLICE RESPONSE FEE FOR FALSE ALARMS HIKED TO $300  </P> <P> The cost of a false alarm just went up.  </P> <P> Long Beach officials Tuesday nearly tripled the fee charged to home and  business owners when their alarms are mistakenly set off. The fee increased  from $104 to $300.  </P> <P> Police begin charging a fee for each false alarm after the fourth one. They do  not charge for the first four false alarms within a 12-month period.  </P> <P> The fee had not been increased in five years, "and, thus, has not kept pace  with the increase in associated response costs," Police Chief Lawrence Binkley  wrote in a memo to the City Council.  </P></p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Tokyo share values drop to six-year low: Stock market fall puts pressure on Japanese government to buoy sentiment THE TOKYO stock market yesterday fell below the 15,000 level of the Nikkei index, sending share values to their lowest since March 1986 and prompting renewed government efforts to buoy sentiment. At morning ministerial press conferences - after reportedly heated cabinet discussions - it was announced that measures to provide indirect support to the market were under consideration. However, this was not enough to draw buyers back into the market. The Nikkei average of 225 leading companies, on the decline for four sessions in a row, ended 243.78 points lower at 14,822.56. Shortly after opening this morning the index had gained about 50 points. Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, held out the prospect of help to financial institutions in unwinding problem loans. Land held by them as collateral could be included in government purchases of sites for public works projects, he suggested. Mr Hata has been under fire from within the ruling Liberal Democratic party over his ministry's allegedly tardy response to weakness in the economy and property and equity markets. This prompted calls by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, for ministries to put aside sectional interests in formulating autumn measures to stimulate growth. News on the economy yesterday remained negative. The Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said private sector machinery orders for June, excluding those placed by the shipping and electric power industries, were down 19.2 per cent from a year earlier and 3.2 per cent below the May figure. The EPA forecast that machinery orders would be up 9 per cent in the current quarter compared to the April-June period, which had shown a 17.9 per cent fall against the previous three months. This would, however, still leave order levels 14.3 per cent below the third quarter of last year. In another measure of a sluggish manufacturing sector, June use of electricity by Japanese industry, according to preliminary figures from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), was down 2.3 per cent from June last year, the fourth month in a row demand had fallen. Mr Kozo Watanabe, Miti minister, said the structure of Japanese industry had to be strengthened and went as far as disclosing his staff had given up their summer holiday to prepare such measures. Mr Robert Feldman, economist at Salomon Bros in Tokyo, said: 'The government has begun some serious work on fiscal support, but it's a few months too late.' Stock market turnover moderated to 190m shares from Monday's 200m, and some comfort was drawn from a slowing in the slide by market leader Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. NTT shares closed at Y465,000 (Pounds 1,914), another record low, but the fall of Y2,000 was modest compared with a Y42,000 fall the day before. Mr Hideo Watanabe, posts and telecommunications minister, hinted that the utility might be allowed to diversify. He added the ministry was also considering using income from its postal savings and life assurance services to invest in equities. Editorial Comment, Page 16</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] Mr. Sombat Uitrakun, director of the Zone 11  Environmental Health Center in Surat Thani Province, said that  analyses of water samples taken from the Tapi River in 1990  showed that the water in the river was suitable for consumption.  But the water first had to be treated to kill the bacteria and  improve the quality of the water as usual. Also, the water could  be used for piscicultural activities and for water sports.    But water samples taken during the period 1991-1993 have  shown that the quality of the water in the Tapi River has  declined to dangerous levels. Today, the river is suitable for  communications only. In some sections, officials found heavy  metals such as lead and chromium. For example, at the Tha Thong  dock, the lead level was 0.16 milligrams per liter, and the  chromium level was 0.34 milligrams per liter. At the municipal  dock, the lead level was 0.06 milligrams per liter, and the  chromium level was 0.14 milligrams per liter. Even though these  metals were not found everywhere along the river and even though  the amounts found were small, this could pose a danger. If more  and more such metals are released into the river, the river will  become polluted, and this will destroy the ecological system.    Mr. Sombat said that the reason why the Tapi River is  becoming more and more polluted is that the people who live  along the banks of the river throw their garbage into the river,  farmers are using pesticides, and some industrial factories are  secretly releasing untreated waste water into the river. Besides  this, waste materials from auto repair shops and from battery  plants also drain into the river. Another reason is that there  has been a lack of urban planning concerning treating waste  water before it is released. [passage omitted]</p>

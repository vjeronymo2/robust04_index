			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Tighter watch on projects urged The Overseas Development Administration could improve its management of UK programme aid to developing countries to ensure greater value for money, says the National Audit Office, the parliamentary watchdog. Reporting yesterday on the disbursement of programme aid to four African countries between 1987 and 1993, the NAO urged the development administration to consider 'more timely' completion of reports, the setting of more specific targets and swifter payment of aid to countries meeting their reform programmes. Since 1987 the administration has spent Pounds 914m on programme aid, which is intended to smooth the introduction of economic restructuring programmes agreed with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Most of the aid has gone to Africa. The NAO examined prog-ramme aid devoted to Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia, which between them account-ed for more than half the aid given to Africa over the six years. It concluded that new safeguards to ensure better value for money in procurement spending had achieved only 'mixed' success where governments were reimbursed with foreign exchange, and needed to be tightened. According to the office, two-thirds of the aid was not tied to UK or other suppliers. The Overseas Development Administration believes that the untying of aid was generally beneficial to the UK 'because British exporters win a significant share of African business'. Overall, the NAO concluded that 'no fully satisfactory' method existed for judging the value of programme aid.</p>

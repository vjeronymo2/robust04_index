			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By AL-JUMHURIYAH correspondent in Khartoum] </F>   [Excerpt] Sudanese Culture and Information Minister  'Abd-al- Basit Sabdarat has said Sudan will never change its  principled position toward Iraq because Iraq's cause is fair.  In a statement to the AL-JUMHURIYAH correspondent in Khartoum,  the Sudanese minister said the economic sanctions on the lofty  Iraq are eroding, thanks to the great and historic leadership of  President Saddam Husayn. He said the recent Security Council  resolution is neither fair nor legal, adding that it is enough  to say that France, Russia, China, and some other states did not  approve of the final statement.    Sabdarat praised the steadfastness of the Iraqi people in  the  face of aggression and blockade, stressing that there is an  unusual chemistry in the structure of the Iraqi people, whose  achievements under the siege are greater than under normal  circumstances. I do not believe any other people under the same  pressure and siege could have achieved what the Iraqis have  achieved. The Sudanese information minister said the most  important achievement of the Iraqi leadership was that it  prevented any fragmentation of the country, as was planned, and  that the national structure and unity of Iraq was maintained.  He added that the most important achievement of the people of  Iraq is their rallying around the historic leadership of  President Saddam Husayn.    The Sudanese minister said the blockade will collapse now  that the Iraqis have quickly adapted themselves to the imposed  conditions and developments and become a great giant through  their great and historic achievements.

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Clinton acts to revive Uruguay Round talks PRESIDENT Bill Clinton will ask Congress for an extension of the 'fast-track' negotiating authority which is seen as vital to completing the Uruguay Round trade talks, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, announced yesterday. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC external trade commissioner, who met Mr Kantor yesterday for the first time, said this would give 'immediate life to the Uruguay Round corpse'. He said any extension should allow enough time to complete the negotiations but not so much that momentum is lost. Mr Kantor said the timing, duration and appropriate conditions for the extension would be determined in meetings with Congress and the private sector. There has been much speculation in Washington that the round must be wrapped up with a one to six month extension in order to make way for another round to deal with issues such as the environment and competition. The fast-track authority allows a president to submit a trade agreement, which cannot be amended, for a Yes or No vote in Congress. Under the current authority, at least an outline of a completed Uruguay Round deal would have to be sent to Congress by March 2. Having diplomatically agreed that their first meeting, which lasted two hours, had been 'useful and productive', both officials urged that Japan play a more active role in completing the round. The inference was that Japan must now agree to an opening of its rice market and make further concessions on cutting or eliminating tariffs. Both men acknowledged continued differences. Sir Leon said the new steel tariffs imposed by the Commerce Department were 'altogether unjustified and excessive', and said he would bring his complaints to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said the US threats to levy sanctions on March 22 in a dispute over government procurement gave the EC leverage to have barriers removed in the US government procurement market. Bilateral talks on the procurement dispute are scheduled for next week. Mr Kantor reiterated his dissatisfaction with the farm reform deal. He stressed the tough line the administration would take. 'I'm going to enforce the law,' he said. Trade policy changes, Page 7</p>

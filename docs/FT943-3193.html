			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Arts: A leaky 'Moby Dick' - Theatre John Huston did it on film with Gregory Peck, Orson Welles on stage with Joan Plowright, and Manchester achieved a notably blubbery coup de theatre with it. Cameron Mackintosh came a cropper when he tried it in a girls' school. Now Gerry Mulgrew has directed Herman Melville's haunting novel of obsession and destiny, Moby Dick, with the Royal Shakespeare Company. The production was reviewed in Stratford last November. Rumour has it that fine-tuning, tweaking and general tinkering has taken place for its transfer to the Barbican's Pit; perhaps too much since the piece stolidly refuses to generate much theatrical tension. Mulgrew was responsible for two of the liveliest offerings I have seen in Scotland: Mary Queen of Scots Had Her Head Chopped Off and the wonderful phantasmagoria of Scottish identity real and imagined, Jock Tamson's Bairns. As with many of his compatriots, the journey south has tamed him. As a director he may be uncertain how to take Rod Wooden's adaptation. The writing sets off resonances, echoes and allusions - unwisely, since it fails to stand the comparison with the sort of poetic prosody it sometimes aims at. Chief sufferer is David Calder who brings a Shakespearian technique to some sub-Shakespearian fustian interspersed with creaky metaphors - 'I didn't stop to plug my leak' - that frequently send the dramatic craft dipping into the brackish surge of bathos. The style varies between the clotted poesy of fine writing and deliberate modernity. As the crew remarks in true 19th-century fashion, 'It gives me the creeps'. As with the fountain pen with which our story-teller (whose famous opening, 'Call me Ishmael', is moved back) signs on, the effect is less universal than merely distracting. The story may be timeless, but this implies freedom from such specific details, not a constricting emphasis on them. Writing and direction are at their most ambitious in the choral spoken passages that go on too long, just as the boy Pip (played with passionate relish by Lloyd Notice) has at least one Ophelia-like mad scene too much. Karen Tennent's design dangles ropes from above around which the cast clusters in sculptural groups. This encourages the cult of the picturesque, notably in the case of Christopher Colqhoun's African-toned Queequeg, a designer savage given to posing as if displaying the latest gay leisure wear. The sacrifice of coherence to imagery is seen during a storm, where two figures are pulling on one rope - in different directions. The final use of a billowing white sheet to cover the stage is impressive though, in the words of Porgy and Bess, it takes a long haul to get there. Calder's Captain Ahab, a few weevils short of a ship's biscuit, is powerful enough in a yo-ho-ho sort of way to make one want to see his Long John Silver; a character a great deal more varied and complex than the stumping ranter at the centre of this production. Melville's damned existentialism has leaked, unplugged, away on the voyage from the Avon to the Thames. As the Scottish crew member remarks, 'So many nice intelligent people doing nice intelligent things. Look what a mess it's got the world into]' Oh come on, chaps: this is the man who wrote Billy Budd. In repertory at the Pit</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Money supply growth falls Growth in Japan's money supply slowed in June for the second successive month due to stagnant bank lending, as the sluggish economy continued to affect demand for funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Bank of Japan said M2 plus certificates of deposit grew 1.5 per cent from a year earlier, down from 1.7 per cent for May. Money supply grew 2.2 per cent in April. While recent hot weather has boosted retail spending, spurring hopes of an imminent economic recovery, demand for funds for capital investment remains weak. Bank lending in June fell 0.1 per cent from the previous year compared with the 0.3 per cent rise in April and the 0.1 per cent rise in May. Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd said growth of M2 plus certificates of deposit could recover to 3 per cent by the year-end if currency markets stabilised, prompting a modest economic recovery. However, deterioration of balance sheets at banks may curb credit creation once recovery is under way, in turn limiting the economic rebound.</p>

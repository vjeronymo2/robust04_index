			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: The case against civil service privatisation Sir, Most of the press, including yourselves, failed to report the most significant fact contained in the government's Next Steps Agencies White Paper review ('Reform boost for Whitehall', December 10). Once again, the 90 agencies have achieved better than the three out of every four tough efficiency and quality targets set for them over the previous 12 months. Each year the targets get tougher, but performance continues to improve. To argue that to have only privatised one area of the civil service represents a policy failure is to miss the point. What sense is there in forcibly putting central government work into the hands of private companies if it can be done more cheaply and efficiently in the public sector? The success to date of the in-house teams winning market testing contracts clearly demonstrates that the civil service can compete on costs with the very best of UK, US and European companies. Privatisation may well help to satisfy the ideological appetites of some ministers but what is the benefit to Britain of a greatly reduced civil service if the taxpayer is actually paying more for those services?

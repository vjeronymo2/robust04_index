Alvarez said the expert's recommendation contradicts the  economic policy of President Rafael Caldera as well as the  economic policy of private economic organizations, such as the  Higher Institute of Administration Studies, Iesa, and the  Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce, Venamcham. The adviser  participated in the forum: "Post-Sosa Plan Alternatives for  Venezuela," where he said that President Caldera should adopt  these measures, otherwise, the crisis will deepen and [words  indistinct] stabilization in a more radical manner.

[Reporter] I meant the government's economic policy.    [Alvarez] The government's economic policy is absolutely  independent from what Mr. [name indistinct], the IMF, Venamcham,  and Iesa might say. Absolutely different.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] break from IMF?    [Alvarez] No, perhaps a break between the IMF and Iesa and  Venamcham. [end recording]</p>

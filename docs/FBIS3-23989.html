			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Pushkar under the "Mass Media" rubric: </F> "The Sober `Pravda' (`Truth') of Capitalism"]    [Text] DETAILS: The half-life of PRAVDA has been  established by an experimental method. It turns out to be 89  years.    At the end of last week, toward evening, journalists of  PRAVDA urgently called together their colleagues for a desperate  press conference, whose subject was the general meeting of the  collective that had just taken place, where, in the absence of a  quorum, the newspaper's editor in chief, Viktor Linnik, had been  deposed. A schism in the collective was announced.    As has been the case in all such instances, this division  has  a hidden economic aspect. In the words of the Pravdites, the  knot was tied up by the former editor in chief, Gennadiy  Seleznev, who, for next to no money and without consultation  with the collective, sold the controlling share of stock (55  percent) to the Greek entrepreneur Gianis Giannikos. The  authorized capital of the joint-stock company is laughable--1  million rubles [R]. And thus, on the cheap, for R550,000, the  Greek obtained the greater half of PRAVDA and the right to the  deciding vote in all questions. The rest belongs to the  editorial staff, but its vote does not carry any force. Having  given away the "right of primogeniture" to Giannikos, the  Pravdites expected assistance in publishing the newspaper. High  salaries, vacations on Greek islands, and so forth, were  promised. However, nothing fell from the "Greek apple tree" onto  the heads of the journalists but a rotten apple core. From the  entire editorial staff, only one person traveled to the Greek  islands, today's Duma boyar Gennadiy Seleznev.    At the press conference, the Pravdites said that, being  communists, they had crossed out the Communist Party at the  December elections because third on its list was their former  boss Gennadiy Seleznev. Although it was still the Greeks who  vexed them more. They (the management of the joint-stock company  Pravda International includes two very close relatives of the  boss) did not pay for medical care or child care, and withheld  payment on the pathetically small compensations for children;  since October they have not paid publication fees, and, worst of  all, have halted financing of publication and distribution of  the newspaper. For three weeks before the beginning of elections  to the Duma, PRAVDA stopped coming out. The financing of  correspondents' offices and payment for the printing of the  newspaper in the localities has been halted. Because of the  economy, a multitude of telephone, teletype, and fax lines has  been shut down. At the same time, the Greek side has engaged in  assault and battery, has interfered in the publication of the  newspaper (a journalist who wrote something negative about a  personal acquaintance of the owner was promptly fired), and  posted an order reprimanding the editor in chief, who is neither  subordinate nor accountable to the Greeks in any case, since he  is an elected official.    PRAVDA had its own small cafeteria, which cost slightly  less;  the Greeks eliminated it. Putting the staff on a hunger ration,  the bosses returned to its pristine form the "chief editor's  dining room," which had been closed during democratic times, and  now they themselves take their meals there.    After the transformation of the editorial office into a  joint-stock company, the remaining 45 percent of the shares that  were left to the collective were not distributed among the  workers, so each one individually could hardly be considered a  proprietor. The only thing that still belongs to the journalist  collective are the founder's rights, including the patented  trademark. The Greeks, naturally, also encroached upon the final  thing remaining to the Pravdites, who had been cheaply sold by  Gennadiy Seleznev. Not everyone agreed to give up this final  thing.    The owners compiled a blacklist of 13 journalists upon whose  firing they insist. Among them, for instance, are last year's  Russian professional prize laureates Stanislav Pastukhov (he  runs the Moscow publication of PRAVDA) and Yuriy Glukhov. Not a  single point of the contract have they violated, but the  businessmen do not like them. It is simpler to consider the  objectionable ones as departments: the information department,  the international department, the photography department.... The  bosses also want to curtail the activity of the journalistic  organization of the editorial office. As a separate issue, they  want to drive out Viktor Linnik. In exchange, they promise to  resume financing, raise salaries, pay the fees they owe, and,  possibly, to send the subjugated to vacation on the shores of  the Aegean Sea.    In violation of the joint-stock company's charter, the fate  of the collective was entrusted not to an assembly of  journalists, but to a general assembly of workers. The workers,  whose ranks include, besides journalists, drivers, proofreaders,  translators, and secretaries from the Greeks' office, in an open  vote threw out the editor in chief, whom they themselves had  elected to that post three months before. Aleksandr Ilin was  elected acting editor-in-chief; he had already been named to  that post by Minister Shumeyko after the October events.  Eighty-seven (of a staff of 216 persons) spoke against  confidence in Linnik and against confirmation of his commission  (when he was elected as chief editor, he received 40 votes).  Ninety were for entrusting these duties to Aleksandr Ilin. These  same workers, by a majority of votes, resolved to continue the  cooperation with the Greek company. In the words of the new  acting editor, the Greeks need the founder's rights for greater  surety: They bear the expenses and must be insured against a  situation where their ouster suddenly seemed desirable.    No professional claims were made either of Viktor Linnik or  of the persons figuring on the blacklist, but at the meeting,  the Greeks snitched to the collective that they had paid the  current editor in chief extra in foreign currency (about  Gennadiy Seleznev they said nothing). Viktor Linnik, however,  expecting such a turn of events, opened a safe and rendered an  accounting to the last drachma: He had released the money for  the publication of PRAVDA. At this newspaper, many people work  literally for kopeks. PRAVDA journalists today have a salary of  R25,000: That is how much satirist Valentin Prokhorov makes. And  he would be happy to be getting even that much, but since  January the Greeks have not paid salaries at all. One of  PRAVDA's most highly paid journalists, Aleksandr Ilin, named the  acting chief editor, receives R130,000.    In the words of Stanislav Pastukhov, one of the senior  employees at PRAVDA, it was not the best portion of the  collective who supported the Greeks; it was basically people who  had worked for a year or a year and a half, "those because of  whom communists are referred to as Red-browns."    At the press conference, Viktor Linnik announced that he was  not planning to leave the post of editor-in-chief and that he  did not acknowledge the decision of the illegal assembly.  However, he is not now in a position to dismiss the "mutineers,"  because of the dual power that formed long ago at the newspaper,  where the Greeks interfere in the operational management. It is  also hard for him to imagine how he is going to manage to break  off relations with the Greeks and with what money he will  support the flickering life of PRAVDA. After all, even the R200  million received from subscribers is controlled by the Giannikos  family. In January, 15 issues were published instead of 22.  Money for publication, reported Viktor Linnik, was given by the  entrepreneur Konstantin Zatulin and the Communist Party of the  Russian Federation.    On the one hand, of course, the market is the market.  However, the attempts of Pravdites to clarify the financial  condition of the joint-stock company, of which a part of the  authorized capital still belongs to them, have come to  nothing--the Greeks have not shown them a single paper.</p>

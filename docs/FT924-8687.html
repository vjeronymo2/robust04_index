			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Age of the computer has yet to dawn - In a Nutshell More than half of small businesses in the UK make no use of personal computers to improve their efficiency at work, according to a Mori survey for IBM.

Businesses in the south are far more likely to have or to be considering buying a PC than those in the Midlands and the north.

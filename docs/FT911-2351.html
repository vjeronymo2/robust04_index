			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: US legal eagles may clip Schneider's wings - The challenge for Square D The takeover battle being waged by Groupe Schneider of France for Square D of Illinois is about to enter a critical phase. During the next two weeks, two key legal decisions will be made that could spoil the French company's plans. At hearings on May 9 and May 13, Judge Leonard Sand, of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, is scheduled to decide whether there are grounds to Square D's allegations that a takeover by Schneider would violate American anti-trust laws. Square D has asked for preliminary injunctions against Schneider to halt its proxy solicitation and tender offer of Dollars 78 per share, or Dollars 1.9bn. Both Schneider and Square D make electrical equipment. If Judge Sand were to find in favour of Square D, Schneider would find it difficult to resolve the legal challenge in time for the US company's annual meeting on June 21 , when proxy votes will be cast for the board of directors. A simple majority vote would win the proxy fight and allow Schneider to replace the current board. The replacement Schneider-affiliated board could then clear the way for completion of the takeover transaction. The board would have to remove the company's poison pill provision and waive Square D's obligation under the law of the state of Delaware, which requires that hostile bidders acquire 85 per cent of the company's shares. This done, Schneider could then purchase the shares tendered to it. At the last count, on April 12, Schneider said that some 78 per cent of Square D's shares had been tendered to it. While falling short of the 85 per cent requirement, Schneider's chances of obtaining at least a simple majority of proxies would appear to be rather good. Square D has spurred anti-trust reviews of Schneider's bid in the US, Canada, Britain, and Italy, according to a letter by Square D chairman, Mr Jerre Stead to Schneider chairman, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne. Square D's US anti-trust allegations rest principally on one point. It charges that Schneider's slate of nominees for the board, submitted in February, violates the provision of American law regarding interlocking directorates. The slate contains directors, officers and consultants of Schneider and its affiliates. While Schneider has argued there is no merit to Square D's legal challenges, it submitted an alternative slate of board candidates in early April. While these nominees apparently would not violate US laws on interlocking directorates, it was received too late to qualify under company by-laws, Square D says. The deadline for board of director's nominations was at the end of February, which is when Schneider sent in its original list. Besides trying to thwart Schneider's takeover by legal means, Square D has been pursuing other options. It was reported last week to have sought Dollars 1bn in financing for a leveraged recapitalisation. Although the company would not comment on its intentions the loans could be used to pay shareholders a special dividend. This could at least cover the tender offer's price and thus convince shareholders to stay on board with the current management. As Square D's financing proposal to banks was reported last week, Mr Pineau-Valencienne offered to raise the tender offer's price if Square D's management would come quietly to the table. But relations between the two chairman are now so embittered that even a sweeter deal is considered unlikely to be persuasive. Analysts believed the original Schneider offer of Dollars 78 was a generous one. This is partly because they feel Square D, while weathering a difficult economic period relatively well, has not lived up to its own assessments of success. After news of a possible price increase from Schneider last week,the market boosted Square D shares to Dollars 81.25, a Dollars 3.25 premium over the tender offer price. They closed last week slightly down from that peak, at Dollars 80.12.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLU TO MEET MASTER'S IN SOCCER PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran, surprisingly seeded third in the National Assn. of  Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 soccer playoffs, will meet The Master's,  the second-seeded team, Tuesday in the playoff opener for both schools. The  game at Master's is scheduled for 1 p.m.  </P> <P> CLU Coach George Kuntz had speculated that his team might not qualify for the  playoffs if it lost its season finale to Fresno Pacific, which it did, 1-0. But  one-goal losses to Westmont and Master's apparently worked to CLU's advantage  in the Longo System, the formula by which playoff berths are determined.  </P> <P> The Longo system takes into account goals allowed, strength of schedule and  several other factors.  </P> <P> Master's, 13-4-3 and ranked 13th in the nation, beat Cal Lutheran, 4-3, earlier  at CLU. The Kingsmen are 11-6-1.  </P></p>

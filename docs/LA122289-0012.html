			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NUCLEAR WASTE  </P> <P> I am writing a letter in response to your editorial "Garbage That's Too Hot to  Handle" (Dec. 2): I am disappointed in the editorial; it did not take a strong  stance in its position on nuclear waste. Of course the disposal of nuclear  waste is linked to man's future and posterity. That garbage remains dangerous  for close to 10,000 years.  </P> <P> The Department of Energy needs to find new ways to either harness energy or  eliminate the dangerous waste once and for all. Presently, there may be areas  able to keep the waste. However, at the rate we are producing it, there won't  be enough places to deposit the waste for long. What will we do then? Will we  start poisoning outer space just as we will by then have our own planet?  </P> <P> There may be arguments suggesting that the disposal areas are checked so that  there will be no leaks into our environment. This sounds reassuring, yet how  sure are the experts? Many officials in charge may be negligent or too  preoccupied with other problems. By placing the radioactive waste in our ground  -- no matter how secure the site is -- we face the risk of contaminating our  water and killing plants and animals.  </P> <P> Is it our right to gamble with the lives of other creatures on this Earth as  well as our own?  </P> <P> VAN VUONG  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

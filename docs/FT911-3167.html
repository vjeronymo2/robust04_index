			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Survey of Cornwall (4): When the speculating had to stop - Property A YEAR and a half ago, at the height of the property boom, English Estates had just four of its 500-or-so properties available. Today, that figure has risen to more than 100. Receiverships and insolvencies are an unfortunate occurrence practically every week now, especially among small firms and Mr Richard Goldring, the corporation's senior management surveyor for Cornwall, says: 'Times are difficult.' English Estates, a quango that builds factories in the English assisted areas and therefore has similar factory-building powers to those of the Scottish and Welsh development agencies, is the only major developer of industrial properties and sites within the Duchy of Cornwall. Mr Goldring adds: 'There are a number of small builder-developers putting up a couple of small units on land they have probably bought from a farmer but most of them don't look further than 10 miles from home and are really looking to provide themselves with a pension from the income out of lettings.' The private sector is very cautious, he adds. It wants pre-lets where possible. Even so, a number of small privately-owned business parks can be found dotted around the county - at Launceston, Wadebridge and Bodmin, for instance. English Estates itself has 30,000sq ft in Falmouth and a much smaller, 6,000sq ft development in Liskeard. But business parks in general have been slow to develop reliable roots in the county compared with other areas of Britain. Of the 500 properties in the duchy belonging to English Estates a large number were put up in the 1980s. When the upturn in the economy comes it will, therefore be well positioned to cater for demand, especially in the smaller units up to about 1,500sq ft where the casualty list has been heaviest. The situation in the industrial market is reflected to a very large extent in the office and retail sectors according to Mr Steve Lobb, partner in Chesterton's Plymouth office. 'The only place in the county that can sustain speculative office development is Truro,' he says. 'The county town is also about the only place where a healthy demand for retail outlets exists.' Truro stands out in these two sectors. Office rents have reached Pounds 12.50-13 a sq ft in the city which Mr Lobb describes as 'pretty remarkable'. Although prices have softened a little this year Maybey Developments South West has let the whole of Elizabeth House to the Employment Services Agency in the region of Pounds 12-13 a sq ft according to Mr Lobb. Another government arm, the Inland Revenue, has bought the freehold of a 45,000sq ft block for Pounds 6.1m but the county's main problem is there is no investment market so that deals tend to be one-off. Elsewhere, Sun Alliance has had a scheme on the stocks for some time in Truro in which Debenhams would be the anchor store and rents generally approach Pounds 80 a sq ft for zone A properties. This compares with Pounds 40 in St Austell, Falmouth and Penzance and even lower in Newquay. In St Austell, Guinea Properties had a Pounds 30m scheme for Aylmer Square but that is understood to have been sold on to Sovereign Land which is believed to be looking at a more modest scheme. The retail sector is slightly more healthy and although most of the activity has again been centred on Truro there are signs that some of the bigger food chains are now looking more widely around the county. Sainsbury's decision to build on the old county hall site in Truro is considered a watershed within the market because it brings in one of the top groups. Sainsbury is also thought to be looking at both St Austell and Falmouth. It is in the far west of the county that the greatest difficulty arises in developing properties, according to English Estates' senior development surveyor Mr Tony Thomson. The Redruth-Camborne axis in particular has had a very difficult time over the past year. A number of companies such as Case, Strategic Alloys, Bryants Electrical and B &amp; J Shoes have pulled out and filling the factories is made all the more difficult, he claims, because the local authority, Kerrier, only wants manufacturing industry on sites in the area. Mr Thomson believes that if it were possible to open up the market to distribution concerns it might be possible both to fill some of the factories and create jobs in an area of high unemployment. 'Rents certainly become cheaper the further west into the county one goes, which should help us when the market picks up,' he adds. At the moment industrial units attract about Pounds 3 a sq ft for those over 10,000sq ft rising to about Pounds 6 for micro units of about 500 sq ft, though English Estates introduces an element of charging what the market will bear by charging slightly less for small rural properties.</p>

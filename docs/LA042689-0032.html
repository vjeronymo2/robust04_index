			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV'S TEETER-TOTTER  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's new revolution has the one ingredient  that no spy thriller can survive without. It crawls with suspense. Four years  into his revolution, every important issue remains in doubt, while he goes on  winning some and losing some in a fashion foreign to tyranny.  </P> <P> A few nights ago, an inept contingent of Soviet troops made the sensitive  nationalities problem explode to new dimensions by spraying some kind of poison  gas into a crowd of Soviet Georgian demonstrators. The gas seems to have killed  some of the 19 Georgians who died; others were killed or maimed by soldiers  hacking away with short-handled spades designed for digging trenches.  </P> <P> Not only did the troops fire poison gas, they were refusing yesterday to tell  medical authorities what kind of gas it was that put perhaps 120 people  clamoring for Georgian independence into hospitals. Without knowing the  chemical composition of the gas, doctors were helpless to know what antidotes  to try.  </P> <P> That is how things stood in Georgia when Soviet officers loaded 31 tanks onto a  train in Hungary and headed for the Ukraine, away from the East-West border in  Europe. Gorbachev has said the scene will be repeated until 5,000 tanks and  50,000 troops have left Eastern Europe as part of an attempt to reduce  East-West tensions.  </P> <P> Reports from Moscow say market shelves are so bare that they are reminiscent of  the days immediately after World War II when an exhausted Soviet Union was  still trying to pull itself together. Savings soar because there is so little  to buy, and growth in the economy, already faltering, slowed even more.  </P> <P> Then on Monday, during a one-day meeting of the Soviet Communist Party's ruling  Central Committee, the last of the Old Guard resigned -- about one-fourth of  the committee's 251 members -- clearing the way for Gorbachev to replace them  with people who think more as he does. They include people like Yevgeny  Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Gorbachev's  chief adviser on nuclear arms control, and Valentin Falin, a Party foreign  affairs expert.  </P> <P> The revolution lurches on, Gorbachev supervising from a seemingly secure perch  on his geopolitical teeter-totter that bounces around from hope to despair. How  the suspense will end depends more on the tolerance of Soviet citizens for  descriptions of rewards without the rewards themselves than on the leadership's  record of wins and losses. Americans cannot and should not intervene in the  accepted sense, but they need only look back at the brutality of alternative  methods of rule to find cause to cheer the revolution on.  </P></p>

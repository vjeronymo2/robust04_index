			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: European setback for Jones Stroud Jones Stroud (Holdings), the Nottingham-based textile and electrical accessories group, blamed 'deteriorating conditions' in its European markets for an 11 per cent contraction in interim profits. Mr Philip Jones, chairman, said the downturn - from Pounds 3.29m to Pounds 2.92m - in the six months to end-September, reflected lower exports and difficulties in recouping increased raw material costs following sterling's devaluation. Turnover improved to Pounds 35.9m (Pounds 34.2m). Mr Jones said that action had been taken to reduce costs and improve productivity but 'beneficial effects will not become apparent until the next financial year'. Earnings per share dipped to 11.4p (12.32p) but the interim dividend goes up 0.2p to 3.5p.</p>

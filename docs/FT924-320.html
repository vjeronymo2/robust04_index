			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Young considers tax help for rented housing finance TAX CONCESSIONS and other incentives could be introduced to encourage financial institutions to invest in housing for rent, Sir George Young, the housing minister, said yesterday. The fresh emphasis on promoting the private rented sector marks a shift away from the 1980s Tory rhetoric in favour of home-ownership but Sir George made it clear that the government stood by its manifesto pledge to maintain mortgage tax relief. His suggestion of new forms of government financial help for housing investment, including cash grants and loans on preferential terms appeared unrealistic to some investors, and people working in housing. Sir George said on BBC radio that his talks with financial institutions had shown they were interested in investing, but that 'at the moment, the sums don't quite add up'. There was a yield gap between the return an institution, such as a pension fund, could expect from putting money into housing and what it would get from other investments, he said. 'The decision government will have to take quite soon is whether they are prepared to meet that gap in return for getting the substantial increase in investment in property that we all want to see.' Institutional investors reacted sceptically. They said it was unlikely they would be attracted to residential property and cited the lack of liquidity and the small size of the potential investment. Mr Philip Scott, general manager of finance at Norwich Union, said it was 'highly unlikely' that institutions could be persuaded to invest in private rented housing, although traditional landlords might be encouraged back. Mr Scott said institutions tended to consider any investment of less than Pounds 5m - the typical size of a residential investment - as small. Economies of scale were not available from such investments, he said. Mr Paul Gaunt, a senior investment manager at Equitable Life, said property was likely to be such an illiquid investment that he did not believe most institutional investors would be interested in it. He added: 'If we are approached, we will certainly take a look at the risk and reward but at first glance it looks like a non-starter.' Ms Sheila McKechnie, the director of Shelter, the national campaign for the homeless, thought the plans Sir George had in mind required a different fiscal and investment structure. She said they would need 'massive injections of government money - and I don't see the Treasury doing that'.</p>

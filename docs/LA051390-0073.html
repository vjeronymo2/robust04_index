			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPOSING A CALL FOR HIGHER DENSITY  </P> <P> Re: Your article in the Westside Digest (Times, May 3), Daniel S. Levitan of  Price Waterhouse Real Estate Consulting Group should be sent to live in New  York. He states that "a vertical city can be just as livable as one that is  horizontal."  </P> <P> Bull! Anyone can see the difference between the "Golden Ghetto" that developers  have inflicted on Wilshire Boulevard versus the beauty of Cheviot Hills.  </P> <P> Mr. Levitan's call for citizens to tell their elected officials to allow  high-density development is a transparent attempt to cater to the profit  motives of his clients at the expense of livability for everyone else. Hasn't  he been reading The Times' stories on water shortages? Higher density means  denser smog, denser traffic, higher water use and a lowering of the quality of  life for everyone.  </P> <P> Of course there are millions of Americans (and non-Americans) who want to own a  home, but too many of them who want to live in Southern California.  California's resources are limited. The only fair way to decide who will get  ownership of a scarce resource is price, Mr. Waterhouse. I'm glad to be one of  the lucky ones who couldn't possibly afford to buy the house I now own. I call  it "success."  </P> <P> CHARLES A. LEE  </P> <P> Cheviot Hills  </P></p>

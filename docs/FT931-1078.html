			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Heseltine wins over Tory backbenchers but not quite rousing - backing for his coal pit proposals that appeared to have headed off the threat of a full-blown revolt that would end his political career. Labour protested that the trade and industry secretary's package was 'only a stay of execution'. But the number of Conservative MPs prepared to vote against the government has all but evaporated. Only a handful are expected to abstain when MPs vote on the package on Monday. Colleagues of Mr Heseltine believe that a government defeat would force his resignation. Conservative business managers were confident last night, however, that his position, in the short term at least, is safe. Mr Heseltine's typically flamboyant two-hour Commons performance combined fierce attacks on Labour MPs with deliberate flattery of Tory colleagues. He wooed members of the Commons select committee on trade and industry by saying he 'broadly accepts the thrust of their central recommendations' - a claim challenged by some of the committee's members. Mr Heseltine's political career has been battered by the coal debacle and his reception on Conservative benches yesterday fell short of adulation. He began a concerted effort to build support for his proposals last night by meeting the Tory backbench trade and industry committee - where in October he was given a bruising reception. Sir Michael Grylls, the committee's chairman, said: 'He was greeted like a knight in shining armour who makes a rescue bid.' The government will be anxious to avert the growth of any disquiet over the weekend. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said the white paper amounted to 'a comprehensive admission of failure'. Mr Heseltine had 'failed to find a market for one single extra tonne of coal'. He added: 'The period of two years has nothing to do with the time to turn round these pits, and everything to do with your timetable to privatise the coal industry and wash your hands of it.' Support among the broad swathe of Conservative MPs was tempered by some protests at the bringing forward of the coal debate to Monday - a decision apparently calculated to minimise the scope for any disquiet to ferment at Westminster. Yet many, particularly on the party's right wing, were relieved that subsidies had been limited and the jobs saved were not at the expense of jobs in the gas or oil industries. The most vociferous attack by a Tory came from Mr Richard Alexander, MP for Newark, who complained the package would cause 'devastation' in north Nottinghamshire and that Mr Heseltine had failed in his promise to keep Union of Democratic Mineworkers' pits open. But others who protested last October were falling into line last night. Mr Winston Churchill, Tory MP for Davyhulme, welcomed the 'very considerable distance he has travelled since October 13'.</p>

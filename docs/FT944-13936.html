			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Germany begins coalition talks Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister and leader of the liberal Free Democratic party, arrives for a meeting of his party's leadership yesterday to finalise demands for coalition talks with Chancellor Helmut kohl. Negotiations to form Germany's next government seemed likely to be smoother than expected after members of the FDP, which has kept the coalition in power since 1982, emerged from the talks much more united than before they began. Mr Kohl's party, the Christian Democratic Union, has said it wants negotiations completed quickly so that parliament can re-elect Mr Kohl as chancellor in the week beginning November 14.

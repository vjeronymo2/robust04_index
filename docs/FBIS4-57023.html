			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patricia Munoz Rios] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the Commerce and Industrial Development  Secretariat [Secofi] revealed that Mexico has already prepared  the package of products for which it will demand immediate  inclusion during the negotiations Mexico will hold with the  United States and Canada to expedite the liberalization process  agreed upon in NAFTA.    Reports indicate that only a few details regarding this list  of products to be submitted for negotiation are pending review.  Those details are being studied jointly with the production  sectors because these sectors have directly demanded that their  products be included in this package.    Agricultural-livestock and fresh and processed fruit  products  head the list of products for which Mexico will demand immediate  inclusion. Mexico is negotiating this immediate inclusion  through NAFTA for the med-term.    Secofi revealed unofficially that talks to expedite  schedules  for tax-elimination [calendarios de desgravacion] were still in  the preliminary stage, agendas have barely been agreed on.    This is occurring despite the fact that the U.S. and Mexican  Governments signed a commitment "as part of NAFTA supplemental  negotiations to conclude the review process of the tariff  acceleration 120 days after the treaty's entry into force on 1  January, that is, 1 May."    The deadline has passed. The United States seeks to expedite  particularly the elimination of taxes from products such as  wine, plate glass, electric appliances, hardware materials, wood  products, among others which make up the long list of goods in  the negotiations, however.    Secofi even promised to disclose the list of products to be  negotiated by the end of the week of 25 April or the beginning  of the week of 2 May at the latest, but this never happened. A  report indicated that this package is entirely ready for  negotiation, however.    One line of products for which Mexico wants an early opening  is that of processed fruits and vegetables. In this line, 62  percent of the exports must go through a 10-year period before  tax exemptions go into effect. Twenty-one percent of sales to  the United States face a 15-year protection period. Only three  percent of the market is tax free.    It is important for Mexico to have an early opening in this  line of goods because this is one of the few lines in which the  country has a positive trade balance. The main products in this  line of exports to the United States, asparagus, broccoli,  cauliflower, however, must wait 10 years before the  tax-exemption process begins. Tax-exemption on frozen orange  juice will begin in 15 years; 10 years for frozen strawberries.  The tax-exemption deadline for processed and preserved  tomatoes, for processed avocados, and, in general, for  vegetables, is five years. Mexico will request immediate tax  exemptions on these products.</p>

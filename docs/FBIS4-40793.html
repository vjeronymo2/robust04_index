			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 9, RIA -- Another crew will be sent to  the Mir orbiter on July 1, a spokesman for the Russian Space  Agency [RSA] told RIA. However, some difficulties related to  the citizenship of one of the cosmonauts arose during the  preparations for the mission. Dalgat Musabayev, 43, is a  lieutenant colonel of the Russian air Force, he is also a  Russian citizen and has lived in Star City for quite some time.  Meanwhile, representatives of Kazakhstan insist that Musabayev  go to space as a Kazakh citizen. According to the Russian Space  Agency spokesman the request of Kazakhstan will be granted.    There are plans to launch a Russian-Kazakh crew from the  Baykonur spaceport on July 1. Dalgat Musabayev will fly  together with Major Yuriy Malashenko, 33. During the four  months he will stay on the orbit, Musabayev will perform a  number of experiments, including those under the national space  programme of Kazakhstan. Asked about the payment for the stay  aboard the Mir spacecraft, the RSA spokesman said that  Kazakhstan will probably withhold this amount due from the lease  payment Russia makes for the use of the Baykonur spaceport. The  amount which Kazakhstan will pay for Musabayev's involvement in  the mir mission has not been disclosed. A well- informed  sources told RIA that the sum may be reduced, considering the  fact that Kazakhstan and Russia have common interest in the  outer space.    As a rule, a one-week flight for a foreign cosmonaut on a  Russian orbiter cost about 10 million dollars.</p>

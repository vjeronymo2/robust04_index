			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Patten wins backing for push on HK reform plans Hong Kong's Governor Chris Patten yesterday received the support of the Executive Council, his top advisory body, to push ahead with his plan for political reform in the colony later this week. This decision is likely further to anger China, which says the governor's plans violate previous Sino-British agreements and understandings. China has said it will hold fresh elections in Hong Kong when it takes over in 1997 if Britain pushes ahead without agreement. Mr Patten plans to tell the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo) tomorrow that he will publish a bill on Friday containing his 1992 proposals to broaden the democratic franchise in Hong Kong. On Friday, he is expected to publish a 'white paper' giving Britain's account of Sino-British talks held last year. These talks broke up in November without agreement. Publication of his second reform bill will follow a vote in LegCo today on Mr Patten's first reform bill, which lowers Hong Kong's voting age to 18 years. The government is expected to win today's vote but it may be close run. Already, 24 of LegCo's 59 voting members have said they will back measures to amend or delay the bill. Signs exist that Hong Kong is wearying of its political fight with China. An opinion poll shows over 70 per cent of respondents were not interested in the debate over the colony's elections later this year and in 1995. Some 36 per cent favoured passing the first bill, but 50 per cent said they had no view, the poll, published in the South China Morning Post, said. The legislation Mr Patten plans to unveil on Friday will include provisions for nine 'jumbo' electorates, each consisting of 300,000 electors, and the replacement of corporate with individual voting in Hong Kong's 'functional constituencies' which represent business and professional groups. Hong Kong could lose more than a third of its senior civil servants at the 1997 handover to China, a poll of 1,000 of them shows, Reuter reports. The poll, by the colony's City Polytechnic, showed 35 per cent were unwilling to stay on beyond 1997.</p>

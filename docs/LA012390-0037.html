			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA SETS UP PANEL ON POLICE, FIRE  PROBLEMS  </P> <P> The Pomona City Council has voted to establish a Public Safety Commission to  advise the council on police and fire problems.  </P> <P> Council members Nell Soto and C. L. (Clay) Bryant were appointed to work with  city staff members to prepare an ordinance spelling out the commission's  duties.  </P> <P> The council must approve the measure before appointments are made.  </P> <P> Soto, who proposed the commission, said it would examine public safety issues,  ranging from traffic problems to citizen complaints. She said the commission  would not have the power to punish employees, nor would it function as a  watchdog. However, Bryant offered a different view, saying it could serve as a  police review board to look into complaints against officers.  </P> <P> Mayor Donna Smith and Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer voted against the proposal.  Smith said the commission might alienate workers, and Nymeyer said Soto's  proposal was too vague.  </P></p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (1): A growing list of failures - Overview / Tenants' bankruptcies have added to industry problems FEW areas of British industry have suffered so visibly during the recession as the UK property industry. This year, its declining fortunes became obvious to even the most casual observer. In place of the trappings of the boom - the duckboards, cranes, dust and traffic diversions - there are now derelict, boarded-up buildings, unlet new developments and rows of letting signs. The ever-growing list of failures has embraced property companies, shopping centres and office developments, most notably the ill-starred Canary Wharf development that towers over East London. The problems of the property industry are no longer merely those of its own making. Even where it did not overvalue, overbuild and over-borrow, it has suffered from record bankruptcies among tenants. The industrial sector, for example, has suffered heavily from the recession this year, even though it never became oversupplied with new buildings. Not every participant in the property market is despondent, however. Tenants who are unencumbered with existing premises have had opportunities to sign cheap leases on their own terms. Some fledgling retail companies have expanded rapidly in underlet shopping centres with the help of incentives from desperate landlords. Some investors, too, are cheered by the opportunity to buy at what they perceive as the bottom of the market. Their enthusiasm is whetted by the very high level of property yields, which this year exceeded gilt yields for the first time since the 1960s. Many also believe that the dearth of new construction activity will bring the property market back into balance in a few years' time. The state of the market is very uneven. Pockets of the market such as retail warehouses and supermarkets have largely escaped the downturn. The decline has not affected every part of the UK. In Scotland, for example, rents actually rose in the year to September. Even the depressed Central London office market shows large variations in the severity of the downturn. While top rents have generally halved since their peak in May 1990 to Pounds 35 per sq ft at most, the scarcity of large modern buildings in the West End recently led Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks group, to pay a reported Pounds 55 per sq ft for a building in Berkeley Square. Record vacancy rates should not be taken entirely at face value. Herring Baker Harris, chartered surveyors, says that 5m sq ft of offices in the City of London, where 20 per cent of offices are empty, are virtually unlettable space. The prospects for some office blocks are so poor that their owners are making them uninhabitable to escape the burden of rates bills. Even modern buildings do not necessarily provide the premises that occupiers want. A study by Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, property advisers, showed that speculative developments often did not meet tenants' needs. 'While the development boom has affected most key office centres, this should not be taken to mean that the choice available to potential office occupiers has increased in line with construction activity,' it concluded. Despite these caveats, the unprecedented imbalance between supply and demand is putting new power in the hands of tenants seeking new space. This - and the difficulties of letting and selling buildings - is changing the roles of banks, developers and investors. The developers are being kept afloat by their bankers for the present while they attempt to let their existing buildings. But they are under heavy pressure to cut costs and their future prospects look bleak. There is little prospect of attracting finance for future speculative developments as the banks are only prepared to provide property finance in the most exacting circumstances. The banks' reluctance stems from the scale of their existing problems, which has made them, in effect, the unwilling owners of property for years to come. The attitude of investors has also changed. The old adage was that all that mattered in property was 'location, location, location.' The emphasis has changed to stress the quality of the covenant above the location and the quality of property. The pressures mounting on the traditional lease is perhaps the most dramatic symptom of the new conditions facing developers, investors and tenants. Tenants, particularly retailers, are baulking at the 25-year lease with upwards-only reviews every five years, which they see as restrictive and inflationary. Landlords are being forced to concede break clauses that allow the tenant to curtail the lease prematurely. Similarly, tenants have lobbied intensely for a change in the law on privity of contract, which allows landlords to reclaim unpaid rent from former tenants, where a lease has been assigned. Investors are anxiously watching the pressure for change to lease structures. Many institutional investors feel that any change would be a severe threat to the security of income from property. As a result, the role of property in institutional portfolios could be jeopardised by reform. The role of property in institutional portfolio is under scrutiny for other reasons, too. The UK's withdrawal from the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism has reopened the debate about property's role as a hedge against inflation. Even those who believe that inflation will not re-emerge as a serious problem generally believe that property's prospects have been boosted by the exit from the ERM. It allowed a relaxation of high real interest rates, which bore down heavily on indebted property companies. It remains to be seen whether institutional interest in commercial property can be rekindled. Net institutional property investment remained subdued this year, totalling just Pounds 212m in the second quarter, according to the Central Statistical Office. In some parts of the market, such as the City of London, the institutions' involvement was exceeded by overseas investors. Buying interest, from whatever source, has been highly selective. It is focused on well-let, well-located and high quality property that makes up, at most, a fifth of the market. The bulk of the investment market will only begin its recovery after tenants stop going bankrupt and start to absorb new space. Even if the decline abates, few analysts expect any significant improvement in the coming year.</p>

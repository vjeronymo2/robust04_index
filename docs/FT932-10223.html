			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / City fails to master the enemy within: Richard Waters and Norma Cohen find suspicions of insider deals are rarely proved INSIDER dealing is like sex. To hear some people in the financial world talk, everyone else is doing it all of the time - except you. In fact, no one has any idea how common (or uncommon) the crime really is. As Mr Peter Gerrard, general counsel at the London Stock Exchange, says: 'That's part of the problem. It makes it easy for anyone to stand on a soapbox and talk about it.' Jumping on the soapbox last week was Mr Paul Myners, chairman of UK fund manager Gartmore. In one of the City's periodic outpourings of angst on the subject, he wrote to the Financial Times to complain about a sharp drop in the share price of Tiphook, the transport rental group, in the days before the company issued a profits warning. On previous experience, he said, it was unlikely the Stock Exchange would be able to do anything about it. Other fund managers queued up to agree with him. Several pointed to the cases of MTM, the chemicals company, and BM Group, the construction equipment company, both of whose shares collapsed spectacularly last year after having fallen suspiciously sharply in the days before bad news was announced. Some claim the Stock Exchange lacks the will to police its members, or is too passive. 'Most insider dealing is done by stockbrokers,' said one shareholder, adding that the self-regulatory nature of the exchange meant it could not take the tough action necessary to root out and punish insider dealing. The Stock Exchange, the body primarily responsible for detecting the crime, denies the charges, but agrees it has been hampered in its fight against the crime. A private body with powers only over its members, the exchange has limited access to information. Department of Trade and Industry inspectors, to whom the exchange refers cases it has assembled, have greater powers, for instance, to require witnesses to answer questions. 'The gap comes where we don't have the powers needed to gather sufficient information for inspectors to be appointed,' said Mr Mike Feltham, head of the exchange's insider dealing group. A central agency  - perhaps the Securities and Investments Board - should be invested with all the powers and resources necessary to do the job, he says. The exchange's complaints have fallen on deaf ears at the Treasury, where an official said: 'It is very easy to come up with panaceas - an insider dealing tribunal, a change in the burden of proof, a new central agency. But the central difficulty is to establish that someone actually possessed inside information. It is easy to have the suspicion.' On this point, all agree. The rumours that sweep the stock market can take share prices up or down sharply. 'A lot of those movements are market manipulation rather than insider dealing,' says David Rough, investment director at Legal and General. Many other cases are prompted by speculation. Finding the evidence that a suspect actually dealt on inside information has defeated many potential prosecutions in the past. The Treasury has decided not to use the opportunity presented by the implementation of the EC's Insider Dealing Directive in UK law to step up the fight against insider dealing. Prompted by the EC directive, the new legislation, included in the Criminal Justice Bill, may make a marginal difference to the fight against the crime: the need for prosecutors to establish a 'connection' between the insider dealer and the company whose shares are traded will be abolished, for instance. However, the Treasury's draft legislation on insider dealing, which will land on the desks of City trade associations this morning, will do nothing to tackle the problems of enforcement about which investors like Mr Myners complain. Despite the soul-searching in the financial world, it seems likely that some forms of insider dealing are declining. Even after it became a crime in 1980, trading on inside information remained an institutionalised practice in securities houses, and brokers were valued most for their well-timed tips, not their analysis. The well-publicised insider dealing cases of the late 1980s in the US and UK changed all that, prompting securities and investment management firms to introduce and enforce tougher dealing rules on their staff. Also, companies and their advisers are coming under greater pressure to keep information secret, and to publish price-sensitive information promptly. The exchange says it has become concerned at the leaking of information to Sunday newspapers and has called in a number of chairmen of listed companies in recent months. These tickings-off have been done the way the City likes best - in secret - but the exchange threatens it may make cases public in future. Despite this, listed companies still like to prepare the market for bad information. 'Companies call it news management,' said the head of UK equities at one leading fund management house. 'They don't exactly say 'We're issuing a profits warning.' They just give you enough information to realise the profits estimates of most analysts are too high.' A shareholder said that in one such meeting with the management of a major international food group last autumn, he realised that the company was likely to take write-downs at year-end which had not yet been factored into analysts' profit forecasts. As a result, he held off buying a further stake in the company. Prompter publication to the market as a whole would keep insider dealing at bay, whether real or suspected. The slide in the Tiphook share price came in the days after the company had told its broker, UBS, that it planned to issue the profit warning, but before the warning was announced. The longer price-sensitive information sits around the offices of a company or its advisers, the more likely it is to leak. The conviction in March of Mr Thorold Mackie, the Edinburgh-based stockbroker fined for advising his clients to trade in the shares of Shanks &amp; McEwan, also sprung in part from a delay in publication. He was told of a possible profits warning at the company two weeks before it was published to the stock market. As the Treasury official says: 'More pressure should be put on companies to get information out to the market quickly.' And a fund manager adds: 'The minute a material development is known, the company should be required to disclose it to all shareholders.' After all, if there was less inside information, there would be less insider dealing.</p>

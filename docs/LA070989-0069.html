			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BARGAIN CORNER: HOTEL CHAINS CUT RATES, OFFER SUMMER SPECIALS  </P> <P> Ramada and Hilton are making a splash with special summer programs.  </P> <P> Ramada's "Summer Sale" rates start at $37 a night until Sept. 30. Up to four  guests can share a room at no extra cost, and the offer is good throughout the  week. Nearly 450 Ramada properties and Renaissance hotels in the United States,  Canada and the Caribbean are participating.  </P> <P> At check-in, guests receive a Budget Rent-a-Car coupon good for either $20 off  a weekly rental or $10 off a weekend rental of two days or more on a compact or  larger car. The car, however, must be returned to the original rental point.  </P> <P> There are more than 60 hotels with summer rates under $40, all in the United  States. Rates start at $70 for the hotels in Canada and $65 in the Caribbean.  </P> <P> Hilton has extended its "BounceBack Weekend" to cover weekdays during the  summer if stays include a Saturday night. The original program covered only  Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights.  </P> <P> Rates start at $45 per room a night. The number of guests who can stay in the  room varies from hotel to hotel, but at least two can stay for the same price,  according to a Hilton spokesman.  </P> <P> Children of any age can stay free with one parent or grandparent. A continental  breakfast for each guest is included.  </P> <P> Rates of $65 or under are available at 176 of the more than 250 properties  participating in the BounceBack promotion, with rates 40% to 50% off regular  prices.  </P> <P> The program is available until Sept. 4, but excluding weekdays, the program  will continue after Sept. 4.  </P> <P> Contact travel agents or Ramada toll-free at (800) 228-2828, and Hilton at  (800) HILTONS.  </P> <P> If you prefer a bed and breakfast inn, the Bed &amp; Breakfast Innkeepers of  Southern California are offering a "Mid-Weekenders Discount Coupon Book" for  $10.

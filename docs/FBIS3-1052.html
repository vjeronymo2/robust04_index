DP leader Dr Zach de Beer and Western Cape premiership  candidate Hennie Bester led the charge. The party faced the  perception in these areas that the April elections contest was  between the African National Congress [ANC] and the National  Party [NP] only.    Mr Bester and his team of strategists devised a simple  first-phase approach: Make the DP visible.    Dr de Beer, Mr Bester and other leaders boarded kombis  [minibuses] and bakkies [pickup trucks] and slowly drove through  countless suburbs, towns and hamlets with loudspeakers blaring  "vote for the DP, the party of peace" and the party jingle "one  nation, one future, one South Africa; DP will fight for your  rights".    Pamphlets were dished out as widely as possible along the  way  and informal and formal meetings and gatherings were addressed.    On the whole the DP received a friendly -- if at times  bemused -- reception, with its central peace and human rights  message reciprocally acknowledged with two-fingered peace  salutes.    The occasional bystander flashed an "up yours" and mouthed  an  accompanying expletive, and in the JCC squatter camp at Mossel  Bay a man was restrained from throwing a stone at the  procession. But in the final analysis, at least the party was  "there" in hitherto largely virgin territory.    An ANC worker in George said the DP had blown away the  previous well-ordered ANC/NP scenario. As a bonus, the DP  received good television, radio and press coverage.    Outeniqua MP Chris April summed up the organisational  dilemma  by saying that under the previous constituency-based,  winner-takes- all electoral system, the DP and its progressive  predecessors were largely confined to privileged urban enclaves  where there was no pressing need to build up organisational  structures. Now, under proportional representation, every vote  counted equally, even that of the solitary democrat in the  tiniest hamlet.    But the organisational infrastructure is lacking and begs  the  question whether the next phase of the strategy can be  effectively implemented before April 26.    The second phase is for party representatives and canvassers  to move from street to street and door to door with more  personalised messages and pamphlets. Coupled with this is the  DP's comparative paucity of funds.    A top DP strategist sums it up best: "All we can really do  is make as much noise as possible and hope for the best."</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Classroom reform fails the freedom test: John Patten's Education Bill promises schools more independence but it may actually reduce their power The government's Education Bill, which starts its progress through the Commons this afternoon, is designed to make state schools in England and Wales fit for the 21st century. Since, by general consent, too many of them are unfit for the late 20th, it is an ambitious but imperative goal. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, claims that 'choice and diversity' lie at the heart of his bill. His aim? To make all schools self-governing, busting the monopoly of local education authorities (LEAs), putting parents and teachers in the driving seat, and creating a market in education to increase opportunity for all. The means? Grant-maintained (GM) status, by which head teachers and school governors are set free from their local council bureaucrats, made accountable to parents, given a block grant from the state broadly related to their numbers, then left to get on with it. That is the rhetoric. The reality is different. As with so many of the reforms of the Thatcher decade, the Education Bill and wider government education policy reflect contradictory pressures. On the one hand they laud the market; on the other, they shackle it at every turn. Consider the position of Mr Patten's self-governing grant-maintained schools. Undeniably, GM schools will have greater control of their finances and internal management than under the old LEA regime. This can only be positive. Under the local management of schools policy, most schools already enjoy wide budgetary discretion. But a visit to most GM schools reveals an extra sense of pride and commitment among the staff at running their own show entirely free from local bureaucrats. There are fears that the proposed Funding Agency for Schools, which will distribute grants to GM schools, will yield a new set of unelected officials to replace the old. On that the jury is out. Mr Patten's bill deliberately makes no provision for regional agencies, and he is adamant that the national agency will largely confine itself to sending out the cheques. Even if that proves to be so, the powers of the state over schools remains vast - and under the current bill, they will be increased in crucial respects. Some of the new powers relate to regulation, notably the provision for regular inspections under the aegis of the new Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted). For all the controversy over 'private' inspectors - Ofsted's licensing procedure will make them public in all but name - this aspect enjoys wide support. So does the plan for 'education associations' - task forces - to take control of schools certified by Ofsted that fail to provide an acceptable standard of education. The associations could hardly do other than improve such schools, provided high-calibre staff can be recruited. However, the government has taken, or plans to take in the current bill, a whole panoply of powers which run contrary to the self-governing notion, even admitting the need for strong regulation. First, Mr Patten intends to exercise far-reaching powers to reorganise schools. He argues that the expense of 1.5m surplus places in schools nationwide obliges him to do so. Under the bill, he will have the right to by-pass LEAs and GM schools and draw up his own reorganisation proposals for any locality. Where the locals object, a public inquiry will be held. But whatever its findings, Mr Patten is allowed to do what he likes apparently without having to give reasons for any decision to over-ride opposition. This approach offends even the haziest notions of the market and local accountability. As one prominent Tory educationalist put it, if Mr Patten really had faith in a numbers-related funding formula plus the work of Ofsted, surplus places should take care of themselves without leading to unacceptably low standards in those small schools which survived. Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr Patten's predecessor, was attracted to the idea, and proposed to earmark funds for successful schools wanting to expand - the reverse side of the coin. One of Mr Patten's first acts on taking office was to cancel that proposal. As to accountability, parents and schools - GM or not - will have no redress against an education secretary determined to reshape their education system. At present, they can lobby their LEA and vote it out of office if they want. They can also appeal to the education secretary as a last check against their LEAs. Such is the government's distrust of local councils that Mr Patten is not prepared to give LEAs any role in checking his discretion. Nor is he prepared to consider other democratic devices. Local referendums have a long tradition in British local government; the argument for them in the case of a wholesale school reorganisation is potent - it is the kind of issue which dominates the consciousness of a locality. The second area of unrestrained government authority relates to the curriculum and examinations. In the 1980s, almost everyone agreed that a national curriculum of some sort was necessary, and its inclusion in Mr Kenneth Baker's 1988 Education Reform Act caused little controversy. It was generally assumed then, however, that the government would introduce a loose framework curriculum and leave schools a large measure of freedom. Not so. With every year, state interference has increased. Last year, Mr Clarke appointed Lord Griffiths, former head of Lady Thatcher's policy unit, as head of the quango responsible for school assessment. He proceeded to reshape large parts of the post-1988 system. Mr Patten has gone further still. This summer he even decreed that all 14-year-olds would be forced to study one of three Shakespeare plays - including Julius Caesar - for their national English tests. It is the same tale with exams. Last year Mr Clarke, after no consultation and to the consternation of most teachers, announced that the course work component of the GCSE, the exam taken by all 16-year-olds, was to be slashed. Schools had to change courses at short notice. Yet both he and Mr Patten to date have ruled out of court any reform of A-levels, despite the overwhelming consensus for change among teachers, educationalists and businessmen, who are concerned that a fifth of all candidates are left with little to show for their work, with even the successful obliged to specialise far earlier and more narrowly than their Continental counterparts. So 'choice and diversity' operate within narrow confines. Local bureaucrats and the education establishment are being shown the door. But education is evidently too important to be left to parents and teachers. It is no surprise that Mr Patten has taken to dubbing himself 'the nation's headmaster'.</p>

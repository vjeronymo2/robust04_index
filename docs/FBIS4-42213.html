			<p>BFN     [Text] Canada has decided to send 300 forces'  communications specialists to Rwanda. Defense Minister David  Collenette says their deployment depends on the United Nations  supplying 5,500 peacekeeping troops. Mr. Collenette says the  Canadian soldiers stationed in Kingston, Ontario, have been  warned to be ready to ship out for a six-month assignment. Only  a few Canadians are now stationed with the UN force in Rwanda,  including the group's commander, Major General Romeo Dallaire.</p>

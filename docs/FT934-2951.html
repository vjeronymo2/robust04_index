			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (4): Making it in Latin America - Rise of an innovative vehicle industry Latin America used to be one of the largest and most lucrative markets for commercial vehicles from Europe and North America. In the 1950s and 1960s, extensive industrial-isation required vast numbers of trucks and buses, while the size of the continent, 7,000 km from the Caribbean coast to Cape Horn, meant that each and every one had plenty of work to do. In 1960, for example, Leyland alone was supplying 1,000 buses to Buenos Aires, 500 to Montivedeo, 100 to Jamaica and 240 to Havana, with corresponding truck numbers to every part of the continent. Mercedes, GM, MAN and Ford did similar volumes of business later in that decade. All that has gone, not because the suppliers are less able, but because many countries decided to develop their own vehicle industries. They encouraged manufacturers to establish assembly operations, leading to progressive manufacturing, and set up formidable barriers against vehicle imports. The Mercosul scheme currently carries out that task. The progress of such well-meaning projects was far from smooth. Restrictions or bans on imports meant that vital components, which were difficult to make locally, were excluded along with complete vehicles. Consequently, manufacturers struggled to produce the required quality of vehicle and, as in India and elsewhere, they learned how to solve technical problems the hard way, by going back to basic engineering principles. The result is that today's Latin American commercial vehicle industry is both innovative and technically strong. Some European senior managers, including Mr Helmut Werner of Mercedes-Benz, reckon that Brazil is one of the most exciting countries in the world as far as trucks are concerned. Several Latin American nations have become vehicle producers, while some, including Argentina and Mexico, combine production and imports in their increasingly dynamic economies. Brazil not only provides all its own commercial vehicles - a few special designs excluded - but exports in quantity to other Latin American countries, the US and Canada, numerous African states and even to Europe. Fiat's Fiorino light van, for example, is made exclusively in Brazil. Mexico also provides for most of its own needs. In 1992, it built or assembled 304,000 commercials, mainly under 3000kg GVW. Assembly takes place in Venezuela and Peru, but substantial numbers are imported, partly from other Latin American countries. Different strategies are employed by some of the big players. Mercedes-Benz has developed a range of medium and heavy truck designs in Brazil which, apart from the star on the grille, bear little or no resemblance to their distant European cousins. Thirty years ago, when Mercedes set up in Argentina and Brazil, the products were simply export versions of European originals. The VW-Ford venture, Autolatina Brazil, has also developed along lines that owe little to North America or Europe; hence, there are VW trucks up to 35 tonnes with MWM engines. Dedicated US market truck chassis are built in Brazil by several makers, such as the 'baby' Kenworth Class 6 &amp; 7 medium trucks. But while some manufacturers freely develop designs found only in Brazil, others go to great lengths to ensure that their Latin American products, including components, are identical to and interchangeable with those in Europe. Scania, which has manufactured in Brazil and Argentina for more than 25 years, uses its Latin American plants as part of a global manufacturing network. Engines made in Sao Paulo and gearboxes made in Tucuman could find their way into chassis built in Iran or France or Holland just as easily as those from Sweden, depending on production balance at any particular time. Among the old world manufacturers to be found in Brazil are Mercedes, Volvo, Ford, Scania and VW, although Iveco pulled out some years ago. Significantly, there is, as yet, little Japanese presence: it accounts for less than 1 per cent of truck output in Brazil's total of well over a quarter of a million. Mexico's industry is, perhaps inevitably, closer related to the US, its next-door neighbour, than to those in countries further south. US manufacturers with Mexican operations include Ford, Chrysler and GM, Freightliner in conjunction with Mercedes' international operations, Volkswagen, Cummins engines and Rockwell components among many others. The European presence is less prominent, but Perkins has had a diesel engine joint venture, as have a number of component specialists. Just as the major manufacturing operations of the 1990s began in a modest way a quarter of a century ago, so others have more recently begun the long industrial haul. Cuba builds its own diesel engines in a rationalised range of V6 to V12 units from 200 to 450 bhp, powering literally everything that moves, from trucks and urban railcars to fishing boats and combine harvesters. It has a surprisingly extensive components industry, making a variety of parts, from fuel injectors to semi-automatic gearboxes. The country's expanding population and free movement of labour demand extensive public transport, and Cuba's bus production is numbered in thousands rather than hundreds a year. There was a promising export trade in buses until the collapse of the east European bloc, but nowadays just a trickle goes out, mainly to African nations with leftwing governments. Given reasonable political stability, Cuba has every chance of joining that growing band of third world nations which aspire to 'supplier' rather than 'consumer' status. Modest assembly operations have been going on in Peru and Venezuela for more than a decade, but to date they show little sign of development into viable manufacture. Colombia assembles a modest number of light commercials, mainly of Chrysler and Renault origin, but heavy trucks are imported. In a relatively short period and largely by its own efforts, Latin America has been transformed from a large market for old world suppliers to something approaching self-sufficiency. Indeed, the US buys more commercial vehicles from Latin America than it sells there. That trend can be seen elsewhere in the world, simply because it makes economic sense.</p>

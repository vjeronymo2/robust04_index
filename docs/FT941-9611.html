			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: No sign of evidence Sir, If public service minister, William Waldegrave, has evidence to show that market testing has led to savings of 25 per cent, together with improvements in the quality of 1 in 3 of the services tested, why does he continue to refuse to publish a single piece of evidence to substantiate these claims? ('Public work totalling Pounds 1.1bn put out to tender', February 8). Only recently, a whole series of obviously co-ordinated parliamentary answers from each department of state refused to give MPs any information on the level of savings that had accrued from their market testing programmes. Each answer was also carefully worded to indicate that, while at some point in the future overall figures for savings would be released, these would not be broken down by individual market tests. The minister's remarks on quality must also be taken with a huge pinch of salt. As one of our main criticisms of the whole market testing process is precisely that the new contracts for services do not contain mechanisms for properly checking and monitoring quality, the assertion that services are already getting better is ridiculous. Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary, The Civil and Public Services Association, 160 Falcon Road, London SW11 2LN</p>

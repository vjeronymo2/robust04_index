			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets conducted </F> by Aleksandr Golyayev under the "In the Russian Federation  Government" rubric; place and date not given: "Where Unpaid  Debts End Up"]    [Text] Questions concerned with setting up investment  funds in the fuel and energy complex and measures to regulate  the system of tariffs for electricity and heating in 1994 were  discussed at the latest session of the government commission on  current issues. Prior to it First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets  gave a briefing to Russian journalists.    [Soskovets] The main thing is to solve the problem of  inflation. Credit will be allocated more strictly and we will  have to get down to organizing production at the same time.  What does that mean? The system of settlements must be  adjusted, not in the sense that the budget be used to clear  enterprises' reciprocal debts but in the sense of helping those  who are linked by a common manufacturing process or  production-sharing relationship to find a mutually acceptable  method. Pricing policy must be improved. Prices for services,  transport, and energy are going to grow, and the government's  actions in that area must be understood by all.    [Golyayev] Oleg Nikolayevich, I have heard people say that  the whole problem of the state's insolvency is down to  enterprises and the debts owed by one plant to another or one  sector -- subcontractors -- to another. The government, which  is failing to draw up a program to regulate relations among  enterprises, is guilty.    [Soskovets] The problem of nonpayments is a topical one, and  here one thing is bound up with another: Enterprises don't have  money and consequently the state's pocket is empty.  Manufacturers are a prime source of finance for the exchequer.  But what are they doing to ensure they get back what they are  owed? Nonpayments have always existed, and I know from my own  experience that whether an enterprise recovers the money it has  earned depends to a large extent on its leader. If you just sit  around and wait, you won't get a red cent. The money doesn't  disappear, after all, it's there, someone who does not deem it  necessary to return it unless he receives a demand has got it in  his possesion.    Let's take the chain constituted by VAZ [the Volga  Automobile  Plant], the Lipetsk metallugical combine, Vorkutaugol, and the  Lebedinskiy ore-dressing combine. One provides raw materials,  another the power supply, a third the sheet metal, and the  fourth the actual vehicles. They have reciprocal debts while  the Zhiguli is the most popular, if one may put it that way,  automobile on sale, but money does not move along the chain.  That is to say, there are structures -- commercial or banking  -- which find this advantageous. How will the government help  here? Under market relations the government does not lay down  the law, people have to be accustomed to be self-reliant. I  asked the leaders of VAZ: What's the problem? You will  understand, they answered: the structures of the stores are  such... But who founded LogoVAZ? Make your demands there!    You have the same situation with petroleum: There is the  well-refinery-gas station chain. The product is in great  demand, but there's no money. And what's the government's got  to do with this? Yes, it is a taxing, dreary chore prising  money out of people, but it has to be done -- links must be  forged, otherwise you go bankrupt.    [Golyayev] Has the "beefing" about nonpayments within  sectors been exaggerated, are there people doing this  deliberately?    [Soskovets] I'm not in doubt. There are many ways of  "wearing down" a debtor -- the tax police, the tax inspectorate,  and much else besides. You have to act rather than waiting to  hear what the government will say on this score. While people  are waiting for a piece of paper from above, there's no knowing  where tens of trillions of rubles are fetching up.    Many examples of proper market relations could be cited  where  goods are delivered on time and paid for in full. We have  people in this country who understand the market and know how to  work and live not just in terms of the present. Unfortunately,  the majority ask the state to provide, and if they receive  nothing they curse the government for not having organized the  system of reciprocal settlements and for consequently being the  wrong kind of reformers.</p>

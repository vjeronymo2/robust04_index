			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Robertson drops bid for UPI REV Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who once had presidential ambitions, will not proceed with his Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.2m) takeover of United Press International, the loss-ridden news agency. He told a Washington news conference yesterday that a review of UPI's finances and operations had shown that 'its economics just don't seem to make sense'. He said he might submit a bid for one or two of the company's assets, including possibly its name, later in the day. Mr Robertson, who runs the Christian Broadcasting Network, emerged as the only bidder for all of UPI at a bankruptcy hearing last month. He was given 30 days to inspect its books, during which time he has been paying the 500 staff still working at the agency. Advisers had told him he would have to spend about Dollars 31m on UPI over the next 18 months to make the news agency notionally viable, but with no guarantee of commercial success. He noted wryly that his own broadcasting company had recently dropped UPI's service in favour of Associated Press. There had been speculation that Mr Robertson might use UPI as a vehicle for proselytising his fundamentalist beliefs, a prospect which alarmed Kyodo, the Japanese news wire service and the agency's largest remaining client.</p>

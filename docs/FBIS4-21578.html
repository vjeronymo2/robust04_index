			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Repirt by ITAR-TASS correspondent veronika romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- Russia's atomic industry  will be ready to stop the production of weapon-grade plutonium  by late 1994. A Russo-American agreement to this effect is  planned to be signed as early as in summer. The arrangement was  reached during a visit of Russian specialists to the United  States, Valeriy Bogdan, business manager of the Russian Ministry  of Atomic Energy, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday.    Three reactors producing weapon-grade plutonium continue to  operate in Russia (one in Krasnoyarsk-26 and two in Tomsk-7).  But these are dual-purpose reactors. They supply energy and  heating not only to Krasnoyarsk-26 and Tomsk-7, but also to  regional centres. The Ministry of Atomic Energy planes to phase  out these reactors in 1997-1998. Their service life is almost  completed. District power plants will be built instead.    Storages in Russia are now filled to the limit with  weapon-grade plutonium and with plutonium released from  dismantled nuclear weapons. There are large plutonium  stockpiles in Russia and in the United States and there is no  sense in continuing to manufacture plutonium.    However, Russia is now short of funds, and from the  economical viewpoint it cannot stop plutonium-producing reactors  and replace them with district power plants. Valeriy Bogdan  believes it is necessary to reach agreement with the United  States so that it help resolve the financial problem. The  United States has stated the intention of helping to get funds,  without giving guarantees of money, he said.</p>

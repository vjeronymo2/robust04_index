			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETARDED TO TRY HANDS AT 'POWER GARDENING'  </P> <P> The barren land stretches for miles, with no greenery to soften the glare of  sunlight off silvery electrical towers, prolific brown weeds and broken glass.  </P> <P> But this fall a group of mentally retarded people, some with physical handicaps  as well, will plant a garden on more than an acre of the Los Angeles Department  of Water and Power's 2 1/2 miles of vacant right-of-way property in North  Hollywood.  </P> <P> The specially designed garden, to be planted on Whitnall Highway under DWP  power lines, is intended to spruce up the community and provide therapy for the  32 mentally retarded clients of VISTAS, a nonprofit program for mentally  handicapped people with emotional problems, said Kathleen Lynch, executive  director of the Panorama City-based organization.  </P> <P> The group will invite non-handicapped residents of the area to cultivate plots  on the property in January, she said.  </P> <P> The garden project was hailed by city officials and community activists as an  ideal way to get the blight-ridden neighborhoods near Whitnall Highway to  blossom. And DWP officials said the project will offer insights into what to do  with the largely vacant, trash-strewn land under their power lines in North  Hollywood.  </P> <P> "We've tried this kind of thing with other organizations and found that after a  few months, people walk away from it," said Lee Moussafir, DWP's chief real  estate officer. "But these folks seem like they're really trying to accomplish  a purpose."  </P> <P> Moussafir said the department rents much of the 1,500 miles of rights of way it  owns in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties to nurseries and other  businesses for about $1,200 a year per acre. But he said the agency has had  difficulty leasing vacant rights of way in North Hollywood because growers and  other tenants apparently fear that their plants and goods will be stolen.  </P> <P> The DWP would rather rent the land than keep it vacant because of soaring  maintenance costs, Moussafir said. "It's hard to keep up with the demand," he  said. "We get a call from one location to remove a sofa, and the next week, we  get another call about some other trash at the same site."  </P> <P> Under its arrangement with VISTAS, the department will issue a license to the  University of California's extension service to run the garden for two years on  a trial basis, Moussafir said. The university's federally funded Common Ground  Urban Gardens program, which teaches low-income groups, the elderly and youths  to grow their own food, will maintain the property and train VISTAS staff  members and clientele in gardening skills, he said.  </P> <P> The project will cost about $54,000, in part because of special features such  as 2-foot-high raised beds to make it easier for those with cerebral palsy to  dig in the dirt, said Sherl Hopkins, demonstration projects coordinator for  Common Ground.  </P> <P> The Kaiser-Permanente Community Service Program has donated $5,000 to VISTAS  for the program, and the rest is being funded by the state and federal  governments, Lynch said.  </P> <P> Two VISTAS staff members have already received 11 weeks of training from Common  Ground. Since June, they have been running a small version of the North  Hollywood garden project at the Sepulveda Garden Center, a community garden run  by the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks at Hayvenhurst Avenue and  Magnolia Boulevard.  </P> <P> "It's making a tremendous difference already," Lynch said. "One of our autistic  clients had been afraid to do anything and would never get his hands dirty. But  ever since he's been working in the garden, seeing he can make tomato plants  grow, he's become so much more open and talkative."  </P> <P> Moussafir said the department will consider allowing other community activists  to use the vacant rights of way. Kurt Hunter, president of the North Hollywood  Residents Assn., said the vacant property represents "an incredible  opportunity" to transform power line routes in North Hollywood from barren  urban scars into parkland.  </P></p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Canadians buy into Peru power Ontario Hydro, the world's fourth-largest power company, is making its first incursion into Latin America. In association with Chilquinta, a Chilean electricity company, it has bought a 60 per cent stake in Edelsur, one of Peru's formerly state-owned electricity businesses. Edelsur covers the southern half of the capital, Lima. The consortium, known as Ontario Quinta, bid more than Dollars 212m for a controlling stake. The northern sector, Edelnor, was sold for Dollars 176.5m to a Peruvian-Chilean-Spanish consortium. The principal partners are Spain's Endesa, and Enersis and Chilectra of Chile. Perelec, a third consortium made up of Electricite de France and SAUR, both of France, Houston Industries of the US and Peru's Banco Wiese's investment arm, bid only for Edelsur, but their offer was some Dollars 75m lower than Ontario-Quinta's. The nationwide generation and distribution company, Electroperu, will also be sold.</p>

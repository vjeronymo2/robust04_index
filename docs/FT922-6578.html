			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jackson tumbles Pounds 1.55m into loss Jackson Group, the Ipswich-based engineering and construction concern, fell Pounds 1.55m into the red in 1991 compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 827,000 previously. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 59.3m. Some Pounds 1m (Pounds 550,000) of the loss was as a result of the reduction in value of dealing property stock. After a tax credit of Pounds 498,000 (Pounds 134,000 charge) the loss per share amounted to 4.9p (3.2p earnings). However, the directors are recommending a final dividend of 1p (2.2p) for a 2p (3.2p) total.</p>

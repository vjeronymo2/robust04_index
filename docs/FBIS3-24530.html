Lomonosov; UDC 547.963.32.057:542.95]    [Abstract] Automated solid-phase amidophosphite methods  (Victoria-4M and Applied Biosystems 380B systems) were employed  for the synthesis oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing  2'-amino-2'-deoxyribopyridine nucleosides residues. The 12  compounds were 5 to 20 nucleotides long, some of which  corresponded to stretches of 5S rRNA of E.coli. Oligonucleotides  bearing 2'-amino-2'-deoxyribopyridines withstood acid  hydrolysis, with the amino groups undergoing acetylation and  reacting with FITC to form fluorescent compounds. CD spectra and  melting studies showed that the 2'-amino-2'-deoxypyridine  moieties destabilized DNA-duplexes. Comparative evaluation  indicated that such derivatized oligodeoxyribonucleotides with a  high G:C content may find application as hybridization probes;  similar arguments apply to derivatives with modifications on the  3'- or 5'-ends of the oligonucleotides.

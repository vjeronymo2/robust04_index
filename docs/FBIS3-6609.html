			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan-U.S. Accord on Mobile Phone Not </F> Complete"]    [Text] Japan-U.S. negotiations on the mobile phone issue  have concluded. As in past negotiations, Japan made concessions  while the United States took a hard-line attitude, and the  results of the negotiations are difficult to assess.    Facing a U.S. deadline on the imposition of sanctions and  amid growing distrust, the two governments eventually came to an  agreement on opening Japan's mobile phone market. We wonder  what the result would have been if negotiations had ended in  failure. The United States would have announced a list of trade  items subject to sanctions. Japan would have appealed to the  GATT. The result would have been a further deterioration in  relations between the two countries.    We welcome the results of the negotiations because a further  deterioration of relations between Japan and the United States  would not only be unprofitable for the two countries, but would  have a negative impact on the international community.    Analyzing the details of the agreement, however, we cannot  say "there is no problem" with it. In particular, the Japanese  Government adopted a questionable line during the negotiations.    One reason is the impression left that the "conventional  settlement method"--in which Japan yields to U.S. Government  pressure--was applied to the negotiations.    The Japanese Government originally stressed that the U.S.  position ran counter to previous agreements between the two  countries. There is no doubt that Motorola's contention was  partly unreasonable. Motorola made much of the fact its market  share in Japan had not increased and that the responsibility for  this lay on the Japanese side. We think that position is a bit  farfetched.    But the Japanese Government finally went into reverse.  Immediately after the United States hinted it would take  sanctions measures, the Japanese Government made concessions  which contradicted its original position.    We are not saying making concessions is wrong. The  government said that "there is no pressure behind Japan's  compromise" and discounted the view that Japan had yielded to  threats by the United States. However, judging from the  negotiating process, we get impression that Japan yielded to  U.S. pressure. And contrary to Japan's wishes, there is the  possibility that U.S. distrust of Japan will grow. For this  reason, Japan should bid farewell to its conventional method of  settling issues.    Another reason is that the agreement on increasing ground  radio stations and assigned frequencies for Motorola-type mobile  phone--a focal point in the issue of opening the mobile phone  market--is vague, and may provide ammunition for future  discussions.    The two governments are already at cross-purposes about how  to interpret a statement that "the Government of Japan will take  all available measures to ensure compliance with the private  sector's commitments." The Japanese Government says it cannot  guarantee a private contract. However, the U.S. Government  interprets Japan's agreement to increase relay stations for the  Motorola-formula cellular phone service as a "objective  criterion," saying the Japanese Government has guaranteed the  fulfillment of the agreement.    It is possible the United States will apply pressure to  Japan  by saying "you must carry out your promise." We believe the  major aim of the recent failed economic framework talks was to  confirm Japan's rejection of U.S. pressure. We do not want see  the government continuing to make "vague" agreements any more.  Shelving important issues will only worsen the situation and  increase U.S. distrust.    From the point of view of consumers, the government should  create a more open, transparent market by deregulation. This is  what the government must do and this is the way to win the  international support.    The government is scheduled to come up with new market  opening measures this month aimed at resuming the economic  framework talks. This time, the government has to hammer out  persuasive, substantial measures which will bring profit to the  consumers and lead to the promotion of reform of the industrial  structure.    Taking advantage of this opportunity, we want to say that  U.S. economic policy will lose international support if it  continues its "results-oriented" steamroller attitude which  ignores the economic environment. The United States needs to  take a calm attitude on economic issues.</p>

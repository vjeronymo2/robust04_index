			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Solution to league tables Sir, It is amazing what you can do with statistics. Three years ago I presented the head master's special prize at St John's College School, Cambridge, to a boy who, according to the senior school for which he was aiming, had scored high marks in his Latin common entrance papers. He had not taken Latin at all. The latest league tables from the Department for Education give the impression - and impressions can be as important as facts - that only 85 per cent of Rugby's GCSE candidates gained five or more A-C grades ('Independents remain at top in A-levels and GCSEs', November 17). Your article refers rather disparagingly to the GCSE performance (my italics) at Repton, Rugby and Haileybury, thus reinforcing the misleading statistics. The cohort decided on by the DFE for these statistics in fact included, among other anomalies (young sixth formers), 15 pupils who were not taking their main group of GCSEs. Although we went through all of this shemozzle last year I am sad that some newspapers continue to present such misleading figures without sufficient explanation. In this age group, 94 of the 95 candidates at Rugby who took five or more subjects gained grades A-C; this represents a figure of 98.9 per cent. The best solution for next year - league tables are certainly here to stay - is surely for the DFE to present statistics by year group rather than age, or (if it sticks to the age group) to show the results of those who have actually taken five or more subjects. If the DFE does not do this a very special head master's prize will have to be invented for it. Michael Mavor, head master, Rugby School, Warwickshire CV22 5EH</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Bonn is anxious to spread its burden GERMANY, by far the largest donor and international lender to the former Soviet Union, is going to the Washington conference determined to spread the load. If all sources of aid and credit committed since September 1990 were put together, EC members would have provided about 75 per cent of the total, and Germany alone 57 per cent, according to figures from the European Commission. That includes food and medical assistance as well as export credits and credit guarantees, balance of payments support, specific payments to finance the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germany, the dismantling of nuclear missiles and technical assistance. 'Given the importance of the reform process in the Commonwealth of Independent States for the future of the whole world, the burden must be fairly borne on all shoulders,' the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday. 'Failure of the reform process will not only have a negative effect on one country, or even one group of countries, but on the whole world.' At the same time, thanks to its aid efforts, Germany has the best experience of how carefully aid must be targeted within the CIS. The leading non-governmental aid agencies argue that blanket food aid, and private programmes of aid parcels, are not what is needed. 'We must have patience and not rush into sending assistance,' says Mr Peter von Oy, chief executive of the Care agency. 'The European Community kept saying aid must go at once, at once, at once. I kept saying it is far more important to ensure it is properly distributed. 'Food is not necessarily what is most needed: medical aid is even more urgent. But in the medical field we need measures which will last for a few years: which will mean progress and change. 'It is not just a question of sending medicines which will be accepted officially, but which are simply unheard of in Russia. They don't know how to use them.' Germany is proud of the DM400m (Pounds 140.8m) private aid effort launched last winter. Yet this showed that initiatives like food aid parcels sent through the post fail to reach the needy and could create resentment among recipients. As a result, groups like the Red Cross and Care have focused on specific aid programmes or targeted particular areas, like the Chernobyl radiation zone. The Foreign Ministry, which has co-ordinated the German aid programme, is also switching its focus from immediate short-term food aid, to medium- and long-term assistance.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Observer: Plumber on board The City's blue-chip merchant banks often like to lend their directors to the boards of companies performing below par. So perhaps the arrival of Jeremy Lancaster, chairman of Wolseley, as a non-executive director of Kleinwort Benson, proves that it can be a two-way process. Kleinwort, currently searching for a chief executive, has seen better days whereas Lancaster is one of Britain's more successful industrialists. Given that he is also the son of Wolseley's founder, he knows what it's like to be brought up in a family firm which needed to change its ways. His success during his 17 years at the Wolseley helm has been based on great attention to detail and a restlessness which has kept his management on their toes. However, getting this simple message across to the other 22 directors around the Kleinwort boardroom table could prove a challenge. Hope he didn't take the job just because he was flattered by Kleinwort's interest in him.</p>

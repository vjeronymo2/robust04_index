			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESPRIT'S SUSIE TOMPKINS BUYS HER HUSBAND'S SHARE OF CLOTHIER  </P> <P> In a surprising twist to the long-running family feud at Esprit de Corp.,  co-founder Susie Tompkins and a group of investors said Friday that they have  bought the half owned by her estranged husband.  </P> <P> Susie Tompkins, sounding euphoric in a telephone interview, declined to reveal  how much she and the investors paid to Doug Tompkins. Sales of San  Francisco-based Esprit, a trend-setting maker of casual clothing for juniors  and children, at one time topped $1 billion but last year were reportedly $800  million.  </P> <P> The agreement between the Tompkinses, whose bickering over Esprit's direction  had frayed morale at the company, was negotiated at the 11th hour as investment  banker Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. was in the process of receiving and analyzing  bids from a variety of outside firms.  </P> <P> Esprit was put on the auction block after Doug Tompkins passed on the chance to  buy out his wife for $350 million, a figure set by Goldman Sachs. However, he  said earlier this month that he hoped to get the company at auction for less.  </P> <P> But Monday, according to his wife, he had a change of heart when it became  evident that control might pass to outsiders, most likely foreign investors.  While on vacation in Arizona, Susie Tompkins received a faxed letter from her  husband indicating his desire to negotiate a settlement. She flew home the next  day, and the two put lawyers to work around the clock to hammer out a plan.  </P> <P> On Friday, Susie Tompkins said, the two celebrated the deal with a "tearful,  happy, laughing" lunch at a former favorite haunt, surprising the personnel  there, who had not seen the couple together since they filed for divorce last  year.  </P> <P> "It's a wonderfully happy ending," Susie Tompkins said. "It became evident (to  Doug) how important it was to keep it in the family."  </P> <P> Doug Tompkins, an avid outdoorsman and rock climber, said in a statement that  he intends to devote time to the environment and other causes. He will retain  his interest in Esprit's operations in southern Europe and other foreign  affiliates.  </P> <P> Among the investors on Susie Tompkins' team are Isaac Stein, who has served as  her representative on the Esprit board since 1988; Michael Ying, an Esprit  director and chairman of the Esprit Far East Group, the company's main buying  agent, and Bruce Katz, founder of the Rockport Shoe Co. After selling Rockport  to Reebok International in 1986, Katz (pronounced Kates) formed Rosewood Stone  Group, a private investment firm in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Stein, who is also president of Waverley Associates, a Palo Alto investment  firm, will become chairman of a new board. Corrado Federico will continue as  chief executive.  </P> <P> Susie Tompkins, 47, who was ousted a couple of years ago as the company's chief  designer, will once again take that role.  </P> <P> In the interview, she said she plans for the company to also design  contemporary lines for older customers. It was her wish to appeal to a more  mature customer that contributed to the rift with her husband, who favored  sticking with the younger styles. The company's clothing is now sold at 50  Esprit stores nationwide and in better department and specialty stores.  </P> <P> Contrary to earlier reports that the couple's rift resulted in a loss for  Esprit in 1987, Susie Tompkins said Esprit has never suffered an annual loss.  She added that it is soon expected to report its highest annual sales in  history.  </P></p>

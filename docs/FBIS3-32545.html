Compared with the "good old days" of the leading Antioquian  textile mills in early 1993, profits reported for the third  quarter of last year indicate that it was not a good year, nor  is the situation expected to improve in 1994.    Even though factories have not announced the results of  operations leading into 1993, smuggling, underbilling, and money  laundering combine to indicate that it is highly unlikely that  losses built up during the year will be recovered during the  final four months.    Another reflection of the situation appeared in December  when  Fabricato, COLTEJER [Colombian Textile Company], and Tejicondor  shares were among the five companies whose quotes suffered the  steepest drops.    COLTEJER, which in 1992 earned profits of 10 billion pesos,  ended the third quarter of 1993 with losses totaling 7.336  billion pesos. Fabricato began 1993 with profits of 9.499  billion, but by the third quarter, results totaled scarcely 504  million.    In 1992, Tejicondor earned net profits of 3.565 billion  pesos. However, by the close of the third quarter, it had earned  only 526 million.  <H5>  More Smuggling </H5>   "We did lose money, but we still do not know how much," said  Tejicondor President Abel Perez Gil in summing up 1993, a year  that saw 3,000 workers laid off by the country's 500 textile  companies.    Perez reported that the company's sales were 18 percent  lower  than anticipated at the start of 1993. Last year, only 41  billion pesos worth of goods were sold, compared with a goal of  50 billion.    The president of Tejicondor believes that smuggling and the  government's inability to control it, despite its intention of  imposing port restrictions once again, are the basic causes of  the crisis we are facing, a crisis that in 1993 was merely  circumstantial, but that now threatens to become structural.    "How can we not need restrictions when we are drowning in  textiles as a result of underbilling and money laundering?" the  business executive asked.    In early 1993, the lack of minimum reference prices,  combined  with subsidized imports and smuggling, resulted in a loss of 30  percent of the domestic market.    According to Perez, "fabrics ranging from $.10 to $5.00 are  entering the country and, except for Medellin, Customs is not  going its job. Furthermore, any estimates of what comes in is  false. In addition, the only country with money laundering is  Colombia. A laundered dollar is worth only a fourth as much as  an official dollar."    The businessman said that while it is practically impossible  to ascertain the volume of textiles smuggled in or resulting  from money from drug trafficking, if Customs seized some 9  million meters of fabric in 1993 (equivalent to Tejicondor's  production for three months), much more has come in through  undetected operations.    According to these estimates, imported textiles have  garnered  some 30 percent of the market, and 70 percent of all imports  comprise unfair competition.    Textile workers claim that such measures as minimum import  prices for 31 types of textiles have not been as effective as  hoped either.    They say that, under the circumstances, despite the  government's encouraging predictions, the sector's problems will  be reflected in the coming annual balance sheets.    For the time being, the textile industry knows that the new  year has begun, accompanied by adjustments in investment  programs, possibly more layoffs of workers, and the discussion  of petitions in a number of companies.    All signs indicate that any hope of recovering first  semester  losses during the latter half of 1993 has been thwarted or, more  appropriately, unraveled. Consequently, the nation's textile  plants are reportedly on the brink of a crisis as serious as the  one experienced in the early 1980's.</p>

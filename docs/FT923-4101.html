			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Italians considering alternative to EFA Farnborough Air Show ITALY has begun considering a possible alternative to the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), raising doubts on its commitment to the Pounds 20bn collaborative project. Rome recently requested information about the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, Mr George Hibbard, a senior executive of the US manufacturer, said yesterday. Britain has been counting on Italy as its most solid ally in the EFA programme, the subject of reviews by both defence staffs and aircraft makers of the four countries involved. The multi-role F/A-18 has long been considered a principal rival to the EFA. Germany's decision this year to pull out of production plans for the EFA in its current form and seek European collaboration on a cheaper aircraft is widely expected to lead to further delays in the programme. Some observers believe the future of the EFA project will not become fully clear before the German elections of 1994. Italy urgently needs a new fighter to replace its ageing fleet of US F-104 Starfighters, increasingly costly to maintain. Spain, by contrast, has little pressing need, as it already possesses 72 F/A-18s ordered in the early 1980s. Washington backed a promotion campaign four years ago for a new version of the F/A-18 to be made in collaboration with European partners. Mr Hibbard said that campaign 'helped to bring the EFA consortium together', and that McDonnell Douglas was anxious to avoid making the same mistake now. Joseph Mann reports from Caracas: The Venezuelan Air Force is studying buying 10 Spanish-made Caza-212 passenger aircraft for about Dollars 31m (Pounds 15.5m), Gen Eutimio Fuguet Borregales, air force chief, said. Each can carry up to 25 passengers and cargo, land on short runways, and would be used to help develop Venezuela's border regions.</p>

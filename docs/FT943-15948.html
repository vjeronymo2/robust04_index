			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Menem condemns 'senseless' union protest Thousands of demonstrators yesterday converged on Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, for a rally against the government's economic policies as President Carlos Menem criticised the nationwide protest by public sector unions as 'senseless'. The president said that the so-called Federal March, the largest protest against his free-market reforms since he took office in mid-1989, was 'a direct blow to the country, not the government'. 'It's a senseless and aimless march,' Mr Menem said. 'They will achieve absolutely nothing.' The streets of Buenos Aires were nearly empty early yesterday as police cordoned off access routes to guarantee security during the rally, which drew thousands of disgruntled civil servants, students and a handful of farmers. The march, backed by trade unions and political parties ranging from the hard left to the ultra-nationalist right, set off from Argentina's northern and southern tips on Monday. By noon yesterday, some 16,000 protesters had reached the capital and the count was expected to hit 40,000 as four huge convoys of buses wound their way into the city. Worried about the possibility of riots, similar to the outbreaks that rocked several provinces earlier this year, the government sent 20,000 policemen into the streets of the city. Mr Menem, whose sights are set on re-election next year, dismissed the possibility of popular endorsement of the march, arguing that his fellow-citizens would not spurn a programme which had brought inflation down to its lowest levels in four decades. 'Argentines are not going to shoot themselves in the foot,' he said. He also appealed for support from employers, urging them to punish workers by docking pay for days spent absent at protests.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Plutonium vessel docks in Japan A JAPANESE vessel carrying a controversial shipment of plutonium docked early today after a two-month voyage from France that has attracted severe international criticism. The Akatsuki Maru, carrying one ton of plutonium destined for a trial fast-breeder reactor, entered a purpose-built port at Tokai, which is near the nuclear research plant and is about 120km north-east of the Japanese capital, after one of the longest non-stop voyages by a commercial ship. It was ringed by a dozen coastguard vessels, and a boat chartered by Greenpeace, the environmental group, trailed nearby. On shore 2,000 police prepared for protests planned by anti-nuclear activists who claim the voyage has been dangerous and unnecessary. During the Akatsuki Maru's journey, about 10 countries warned Japan that the vessel should not enter their territorial waters and complained about being left in the dark about the cargo's potential dangers. The sustained criticism prompted the government to hint that plans to import about 30 tons of plutonium this decade would be reconsidered. The high security on the voyage was in response to concerns that the load could be a target for terrorists seeking to build nuclear weapons. However, the voyage was incident-free, apart from a dispute with a vessel owned by Greenpeace. About 70 vessels from the Maritime Safety Agency will secure the port during the unloading of the vessel. Unloading of the 15 containers holding the plutonium is expected to last until tomorrow morning.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Japan's foreign exchange  reserves jumped 3.305 billion dollars in March to 101.737  billion dollars, posting the fifth consecutive month-to-month  increase, the Finance Ministry said Friday [1 April]. Market  dealers said they had anticipated the surge as the Bank of Japan  was seen selling the yen actively for dollars to stem its rise  in the reporting month.    The foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies,  gold and international monetary fund special drawing rights.  The March-end balance hit a record high, breaching a previous  high of 100.36 billion dollars posted in April 1989.    The official, as usual, declined to comment on details and  reasons for the change in the foreign reserves when briefing  reporters.    Market experts closely follow fluctuations in foreign  reserves as evidence of intervention by the Bank of Japan, and  dealers said the central bank bought some 3 billion dollars in  March to stop the yen's rise.    The ministry official said the dollar started the month at  104.70 yen and ended at 102.80 yen, ranging from 102.52 posted  on March 30 to 106.58 yen marked on March 24.    Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign  reserves  for the fifth month in a row, amassing 96.0 billion dollars as  of January, the most recent figure comparable with those of  other nations.    Germany came in second with 85.7 billion dollars, followed  by  Taiwan with 84.8 billion dollars. The United States posted 74.9  billion dollars in December, the latest available month. Spain  marked 42.1 billion dollars in January.</p>

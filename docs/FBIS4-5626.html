			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First installment of unattributed article: "Outlook: </F> Personnel Appointments in Kasumigaseki"]    [Text] The season of personnel appointments has come to the  central government offices in Kasumigaseki. Although each  ministry tries to build a new setup before the Diet session ends  in late June, the arrangements may not be completed until July  due to the confusion in politics. While many ministries are  said to be concentrating on strengthening their organizations by  seniority promotions this year amid the increasing criticism of  bureaucrats, the personnel changes of some ministries are to be  watched, such as the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI], which was in an uproar over the issue of MITI's  Industrial Policy Bureau Chief Masahisa Naito's resignation; the  Ministry of Finance [MOF], which carries the major task of tax  reform; and the Ministry of Construction [MOC], which is being  criticized for general contractors scandals. This year's  personnel appointments are likely to draw more attention than  usual.  <H5>  MITI </H5>   The dispute in which Naito was dismissed as Industrial  Policy  Bureau chief by MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai late last year for  giving a preferential promotion to the son of Yuji Tanahashi,  former MITI vice minister, still casts a blight over the  ministry, and its personnel appointments for June is quite  uncertain. At this point, the chances are that Administrative  Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano (entered the ministry in 1960;  hereafter, the numbers in parenthesis indicates the year the  person became a bureaucrat) will remain in office and work to  settle the confusion.    In this case, Kumano's contemporary, Sozaburo Okamatsu,  deputy vice minister; Tomio Tsutsumi (1962), who succeeded Naito  as Industrial Policy Bureau chief; and Yoshihiro Sakamoto  (1962), chief of the International Trade Policy Bureau, are all  expected to stay in their posts.    On the other hand, in and outside the ministry, there is a  view that Kumano will resign to take responsibility for the  situation. In this case, the personnel changes will be fluid,  but, a plan to shift Okamatsu to the vice minister's post is  most likely. Nevertheless, there is another view that Tsutsumi,  who heads the Industrial Policy Bureau, will be promoted to  administrative vice minister, a normal practice since a deputy  vice minister becoming an administrative vice minister has no  precedent.    In either scenario, Hideki Osada (1963), director general of  the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, and Wataru Aso (1963),  director general of the Patent Office, who are in MITI's  extra-ministerial bureaus, are likely to retire voluntarily.  There is a possibility that Tetsuo Nakata (1964), chief of the  Defense Agency's Equipment Bureau, will be appointed director  general of the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency; and Hisashi  Hosokawa (1964), chief of MITI's Basic Industries Bureau, will  be appointed director general of the Patent Office. In this  case, Tadashi Ezaki (1965), director general for MITI Minister's  Policy Coordination Secretariat is the candidate to succeed  Hosokawa as Basic Industries Bureau chief. The post of Akira  Takashima (1963), chief of the Industrial Location and  Environmental Protection Bureau, is also expected to be  replaced.    Tsutomu Makino (1963), director of the MITI Secretariat, is  likely to stay in his post, but in case of his replacement, the  promotion of Osamu Watanabe (1964), chief of the Machinery and  Information Industries Bureau, to Makino's post is most likely.  Then, Watanabe will be succeeded by Katsuhiro Nakagawa (1965),  chief of the International Trade Administration Bureau, and  Nakagawa's post will be taken over by Hisamitsu Arai (1966),  deputy chief of the Machinery and Information Industries Bureau.  <H5>  MOC </H5>   To continue to reorganize the construction administration,  which has been criticized even more due to the recent bribery  scandals involving general contractors, Shigeo Mochizuki (1959),  administrative vice minister of construction, is very likely to  remain in office. The [MOC] has a custom of appointing  officials specializing in technology and those in administration  to the post of administrative vice minister by turns. So if  Mochizuki, who is an administrative specialist, does not retire,  the next vice minister candidate, Haruho Fujii (1962), vice  minister of engineering affairs, who is technological  specialist; and the next candidate but one, MOC Secretariat  Director Noboru Ban (1963), who is from the administrative side,  will stay in their posts. In that case, the personnel changes  will mainly concern bureau chief level officials, and be  relatively minor.    However, a possibility still exists for a major personnel  change if voices to hold MOC executives responsible for the  scandals increase.  <H5>  National Land Agency </H5>   Ichiro Ichikawa (1961), administrative vice minister of  national land, will retire voluntarily after the current Diet  session ends, and Secretariat Director Kazuhito Fujiwara (1962)  will be promoted to the vice minister's position. In principle,  the vice minister's post is held by officials from the MOC and  the MOF alternately. MOC Housing Bureau chief Yasuhisa Mitsui  (1963) will succeed Fujiwara, who was from the MOF, as director  of the Secretariat, and prepare for next year's appointment to  the vice minister's seat.    Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications    Administrative Vice Minister Futoshi Shirai (1959) is going  to retire voluntarily. Telecommunications Bureau Chief Haruki  Matsuno (1960), who has been taking the lead in creating an  environment for the multimedia age, is certain to become  Shirai's successor. Communications Policy Bureau chief Mitsuo  Igarashi (1963) will probably be appointed Telecommunications  Bureau chief, which is the position for a vice-minister-to-be  official.    Postal Savings Bureau chief Akemi Yamaguchi (1963) and  General Councilor Masahito Tani (1964), who was responsible for  the talks over cellular phones (automobile and hand-held phones)  between Japan and the United States, are among the list for the  post of Communication Policy Bureau chief. International  Affairs Department chief Yoshio Utsumi (1966) will be the next  general councilor. Postal Bureau chief Tadaaki Arai (1965) and  Secretariat Director Tsuyoshi Kimura (1966) are likely to stay  in their posts.  <H5>  Ministry of Foreign Affairs </H5>   Kunihiko Saito (1958), who took the office of administrative  vice minister last August, is likely to remain in his post.  While there are voices hoping for Treaties Bureau chief Minoru  Tanba (1962) to remain in his post because of the DPRK's nuclear  development issue, he will be transferred overseas as ambassador  around summer because his service at home has been long. Masaki  Orita (1965), consul general to Hong Kong, is likely to succeed  Tanba.  <H5>  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries </H5>   Upon completion of the Uruguay Round, executives, such as  the  administrative vice minister and Food Agency director general,  were already replaced. Although the retirement of Deputy Vice  Minister Jiro Shiwaku (1959), who was responsible for the  [Uruguay Round] negotiations, is postponed to the end of May,  Economic Affairs Bureau chief Takeki Manabe (1963) has been  informally appointed to Shiwaku's post. Livestock Industry  Bureau chief Hisao Azuma (1964) is expected to be the next  Economic Affairs Bureau chief.  <H5>  Science and Technology Agency </H5>   Administrative Vice Minister Takuya Hirano (1959), who has  been in office for two years this June, will retire voluntarily,  and he will be succeeded by Kenichi Murakami (1960), deputy vice  minister of scientific councilors, who will be the third  administrative vice minister in a row from within the Science  and Technology Agency. Katsuhisa Ida (1962), director of the  Secretariat, and Fujio Sakauchi (1962), director of the National  Institute of Science and Technology Policy, are candidates for  deputy vice minister of scientific councilors.</p>

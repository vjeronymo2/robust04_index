			<p>BFN     [Text] The main purpose of the visit to Tajikistan by the  President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs is participation in a congress of the Tajik Union  of Science and Industry on Wednesday [25 May]. He disclosed  this to INTERFAX on Monday in Dushanbe where he arrived as the  head of a 23 person delegation.    Volskiy thinks the contacts of industrialists are now  extremely necessary for both Russia and Tajikistan because there  is a burning need to discuss further cooperation and begin  seeking a way out of the crisis. "We cannot help it, because we  would find life difficult without each other," Volskiy said.    Asked about the expected results of the working visit  Volskiy  said an agreement with the Tajik union was drafted and Russian  businessmen would gladly sign it, if Tajik colleagues approved  it.    The visit will last till 26 May. On Tuesday Volskiy is to  meet the chairman of parliament Emomali Rakhmonov.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Plan to curb phone ads for bogus jobs TOUGHER measures to curb the growing practice of advertising bogus jobs via premium-rate telephone numbers were proposed yesterday by the industry watchdog. The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) said unemployed people were being encouraged by unscrupulous operators to call premium-rate numbers at a cost of up to 48p a minute. The jobs advertised sometimes did not exist, but the advertiser benefited by receiving more than half the cost of the call. ICSTIS has received an increasing number of complaints about 'work' services despite a code of conduct introduced this year to curb such abuses. A report published yesterday by ICSTIS concluded that work services should be banned from premium-rate lines unless they were provided directly by a potential employer rather than through an agent. It added that companies offending its code of conduct should be fined. ICSTIS would consider a ban on work services if that did not prevent abuses. ICSTIS said about 20 companies regularly provide work services. Answering Services, based in Bracknell, Berks, which was the subject of four complaints in September alone, refused to comment. Review into Work Services. ICSTIS, Kingsbourne House, 229-231 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7DA. Free.</p>

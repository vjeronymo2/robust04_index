			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Profit forecasts deal further blow to Japanese investors: The ebbing confidence in the Tokyo market Among the many blows raining down on investors in the Tokyo stock market this week, the heaviest have been warnings about the grim outlook for corporate profits. Gloomy forecasts published this week by leading securities groups have helped to squeeze the last drops of confidence out of the market. Yesterday, the Nikkei index fell 507.73 to 16,445.8, setting a new low for the fall in stock prices which began in 1990. Ten top brokers' research centres predicted pre-tax profits of large Japanese companies would fall in the current financial year which ends in March 1993 - it would be the first time since the Second World War that profits have fallen three years in a row. The brokers forecast an average decline of 9.9 per cent for all industries and of 12.9 per cent for manufacturing companies, which are more exposed to swings in the business cycle. Nomura Securities, the largest brokerage, predicted falls of 12.1 per cent and 15.5 per cent. The forecasts contrast sharply with corporations' own forecasts of declines averaging around 5 per cent, except for financial groups. Until a few months ago, many companies accepted the government's forecast of 3.5 per cent economic growth in the year to March 1993 and based their profits predictions on this figure. But there are growing doubts in Tokyo that the economy will actually grow at this speed. The stockbroking companies this week put themselves firmly in the pessimists' camp. For example, Nomura's profits forecasts are based on the assumption that growth will only reach 2 per cent this financial year and will recover only slowly to 2.8 per cent next year. Profits are being squeezed by this slowdown in the economy, as companies' incomes fall faster than costs, in spite of intense efforts to trim spending, run down inventories and reduce capital spending. Groups are cutting recruitment but cannot sack existing staff, except as a last resort. Companies also face increased depreciation charges from the huge investments made in the boom of the late 1980s, which totalled around Y400,000bn (Pounds 1,700bn) for the economy as a whole. Furthermore, borrowing costs for listed companies will rise as around Y15,000bn of equity-linked bond issues fall due by March 1994. Banks, seeking to boost their own profits, will attempt to extract better margins from borrowers. Smithers, a British securities research boutique, estimates that every 0.1 percentage point increase in borrowing costs reduces corporate pre-tax profits by 2 per cent. Finally, companies face further losses from the financial investments made in the speculative boom of the 1980s. For some groups, notably Sharp, the electronics group, financial revenues account for more than half of total profits. Even conservatively managed groups which put their funds into safe cash deposits face falling income as interest rates have fallen from their peak in 1990. A recovery in profits will depend crucially on a recovery in the economy. Even the government's Economic Planning Agency this week admitted it would be 'difficult but not impossible' to meet the official target of 3.5 per cent growth for the current year. Private sector economists even believe the forecast could be cut if more evidence of weakness in the economy emerges. But the EPA still believes that a recovery will come in the autumn. However, a slow recovery would mean a very weak rebound in profits. Nomura believes that profits in 1993-94 may rise only 9.6 per cent for leading non-financial companies. Yamaichi Securities foresees an increase of just 11.6 per cent. These figures will bring little joy to stock market investors. In spite of the near-60 per cent fall in the Nikkei index from its all-time high, Japanese stocks are not cheap. Stocks in the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange trade at around 40 times prospective earnings for 1992-93. That is well below the peak of 70 recorded in the late 1980s but is still near the top of the 20-to-40 range of the early 1980s. The implication is that investors still hope for a faster recovery in profits than the brokers are forecasting. They might possibly be right. The government and the Bank of Japan might act to boost the economy through increased public spending and further cuts in interest rates. Construction and interest-rate sensitive stocks might respond and lift the whole stock market. Economic policymakers at the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance have repeatedly said that executives' and investors' sentiment is worse than economic reality. If so, then sentiment could turn sharply once executives and investors realise that they are wrong. But there is precious little evidence this week of an imminent change of heart.

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Arts: A season of excellence from the BBC - Television What a tremendous season the BBC is having. Tonight BBC1 completes its unmissable series, Thatcher: The Downing Street Years. BBC2 screens the second episode of The Buddha Of Suburbia a four-part serial which, at least in its opening episode, was so much more subtle and telling than My Beautiful Laundrette that it is difficult to believe it was written by the same person. On Tuesdays BBC1 brings us the most powerful popular drama series for many years, Between The Lines, and last week's episode was one of the best yet. On the same night the same channel screened Michael Frayn's charming programme about Prague, 'Magic Lantern', in the Omnibus slot. The first in a new season of 'Performance' on Saturday was a production of Suddenly Last Summer which made you see the 1959 Hollywood version with Liz Taylor for the travesty it really was; and on Sundays BBC2 is offering a compelling series about the teaching of drama, Theatre School, followed later by Stendhal's Scarlet And Black on BBC1. In other words the BBC, an organisation still accused of being inefficient, over-expensive and ripe for privatisation, is currently giving us an outstanding series about recent politics; a contemporary drama serial about multiculturalism and social mores that is better than its creator's previous work which we were assured was the most glorious flower of the British film industry; a police series which meshes the ethical questioning of Law And Order with the entertainment of Hill Street Blues; a highly personal travel documentary combining information and entertainment in just the the way we have always been told British broadcasting should; a splendid version of a Tennessee Williams play with a magnificent performance from Natasha Richardson; an exemplary modern documentary series; and exactly the sort of classic literary adaptation that even the BBC's fiercest critics seem to agree it does better than anyone else. What is there in all the rest of television put together - ITV and Channel 4, satellite and cable - which can hold up its head in such company? So far as I can see, back in Britain just two weeks and still sampling the autumn season's new series though with little expectation now of any great surprises, just one ITV series from Granada: Cracker, in which Robbie Coltrane does everything that a good actor should when he is given a peach of a part. He gobbles it with glee, allowing the juice to run everywhere. Superb though his performance is, however, even this series has some small queries hanging over it: can writer Jimmy McGovern prevent Coltrane's character, an offbeat police psychologist named Fitz, tumbling into self parody; and, given that another series has already been commissioned, can he invent enough varied stories to justify Fitz always having a central role? Trying to talk someone out of a crisis is all very well, but every week? In Thatcher we have become used to the former prime minister talking herself out of innumerable crises as her account of her years in office progresses. The absolute consistency with which 'we' (as in 'We have become a grandmother', included tonight) claim all the credit for the successes while blaming others for the failures, has been breathtaking. Her account in today's programme of the parting of the ways between her and two of her chief ministers, Nigel Lawson and Geoffrey Howe, is staggering in its egocentricity. This incident provides a perfect example of the way that the television version scores so heavily over the book (Harper Collins, Pounds 25). At 914 pages the book is about twice as long as it ought to be, yet it is fairly easy reading. However, if you watch the television series first and then read the book you cannot but be struck by the two-dimensional nature of the printed version which, of course, supplies only the Thatcher line on events. In Denys Blakeway's television version the Thatcher words are often virtually identical to those in the book, but there are two crucial differences. First, the screen allows you to see how the lady's eyes gleam or narrow as she delivers them, and that can double the impact or even change the meaning. Secondly her words are often modified by an immediate reaction from somebody else. Tonight, for example, she suggests that when Lawson claimed to be resigning because of her preference for advice from Alan Walters, his real reason was the realisation that he had been responsible for inflation. In the book Thatcher's assertion stands unchallenged, but on television Lawson promptly pops up to denounce this as ludicrous. This series confirms something I have been suspecting for some years: that, far from being the vulgar magic lantern which book academics would have us believe, television can actually be a better medium for history than print, once you are dealing with the modern world in a period when there are news archives to be raided (as Blakeway does, naturally) and many of the key witnesses are still alive to be interviewed (as in this instance, where the cast list is astonishing: everyone from Reagan and Gorbachev to Ingham and Powell). Fifty years from now, who will turn first to the book if, instead, they can turn to this engrossing, far more revealing, and better rounded television series? You could hardly find a bigger contrast than that provided by Between The Lines, a drama series which has faint echoes of so many previous series from Z Cars to The Sweeney, though we may eventually conclude that this is the best of the lot. Watching last week's episode, written by Rob Heyland and directed by Roy Battersby, was a particularly fascinating experience for any fan of film noir who had watched Huston's 1950 movie The Asphalt Jungle on BBC2 on Sunday night. The received wisdom is that the old hard-boiled black and white American thrillers set a benchmark for crime drama which has rarely been matched subsequently, either in cinema or on television. Yet Between The Lines told a story of bungling and departmental rivalry (between MI5 and Special Branch) which was far more subtle and complex than any of the film noir classics. It did so within a framework in which all the detail was hugely satisfying, from the wicked comedy of the scene where the Home Office bigwig's assumption of a no-smoking policy was promptly ignored by all and sundry, to the nice ambiguity of the relationship between our hero, Tony Clark of the police's internal security division (Neil Pearson), and Angela Berridge from the Home Office (Francesca Annis). There has been a marked reduction in the activity which earned this series its alternative title of Between The Sheets, but it looked as though Clark, despite his deep distrust of the Ministry, was about to show his Achilles heel again, and probably a good deal more of his anatomy. As sheer entertainment this production rated very high, but it also had a serious question to ask about who should guard the guardians. If our security bodies will, indeed, lie in the competition to predominate, how on earth can the private citizen, or even the ordinary policeman, know whom to trust? There were hints of Kafka's world here, all the more effective for being contained within a classic bit of television crime drama. Who should take the credit for this outstanding showing from the BBC? The new channel controllers, Alan Yentob and Michael Jackson? Most of this season's series must have been commissioned before they came to power. John Birt then? Perhaps so; he has been wielding influence at a high level long enough for his appointments and ideas to have started having their effect on screen. But caution is advisable. Swings and roundabouts have always been the most important constituent in the contest within British television. It may be that ITV really is abandoning the high ground of programme quality in its pursuit of audience quantity, and that we are witnessing the first evidence of an important long-term change. On the other hand, the seesaw has swung wildly in the past and could easily do so again. Still, there is no mistaking the BBC's superiority at this moment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad arrived in Cairo at  the head of a delegation yesterday afternoon and immediately  began talks with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak.    In addition to the two presidents, the Egyptian prime  minister, defense minister, and foreign minister also  participated in the bilateral Egyptian-Syrian talks. The Syrian  side included the vice president and the country's foreign  minister. The focus of the al- Asad-Mubarak talks was on the  efforts for a compromise in the Middle East, although some  regional and international issues of mutual interest such as the  events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia were also discussed.    The unscheduled visit by Hafiz al-Asad to Egypt is  significant since within a few days Warren Christopher will be  visiting the Middle East region to reactivate the wheels of  diplomacy to achieve this compromise. In the course of this  visit, the U.S. secretary of state is to strive to resuscitate  the almost lifeless Washington- brokered Arab-Israeli talks.    These talks--which were resumed after a prolonged hiatus in  the wake of Clinton and al-Asad's meeting in Geneva--were  suspended by the Arab side after the al-Khalil [Hebron]  massacre. Informed sources predict that after Christopher's  visit and within the next 10 days these talks will resume in  Washington.    At present, the crisis in the Middle East will play a  decisive role in the array of political forces in this region.  Therefore, between Tel Aviv and Damascus is Cairo, which is the  base of the compromise and peace brokering.    While Damascus continues its role-playing in the peace  talks,  it is also a center for the Palestinians opposed to this  compromise and is a leader of the diplomacy of intense conflict  with the Zionist regime. On the other hand, Cairo is the base  of the colluding Palestinians and the center of the compromising  talks between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv.    Despite all this, the situation in the region, especially in  the wake of the Cold War and the departure of the Soviet Union  from the Middle East arena on the one hand and Mubarak's efforts  for attaining a special position in Washington's Middle-East  policies on the other, has brought Egypt and Syria closer  together. In fact, whenever Damascus wishes to gauge the  viewpoints of the United States and of the Zionist regime or to  convey its own views to them the Damascus-Cairo axis becomes  active.    Of course, the interim policies and strategies transpire  amid these tussles, more or less. In any case, Damascus has a  decisive role in the Middle East crisis both during wartime or  in the course of peace talks. Neither Washington nor Tel Aviv  and Cairo can nudge the process forward without taking into  account al-Asad's viewpoint on regional developments, certainly  not on a longstanding crisis such as that in the Middle East.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALESA IS FORCED INTO A RUNOFF;  </P> <P> POLAND: DARK-HORSE CANDIDATE TYMINSKI APPARENTLY FINISHES SECOND, OUTPOLLING  PRIME MINISTER. A SHOWDOWN VOTE WILL BE HELD DEC. 9.  </P> <P> An outsider in the Polish presidential sweepstakes jolted the political  leadership here Sunday by outpolling the prime minister to finish in second  place and throw the election into a second round Dec. 9, exit polls indicated.  </P> <P> Dark-horse candidate Stanislaw Tyminski, a 42-year-old self-made millionaire  who left Poland in 1970, living most of that time in Canada, had a projected  23.2% of the vote. His total was well behind that of Solidarity leader Lech  Walesa, the favorite in the race, who won 39.3% -- well short of the 50% total  required to win the office outright in the first round of voting.  </P> <P> In the first free presidential election in 45 years, Prime Minister Tadeusz  Mazowiecki's total was projected at 19.9% of the vote, a sharp rejection for  the dogged, gloomy-faced intellectual who has guided the Polish government  since August, 1989, setting the country on a difficult course of economic  reform.  </P> <P> The unofficial projections, announced on Polish television moments after the  polls closed, were made by the government polling agency working with a German  polling firm with wide experience in European elections.  </P> <P> The results were quickly read by political operatives as an indication of the  disenchantment of the electorate, which expects even more economic uncertainty  in the coming year.  </P> <P> "Tyminski means for me a no-confidence vote for political parties," said one  election night analyst on television. "It is a vote for a man who is a  professional, but not a professional politician."  </P> <P> Tyminski is an enigma in Polish politics. He left Poland nearly 21 years ago  for Canada and spent nine years in Peru. A businessman who made his fortune in  computer and electronics equipment, Tyminski recently returned to Warsaw with  his Peruvian wife and attracted Poles with his promise of quick profits for  those who work hard despite the depressed economy.  </P> <P> Agreement was general that Walesa would beat Tyminski handily in the runoff.  </P> <P> But there was a notable lack of jubilation at Walesa headquarters in Gdansk,  where aides of the fiery Solidarity leader had expected an outright,  first-round victory despite pre-election samplings suggesting that Tyminski was  running in second place ahead of Mazowiecki.  </P> <P> "I think people will come to their senses," said one Polish journalist. "In the  end, Poland is not going to elect someone no one has ever heard of for its  president."  </P> <P> "We have a crisis of trust, a crisis of authority . . . that is so deep that  the public is ready to vote for someone who comes from nowhere," said Krzystof  Krol, a manager for one of the minor parties in the election, whose strongly  nationalistic candidate won only 2% of the vote.  </P> <P> Tyminski campaigned actively in the election, arguing that his business acumen  equipped him to tackle the economic problems faced by the country. He brashly  attacked Mazowiecki as a "traitor" to Poland because of economic policies that,  he said, were leading the country into chaos and poverty.  </P> <P> He also capitalized on his image as an outsider who was free from past  entanglements either with the Communists or with Solidarity, whose noisy split  appeared to have left many voters disenchanted.  </P> <P> Walesa and Mazowiecki, old allies under Solidarity, divided the Solidarity rank  and file between them, often bitterly.  </P> <P> Walesa charged that the Mazowiecki government was moving too slowly to  privatize the economy and to remove the old Communist holdovers from positions  in government and industry. He argued that the public had begun to feel, as  they had under the Communists, a "them-versus-us" division between the people  and the government.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki countered that Walesa was a "destabilizing" force and that change  must come carefully. Mazowiecki's backers accused Walesa of acting purely out  of his ambition to win the presidency.  </P> <P> The exit polls Sunday indicated that Tyminski did especially well among voters  between the ages of 18 and 25, attracting nearly 30% of the votes of that  sector. Only Walesa, with 32%, did better among the youngest voters.  </P> <P> Tyminski also did well in the countryside and in towns under 10,000 population,  scoring about 27% of the vote in those areas. He did poorest in the large  cities -- Warsaw, Gdansk, Krakow and Lodz -- where he drew less than 10% of the  vote.  </P> <P> The conclusion drawn by many political observers was that Tyminski did well  among the least-sophisticated voters in the country.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki, whose government's agricultural policy has been under bitter attack  from farmers, was virtually deserted by voters in the rural areas, carrying  only 4% there.  </P> <P> Walesa, leader of the Solidarity movement that toppled communism last year and  a national hero, made no election night appearance. An aide, Jacek Merkel, said  that Walesa "is very serious about the second round of the election and will  not make any premature comments about his opponent." He said the results of the  vote point up Walesa's strong standing in Polish politics.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki turned up briefly at his Warsaw headquarters but said he would wait  for the official results to make a statement. "These first results," he added,  "are a sign of the sense of crisis in the country."  </P> <P> Tyminski, appearing at his headquarters to thank his campaign workers, said he  hopes to have a chance to debate Walesa before next month's runoff election. "I  have asked for this before," he said, "but no one was interested."  </P> <P> In Chicago, a Polish consular official said Sunday that Walesa drew 60% of  about 30,000 votes cast by Poles in North America on Saturday. Polish emigres  were invited to vote in several U.S. and Canadian cities, including Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki got 33% of the North American vote, with the remainder scattered  among the other candidates.  </P></p>

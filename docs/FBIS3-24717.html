			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 29 SAPA--The African National  Congress's [ANC] election manifesto spelt disaster for South  Africa and was a blueprint for a socialist state, the National  Party [NP] said on Saturday. In a statement, NP Director of  Information Marthinus van Schalkwyk said the ANC was totally  unrealistic and made promises they would never fulfil. The  massive state intervention proposed in, for instance, the field  of housing was exactly the kind of thing that would destroy the  economy and result in widespread unemployment and poverty, he  said.    "The ANC has not learnt from the collapse of the socialist  states in Africa and Eastern Europe," he said. Mr Van Schalkwyk  warned that if the manifesto ever became policy, South Africans  would pay much higher taxes.</p>

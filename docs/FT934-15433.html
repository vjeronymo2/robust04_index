			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / People: Harrison takes over at Sterling Roger Harrison, former chief executive of The Observer is taking over as chairman of Sterling Publishing, the company specialising in the publication of annuals and magazines - including Debretts. Roger Harrison, who has had wide managerial experience in the media, takes over from Mr Ronald Cohen, who has been chairman from 1985. Ronald Cohen became chairman after Apax Venture Capital took a major shareholding in Sterling as backers of a management buyout. Apax sold the final tranche of its original investment in January this year; Cohen's resignation is as a result of that disposal. Apart from being chief executive of The Observer and a council member of the Newspaper Publishers' Association for 20 years, Harrison is also deputy chairman of Capital Radio and a director of Trinity International Holdings and LWT Holdings.</p>

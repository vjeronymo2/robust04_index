			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa said Monday [20 June] Japan still wants North Korea to  come clean on its nuclear program.    "If nuclear weapons are created on the Korean peninsula,  this  would be a direct threat to Japan. It is our position to demand  everything be made clear, including the history of operations of  nuclear facilities," he told a House of Councillors Foreign  Affairs Committee meeting.    Kakizawa indicated he does not believe the United States  will  drop its demand that Pyongyang give a detailed report on the  history of its nuclear activities, given the growing prospect of  a diplomatic solution to the crisis.    "I don't understand that the U.S. is ready to let the past  pass without questions," he said.    Kakizawa was responding to surging optimism that a peaceful  solution will be found to the dispute over North Korea's  suspected nuclear arms program.    Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit last week to  Pyongyang led to an apparent breakthrough in the crisis, opening  the way for high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang.    After briefing U.S. officials over his talks last Thursday  and Friday with North Korean President Kim Il-song, Carter told  reporters he believes the crisis is over.    But Kakizawa echoed the official U.S. stance toward the  issue, which is more cautious than Carter's upbeat tone.    Kakizawa said unless negotiations are conducted under  international pressure, "There might be a possibility that North  Korea will not make its stance clear."    The foreign minister said the primary arena for negotiations  may shift from the United Nations to Washington-Pyongyang talks.    "The discussions at the United Nations may become low-key  once the U.S. and North Korea start preparatory talks for  high-level negotiations," he said.    While welcoming the latest developments, Kakizawa cautioned  against unreserved optimism, pointing to the track record of  negotiations with the communist country.    "The U.S. says it wants to follow up the move  diplomatically.  It happened once that a summit between North and South Korean  leaders failed to materialize after a proposal."</p>

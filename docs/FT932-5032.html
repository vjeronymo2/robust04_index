			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Property: Looking for the good life beyond Chianti-shire - Italy has many attractions for the second home-buyer. But, says the head must still rule the heart KEATS, Byron and Shelley have a lot to answer for. So do Goethe, Gregorovius and an army of German, French and Swiss writers, travellers and poets who elevated the cultural pilgrimage to Italy into a model for enlightenment. Their writings opened the gates to a flood of foreigners, for whom Italy represents all that is best in culture, architecture, food or just sun and society. While many pass through, some prefer to linger, strengthening their bonds by buying a piece of Italy they can call their own. Whether just for holidays or more permanently for retirement, Italy's language, climate and lifestyle have created a community of expatriates from Trondheim to Torquay, Sydney to San Francisco. But owning a second home is often a case of the heart ruling the head. While the concept may be unquestionable, practicalities and execution can leave much to be desired. For an unlucky few, a dream can turn into a nightmare. Take the Zurich businessman so entranced by the Chianti region between Florence and Sienna that he decided to run his company partly from there. One beautifully converted farmhouse, swimming pool and manicured garden later, the property is for sale. Even an autostrada-eating sports car and the sort of serious money that does not worry about leaving a house unoccupied have not compensated for a basic misjudgment. So the first lesson must be: do you really want to buy, or might it be better to rent? The financial arguments for buying have declined as prices in popular areas around Sienna or the walled city of Lucca have soared, making ownership prohibitive for many. That is certainly the case in Chianti-shire, an area of rolling hills, vineyards and olive trees renamed for its large expatriate community. Many who bought delapidated farmhouses for a song during the rural depopulation of the 1960s and early 1970s have made a killing. Buying today is much pricier. Among properties currently on the market are beautifully-restored farmhouses, in grounds and with pools, such as Monticello (on offer from the UK-based Italian Property Portfolio for just under Pounds 900,000) or Casalvento (on sale via Lucca-based Villaman for Pounds 650,000). While that represents an astronomical leap from 20 years ago, the market has flattened, if not fallen, under recession in the 1990s. Even in Chianti-shire, where the stock of property is severely limited by prohibitive planning laws and Italian buyers are taking up some slack, there is now a relatively large choice of property against uncommonly weak demand. Those with more modest budgets must scale down or look further afield. Small terraced town houses, without gardens, can be had even in Chianti or around Lucca - almost as expensive - for as little as Pounds 50,000. Bigger places can be found for about double that, provided the buyer is prepared to stump up for restoration, which Michael Goodall, an expatriate Brit based in San Gimignano, calculates at about L1.5m (Pounds 650) per square metre more. Rising prices in Tuscany led to an upsurge of interest in Umbria in the late 1980s, the region lying south-east and known for attractive towns such as Perugia and Assisi. Umbrian prices soared as buyers expanded their horizons. But here too, the market is now flat at best, while the relative cheapness compared with Tuscany must be measured against greater distances from northern Europe and less convenient airports. Although the British have tended to concentrate on Tuscany and Umbria, they are by no means the only parts of Italy that appeal to foreigners. The northern lakes such as Como and Maggiore are coming out of the doldrums. Living on the lakes or the slopes above has always attracted the Germans and Swiss: Frankfurt to Como is five hours by car, making even long weekends possible. After being spurned as 'old-fashioned' 10 years ago, lakeside property has regained popularity among the Italians. But whatever the effect of local blips in the market, buyers should not be motivated by making money from a second home. Asking prices are relatively high; the market is mature; and the days of sharp speculative gains are probably over. The rationale should be different. Says Sandy Christie, a British information technology executive now working in Milan, who bought a house near Lucca in the early 1970s: 'I'd saved money after working two years in Iran. The question was, should I buy an E-type Jaguar or something else. I didn't really know what I was doing and I spent what I thought I could afford to lose.' The 'something else' was a farmhouse in four hectares, transformed over the years into an attractive holiday home with pool. Christie has no regrets about his investment. 'With the benefit of hindsight, we've probably been overcharged right down the line. It's all been highly unprofessional, but it's worked out well.' Having decided to go ahead, how do you start? For those, such as the British, used to a relatively standardised property market based on relatively transparent rules, clear fee structures and marketing-conscious intermediaries, matters will come as a shock. There are no big estate agents, and, for property outside the cities, the 'agent' is likely to be a one-man band with a limited range in a restricted area. Such fragmentation means vendors seldom give agents sole instructions. That can save time when it comes to looking, as one agent may know about much of the property available locally. But it can also lead to confusion - and risk  -once a choice has been made, as others may be negotiating for the same house through different intermediaries. While many agents, notably some of the established expatriates, are knowledgeable and reliable, some locally-based foreign buyers who have the language avoid agents altogether. That eliminates commission, which differs locally but can reach 3 per cent from both sides. Do-it-yourselfers in Lombardy begin with Secondamano, a five-days-a-week listings paper, advertising various goods for sale. Other regions have differently-named equivalents. More specialised and up-market publications worth consulting are Dove, a glossy travel monthly and Casa Bella, a decorating and interiors publication. Some British agents operating out of Italy advertise in the Sunday Times, the Financial Times or the International Herald Tribune. Brian A French &amp; Associates, a London-based estate agency specialising in Italy, even publishes Belle Cose, its own magazine. Having time on one's side helps. Paul and Luann Erickson, an expatriate American couple based in Milan, decided to escape the city's pollution and lack of public spaces when their first child was born. 'After ruling out the Riviera on cost grounds, we decided to look at the lakes.' Going through Secondamano led them to a hamlet above Lake Como, where they bought a semi-detached three-storey house four years ago. The legal side of property purchasing can be a minefield, with conflicting ground plans and land claims stretching back years. A concise guide is: find a local surveyor (geometra) or lawyer to make the necessary searches and take the trouble to do things properly from the start to avoid difficulties when it comes to selling. Legal fees and taxes will add 10 to 15 per cent to the purchase price. The declared contract price sometimes bears little relation to the actual purchase price, as money often passes under the counter. Once the formalities are over, what do people do with their homes when they are not there? The risks of burglary or accidental damage should not be exaggerated, but are real nonetheless. 'We recommend installing an alarm, ideally linked to the local police station,' says Bill Thomson, whose Chianti Estates Management Company renovates and supervises properties as well as selling them. In many cases, buyers will ease the burden of vacant property - and possible mortgage costs - by renting for part of the year. For the British, rentals tend to be done either privately through adverts in magazines such as The Lady, newspapers such as The Guardian, or through UK-based specialists. Many of the Italy-based expatriates doubling as estate agents also offer supervisory and rental services. A familiar voice at the end of a phone can be reassuring for distant owners, even if some of them tend to abuse the relationship. 'Sometimes, you get called from people at a dinner party on a portable phone who just want to show off to their friends,' says one Tuscany-based Brit. Supervision charges differ sharply. Lucca-based Masterman has an hourly fee structure, or alternatively negotiates longer-term arrangements. Thomson, based in Gaiole in Chianti, also prefers to agree a yearly contract covering regular visits and crisis-management.

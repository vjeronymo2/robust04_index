			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Polezhayeva, editor in chief of </F> ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "First Swallow"]    [Text] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA is beginning publication of the  first all-Russian Tatar newspaper. This event--I am not afraid  of using lofty words--is a signal one.    There are a good many ethnic publications in Russia and,  incidentally, not only on the territories of various national  formations; for example, Tatar-language newspapers are published  in Tyumen and other cities. This is the first time that an  ethnic publication has been accorded the status of a statewide  newspaper.    BERDEMLEK-YEDINSTVO will be distributed in a circulation of  more than 1 million in all the country's cities and villages.  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA has not only initiated and implemented this  idea but has provided its broad shoulders to the new paper by  offering its pages, subscribers, printing facilities and  distribution network, thereby ensuring YEDINSTVO's success from  its very first steps among a broad range of readers. The idea  met with an enthusiastic response from the president of  Tatarstan. Thanks to the personal involvement of Mintimer  Sharipovich Shaymiyev, it has been possible to put together the  newspaper's first issue in a short time. Its founders are  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and the Government of the Republic of  Tatarstan.    It will come out once a week. We have decided to publish it  in Russian, because the newspaper is aimed at millions of Tatars  living throughout Russia, many of whom do not know their native  language. But we will help them learn it: lessons in Tatar will  be included in every issue.    Together with Tatar journalists, we will tell about the  present day, history, culture, customs and holidays of  Tatarstan. Our readers of all nationalities will be able to come  to better know and love this people, which is one of Russia's  numerically largest peoples.    Let us hope that YEDINSTVO will be the first but not the  only  ethnic publication to be an all-Russian publication. Our  newspaper is prepared to collaborate not only with individual  republics but also with confederations and public centers of  Ukrainians, Germans, Jews, Koreans and other peoples living in  Russia but lacking their own national formations on its  territory.    Bon voyage, BERDEMLEK.</p>

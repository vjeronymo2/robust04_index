			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Taking the one-stop shop to St Petersburg MR John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, flies out to Russia and the Baltic States tomorrow on a flag-waving tour. But there will be few British businesses to visit. Amid much publicity last September, Mr Gummer summoned the great and the good of the UK retail trade to a breakfast meeting to discuss ways of developing the former Soviet Union's food business. At that time, Mr Gummer did little to dispel the impression that there would soon be Safeway stores in Sverdlovsk and Tesco stores in Tomsk, as one newspaper duly reported. But, almost a year on, little has happened. Only the privately-owned Littlewoods group has so far moved into Russia, opening two stores in St Petersburg last year. But an unlikely British investor has been Sid Shaw, a doggedly persistent entrepreneur who runs Elvisly Yours, a shop selling kitsch Elvis Presley memorabilia in Shoreditch High Street. Earlier this month, Mr Shaw opened a 2,000 sq ft 'Super' store on Prospekt Smirnova in St Petersburg as a joint venture with a local co-operative. The store sells a hotch-potch of western goods, ranging from flea collars and cider to car repair kits, for either roubles or dollars. He expects it to take Pounds 2m in its first year. Why does Mr Shaw want to open shops in Russia? 'Why did anyone set off to California with a shovel?' he responds. But Mr Shaw complains that he has received little support from the UK government or industry. He says he has contacted hundreds of companies seeking supplies to export but has met with a miserable response from most. 'I have struggled for two years against Russian bureaucracy and British intransigence,' he says. 'This country is run by bloody accountants who have no imagination.' The British Food Export Council has agreed to help Mr Shaw find backers but says it is not surprising that he has not yet met with a more encouraging response. 'He has a very jaundiced view of British suppliers, but you do not deal with someone you do not know,' says David Gray, marketing manager at the BFEC. 'At the end of the day, exports have to be based on a more centrally planned approach,' he adds. Mr Shaw has spent Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 262,000) on developing the Super store but has plans to open another ten, from cash flow - he has received no backing from any banks. He says Russia is in a state of 'economic anarchy' at the moment and it needs unconventional men and methods to succeed there.</p>

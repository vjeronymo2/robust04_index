			<p>BFN     [Text] When inspecting Guizhou from 7 to 14 June, Qiao  Shi, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central  Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress, pointed out: Guizhou should seize  opportunities, accelerate development, and further bring about  the enthusiasm of the masses of the people of all nationalities  and the vast number of party-member cadres so that it will  gradually forge ahead along the path of economic development  with great strides as an inland province which is not situated  near the sea, rivers, or boundary lines.    Accompanied by provincial party Secretary Liu Fangren,  Governor Chen Shineng, provincial people's congress standing  committee Chairman Wang Chaowen, and others, Qiao Shi drove for  thousands of li and went down to industrial and mining  enterprises, schools, nationality villages, and peasants  households in Qiannan and Qiandongnan Prefectures, and held  extensive contracts with the masses of people and cadres to find  out about their production, lives, education, and their efforts  to shake off poverty. Qiao Shi was very pleased after having  learned that the economies of these nationality areas had  developed, their people's living standards had improved, social  stability prevailed, and people of all nationalities lived in  harmony. In Yaonshan township in the Yao Nationality, Libo  County, walking along a country path, Comrade Qiao Shi visited  the home of He Laopo who was a peasant and inquired if his  family had enough grain to eat and if they had difficulties in  production and their livelihood. In a nationality primary  school in Yaoshan Township, township head He Zhiyong informed  him: In the last few years, although Yaoshan is poor, it has  never relaxed its efforts in education. Comrade Qiao Shi was  relieved to hear that and said to the provincial, prefectural,  and county leaders who were around him: Well done. It is  important to pay close attention to education. So long as the  cultural quality of the peasants is raised, there will be hope  of putting an end to the rural areas' poverty and backwardness.  At Miaoliang Village in the Shandu Shui Nationality Autonomous  County, after visiting a room for the village party branch and  also for militiamen and youths to carry out their activities,  Qiao Shi said with elation: This is good form. If all rural  grass-roots units function well, we can accomplish our work. He  hoped the Shui Nationality would unite with all other  nationalities across the country and better carry out national  construction. At the Duyun Dongfang Machine Tool Plant and the  Kali Polyester Fiber Spinning and Weaving Machine Company,  Comrade Qiao Shi warmly shook the hands of the workers, which  were stained with greasy dirt, and spoke with them, inquiring in  detail about their enterprises' production, operation, and  product sales. He encouraged enterprises to make great efforts  to improve product quality, open up more markets, and develop  themselves by relying on their own strength.    On the afternoon of 11 June, accompanied by the provincial  and Qiandongnan autonomous prefectural leaders, Chairman Qiao  Shi arrived at Langde Village of the Miao nationality in Leishan  County. With compatriots of the Miao nationality clustering  around, he climbed up along a small winding path and after  drinking wine offered by the hospitable compatriots of the Miao  nationality, he arrived at the village cultural center, where he  watched with great interest traditional Miao nationality  programs including dances performed by villagers accompanied by  reed pine wind and other instruments. When the chairman danced  a unity dance with the villagers to the drum beats, the gaiety  reached a climax. At the end, the chairman wrote an inscription  with a brush, which read: Strengthen national unity and develop  the economies of the nationality areas.    During his visit to our province, Comrade Qiao Shi also  visited the former residence of the martyr Deng Enmin, deputy of  the party's first congress, and the nationality museum of  Qiandongnan Autonomous County. He also listened respectively to  the work reports of the provincial party committee, the  provincial people's congress, and the provincial government and  made an important speech. He pointed out: Now is the best time  for our country's construction and development. The domestic  and international situations are conducive to our country's  economic construction. He encouraged everybody to have a  profound understanding of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important  instructions, seize the opportunity, and further develop  Guizhou's economic construction.    When discussing Guizhou's economic work, Qiao Shi said:  Guizhou, which is not situated near the sea, rivers, or  boundary lines, has vast mountain areas which are poverty  stricken and beset with many difficulties. For Guizhou to solve  its difficulties, it is true that the province needs support  from the central authorities and help from all sides concerned,  but in the final analysis, it should rely on its own strength.  Importantly, it must be noticed that Guizhou has huge potential  and many strong points, which should be brought into play by  relying on the masses of the people to invigorate the province's  economy. He fully affirmed the practice of the provincial party  committee and government to always put agriculture and rural  work in the first place of economic work. He said: Guizhou has  had great success in developing agriculture. It should take a  broader view of things and implement the idea of agriculture in  a broader sense down to work in all fields generation after  generation. Guizhou has good prospects for agricultural  development. While doing a good job of grain, it should develop  animal husbandry, cultivation, and commercial crops, such as  fruits and tea, by suiting measures to local conditions. It  should develop township and town enterprises by basing itself on  local raw and semifinished materials, in particular, processing  industries. He pointed out: Guizhou has extremely abundant  natural resources, in particular, energy and nonferrous metal  resources. Guizhou's strong points, dubbed the coal sea of the  area south of the lower reaches of the Zhang Jiang, should be  brought into good play. Its rich water resources should also be  exploited and utilized at an accelerated pace, with equal stress  on the development of thermal and hydropower stations. Guizhou  has a considerable foundation for aluminum production and,  moreover, it has electric power. So aluminum production has  bright prospects.    In road construction, Guizhou should strive to build more  main highways to link with the high-grade highways of the  surrounding provinces and autonomous regions. Forces of all  sides concerned should be mobilized to expedite construction in  other fields of endeavor. Every possible means should be tried  to speed up the construction of projects where conditions are  ripe. Qiao Shi stressed: For Guizhou to speed up the pace of  its development, it should bring the enthusiasm of its 34  million people of all nationalities into full play and  strengthen lateral ties and cooperation with its fraternal  provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions while striving  for support and help from the central authorities and relevant  departments. It should speed up the pace of reform and opening  up to the outside world, do a good job of building the  investment environment, and absorb more foreign capital and  technology. To put it briefly, we hope that Guizhou will  further emancipate its mind, acquire a broader view of things,  take a broader path, open up more avenues of development, and  strive for faster economic development.    When talking about the work of the people's congress, Qiao  Shi stressed: We should strengthen the building of socialist  democracy and legal system and establish a law system  commensurate with the socialist market economy in accordance  with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. He said: The task of the people's  congress is very important. The work of the people's congresses  at all levels, including legislation, publicity on the legal  system, and supervision of law enforcement, should be  strengthened. To establish a law system for the socialist  economy, we should mobilize forces from all sides concerned to  get involved. This is also a process of extensively developing  democracy. Strengthening the work of the people's congresses at  the grass-roots level is of great significance to the building  of the basic-level party organizations, of political power, and  of the legal system. Comrade Qiao Shi believes that under the  leadership of the provincial party committee and government, the  people of all nationalities in Guizhou will surely be able to  build Guizhou better by upholding the party's basic line,  deepening reform, and opening wider to the outside world.</p>

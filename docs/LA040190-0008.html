			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: 'PARTY' TIME  </P> <P> While "House Party" took off surprisingly well, a number of recent releases  with bigger budgets, stars and profiles haven't. Among the more disappointing:  "Revenge," $15.3 million, 38 days; "Stella," $19.4 million, 52 days; "Men Don't  Leave," $6 million, 52 days; "Blue Steel," $5.6 million, 10 days. And despite  all the Rob Lowe publicity, the opening of "Bad Influence" hasn't been a  thriller -- a modest $10 million on 1,300 screens in its first 17 days. John M.  Wilson  </P></p>

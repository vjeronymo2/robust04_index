			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Backbench Tories underwhelmed by 'best leader they have' - Ralph Atkins on how despair among Conservative MPs betrayed the damage done to the prime minister and the near absence of the usual waving of order papers for Mr John Major - yesterday betrayed the injury Mr Norman Lamont's resignation speech had done to the prime minister's credibility. Even loyalist MPs admitted Mr Lamont's comments were deeply damaging to Mr Major. They said the prime minister had failed to respond by creating a sense of purpose for his government in his own speech. Questions about his leadership were renewed and reinforced. Rumours about a leadership challenge later this year were heightened. Labour MPs's ironic cries of 'more, more,' after Mr Major sat down added to the sense of disappointment. Private criticism of Mr Major's leadership style was both scathing and widespread. 'If he isn't acting as a prime minister soon, he won't be prime minister at all,' said one Tory. There was public criticism too, with critical speeches by senior Tories in the Commons debate. But, with no challenger to the leadership having yet emerged, there was a sense of floundering among Conservative MPs. A usually loyal member of the government said: 'I have got to think about it. We can't make a considered view. He hasn't shored up his position certainly.' One minister said: 'We got no other choice'. Sir Anthony Grant, Conservative MP for Cambridgeshire south west, captured, perhaps unwittingly, the predicament as he tried to sound supportive: 'He is certainly the very best leader that we have.' During Mr Major's Commons speech, as many Tory MPs were sucking fingers in contemplation - perhaps of the stings inflicted by Mr Lamont - as were indulging in more traditional attempts to goad the Labour party. No one expected the prime minister to make a great speech. It is not his strength. But there was a sense among Conservatives that he could have done better. One backbencher suggested that he should have brushed off the jibes from Mr Lamont, by ignoring them in a statesman-like manner. But to some Tories the fall-out from Mr Lamont's address was less damaging than might have been expected. The prevailing view was that the party had to rally around the government, rather than create further divisions. Almost all Tory MPs agreed that the former chancellor's intervention was not on the same scale as the resignation speech of Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe. Others criticised the former chancellor's motives. One junior minister said: 'Lamont is not popular out there. Geoffrey was respected.' One moderate MP said: 'Norman Lamont wanted to wound rather than to kill - though I suppose to want to wound the government these days is bad enough.' A more careful assessment will precede tonight's meeting of the executive of the Conservative's 1922 backbench committee, the infamous 'men in grey suits' who tell prime ministers - frequently bluntly - what the infantry at Westminster are thinking. Since the committee is usually ruled by conventions of absolute secrecy, details of the message which will be sent to Mr Major were unclear last night. However, at least a few of the 18 executive members were deeply worried at the Tory party's plummeting morale. 'We are prepared to give him time, but not indefinitely,' said one. Another said: 'Morale is definitely low and there is a great deal of anxiety about but that hasn't manifested itself in a feeling that the government is about to collapse, a general election is brewing, or that the prime minister should go.' But the 1922 executive is also split - with many privately furious at what they regard as disloyal and injudicious remarks made by colleagues to the newspapers. There is disagreement too about tax rises. Right-wing executive members want none, while the centre-right members want any public spending cuts balanced by tax increases. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, said Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, should, 'forget any idea that he might have of increasing income tax, particularly the standard rate.' Adding to the government's embarrasment, Sir Peter Hordern, Tory MP for Horsham and 1922 executive member, backed Mr Lamont's call for an independent central bank. 'Monetary policy is not as credible as it might be if our central bank were to be independent,' he said. Sir Peter also said that VAT on fuel and power, if needed, should have been imposed immediately. 'To be blamed without getting any revenue for a year seems perverse.' Sir Terence Higgins, Tory MP for Worthing and another member of the 1922 executive, was also critical of the VAT move, saying he thought the government needed to do more to protect those on incomes just above benefit levels. Ironically, last night Mr Lamont's Kingston-upon-Thames constituency was among those earmarked for re-organisation by the Boundary Commissioners. In the latest provisional plans the seat is set to be divided between the Richmond and Barnes constituency and a new one for Kingston and Surbiton. When the commission started its work there were forecasts that the Conservatives could benefit by as many as 20 extra seats, but last night's plans indicate that the figure could be as few as half a dozen - with many desperately close marginals. Tory-dominated Essex is set to gain an extra seat but sweeping changes are planned to the party's flagship marginal at Basildon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Chetumal, Mexico, 22 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican  Navy rescued 94 Cubans after the Cubans' boat, which had drifted  for several days, ran aground on the Banco Chinchorro reef area  in southern Quintana Roo State.    Roberto Erales Jimenez, under secretary of the state  government, said the group, composed of 47 men, 27 women, and 20  children, sailed from Puerto Tuna, Cuba, on 15 April aboard the  30-foot boat "Casilda 27."    Governor Mario Villanueva Madrid reported that the Cubans  were rescued by Navy members, who helped them get to the village  of Mahahual, some 45 km east of Chetumal, where they were given  medical assistance and food. The governor said the Mexican  immigration authorities issued them a permit to stay on Mexican  territory until next Sunday. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Letter: Integrated EC forces under joint command not 'fantastical' concept Sir, Your leader on the Liberal Democrats' manifesto (March 17) dismisses the commitment to the 'gradual integration of community members' armed forces under a joint command' as 'fantastical'. For a far-sighted newspaper like the Financial Times, I find this a disappointingly short-term assessment. No doubt it is fantastical to imagine that within the next two to three years there will be substantial change in the organisation of British forces. But over the next five to 15 years it is evident that there will be fundamental shifts in national and European defence, following from the end of the Cold War, the withdrawal of most (or all) American forces, pressures to reduce national defence budgets and the shift to different security concerns. The British government and its EC partners have just signed a treaty committing themselves to 'a common foreign and security policy. . .which may in time lead to a common defence', which for the first time brings the Western European Union into the ambit of the Brussels institutions. The French and German governments have tabled proposals for integrated ground forces, building on the Franco-German brigade. The British government has committed troops to a multinational corps, with shared divisions, in the Rapid Reaction Force. We already share training structures for the Tornado with the Germans and Italians, and naval facilities with the Belgians and Dutch; Dutch marines have for many years been effectively integrated into British commando forces. I recall some 15 years ago suggesting that it would be rational and logical to share diplomatic facilities in third countries with our European partners. The idea was swept aside as unthinkable. Yet we are in Alma Ata and elsewhere searching for buildings we can share with the Germans, Dutch and even representatives of the Commission itself: driven by budgetary constraints far more than any 'European' idealism. The British, of course, don't like to look ahead. But the same pressures will push us towards our continental partners in the far more sensitive area of defence. And by the way, we will also have a European Federal Bureau of Investigation within 15 years. The first hints are there in the Maastricht Treaty; some senior British police officers already privately accept the objective. Fantastical - or unavoidable?

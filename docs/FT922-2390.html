			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (9): Embroiderers get the needle - The handicraft industry is in severe difficulties GRETA PHELPS FIGUEIRA, great-great-niece of the Englishwoman who introduced traditional Madeiran embroidery to the world, is despondent. 'The industry is finishing,' she says. 'It can't have any future because nobody wants to learn embroidery. The young ones don't want to do it. They used to be kept at home, now they can get jobs in hotels.' Her ancestor, Miss Elizabeth Phelps, the daughter of a wine trader, took samples of the embroidery to London in the 1850s. 'I think it was Queen Victoria who gave her a boatload of linen to bring back to have embroidered,' says Mrs Phelps Figueira. The word spread, and the cottage industry grew to become one of Madeira's main sources of revenue. Today, people no longer have time to handwash and iron beautiful embroideries, and '90 per cent of the tourists aren't genuinely interested in buying embroidery,' she says. Now 71, she came to the island to marry more than 30 years ago, and she and her husband, Aurelio, still run an embroidery shop, Figueira and Phelps, in Funchal. Her gloom may not be fully shared by others in the industry, but there is widespread acceptance that Madeira's handicraft industry, which includes tapestry and wickerwork, is in severe difficulties because of its low productivity. About 30,000 people, or 23 per cent of the workforce, are occupied, mostly part-time, in handicrafts, and they contribute just 5 per cent of GDP. Some 20,000 women do embroidery, often in addition to farmwork. They are paid by the number of embroidery points they sew, and their annual earnings average between Esc80,000 and Esc120,000, according to the Institute of Embroidery, Tapestry and Handicrafts. A further 1,500 people are employed in factories, designing, cutting, washing, ironing and packing the embroidery for sale. Mr Fernando Sousa Viola runs such a factory near the port in Funchal. He employs 45 people to process embroidery which he buys from 4,000-5,000 women across the island. In the factory office, hand-written ledgers, creaking wooden floors and frosted glass panelling are reminders of a bygone age, but Mr Sousa Viola has a modern business sense. He saw the writing on the wall 15 years ago and concentrated on high-quality exports for the wealthy, who employ others to look after their fine linen. He specialises in elaborate tablecloths that can take three or four years to make and cost as much as Pounds 2,000 each, and bed linen embroidered with the customer's initials or family crest. His main clients are in the UK and Germany, though he is hoping for an opening in the US. The outlook for the industry is not brilliant, he says. 'Madeira embroidery will never end, but it will be only for rich people, and the quantity produced will be much less.' Government and industry officials suggest that the number employed in embroidery needs to fall by half or even three-quarters. That is already happening. Many young women prefer the better pay and environment of hotel work. 'Embroidery affects the eyes. You sit there and have no contact with people,' says Mr Sousa Viola. Even established embroiderers now refuse to work on the most intricate designs. Traditional export markets are finding cheaper sources. Italy, for example, used to take 75 per cent of the island's embroidery exports, but Chinese competition, which Madeirans say is of lower quality, has reduced that to 70 per cent. Baskets and furniture, which are made from willow without nails or glue, are also being undercut in their main market, the UK, by cheaper Chinese and Polish wickerwork. Exports of handicrafts still bring in about Esc2.7bn a year, twice the level of purchases by tourists. While counting on growth in tourism, the regional government is also studying ways of improving the export drive, says Mr Fernando Severino Fernandes, president of the handicrafts institute. The institute, set up in 1978, runs small training programmes for young women in rural areas with a 75 per cent contribution to the cost from the EC Social Fund. Conditions for the embroiderers have improved. Apart from annual pay increases, they are entitled to health care and a minimum pension at 62 in exchange for 2 per cent of their income. Productivity is encouraged with annual bonuses.</p>

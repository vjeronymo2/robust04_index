			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Plan to open rice market shelved THE JAPANESE government had been on the verge of announcing plans to open its rice market to imports last month, a senior trade official admitted yesterday. But the plans had been shelved once it became clear the prospects for an early Gatt agreement had faded. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, had prepared a package to liberalise the market after hinting in December last year that he supported the move. The plan included financial measures to support farmers whose businesses might have suffered as a result of allowing imports into Japan's tightly regulated market. The measures would have been included in a special supplementary budget, designed to stimulate the flagging Japanese economy and planned for this spring. 'Mr Miyazawa was ready to come out of his castle waving a white flag to surrender over rice, but when he emerged he found the enemy had disappeared to do other things,' the official explained. A Japanese promise to open the rice market would have helped clear the way for a deal on agricultural subsidies, one of the main stumbling blocks to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Japanese officials believe that the opportunity to open the rice market has passed for the time being because the prospects of an overall Gatt deal have receded.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Samuel Prieto; from the "Good </F> Morning From Mexico" newscast]    [Text] It is 0630 on 3 January 1994. We begin our journey  to Ocosingo. Some EZLN [Zapatista Army of National Liberation]  roadblocks have been erected several kms from the 31st Military  Zone garrison in Rio Nuevo, Chiapas. A number of the rebels are  very young, even children. It is not enough to see, however.  The question we ask this captain, naturally unidentified, deals  with his remark that he thinks the Armed Forces are bourgeoisie.  His answer is ideological. He says Mexico should have a  socialist system. We will have to ask him why, considering that  this system has not worked in other countries. But the EZLN  refuses to talk with the government or a mediator.    Moving over to the following roadblocks, we observe the  rebels and their activities more closely. At mess time they  have stale biscuits dipped in coffee, as well as hardened  tortillas. We also observe some rebels in formation and others  in a combat crouch. This is the situation.    Las Margaritas municipality has been peacefully vacated by  the rebels. In Ocosingo, the give and take continues.  According to the latest reports, the self-styled EZLN is about  to overpowered. The rebels have sustained 27 casualties. But  they continue to hold Altamirano. Huitzlan fared better.  Guerrillas started to leave beginning at 1400 local time.  Clashes took place in Rancho Nuevo in the afternoon. On  Monday, LA JORNADA newsman Ismael Romero was shot three times in  the left shoulder while on his way to Las Margaritas and  Ocosingo.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Ex-Lotus chief helped steal Dollars 17m: De Lorean project fraud admitted FORMER Group Lotus chairman Mr Fred Bushell yesterday admitted taking part in a Dollars 17.65m conspiracy to defraud De Lorean Motor Cars, the Belfast sports car venture which collapsed spectacularly 10 years ago after nearly Pounds 78m of UK government funding had been invested in it. The guilty plea at Belfast Crown Court came as the government and Cork Gully, receivers for what was possibly the most humiliating project ever funded by UK taxpayers, intensified their efforts to recover some of the government's investment in the abortive development of the stainless steel sports car. So far, just under Pounds 14m has been recovered. However, Mr Christopher Hughes, the principal receiver, said yesterday that he expected further 'substantial' sums to be recovered. This is apart from legal action being taken by the UK government in the US against Arthur Andersen, the De Lorean auditors. The government is suing for Pounds 240m, claiming that the accountancy firm should have been aware of mismanagement, misinformation and misappropriation of funds. In another twist Arthur Andersen has called Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, as a witness in its efforts to prove government incompetence in assessing and monitoring the project. The decision to invest Pounds 53m in the project was made by the Labour government in 1978. Top-up funds continued to be provided after the Tory election victory of 1979, mainly because of the 2,000 jobs at stake in one of the UK's most depressed regions. Mr Bushell, 64, yesterday admitted conspiring with the late Colin Chapman, founder of Lotus, and Mr John De Lorean to defraud the venture in west Belfast of funds originally intended to pay Group Lotus, now owned by General Motors, for developing the car. The money was never received by Lotus. Instead, according to evidence given by Sir Kenneth Cork, the first De Lorean receiver, the money 'went walkabout'. Mr Bushell will be sentenced in six weeks and was freed on continuing bail of Pounds 50,000. He has been on bail since July 1989, when he was first accused of the conspiracy. Mr De Lorean was not in the dock with Mr Bushell because he is in the US and cannot be extradited. The offences took place between 1978 and 1982 and the time in which Mr De Lorean could have been extradited expired in 1988, shortly before the Serious Fraud Office was set up. However Mr De Lorean, the founder and chairman of De Lorean Motor, is still wanted by the SFO. Yesterday Mr Desmond Boal QC, defending, said Mr Bushell realised the consequences of his plea but needed time to put in order certain matters which could be in the public interest. Mr Bushell spoke only twice during the hearing - first when he was asked if the court clerk could repeat his name, and then to admit his guilt. A second charge against him of obtaining Dollars 5.15m by deception was not proceeded with.</p>

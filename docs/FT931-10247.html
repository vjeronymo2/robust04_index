			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Attack on overheads helps P&amp;P - Pounds 8.9m charge for change of emphasis clears ground for recovery P&amp;P, the personal computer distributor and computing services supplier, is beginning to show the benefits of a determined attack on escalating overheads, with a profit before tax last year of Pounds 2.01m, up from Pounds 711,000 previously. The company, however, recorded a net loss for the full year of Pounds 7.88m, as a result of taking an extraordinary charge of Pounds 8.93m to cover the costs of extricating itself from the distribution of high volume, low-cost personal computers - a business where cost cutting and intense competition have reduced margins to unprofitable levels. The share price yesterday rose 5p to 44p. Turnover in the year to November 30 1992 was slightly lower at Pounds 222.8m (Pounds 228.3m). However, as personal computer prices have been falling at up to 40 per cent a year for the past two years, the bald figures conceal a substantial increase in volume of business. Earnings per share were more than doubled at 1.9p (0.7p) and a final dividend of 0.7p is declared, making a total of 1.4p (4.33p). Shareholders' funds remain in excess of Pounds 40m, or 72p a share, and the company has net cash of Pounds 3m. P&amp;P has suffered over the past two years through being one of the largest participants in a sector where profit margins have fallen steadily. It has now taken the step of disengaging itself from the high volume distribution of low cost computers where gross profit margins were only 10 per cent. That leaves it in computing services, with gross profit margins of close to 60 per cent, and in higher value computer products where gross margins of over 20 per cent can be achieved. The Pounds 40m-a-year-sales high volume business, comprising relationships with dealers and contracts with manufacturers and P&amp;P itself, will either be sold or run down. Mr David Southworth, group managing director, said the worst was over: 'If we manage cash and overheads for the next two years, we will do very well.' COMMENT Mr Southworth is looking a good deal happier these days. The decision to cut away the least profitable part of the business and to take the Pounds 8.9m charge for doing so has cleared the ground for recovery and the management team has already shown its competence in coming to grips with costs. Forward profits are difficult to predict in the computer business in the current climate, but it would be surprising if there was not a strong advance on 1992. With a historic p/e of about 23 there seems little reason to quibble with analysts' opinion of a strong buy.</p>

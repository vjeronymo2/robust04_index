			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Waste mountains prove difficult to conquer: The lesson of a German recycling scheme that came to grief through overspill THE spectre over the government's new packaging recycling moves, announced yesterday, is a similar German scheme launched two years ago. Mr John Elkington, director of Sustainability, an independent environmental consultancy, said yesterday: 'A few years ago I would have welcomed this move wholeheartedly. In the wake of the (German) experience I am concerned that the simple setting of ambitious targets is only a small part of what needs to be done.' The crisis in the German waste recycling scheme, the Duales System Deutschland (DSD), came to a head last month when it tottered on the edge of bankruptcy before being propped up at the last minute by funds from industry. Even so, a mountain of waste - particularly plastics - is still threatening to overwhelm German towns. The country's recycling capacity has not kept pace with people's taste for filling the scheme's yellow sacks with carefully sorted rubbish, while demand for recycled material has been much less than expected. The effects are spilling over into other countries. Mr Cameron Mclatchie, chairman of British Polythene Industries, one of Europe's leading makers of polythene film, said that this year the price of imported black film to cover silages had dropped 'through the floor' to around Pounds 60 per tonne  -about half the cost to him of collecting it from British farms for recycling. Ms Jane Bickerstaffe, technical director of the Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment (INCPEN), said: 'Several recycling firms have gone out of business in this country in the past six months because German waste is offered here.' Without those 'repercussions' from Germany, the packaging industry 'could certainly achieve 50 per cent recycling by the year 2000', she said. Mr Peter Hindle, an associate director of environmental at Procter &amp; Gamble, also warns that the costs can be high. P&amp;G's use of recycled plastic for detergent bottles 'currently does add to costs', and was no longer a clear competitive advantage as 'everyone's doing it'. Consumers were now interested in refillable bottles and other measures that reduced the amount of packaging, he added. Some industrialists and environmental consultants have also questioned whether the proposals could, ironically, be damaging to the environment because of the extra transport needed to collect the rubbish, and the energy used in washing and recycling it into usable material. Mr Mclatchie said that, when it comes to household waste, 'after you wash it and transport it, the cost of getting it back in environmental terms is greater than any benefit. And do you actually see the British consumer washing up used frozen pea bags?'</p>

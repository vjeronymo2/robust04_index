			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US textile imports raise sector deficit to dollars 9bn US textiles and clothing imports have taken the sector trade deficit to a high of Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) for the first four months of 1993, writes Daniel Green. It now accounts for almost a quarter of the total US trade deficit. Between January and April the US imported Dollars 12.5bn worth of textiles and clothing, an increase of almost 8 per cent over the 1992 period. In April, when the overall trade deficit fell, the textiles and clothing deficit rose 13 per cent. Mr Henry Truslow, president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, blames Far Eastern countries which 'continue to close their markets to our goods'. He also warned US Gatt negotiators that 'the most perilous threat to our industry is the Dunkel draft' - the latest plan to conclude the Uruguay Round.</p>

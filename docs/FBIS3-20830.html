			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with President of the Democratic Party Zoran </F> Djidjic by Uros Komlenovic; place and date not given: "Eight  Hours With Karadzic"]    [Excerpt] The visit of the delegation of the  Democratic Party to Pale on the occasion of the recently  prepared "festive expectation" of the outcome of the NATO  ultimatum, spurred various comments in Belgrade: Praise could be  heard, as well as criticism that what is at issue is a "cheap  collection of political points." Zoran Djindjic, president of  the Democratic Party, confirms in talks with VREME that the  development of events in Bosnia directly influenced his decision  to travel to Pale.    [Djindjic] We had an agreement in principle even earlier to  discuss with the leaders of the republic of Srpska the forming  of the Democratic Party in this territory. When the ultimatum  was declared, it seemed to us natural to go to Pale and thus  express our solidarity with the people in the republic of Srpska.    [Komlenovic] How was your idea on the founding of the party  accepted in Pale, and what else was discussed?    [Djindjic] We agreed not to found the party until the war is  over. We agreed that the forming of a real political party in  the territory of the republic of Srpska at this moment could  mean disloyal competition with the Serbian Democric Party [SDS]  along with the danger of creating confusion among the members of  this organization, which, because of the conditions under which  it operates, resembles more a blend of a national movement and  the state administration than a political party. In addition to  this, we discussed the future government system and relations  between political parties in Serbia and the government  leadership of the republic of Srpska. We wanted to introduce a  little relaxation in relations and bring into question the  monopoly of the Socialist Party of Serbia in relation to the  Serbs in Bosnia, which, it seems to me, is suffocating them  somewhat. Anyhow, if the SDS were a political party in the  traditional sense, I do not believe that it would be close to  the Socialist Party of Serbia -- communist and socialist ideas  are not popular among the people of the republic of Srpska. On  the other hand, the mention of the republic of Srpska spurs  nonconfidence in some opposition circles in Belgrade. We want to  establish correct relations with the SDS and to lay a foundation  for our future cooperation.    [Komlenovic] The leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan  Karadzic, did not miss a single opportunity to express  unreserved support for Milosevic on the eve of the elections, in  spite of frequent attempts by the opposition to ingratiate  themselves with him -- it is sufficient to mention the support  of the Democratic Party of Serbia when the Vance-Owen plan was  rejected or Seselj's aid in suppressing the military uprising in  Banja Luka. Have you seen any additional reliable indication  that Pale's views on the political scene in Serbia may be  changing?    [Djindjic] I think that something is changing. Before the  last elections the leadership of the SDS and the republic of  Srpska did not explicitly support the SPS. The support of Serbs  from Bosnia was up to now addressed to Milosevic as a candidate  for the president of Serbia and not to his party. The problem is  that many opppsition parties in the republic of Srpska have the  reputation of being unpatriotic. We wanted to destroy exactly  this thesis and show that radical demagogy and crude language  are not a proof of patriotism, that national interests can  successfully be protected by the policy of peace, and that the  division into "patriotic" and "unpatriotic" parties is not  justified. There are no unpatriotic parties in Serbia. Anyhow,  we differ both in our presentation and party mentality from the  political organizations which had previously been coming to  visit the republic of Srpska, but our interlocutors (we talked  with Mr. Karadzic and 15 people from the political and military  leadership) told us that no one has been received as well as out  delegation thus far. Eight hours of conversation in a single day  must mean something.    [Komlenovic] It is increasingly heard in public that the  diplomatic action in connection with the NATO ultimatum and the  withdrawal of the Serbian artillery from positions around  Sarajevo, represent, in fact, Milosevic's defeat. Is it also  your impression that Karadzic has slowly started to become  independent in relation to Milosevic?    [Djindjic] Of course. Maybe this should not be interpreted  as  a Milosevic's defeat but as a process of maturation: The  republic of Srpska does not need a guardian. The greater the  pressure of Milosevic and the FRY on the Bosnian Serbs, the  greater the pressure of the international community on the  parent state. Thus, by making Milosevic and Yugoslavia move away  from their present diplomatic positions, the need for additional  pressure on the Serbs will decrease and the economic blockade  will become meaningless, which is good. It would be best if  Milosevic would declare that he is withdrawing from the Geneva  peace negotiations. Thus, it would be clearly shown that  Yugoslavia is not involved in the conflict in Bosnia and that  the republic of Srpska can represent its interests alone.    [Komlenovic] At the beginning you said that you spoke with  Radovan Karadzic on the future setup of the state. Whose state?    [Djindjic] We agreed that the republic of Srpska should be  joined to Serbia. A transitional solution should be found, and  everything should be carried out with the consent of the  international community, which I think will not oppose this  option if peace is concluded. Thus, we talked about the future  setup of the joint state, which should not be burdened with the  ideological dogmas of socialist bureaucracy. Our common  assessment is that this state should be parliamentary and  democratic. I emphasize that we would be more moderate than our  interlocutors as regards the time frame for changing the  ideology. [passage omitted]</p>

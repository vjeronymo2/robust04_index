			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Cocom in new talks on E Europe WESTERN trade officials meet today and tomorrow to discuss how their plans to cut red tape for exports of sensitive high technology to the former Soviet bloc should respond to collapse of the Soviet Union, William Dawkins reports from Paris. The debate will take place at the twice-yearly executive committee of Cocom (the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls), set up in 1949 to stop sales of militarily useful technology to the former Soviet Union. Cocom members, Nato minus Iceland plus Japan and Australia, agreed to cut the number of controlled goods substantially last spring, following the political changes across eastern Europe. A special class of even lighter controls were also accorded to the three European countries considered to have made the biggest steps towards democracy; Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Exports to them benefit from faster licensing procedures. But security worries caused by last August's Soviet coup attempt and the break-up of the Soviet Union have caused several Cocom members to delay reducing their own national technology export curbs to the former Soviet territories, officials say.</p>

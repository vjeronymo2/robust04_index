			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Santiago claims election fraud Mr Fidel Ramos last night took a narrow lead in unofficial estimates of the Philippine presidential election while his rival, Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago, claimed there had been widespread electoral fraud, writes Jose Galang in Manila. Mrs Santiago, a combative former immigration commissioner who had taken an early unofficial lead, is to launch demonstrations today accusing her opponents of 'wholesale election fraud' consisting of 'snatching ballot boxes and switching them with stuffed boxes.' Analysts predict that Mr Ramos, the administration-backed candidate, will emerge the clear winner once votes from the remote regions come in.</p>

At the Restructuring of the Financial System Report Meeting  jointly sponsored by the CPCCC Propaganda Department, Party  Committee of Departments under the Central Committee, CPC State  Organ Work Committee, Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and the  PLA General Political Department, Zhou Zhengqing said, since  1978, in the wake of the deepening reform of the nations'  economic system, a series of reform of the financial system has  also been implemented. Consequently, we are beginning to find  different kinds of financial institutions; we have a central  bank system and are gradually setting up a financial  macroeconomic regulation and control system that integrates  direct and indirect regulation and control; we have made  progress in creating new financial tools and different ways of  extending credit; we have a fledgling financial market; and we  have begun to restructure the foreign exchange control system.  We have further opened up the financial sector to the outside  world.    Zhou Zhengqing pointed out that despite the progress made in  the restructuring of China's financial system, the old system is  still flawed. Primarily, People's Bank of China has not turned  into a bona fide central bank. It has not really assumed the  responsibility of supervising the nation's financial activities.  The central bank itself is still handling some policy-oriented  loan business. We are still not utilizing the monetary policy  tools skillfully enough, and we lack effective indirect  regulation and control measures. The specialized banks are still  not separating government from enterprises, and unlike banks in  the market economy, they lack the mechanisms to discipline  themselves or let risks constrain their behavior. The financial  market lacks effective supervision which often leads to market  disorder and confusion. Reform with respect to the financial  infrastructure has been slow.    Zhou Zhengqing said, the main purpose of the restructuring  of  the financial system which begins next year is to turn People's  Bank of China into a bona fide central bank. The specific reform  measures are: To change People's Bank's functions and define its  duties. The headquarters of People's Bank will have the power to  issue currency, the power to manage basic money, and the power  to regulate and control the overall credit volume and regulate  the interest rate standards. The headquarters of the People's  Bank normally will have financial dealings only with the  national commercial banks. The branches' basic duties are to  exercise financial supervision and management, compile and  analyze statistics, regulate the money supply laterally, manage  the state treasury, regulate and transfer cash, and manage  foreign exchange and inter-bank settlement. In restructuring and  improving the monetary policy system, People's Bank's ultimate  goal is to maintain currency stability and in turn promote  economic growth. The monetary policy's intermediary and  operational targets are the money supply, the credit volume,  inter-bank short-term loan rates, and bank reserve rates.  Meanwhile we must strengthen the central bank's leadership,  supervision, and management of the nation's financial industry.    Zhou Zhengqing pointed out that, next year, we must set up  policy-oriented banks, achieve the separation of policy-oriented  and business-oriented financial undertakings, and solve the  problem of specialized banks taking on double responsibilities.  After the policy-oriented banks are established, they must  strengthen management, take their own risks, uphold the  principle of not doing money-losing business and not competing  with the commercial financial institutions, and accept People's  Bank's supervision on business matters. After separating out the  policy-oriented matters, existing state-owned specialized banks  should gradually be turned into state-owned commercial banks,  and they should operate like modern commercial banks. Zhou  Zhengqing said state-owned commercial banks should compete among  themselves, and their businesses may overlap. State-owned  commercial banks must not invest directly in nonfinancial  enterprises. Meanwhile we must actively but steadily develop a  cooperative bank system, which consists mainly of urban  cooperative and rural cooperative banks. Their responsibility is  to serve the medium-sized and small enterprises and the  agricultural and developing regions.    Zhou Zhengqing said, we must set up a unified and open,  orderly and competitive, and closely managed financial market  and a tightly controlled money market; we must clearly define  and regulate the market entities and their conduct to prevent  funds from draining away from the money market to the securities  market and the real estate market; we must perfect the national  debt market and create conditions that enable People's Bank to  engage in open market operations; we must perfect the stock  market and restructure the foreign exchange control system--the  long term goal is to turn RMB into a convertible currency.    Finally, Zhou Zhengqing emphasized that the direction of  next  year's restructuring of the financial system is set and specific  steps are mapped out, but in the actual implementation process,  particularly in changing from the old to the new system, we must  insist on controlling the total volume to prevent runaway  inflation. He said that this round of financial reform will be  more rigorous and broader in scope than previous rounds, and it  will entail major changes in the central bank itself. This means  we must pay even closer attention to controlling the total  volume; otherwise not only will the restructuring of the  financial system fail but the whole economic reform process will  be jeopardized. Thus, in next year's financial reform, before  the new monetary policy tools and specific measures are in full  operation or show initial improvement, we should not be rash and  abandon the original volume regulation and control measures  prematurely. Zhou Zhengqing said that after the policy-oriented  operations are taken out of the state-owned specialized banks,  it does not imply that they will automatically become commercial  banks. The transformation of specialized banks into commercial  banks is closely tied to the establishment and perfection of  China's modern enterprise system. It must be coordinated with  the reforms of the planned system, investment system, foreign  trade system, and taxation system. The transformation itself is  a process.    To implement financial reform, we need a series of financial  laws and regulations. Some parts of the reform must be defined  in legal format to ensure an orderly process. Next year will be  a year of financial legislation. We expect that more than 20  laws and regulations will be drawn up and ratified.</p>

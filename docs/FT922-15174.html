			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Parties revise for crucial test - The Issues, Education AFTER taxes and health, the future of Britain's schools and colleges is the campaign issue with the highest profile. The Liberal Democrats took the early initiative, hammering away at their commitment to raise the basic rate of tax by 1p to provide an extra Pounds 2bn in funding for next year and a similar sum the year after. Labour countered this week with details of its more modest plans to spend an extra Pounds 600m in 22 months - an increase of about 0.7 per cent in the education budget. The Tories have kept out of the auction - to their cost, according to the pollsters. In practice, state education spending is set to grow sharply, whichever party wins. All three parties support the real increases in teachers' pay begun, and likely to be continued, by the teachers' independent pay review body this year. All want to see a higher staying-on rate at the ages of 16 and 18, and endorse the target of one in three 18-year-olds going on to higher education by the year 2000 (from one in five now). The opposition parties would replace student loans by more generous grants. This would save money in the short-term because of the time taken to repay loans, but in the long term the switch will be a massive drain on the education budget. The spending argument is not, therefore, mainly about salaries and participation - but about class sizes, equipment, school buildings and nursery provision. Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesman, promises immediate improvements on all fronts. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow education secretary, is more cautious. He is restrained by Mr John Smith's modest 'recovery programme'. He promises a nursery place for all three-year-olds and four-year-olds who want them by 2000 (Mr Taylor proposes to do this within five years), while his Pounds 180m extra for school buildings - to tackle an estimated backlog of Pounds 4.5bn - compares with Mr Taylor's Pounds 1bn-plus. Both agree, however, that schools will get the bulk of extra resources. Lecturers are promised a pay review body, but universities will look in vain for the funds needed to greet 100,000 extra students with existing standards of accommodation and current student/lecturer ratios. Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, emphasises choice as the Tory message. If re-elected the Conservatives will leave A-levels unreformed, continue the assisted places scheme to pay private-school fees for low-income families, create more City Technology Colleges, and encourage all state schools to opt out of local authority control - with small primary schools to be allowed to opt out in groups if they would prefer. Grant-maintained schools will also be allowed to introduce selection, 'if that is what parents clearly want and it fits in with the wider needs of the local area', adds Mr Clarke cryptically. Those policies are bitterly resisted by opposition parties, but they have strong support from the Tory grassroots. Wandsworth, the Conservatives' model borough in south London, is bursting with ideas to take them further. Mr Edward Lister, Wandsworth's ebullient education chairman, was the brains behind Mr Clarke's ill-fated scheme for competing school inspectors; he also aroused local controversy last month with plans - hurriedly withdrawn - to cut more than Pounds 3m from local school budgets. He wants all the borough's nine secondary schools to join the three that have opted-out, and larger primary schools to do so 'when they are ready'. What role then for Wandsworth council? Mr Lister argues that the local authority will have four clear roles: 'It will be innovator, inspector, planner - making sites available for successful schools to expand - and educator of last resort.' On innovation, he points to new maths and non-verbal-reasoning tests to be introduced for 11-year-olds. Mr Lister is enthusiastic about selection, for commitment as much as ability. 'Yes, there will be rejects, but if children are to be rejected it's better they are rejected at 11 than later,' he says. His plans for the borough involve Battersea Park School becoming a technology college, Chestnut Grove School in Balham becoming a 'magnet school' in art and design, and he favours experimentation with 'bilateral schools' engaging in formal streaming. As to the rejects: 'we will pick them up as the education authority'. Mr Alf Dubs, fighting to regain the marginal Battersea seat for Labour, opposes all that. He derides changes to the character of schools as 'creating instability and division.' 'The bottom line of all this is selection,' he insists. 'That's the real agenda - and we will fight it tooth and nail.' So whoever wins on April 9, expect an education brawl.</p>

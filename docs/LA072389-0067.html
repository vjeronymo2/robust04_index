			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMFORTING HER HUSBAND'S LOVER;  </P> <P> MOON PASSAGE BY JANE LECOMPTE (HARPER &amp; ROW: $16.95; 187 PP.;  0-06-016120-5)  </P> <P> Wives have assorted ways of handling infidelity. Some fight; others flee, and  then there are those who fashion personalized permutations of either extreme.  "Moon Passage," a sublimely written and deeply satisfying first novel, is the  story of how one wife deals with her husband's chronic infidelity: Anne Ellis  sequesters herself in a magnificent stone house overlooking a craggy but  picturesque bluff on the Mendocino coast and tends her vegetable garden.  Literally.  </P> <P> There are those who would quarrel with her coping mechanism, but it seems to  serve her well -- preserving her sanity by focusing on the vegetables, the  vistas and her solitary flashback reveries of all those happier days when the  marriage was new and the children were small. Thus armed, she's more than a  match for the occasional discarded lovers who hike to her doorstep, curious to  meet her husband's muse, "the anima made flesh," as one of them describes her.  </P> <P> That is to say, she is more than a match for all but one. Of course, Anne does  not know this the morning that Ellen trudges over the hill toward the house:  "The sway of her steps falters . . . It has hit her how difficult it will be to  say, 'I have slept with your husband, and I just wanted to see you.' She  expects emotional fireworks . . . or she wouldn't be here. But at the same  time, she is a little afraid and, oddly, embarrassed. She can't imagine how to  break the news. It's hard to understand that you're doing something that's been  done before, and that you are perfectly obvious to those with more experience."  </P> <P> The scene is thus set for this rich and resonant character study of two women  in love, two women who meet as antagonists, although neither has the prize at  the moment. Successful author that he is, Jeff is off again, giving yet another  writing seminar -- and picking up yet another young, adoring fan for yet  another brief dalliance.  </P> <P> How a cool and in-control wife and a confused and still-consumed discarded  lover cut through the hostility, the suspicion and the fear that fuel their  emotions when they first meet are the pungent ingredients of this  thought-provoking and beautifully wrought tale that should provide wise lessons  in loving under unsettling circumstances.  </P> <P> In one of her revealing interior reveries, Anne tries to rationalize and  justify her situation: "Why had I thought my life would be a fairy tale when I  had deliberately, insistently, sought intensity? Hadn't I refused the nice  commonplace men who had now and then pursued me? I wanted an extraordinary man,  wanted my life to be like a meteor smearing the sky. My friends admired my  ambitions. None of them had the courage, or perhaps the insight, to point out  that the meteor is burning away."  </P> <P> The young and unsubtle Ellen, only 20 and not on familiar terms with  reflection, probes Anne for scraps of what Jeff is like and what the marriage  has been like, hungry for anything she's willing to share, determined to make a  collection of events she'd never shared. And Anne, after initial hesitation and  unfamiliar irritation, finds a quirky sort of satisfaction in tossing out these  little scenes of young married life, filling Ellen's empty emotional plate.  </P> <P> But throbbing through the book like a patient pulse is the theme of adjustment  to betrayal. Is Anne wrong to "indulge" her seldom-seen husband, grateful for  his occasional attention? Is Ellen wrong to be so outraged that she consciously  invades Anne's refuge in search of answers? Can two women at different stages  of life and with different levels of passion discover any common ground? Can  they comfort each other? Should they?  </P> <P> Which introduces the reader to yet another, less transparent but no less  meaningful theme: the inherent nature of the feminine -- the capacity to feel  deeply, the proclivity for compassion and the access to reconciliation.  </P> <P> "Moon Passage" is a telling exploration of the female psyche recorded by a  skillful traveler who already knows the terrain. As such, women readers will  find it a very rewarding journey.  </P></p>

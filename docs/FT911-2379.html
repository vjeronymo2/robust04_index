			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Observer: Battling back The Paris bourse, tired of seeing trading of French shares migrate to the London market, is to mount a counter-offensive towards the end of this year. In a UK 'road show', it will tell investors that dealing on the Paris stock market offers a better deal than using the London Stock Exchange's SEAQ International. For this 'battle of the bourses', the Parisians are hoping for further support from new research being done by Marco Pagano of the University of Naples and Ailsa Roell of the London School of Economics. The two have already lent credence to the Paris cause. Last year they reported a spread between buying and selling prices for French shares in London of 1.52 per cent, against 0.41 per cent in Paris. They also did much to puncture London's claim to run a more liquid market for big bargains, saying the Paris bourse could absorb large deals just as easily. Roell is quick to point out that the new study of market differences is not sponsored by the French. But, she adds, Paris has been eager to ply the researchers with data.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Police 'not in Cyprus to probe Nadir' SCOTLAND YARD said last night that the letter written by Mr Michael Mates to the attorney general on behalf of Mr Asil Nadir complaining about the behaviour of two police officers was based on misinformation. The letter, published in yesterday's Daily Mail, refers to a visit by two Metropolitan Police officers - Mr Jones and Mr Savin - to Northern Cyprus where, it claims, they made extensive inquiries about Mr Nadir and his assets. Scotland Yard last night confirmed that the two officers visited Northern Cyprus but said: 'They had no association with or responsibility for any investigation relating to Mr Nadir.' They were there on completely different business, it added. In a statement which is virtually unprecedented and which raises questions about the source of Mr Mates's information, Scotland Yard said police officers Mr David Jones and Mr Geoff Savin were members of SO1(3), a branch of the Metropolitan Police's international and organised crime branch dealing with extradition and deportation. Scotland Yard said the two officers had been together in Northern Cyprus only once, on October 9, 1991, in connection with the deportation of a Turkish Cypriot, Mr Surmeli Tuluco. Mr Jones made a further visit to the island on November 5, 1992 with another unnamed officer, while Mr Savin visited on November 11, again with a second officer, on both occasions in connection with different deportations. Separately, the Serious Fraud Office, which has been the investigating Mr Nadir's business affairs with officers seconded from the Metropolitan fraud squad, said that 'none of them have ever been to Northern Cyprus.' Mr Mates' letter was sent to the attorney general on March 17, 1993 with a photocopy of a certificate allegedly issued by the acting commissioner of police in Northern Cyprus, detailing the dates of arrival and departure of Mr Jones and Mr Savin. The letter alleges both men stayed at the Altin Kaya Hotel, where they made extensive inquiries of the proprietor, Mr Fahri Otcuoglu. Mr Otcuoglu said he remembered two visits by Mr Jones and Mr Savin: one at the end of September 1991, when they stayed for three days, the other at the end of May 1992, when they stayed for five or six days. His hotel, a small bungalow on the outskirts of Kyrenia, was unable to provide any registration book or other documentation to confirm this. But the acting police commissioner for Northern Cyprus, Mr Ali Cetin Karahan, said yesterday he had no recollection of either a Mr Jones or Mr Savin coming to the island. One of the hotel's barmen, an Englishman who asked not to be named, said he recalled a visit by Mr Jones and Mr Savin, but insisted the two men had been there on deportation duties.</p>

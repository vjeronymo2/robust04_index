			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Books: Diarist with a dramatist's ear - JDF Jones on Alan Bennett, 30 years on WRITING HOME by Alan Bennett Faber Pounds 17.50, 417 pages Alan Bennett must be chuffed to read his publisher's announcement on the jacket of Writing Home that he is 'one of Britain's best-loved writers'. From Beyond The Fringe to National Treasure in 30 years] The journey from a Leeds butcher's shop to the trendiest intellectuals' street in London surely goes to prove what a splendid, upwardly-mobile country this can be. 'Best-loved'? Oh dear . . . It helps, of course, if you have a wonderful talent to go with the sort of determination and sheer hard work that you cannot quite hide beneath the timid, cardiganed image. Bennett, now an unbelievable 60, is a great wit and a playwright and a performer and a diarist, working in theatre, television and print with almost equal skill, and he deserves every bit of his celebrity (not to mention Britain's love). Writing Home is a compendium. It contains a selection from his diaries of the 1980s, repeats of his pieces in the London Review of Books (most famously The Lady in the Van, his memoir of nutty Miss Shepherd, whom he allowed to park in his garden for 15 years), and odds and sods of journalism, scripts, reviews, plus one-off appearances like his brave speech at the memorial service for his friend Russell Harty. Because much of Writing Home has already appeared in print elsewhere, most attention is going to be paid to the extracts from the diaries. Bennett has been keeping a regular if not daily journal for 25 years, of course; these pages from 1980 are no more than a careful selection. The extracts are invariably either very quotable or very funny, and often both - they are the sort of thing you are constantly tempted to read out to your companion - but I cannot help feeling that published diaries need to be complete, or at least much fuller than this, to achieve their full impact. It used to be rumoured in NW1 that the Bennett diaries would eventually be published posthumously and in full, in all their embarrassment and delight: Faber might remember that. This is, of course, just one way of my saying that we would like more of the same. What we have on display here, not just in the diaries, are, first, a constant and magnificent wit (asked by the BBC for a comment on Pinter's 50th birthday, he thought, too late, of proposing a two-minute silence; Lady Ottoline Morrell is described as 'well-to-do and six foot two'; of Philip Larkin, 'Schweitzer in the Congo did not derive more credit than Larkin did for living in Hull'). Second, there is the English class thing, which includes nostalgia, nervousness, a sense of deprivation ('Class isn't what it was; or nowadays perhaps people's embarrassments are differently located'). There goes with this the gift of a particular detailed memory - see his recollection of the childhood experience of a Leeds tram ride. And for Bennett, timidity apparently goes with apprehension, sometimes expressed with alarming candour: 'My nightmare when blackberrying (or when I stop the car for a pee) is that I shall find the body of a child, that I will report it, and be suspected of the crime'. Behind all this there is an instinctive radicalism. The Gibraltar shootings and the Falklands war figure largely in the diaries: he knows, and explains, how, why, he hates, loves, England. Always, there is the dramatist's ear for quotation: 'I am having supper at the Odeon (New York) when word goes round the tables that John Lennon has been shot. 'This country of ours,' sighs my waiter. 'May I tell you the specials for this evening?'' The dramatist moves, inevitably if incongruously, among the good and the great - 'Supper with the Waltons and Russell Harty. Wm Walton has asked me to write a companion piece for his one-act opera The Bear . . .' More interesting, on a later occasion, 'Liz Taylor perched momentarily on my knee (and pretty uncomfortable it was too).' The serious point Bennett makes in his Introduction is to describe a tension between what he calls the metropolitan and the provincial modes in his writing; he puts this, rather movingly, in an anecdote of an absurd encounter in a Leeds street between his mother and TS Eliot (she is later told by her son of the Nobel Prize - 'I'm not surprised. It was a beautiful overcoat'.) He seems to think that he has not yet closed the gap between his provincial (ie northern) and his metropolitan voices. I think he is wrong, and that if he never wrote another word, after Forty Years On, An Englishman Abroad, A Question of Attribution, Talking Heads, The Madness of George III, and all the rest, not forgetting his original creation of Mark Boxer's The Stringalongs, he would be remembered as one of the very few writers who spoke for our mixed-up generation. He practises compassion as well as wit. Like this. His mother had Alzheimer's towards the end; he would visit her in Weston-super-Mare. 'There are sheep in the field. 'I know what they are,' she says, 'but I don't know what they are called.' Thus Wittgenstein is routed by my mother.' Wonderful.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Key interest rates unchanged at The Bundesbank The Bundesbank left its key interest rates unchanged yesterday as its policy-making council met for the first time since announcing cuts in official interest rates on July 1, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The markets had not been expecting reductions so soon after the Bundesbank's last moves. The discount and Lombard rates remain at 6.75 and 8.25 per cent respectively. At the same time, the bank reaffirmed that there would be no change in its target range for growth in broad money supply, so-called M3. The range will remain at 4.5 to 6.5 per cent for the year, although the annualised rate was running at 6.9 per cent in May.</p>

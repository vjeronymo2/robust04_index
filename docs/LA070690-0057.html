			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: PRIX FIXE AT THIS S.D. BISTRO MEANS A DELUXE MEAL  AT AFFORDABLE PRICE  </P> <P> Just about anyone with a pulse can recall the conspicuous consumption of the  1980s, which, in the case of restaurants, led to what could only be called a  glorious explosion of possibilities.  </P> <P> This zest for spending also led to a remarkable explosion of prices, but now  that the 1990s have struck, it seems that the junk bond dealers have played  their last trump and that a degree of reality has settled in.  </P> <P> The news in recent months from New York, where upwards of 30,000 Wall Street  workers have lost their jobs, is that restaurant prices have been slashed in  response to the slump in expense-account spending. The three-martini lunch  isn't dead, just cheaper.  </P> <P> Such East Coast happenings always hit the West Coast a little late, but they do  show up sooner or later, and we may be about to get a break in the cost of a  good dinner out. One sign may be the return of the prix fixe (fixed priced)  dinner, which is tentatively rearing its more affordable head at a few spots  around town. The lovely thing about un diner prix fixe is that it offers two or  three courses at a price generally below that of an entree ordered a la carte.  </P> <P> Mid-town San Diego's The French Side of the West offers nothing but prix fixe  and has been a mad success since it opened two years ago. Another 2-year-old  that just now has begun to experiment with the concept is Paul Dobson's  handsome St. James Bar in the Golden Triangle.  </P> <P> The menu offers starters priced from $4.50 to $9.50 (except the caviar  listings, which understandably cost much more) and entrees from $17 to $27. The  new nightly choice of two prix fixe dinners include soup or salad and entree at  $16.50, and since the kitchen prepares these with the same high-quality  ingredients and garnishes them just as lavishly, a luxury dinner has become  relatively more affordable.  </P> <P> The choices recently have included such things as a Provencal saute of calamari  (the sauce here interpreted as a little tomato and a lot of garlic) and a  simply remarkable duck confit laid over a sauce too modestly described as a  "horseradish cream." The duck, slowly simmered in its own fat (of which it has  a great deal) and juices, and then left to steep and gain virtue for a few  days, had a burnished exterior and wonderfully rich, juicy flesh.  </P> <P> The kitchen sliced the breast and arranged the pieces in a crescent below the  leg-thigh portion; the whole was underlain by a stiff, beurre blanc sort of  sauce seasoned with just enough horseradish to make it sharp. The sharpness, of  course, worked to cut the unctuous richness of the bird.  </P> <P> The restaurant also soon will introduce an expanded menu with the entree list  divided into "bistro" and "Dobson's favorites" sections. The bistro portion  will include entrees into the $14-to-$17 range, such as duck, frog legs and  seafoods; the higher-priced rack of lamb, venison, lobster and veal dishes more  traditional at this restaurant will be listed in the second category.  </P> <P> This restaurant has matured nicely since chef Christian Vignes succeeded his  fellow Frenchman, Jacques Pastor, at the range. Vignes has retained the high  tone of the menu while expanding it considerably, and the daily-changed list  now typically offers nearly 20 entrees.  </P> <P> Vignes has to some degree reintroduced classic haute cuisine, which he tempers  with more contemporary offerings. Among the classics would be sauteed beef  tournedos with a forestiere (mushroom) sauce made of costly morels; a roasted  breast of free-range chicken with garlic and thyme sauce; grilled veal chop  with grain mustard sauce, and Alaska halibut in the charmingly old-fashioned  Veronique treatment, which calls for a white wine sauce finished with grapes.  </P> <P> In a slightly more modern vein, Vignes recently offered sauteed frog legs with  a chive-garlic sauce of pungent potency; there are those who might feel a  little squeamish about this particular meat, but it really is quite delicate,  and this particular treatment does it full justice. Another offering that  updated a classic approach was a roasted tenderloin of pork, sliced and  garnished with a sweet-sharp sauce of griottes, or bitter cherries. The same  sauce would be happy with duck, which is why it worked so well with a rich meat  like pork.  </P> <P> More modern entrees would be sauteed duck breast in a citron sauce tricked out  with candied lemon zest and the poached Maine lobster on a bed of sauteed  spinach. The spinach, chopped almost to a paste and butter-fried to an  unexpected crispness, was arranged in a precise triangle under the shelled  beast, which in turn was coated with mildly anise-flavored Pernod sauce. In  this context, the spinach had an herbal effect that, in tandem with the herbal  liqueur in the sauce, gave a new, slightly wild (or gamy) taste to the lobster.  </P> <P> This full-on French menu also offers long lists of starters, commencing with  caviars, snails and smoked salmon and growing more interesting with Quilcine  oysters on the half-shell, the newly available, genuine prosciutto ham imported  from Parma, Italy (it is, unexpectedly but deliciously, quite sweet) and a  large selection of soups. This category always includes a cream soup or two and  the house signature dish, mussel bisque baked under puff pastry. Another  regular is vichyssoise, the curse of the banquet circuit but here so velvety in  texture and rich in flavor as to explain why bowdlerized versions have become  ubiquitous.  </P> <P> The salads also are quite interesting, and run to such things as baked goat  cheese layered atop designer greens and grilled sea scallops with costly mache  lettuce. A really fine offering is the salad of sauteed sweetbreads, each  nugget crowned with a truffle shaving, arranged over baby greens and doused  with a citrus-flavored dressing; this might be a good starting point for anyone  who has wanted to try sweetbreads but has been unwilling to commit to a full  entree order. The salads mentioned here are in the $7.50-$8.50 range and may  not be ordered with the fixed-price dinner; the house salad served as prelude  to that meal is nonetheless a good, well-garnished tumble of greens and  vegetables.  </P> <P> St. James Bar offers a tray devoted to house-prepared sweets that includes  fruit tarts, a creamy cheesecake or two, the richly chocolate and coyly  triangular "Golden Triangle" and an even more chocolaty terrine of the  bittersweet stuff, doused in a minted custard sauce and irresistible to the  last spoonful.  </P> <P> </P> <P> * ST. JAMES BAR  </P> <P> 4370 La Jolla Village Drive  </P> <P> 453-6650  </P> <P> Lunch served weekdays, dinner Monday through Saturday; closed Sunday.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $50 to $90.  </P></p>

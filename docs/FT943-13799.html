			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Puzzles over jobs Encouraging it may be. Crystal clear it is not. The UK economy last week breezed through another month's price, wage and employment data, entering the weekend with the added windfall of an endorsement from the OECD. Little has changed in the general picture of the recovery which previous months' figures have revealed. But no change, either, in the murkiness of some of the details. The OECD's comments on the UK economy might be by Mr Kenneth Clarke himself. Overall, the organisation judges the UK to have made 'major strides' in restructuring its macro-economic policy framework. Barring mishaps, the authors expect the UK at the end of next year to be exhibiting much the same mix of above-trend output growth, low inflation and falling unemployment, 'albeit with the latter still above its 'natural rate' '. The OECD parts company with Mr Clarke when it comes to the longer term: not least over his ability to deliver the government's ambitious targets for public spending. But last week's economic data will have given the organisation few reasons to revise the optimistic shorter-term prognosis. Producer and consumer prices continue to rise at a restrained pace. For the third month in a row, the retail price index was up 2.6 per cent year on year, well within the government's 1-4 per cent target range. The underlying growth in average earnings was also unchanged, at 3.75 per cent year on year. The OECD agrees with the Treasury that gross domestic product will grow by about 2.75 per cent this year, although the organisation differs in expecting this to edge higher in 1995. Both seem to think the economy can grow faster than its historical trend of 2.25 per cent without immediately endangering the government's inflation targets. This seems plausible after a long recession. The labour market also appears to be giving good news. Eighteen months ago, when the OECD last analysed the UK, few predicted the steady fall in unemployment which started soon after. But, even though 329,000 fewer are now claiming the dole, earnings and employment data show little sign of an upsurge in the labour market. Average weekly hours in manufacturing have now fallen for two consecutive months, while the number working short-time has actually increased. Even more striking, the total number in employment remains 37,000 fewer than when unemployment started to fall in January 1993. Indeed, the number of men employed, down 138,000 over the period, has not registered a quarterly increase since the end of 1989. Why this recovery has proved jobless in this way is not easily understood, though part of the reason must be that economic growth has been little faster than the long-term trend. Whatever the reason, the failure of employment to rise may also deprive the government of a solid recovery in its popularity.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / International Company News: S&amp;P lowers debt rating for Swedbank SWEDEN's banking system took another blow when Standard &amp; Poor's, the US agency, downgraded the short-term debt ratings of Swedbank, the savings bank group. Swedbank's Eurocommercial paper and certificates of deposit ratings, together with Swedbank Inc's US CP rating, were cut to A-2 from A-1. S&amp;P said the move reflected 'a rapid and severe weakening of asset quality within certain of the 11 Swedish saving banks which will merge with Swedbank on January 1, forming Sparbanken Sverige group'.</p>

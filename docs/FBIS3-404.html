			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring and Dirk van Eeden] </F>   [Text] Rampant Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF]  leaders yesterday swept aside an attempt by former SADF [South  African Defence Force] chief Constand Viljoen and his moderate  generals to register a right-wing party for the April elections.    After a bitter nine-hour crisis meeting, in which numerous  personal insults were directed at General Viljoen, hardline  Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg announced  triumphantly to rapturous applause: "We will not take part in  the elections."    The crisis was sparked by a last-minute decision by General  Viljoen to have included on the ballot an organisation known as  the Freedom Front, with himself as leader.    He did so in response to the decision by the Inkatha Freedom  Party -- the Volksfront's leading ally in the Freedom Alliance  -- to register provisionally for the elections on Friday [4  March] night.    General Viljoen said after yesterday's meeting he had  registered for strategic purposes. It has been established that  he did so without Dr Hartzenberg's blessing.    After the meeting's decision, however, General Viljoen said  the registration of the front would now lapse.    The decision by the Volksraad -- the AVF's transitional  parliament -- to allow the registration to lapse was taken by 73  votes to 20 in a secret ballot insisted upon by CP MPs Corne and  Pieter Mulder, part of General Viljoen's moderate faction.    Those who spoke in favour of the decision to register during  the stormy meeting included Major-General Tienie Groenewald,  Lieutenant-General Kobus Visser, Lieutenant-General Koos  Bischoff, CP Cape leader Jan Hoon, the Mulder brothers and  another CP MP, Petrus Groenewald.    General Viljoen said he would remain in the AVF and would  abide by the decision. "I won't abandon the idea of a volkstaat  [homeland]. I have an obsession to arrive at a point where my  people will survive."    However, Dr Peter Mulder seemed resigned to the fact that he  would not be returning to Parliament.    "There is a short route and a long route to obtaining a  volkstaat. It now seems they want to take the long route," he  said. "The decision went against us. But I'm a fighter; I will  win in the end."    Dr Hartzenberg thanked General Viljoen for his "foresight in  making the provisional registration". He had done so in the  best interests of the organisation. But the election was not  an acceptable test of support for the volkstaat idea, and the  AVF was not prepared to give ligitimacy to the constitution by  taking part.    The AVF, added Dr Hartzenberg, would continue to put  pressure  on the election in pursuit of the ideal of self-determination.  It would also continue to press for a referendum to test  support for a volkstaat.    Yesterday's decision, announced after the meeting held  behind  closed doors, followed a night of high drama on Friday.    For the Volksfront, founded on May 19 last year, it was the  night of the generals, starting with a flurry of one-on-one  meetings and ending with a late-night dash from Pretoria to the  World Trade Centre in Kempton Park.    The generals -- Viljoen, Groenewald (former military  intelligence [Counter Intelligence Division] chief), Visser  (former CID chief) and Koos Bischoff (former SADF chief of  staff, planning) -- learned of the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party]  decision to register provisionally for the elections on the  SABC's [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 6PM news.    At 8PM, a small group of Volkfront employees crossed the  street from their headquarters in Hatfield, Pretoria to watch  the main news bulletin at a restaurant.    They were still not sure the IFP had "handed in the papers"  at the World Trade Centre, and it was not until 9PM that they  received confirmation that the IFP's Dr Frank Mdlalose had, in  fact done so.    General Viljoen left the Volksfront headquarters at 8PM to  keep an appointment with a foreign diplomat. When he returned  30 minutes later, his face was strained.    Shortly before 9PM, General Groenewald arrived, followed 15  minutes later by Afrikaner Volkswag [Afrikaner National Watch]  leader Professor Carel Boshoff and CP MP for Pretoria West  Joseph Chiole. Also at the meeting were the Mulder brothers.    At 9.17PM, a visibly agitated General Visser entered the  building.    Just eight minutes later, General Viljoen, General Visser  and  Professor Boshoff left. Reliable sources said yesterday they  had gone to Dr Hartzenberg's house.    What was said at that meeting is not known, but events moved  swiftly from then on.    General Bischoff entered Volksfront headquarters at 9.40PM.  At 9.58PM, Mr Chiole ran from the building and was heard to  mutter "time is running out".    He returned soon afterwards, but at 10.56PM, he and  Volksfront spokesman Stephan Manning left in a hurry, speeding  off in Mr Chiole's red Alfa.    They were on their way to pick up a cheque for  R[Rand]70,000,  the amount needed to register the Vryheids-front -- Freedom  Front -- for the polls.    General Viljoen, accompanied by Professor Boshoff, General  Visser and General Bischoff, left for the World Trade Centre at  11.01PM.    At some stage in the evening, sources said, General Viljoen  consulted Dr Hartzenberg, who refused to agree to registration  before the Friday midnight deadline.    He had pointed out that any decision to take part in the  election would have to be taken by the Volksraad at its meeting  yesterday afternoon.    General Viljoen impressed on Dr Hartzenberg that the  chairman  of the Independent Electoral Commission, Mr Justice Johan  Kriegler, had said the deadline for registration was final and  that a decision had to be taken immediately.    On arrival at the World Trade Centre, General Viljoen said  he  had come to talk to registration officials "to see if I can  persuade them to let me hand in the papers and the cheque  provisionally, subject to approval by the Volksraad".    He later issued a statement saying that due to the IFP's  decision to register provisionally, he had realised freedom to  exercise "the strategic options" of the Afrikaner people would  be "severely restricted) if the right wing did not follow suit.    "Due to the limited time available, this decision could not  be approved in advance by the Afrikaner Volksfront," he said.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Fresh setback for British Library Defective wiring is the latest in a series of misfortunes to have plagued the construction of the Pounds 450m new home for the British Library at St Pancras in London. The project, running several years late and substantially over its original budget, has attracted widespread criticism over the way it has been managed. The first phase of the development - forecast to cost Pounds 116m when it was launched in 1978 by the then edu-cation secretary Mrs Shirley Williams - is due to be handed over next year. It is now expected to have cost at least Pounds 300m and will be much smaller than originally planned. It was not known yesterday whether the latest setback, described by officials as serious, will cause further delays. Copper wire, normally protected by plastic casing, is understood to have become exposed leaving the system vulnerable to short-circuiting. An interim report from Kennedy &amp; Donkin, the Surrey-based engineering consultants, is believed to estimate that up to 80 per cent of the first phase wiring may be affected. A 1991 report by the Commons public accounts committee, the public spending watchdog, strongly criticised the Office of Arts and Libraries, the department responsible for commissioning the building, and the Property Services Agency, which is over-seeing its design and construction. It blamed both bodies for 'serious management weaknesses', for cost increases and for producing an unsuitable building. When both phases are completed in 1996 it will seat 1,176 readers - only 73 more than can be housed currently - compared with the 3,440 originally planned. In 1991 the development hit fresh problems when mobile shelves, made in the Netherlands, jammed and the anti-corrosive paint covering them peeled. Their replacement at the makers' expense caused a further two-year delay in the project, which was expected to have been completed in the late 1980s. The PSA projects division, responsible for the library, was acquired last year by Tarmac, the UK construction company, which has no financial liability for defects to the St Pancras development caused before it acquired the business.</p>

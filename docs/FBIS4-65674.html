			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- The Bundestag adopted the law on the fight  against crime with the votes of the coalition today. It is  designed to accelerate legal proceedings, to increase the  punishment for drug dealers, and to make possible the  involvement of the Federal Intelligence Service in the fight  against criminal gangs. The Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] rejected the law and announced improvements by the  Bundesrat.    The Bundestag unanimously adopted several amendments to laws  making the fight against right-wing radicalism more efficient.  Among other things, denying the killing of Jews by the National  Socialists and the wearing of Nazi symbols will become  punishable.</p>

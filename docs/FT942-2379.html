			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Management: Desert island manager - John Monks John Monks, 48-year-old general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, is not looking forward to his time on a desert island. A 'moderniser' who is trying to reverse years of TUC decline, he would not, however, seek to direct events back in the office from the end of a telephone. 'I'm one of those who believes out of sight out of mind,' he says. How would you cope with loneliness? 'I've got a good strain of self-reliance, which means I like walking the hills. I'd be pretty relaxed thinking out things. But, after a few days I'd get bored with my own company.' If you could take one person with you who would it be? 'I have to say my wife, who would go beserk if I said anybody else. But if I could one other person it would be a shipwright or somebody who could help get me back to civilisation.' One luxury? 'A Portacabin for a degree of comfort. I like roughing it for short periods but after a couple of weeks I'd get tired of sleeping in a tent.' What additional item would you need for the beachside office, part from a fax or a telephone? 'A radio tuned to the World Service. I'm a news junkie. I would probably be anxious about not being in touch but I don't think that I'd have any influence on the course of history, or the TUC, while I was away.' How would you keep yourself occupied? 'I'd like to learn to play the piano and improve my tennis. I'd also try and polish my writing skills and perhaps write a novel set in provincial England, a kitchen sink of the 1990s, about a young person growing up in a town that was a bit less grimy than where I was brought up but where there are less opportunities than in the 1960s.' An after dinner film? 'Can I take two please? First, Some Like it Hot, with Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe. I can watch that several times a year. Also, a film that improves with watching is I'm Alright Jack, with Peter Sellers. I find the charactures more attractive every time I see them.' One book? 'The one that bears re-reading and has had a lot of influence on my life is The Grapes of Wrath, which I first read at 15. Whenever my appetite for social change gets dulled, re-reading that book replenishes me and I get stuck in again.' Music? 'I'm very much into Mozart's operas at the moment. I'm saving Wagner for my old age.' Food? 'I eat to live, rather than the other way round. So I would be fairly relaxed about food. But, I'd enjoy some real ale and a couple of bottles of malt whisky. If you were stuck on the desert island for the rest of your life how would you like to be remembered? 'One generation which passeth away and another generation cometh'. Ecclesiastes i2.</p>

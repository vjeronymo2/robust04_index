			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Dispatches: A shaky convalescent patches up its wounds - Dubrovnik How do cities return to life? After war, the threads of urban life are more easily knitted together than in scattered rural areas, but what of a city like Dubrovnik, long dependent on tourism and little else, stranded at the furthest finger-tip of Croatia? Sunning herself in a warm corner of south eastern Europe, Dubrovnik is a shaky convalescent uncertain of her prospects for full recovery. The Old City, a potent symbol of Dubrovnik, is an hermetic, self-absorbed place. Walled as securely as Aleppo, as other-worldly as Venice, its atmosphere is curiously febrile. Late on a hot Saturday afternoon the sound of blaring horns approaches; Dubrovnik is traffic-free save for service vehicles. Expensive cars screams into the square by St Blaise's church. It is a wedding. People are dressed to the hilt, as expensive looking as the vehicles. The whole event was theatre for anyone who cared to watch. Onlookers gasped at the sheer nerve of this gesture of defiance to the poverty of expectations. Dubrovnik is still pock-marked, several of its important buildings shored by scaffolding, but it has remained remarkably intact. Damage to roofs has been largely made good, the breach in the city walls healed. Weals blasted into the silky, cream-coloured limestone paving of the main street have been patched with grey concrete, but the gashes in the flights of steps up to the Jesuit church remain jagged reminders of outrage. The Institute for Protection of Cultural Monuments, once happily disbursing an annual Dollars 10m budget, now exists on a fraction of that sum. The staff of 18 take home one fifth of their former salaries. Much of their work is in compiling detailed evidence of the damaged villages in the countryside behind Dubrovnik. The old city received 49 shells in its three-month bombardment, but only seven were primed to explode. Heroic tales include those of the Yugoslavian admiral who is in jail for refusing to attack Dubrovnik and the army general who fled to the city with his family rather than obey commands. Piles of sandbags and stacked building materials are reminders that the repairs go on. A young-faced, grey-haired woman in black and a teenage girl scurry to and fro down the lanes carrying roof tiles, which they pile on the steps. From the walls, you can see recently planted fruit trees and well-tended vegetable gardens; a city which has known siege speedily learns, and remembers, old techniques of survival. The women in the markets patiently wait to sell tiny heaps of grapes, figs and tomatoes. Men living in damaged tourist hotels while their villages are being revived, are bussed daily to the land from which much of the produce is brought. Women are being trained to make traditional embroidery and weaving for sale at home and abroad. But it is said that life in the hotels is degenerating; drugs and prostitution are making in-roads, fast movers beside the slow business of rebuilding. Along the main street in the old city, the cafes are busy, social centres where people effortlessly pass two hours of a morning. Pale, bemused-looking Spanish country boys - not tourists, but UN forces taking a day or two off duty - enjoy good coffee and gaze at the golden, careless Dalmatian teenagers. Signs of the desperate shrinkage of tourism are everywhere. The single entrance to the walkway along the city walls (reduced from three), the thin selection of souvenirs, the absence of guidebooks, and the solitude in which one visits the museums that remain open. The multi-lingual signs for rooms to rent are rusting fast. Discordancy of mood meets one at every turn in this city. Eight 12-year-old girls link arms and skip down a side street singing. Teenagers lounge outside a club, from which a cloud of disco music billows. 'Where are you from, why are you here?' a couple of elderly men ask me one afternoon. 'A conference,' I answer sheepishly. 'What use conferences?' one asks with justifiable cynicism. 'Where do I come from?' he asks rhetorically. 'I am Montenegran, my wife is Croatian. My family has lived in Dubrovnik for 70 years. I sailed the world for 30 years, I could show my passport anywhere. 'Now, I belong nowhere, my son has no nationality. Where do we go from here?' The citizens of Dubrovnik hover between peace and war, between devastation and rebuilding, waiting for answers, as the foreign delegates go home, through an airport which asks you to declare your weapons before boarding the aircraft.</p>

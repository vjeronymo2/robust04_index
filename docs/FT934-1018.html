			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Bundeswehr to pull out of Somalia The German cabinet last night decided to pull its 1,700 troops out of Somalia months after the country embarked on its first peace-keeping mission with the United Nations. The decision coincides with the phased withdrawal of US troops due to be completed next March. The troops were primarily involved in logistical, medical and infrastructure activity and had not been based in Mogadishu, the capital. They were dispatched to Somalia after a long political debate about Germany's military role in the post-cold war era. Its activities had been restricted by the constitution, which confined all military operations to Nato territory. Chancellor Helmet Kohl's governing Christian Democrats have lobbied hard for Germany gradually to play a more active role internationally.</p>

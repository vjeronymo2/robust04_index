During the period the company acquired Skillion, a light industrial property specialist. Mr Kingshott, managing director of Skillion, joined the Embassy board and acquired 35m shares from Mr Tai Yu Wong, Embassy chairman, and Mr Tai Lu Wong, who previously owned 53.6m shares, a holding of 51.4 per cent. Mr Kingshott was appointed managing director of Jacobs after a boardroom shake-up earlier this year.</p>

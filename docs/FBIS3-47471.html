Mondale conveyed Inman's wish to Aichi when he visited the  Japanese Defense Agency chief, officials said.    Aichi also expressed the hope of meeting with Inman at an  early stage, the officials said.    On Aichi's hope for an early visit to the United States, the  Defense Agency is now trying to arrange a trip but it could be  delayed until March or later because of Japanese Diet affairs  and the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget, official sources  said.    Last December, President Bill Clinton named Inman, a former  top Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official, to succeed Aspin  as defense secretary.</p>

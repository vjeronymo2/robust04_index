			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SMALL MIRACLES MARK JUDAISM'S RITE OF PASSAGE FOR SPECIAL FEW  </P> <P> In 1977, when her two sons were 5 and 2, Lora Jerugim gave birth to the  daughter, Elisa, she always wanted.  </P> <P> "I had fantasies about who she would be and what we would share. Of course, she  would be completely articulate by the age of 2, and someday I would teach her  to play the piano," Jerugim said. "And when she grew older we would recommend  books to each other to read. I had images of our whole family sitting at a  table assembling a thousand-piece puzzle."  </P> <P> The future was set.  </P> <P> But after Elisa was born, facts began to replace fantasy. At 6 months, Elisa  couldn't roll over. At one year, she couldn't sit up. Her mother took almost  daily trips to social service agencies, physical and occupational therapists,  physicians and educators -- anyone who might be able to figure out what was  wrong with Elisa.  </P> <P> Jerugim said doctors could "offer no precise diagnosis," only that Elisa was  "developmentally delayed."  </P> <P> The future would have to change.  </P> <P> "I learned to let go of the high expectations," said Jerugim, 43, of Los  Angeles. "I decided to let her be who she was going to be."  </P> <P> But next year, Jerugim will be able to watch her daughter fulfill one  expectation that, only a few years ago, seemed impossible. She can watch Elisa  go through one of the most important rituals in Jewish family life.  </P> <P> Elisa, 11, is learning about Noah's Ark, Adam and Eve, and the Ten Commandments  in Hebrew School at Valley Beth Shalom Synagogue in Encino. On July 7, 1990,  she will celebrate her bat mitzvah, the traditional rite of passage when a Jew,  at 13, becomes an adult in the eyes of the community. Boys have bar mitzvahs.  </P> <P> "Both of her brothers had bar mitzvahs, and she's entitled to her day, too,"  Jerugim said. "Why not?"  </P> <P> Elisa is enrolled in the synagogue's "Shaare Tikva" -- The Gates of Hope --  program. Established in 1983, the class, which meets from 9 to 11 a.m. Sundays,  teaches a dozen disabled youngsters from Los Angeles and the San Fernando  Valley the laws and customs of Judaism.  </P> <P> Students study the rites connected with Jewish holidays and the ethical and  moral guidelines written in the Talmud and Torah.  </P> <P> And, as the students approach age 13, after about three to five years of  classes, they learn the necessary skills -- reading aloud from the Old  Testament, reciting traditional blessings -- to hold a bar or bat mitzvah in  front of hundreds of worshipers.  </P> <P> "The bar mitzvah is of ultimate importance in Judaism," said Neal Schnall,  principal of Valley Beth Shalom Hebrew School. "Because it's so public, it  cements a Jew's identity in his own mind and in the mind of the community. The  Jew now has the right and responsibility to observe the laws."  </P> <P> For parents, the ceremony affirms a family's status in the congregation. But  for the families in Shaare Tikva, it means something more.  </P> <P> When Danny LeCover, 13, of Los Angeles talks, his speech is slurred; his body  movements are awkward. But he celebrated his bar mitzvah in October at  University Synagogue in Brentwood after taking classes at the Encino temple.  </P> <P> "How could we expect Danny to have a bar mitzvah?" asked his mother, Deborah  LeCover, 43. "My God, he can't even hold a pencil."  </P> <P> But Danny read several passages from the Old Testament, and he delivered a  speech to the congregation.  </P> <P> "Danny can share the rich traditions with us," Deborah LeCover said. "We can be  a family. With Danny, there's no running to play with Billy or going to the  mall. There is no soccer or Valentine Day dances. There's not a lot. So you  search continually for something. Anything."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Funded by Parents  </P> <P> Funded by the parents ($370 per child) and the Jewish Federation in Los  Angeles, Shaare Tikva is one of several programs in Southern California that  serve about 500 Jewish students with learning disabilities.  </P> <P> In addition to Valley Beth Shalom, synagogues that offer classes for students  with learning disabilities include Congregation Ner Tamid in Rancho Palos  Verdes, Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills, Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks and  Temple Isaiah in Rancho Park. Shaare Tikva is run only at the Encino synagogue.  </P> <P> "Our community has room for everyone," said Elaine Albert, coordinator for the  Commission on Jews with Disabilities in Los Angeles, which helped set up the  programs. "All Jews should have the opportunity to participate in Jewish life."  </P> <P> Teachers and parents say it is unclear to what degree the youngsters retain  their new Jewish knowledge and how it affects them emotionally.  </P> <P> "What matters more is that Elisa is connecting with Judaism at some level,"  Lora Jerugim said. "She is a complete human being like the rest of us, and if  we can provide her with the whole range of human experiences, that's what we  shoot for."  </P> <P> Mike Sirota, Shaare Tikva's music teacher, believes that the students sense the  program's significance and value Judaism in their lives.  </P> <P> "I think they feel a spiritual peace and that it feels right for them to be  here," said Sirota, 39, of Santa Monica. "They have feelings. They just can't  express them the same way. You can't keep these kids away."  </P> <P> Four years ago at a Hanukkah party, Sirota said, he was singing with the  students when a 6-year-old girl approached him. She just stood and stared --  and listened. Their eyes met, only inches apart. When the song ended, she  clapped and walked back to her seat, never uttering a word.  </P> <P> "But she had communicated with me," Sirota said, "and that's what it's all  about. This class allows them to communicate."  </P> <P> Each student finds something special in the class. Elisa likes to draw. Danny  plays games. Another student, Noah Frank, 6, of Canoga Park, loves to read the  Jewish calendar. Parents say the youngsters look forward to Sundays and often  recite the new songs in the car on the way home and in the house during the  week.  </P> <P> As Schnall explains, Shaare Tikva tries to give students a feeling of what  being Jewish is all about.  </P> <P> "There's a proverb that says, 'Educate each child according to his ability,'  and that's what we try to do here," Schnall said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Repetition Strategy  </P> <P> The main strategy of Shaare Tikva is repetition. Each year, the students sing  the same songs, draw the same pictures and participate in the same rituals.  </P> <P> "That's the reinforcement these kids need," Sirota said. "These kids aren't  that good at retaining information. Occasionally, we'll bring in a new  thought."  </P> <P> The lessons are reinforced at home. The Jerugims light the candles on Friday  nights, a ritual that formally welcomes the holiest day in Judaism, the  Sabbath. The LeCovers go over the songs with Danny.  </P> <P> "We aren't that religious," Deborah LeCover said, "but Danny has made our lives  more spiritual. It has made us more aware and sensitive to others."  </P> <P> Stephen LeCover, deeply moved by Danny's bar mitzvah studying, joined him at  the podium in October. The elder LeCover, 47, had never had his own ceremony,  but he read portions from the Old Testament and addressed the worshipers.  </P> <P> "We have been allowed to dream of unlimited possibilities and opportunities for  Daniel," he told the congregation.  </P> <P> The families in Shaare Tikva say they had some doubts about putting their  children in Hebrew school.  </P> <P> "Because there is such a high emphasis in the Jewish community on education and  achievement, parents might feel uncomfortable because their child won't achieve  in ways others will," Albert said. "There is a lot of pressure for academic  excellence in the Jewish community."  </P> <P> But the families overcame the doubts and became friends. Every Sunday, while  their children learn about the past, the parents meet for coffee; they share  stories and strategies and hope.  </P> <P> They build strong friendships with the teachers, too.  </P> <P> "They do such a great job," said Deborah LeCover. "They know how frustrating  and yet fulfilling it is to work with these kids."  </P> <P> Maeva Carter, 30, of Reseda, who has taught in Shaare Tikva for six years, said  she never knows what to expect.  </P> <P> "Every week, every minute is a roller coaster," Carter said. "One technique  won't be working and the child won't respond and then, all of a sudden, he will  remember something from a week earlier."  </P> <P> The teachers strive for small miracles, like the mention of a familiar phrase,  or even a smile. When a student surprises them by remembering something taught  weeks earlier, the instructors rejoice. It is then that they realize the odds  they must overcome.  </P> <P> "They've done something wonderful," Carter said, "and then you compare it to a  5-year-old, and it's nothing. A giant step for them is like a little one for  younger kids."  </P> <P> But there are giant steps. Like the time Jonathan Garden opened up. Two years  ago, when he joined Shaare Tikva, Jonathan would not talk in class. He spoke at  home, but in new, potentially uncomfortable situations, like Hebrew school, he  kept quiet. He sat and stared for months, seemingly oblivious to his  surroundings. One day, when the teachers asked the students what gifts they  received for Hanukkah, there was a whisper from the back of the room.  </P> <P> It was Jonathan.  </P> <P> "He said 'white bike,' " Carter recalled. "We had to have him repeat it five  times. We didn't know whether he could speak. Since then, he has started  conversations."  </P> <P> Once students are ready to prepare for the bar or bat mitzvah ceremony, Schnall  makes it clear that the synagogue won't treat them any differently than  teen-agers without learning disabilities.  </P> <P> "We meet with them and go over the whole day, like we do with everyone else,"  Schnall said. "The ceremony is not some kind of freak show. We don't do shows."  </P> <P> During October's bar mitzvah, the LeCovers were worried about anything that  might demean Danny and point out his disability. Because of his physical  limitations, Danny would not be able to carry a complete Torah. So instead of  having him carry a scaled-down Torah without all of the Old Testament, they  found a lighter one that still had the entire Scripture.  </P> <P> The LeCovers say the ceremony was more than an attempt to give Danny a valuable  Jewish experience.  </P> <P> "It was a way we could connect with the Jewish community," Deborah LeCover  said. "It's a validation of everything we've gone through."  </P> <P> She showed pictures of Danny and her dancing at the Saturday night reception  after the bar mitzvah. Danny was dressed in a tuxedo.  </P> <P> "You asked if it was all worth it, going through the whole program. It's worth  it," she said. "Look at him. Look how happy he is."  </P> <P> This Saturday, the Greenspans of Northridge will experience the same pride.  Their son, David, 13, will celebrate his bar mitzvah at Valley Beth Shalom.  </P> <P> David was born without an ear, sees from only one eye and speaks slowly. But  his parents couldn't be more excited about Saturday's special event.  </P> <P> "He's doing so much," said Deanna Greenspan, 34, his mother. "I never thought  he could do it."  </P> <P> At first the Greenspans set low expectations. They would be satisfied if David  could understand some of the Jewish traditions and make some new friends.  </P> <P> "We figured he had a hard enough time with English, let alone Hebrew," his  mother said.  </P> <P> But last summer, David started learning the Old Testament portions he will read  to the congregation. Each Sunday after class, he meets with a tutor to go over  the readings and prepare his personal address. A few weeks ago, he was almost  finished with the speech. As his mother watched, David practiced.  </P> <P> The voice was raspy, the sentences sometimes hard to comprehend. The word  "eligible" had to be omitted because David couldn't properly pronounce it. But  he was smiling. So was his mother.  </P> <P> "David will join with all the people around the world who have had their bar  mitzvahs," Deanna Greenspan said. "Who would have believed it?"  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "CNES Already Preparing the </F> Ariane 5 of 2001"]    [Text] The "Ariane 5/Evolution," an enhanced version  of the new European rocket, will be capable of launching two  geostationary satellites weighing 7.3 tons in all (in lieu of  six tons). The development and building of this "Super AR5" is  expected to take six years beginning in 1995.    The "Evolution of Ariane 5," as it is being envisioned  today,  was unveiled by the ESA [European Space Agency] and the CNES  [National Center for Space Studies] at the Space Transport Forum  that was held in Nancy at the end of November by the AAAF  [Aerospace Association of France]. The heads of this program are  already concerning themselves with the future of the new  European Ariane 5 rocket even though its initial version, the  AR5, is still under development and is not expected to fly until  October 1995. It is already evident, however, that to maintain  Ariane 5's commercial competitiveness, as competition grows more  severe toward the end of the decade, and with satellites growing  ever larger, Arianespace will rapidly have need of an enhanced  version of the AR5.    The "Evolution of Ariane 5" program is intended to prolong  Ariane 5's competitiveness by retaining its dual satellite  launching capability, with satellites expected to weigh between  3.3 and 3.8 metric tons according to the CNES. An American study  published last April also concluded that by the end of the  decade, "80% of the payloads will weigh less than 8,000  lbs"  (3630 kg).  <H5>  7.3 Tons in Transfer Orbit </H5>   Under these conditions, the goal of the Evolution of AR5  program will be to launch two satellites weighing a total of 7.3  metric tons between them into geosynchronous transfer orbit  [GTO]. This represents an increase of slightly more than 1.3  tons (+22%) over the capacity of the AR5 currently under  development, which is designed to place approximately six tons,  or exactly 5970 kg, in 600-36,000km/7 orbit. The AR5's  performance objective in the case of a single-satellite  launching into the same orbit is to be 6830 kg, and that of the  AR5/Mk2 approximately 8.2 tons, or double the capacity of Ariane  4 today (4.3 tons).    This sizable gain in performance must be achieved, however,  without loss of Ariane 5's qualities. That is, without degrading  the launcher's reliability, but also at the same time reducing  the cost of the rocket, according to Nancy Remy Hergott,  engineering assistant to the CNES's director of launchers.    To accomplish this, it is not a question of simply  increasing  the number of motors or the size of the stages, nor for that  matter one of adding boosters or an upper high-energy  (cryogenic) stage. All these solutions would be too costly and  would augment the developmental risks.    The CNES proposes to proceed on the basis of two major  steps.  The first would be to augment the thrust of the Vulcain  cryogenic motor and the weight of propellants of the AR5's  central stage. This would produce a gain of at least 800 kg of  payload in GTO. The second step would consist of augmenting the  performance of the Aestus upper stage motor, increasing the  weight of storable propellants (N204/MMH) from 9.7 tons to 14  tons. This would result in a gain of around 400 to 500 kg. In  addition, it is expected to be able to squeeze out another 100  kg of gain by replacing the AR5's P230 dry-fuel booster links  with welded joints.    These are the principal AR5 modifications being proposed,  after its initial 25 to 30 flights, in order to arrive at the  AR5 Evolution version, which would then be ready to enter  commercial service in 2001.  <H5>  A Super-Vulcain </H5>   The Aerospatiale H155 cryogenic central stage will be  modified to increase the total weight of propellants from 152  tons to 172 tons (+13%). But overall volume is to remain  constant. This is to be achieved by displacing the intermediate  dividers of the tanks so as to increase the quantity of liquid  oxygen relative to that of liquid hydrogen, and correlatively  modifying the mixture ratio, from 5.3 to 6.2 (+17%).    In the case of the SEP [European Propellant Company] Vulcain  cryogenic motor, this translates into a thrust increase to 1300  kN (+16%), with a loss of specific impulse that will be  compensated for by a modification of the exhaust nozzle. This  modification will actually result in a slight overall gain (two  seconds), increasing the specific impulse to 433 seconds. The  motor weight will be increased (+9.5%) to 1750 kg.    The Vulcain's combustion chamber (its walls are cooled by  ducting) will be modified by DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AG] to  increase its throat diameter, mixture ratio (+17%),  pressure  (+2%), and flow (+16%). The injector remains  unchanged, as  does also the hydrogen turbine pump. On the other hand, the  oxygen turbine pump will be modified by Fiat Avio so as to  include a 2-stage supersonic turbine (with blades machined in  the disk and not flanged), enabling support of the increases in  pressure (+7%), flow (+18%), and above all, power  (+25%) to  4.8 Mw.    The divergence of the nozzle will be enlarged, with section  ratio increased to 60 (+33%). The upper part will retain  the  technology of the Vulcain, with cooling by a bleed-off of the  fuel flow, which, however, will be reduced  (-20%). The medial part is surrounded by the turbine gases  injection ring. These gases also cool the lower skirt (which  consists simply of bent sheet metal). This new nozzle, developed  by SEP, DASA, and Volvo Flygmotor, is expected to begin testing  on the Vulcain by the end of 1994.  <H5>  L14 Upper Stage </H5>   Generally speaking, and intentionally, the enhanced Vulcain  will use well-known and, for the most part, proven technologies.  The development of the Vulcain Mk2 and the modifications of the  central stage could thus be completed in six years, the last  three of them being devoted to tests of the new motor, which is  to have the same reliability as the present Vulcain (0.946).    The other phase of the enhancement is to concern the DASA  upper EPS [storable propellants] stage. Its tank is pressurized  by helium, without turbine pump, and has actually already been  improved, doubling its performance between the original L5 and  the current L9.7 version. Its propellants capacity has been  increased from 5 tons to 9,7 tons, its thrust from 20 to 27.5  kN, its specific impulse from 316 seconds to 324 seconds, and  its duration of operation from 810 to 1266 seconds.    This time, its performance is to be substantially enhanced,  with an increase from L9.7 to L14. The stage will thus undergo a  complete alteration but without modifying its architecture. Its  tanks will be enlarged (by 700 mm) but made of lighter material  (Al-Li in place of Alu 2219). This, says C. Ransom of ERNO  [German Aerospace's Northern Development Consortium], will make  it possible to add 4.3 tons of propellants (+45%) and  raise the  thrust of the Aestus motor to 35 kN (+27%).    The L14 will have exactly the same mechanical, electrical,  and fluid interfaces as the L9.7, which will therefore continue  to be used for other missions in low-earth and sun-synchronous  orbits and for single-satellite launches into geosynchronous  transfer orbit. The L14 will be used for dual launches requiring  the full power of this "Super Ariane 5" beginning in 2001!

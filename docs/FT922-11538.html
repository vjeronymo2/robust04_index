			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Tories pressured on private health THE government should 'strongly affirm' the importance of private medicine in Britain, Mr Roy Forman, chief executive of a leading medical insurer, said yesterday. Mr Forman, of PPP Group (Private Patients Plan), contrasted ministers' defence of the National Health Service with their attitude towards the private sector. He questioned comments by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and other ministers that they wanted to make the NHS so efficient that no-one would need to use the private sector. Mr Forman's comments present a dilemma for Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the new health secretary. Ministers are smarting from Labour allegations that the Tory general election victory would lead to privatisation of the NHS. They want to demonstrate their commitment to state medicine, but some private providers feel that such support denies them fair treatment. PPP announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 18m in the year to December. Income rose 15 per cent to a record Pounds 404m, although PPP's solvency margin (net worth as a percentage of premiums) dropped slightly to 51 per cent. Mr Forman said PPP had in a broadly static market increased its subscribers by 3.7 per cent to 918,000, giving it a 29 per cent market share. PPP, like other UK insurers, has been required by the Policyholders' Protection Board to provide 0.5 per cent of its 1990 insurance income - in PPP's case Pounds 1.6m - after the collapse of London United Investments. Sir Peter Gadsden, PPP chairman, calls in the annual report for a review of the levy system.</p>

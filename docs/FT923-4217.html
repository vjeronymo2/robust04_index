			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank rate pledge restores confidence THE Bundesbank's pledge not to raise German interest rates any further gave a strong boost to the main European government bond markets yesterday. Speaking at the weekend meeting of European Community finance ministers in Bath, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said the German central bank would not increase its interest rates 'in present circumstances'. His statement was greeted with relief by the European bond markets and the German and French markets rallied strongly when trading opened. 'The markets feel more comfortable now, and we've seen some outright buying of European government bonds,' reported one dealer. German 10-year bonds continued Friday's strong advance, with the yield on the 8 per cent bund due 2002 falling to 7.76 per cent, the lowest level seen so far this year, before closing at 7.78 per cent. The Liffe bund futures contract climbed to a high of 89.63 but prices drifted back later in the day and the futures contract ended at 89.24. Dealers said the bund market appeared to have absorbed last week's tender of DM2.31bn of the Unity 8 per cent 2002 bund. News of further issuance - the Treuhand's forthcoming DM8bn to DM10bn bond issue - had little impact on the bund market. The government agency, which is charged with privatising former East German businesses, will issue 10-year bonds, with the first tranche due to be placed next Tuesday via the traditional federal bond consortium. Elsewhere in Europe, the French government bond market rallied on bullish sentiment over German monetary policy and on the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. On the Matif futures exchange, the September bond futures contract climbed as high as 107.02, before drifting back to close at 106.66, up 0.16 from Friday. Dealers said the French market was also boosted by a couple of favourable opinion polls showing increasing support for European economic and monetary union at the weekend. The latest opinion poll, released yesterday by the French magazine VSD and the Louis Harris polling firm, showed that 59 per cent of French voters who have made up their minds will vote in favour of the treaty in the September 20 referendum, while 41 per cent will vote against. The yield on the 10-year French government bond, the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002, ended at 8.76 per cent, against its opening level of 8.77 per cent. Long-dated UK government bonds continued to out-perform shorter-dated issues yesterday following last Thursday's announcement that the government will borrow the equivalent of Ecu10bn to support sterling and finance government spending. Long-dated gilts remain the chief beneficiaries of the government's decision as more than half of the government's funding in the gilt-edged market this year has been in long-dated issues: the borrowing plan is therefore seen as removing funding pressure at the long end of the market. The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from 103 1/2 to trade at 103 5/8 by late afternoon, yielding 9.18 per cent. Japanese government bonds rallied strongly, with the futures contract climbing to a new high on hopes of a cut in Japan's official discount rate and the covering of short positions. Dealers said market expectations of a cut in Japanese interest rates increased after Friday's easing by the US Federal Reserve. The Fed relaxed monetary policy by signalling a quarter point cut to 3 per cent in the Fed funds rate, prompting a rally in the US Treasury bond market which fed through to the Japanese market yesterday. The key futures contract traded in a range of 106.10-106.20 for much of the day and then rallied sharply to reach a new high of 106.70 before closing at 106.65. The contract ended at 105.55 on Friday. Some dealers suggested the Bank of Japan may decide to cut interest rates soon. The government recently announced a Y10,700bn fiscal spending package, but dealers point out that this week's Tankan report - the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment - is expected to show that the Japanese economy is still in a weak state. The yield on the benchmark No 145 moved from 4.855 per cent at the opening to close at 4.79 per cent. Short-term interest rates slipped, with the rate on three-month certificates of deposit dropping to 3.80 per cent from 3.85 per cent on Friday. The US markets were closed yesterday for the Labor Day holiday.</p>

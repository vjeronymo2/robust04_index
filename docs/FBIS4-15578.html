			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Georgiy Bovt, Stanislav Tarasov in the "Russia in </F> the Karabakh Settlement" column: "Azerbaijan May Leave the CIS"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] As a source in Geydar  Aliyev's entourage told KOMMERSANT-DAILY yesterday, it is not  ruled out that at the upcoming meeting of CIS leaders the  republic's delegation will announce its withdrawal from the  Commonwealth. The cause for this may be disagreements on issues  which Moscow deems key to a settlement in Karabakh and in the  region as a whole: about the deployment of Russian troops on  the line disengaging the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis and on  the closure of CIS external borders (notably between Azerbaijan  and Iran). Yet today even the remnants of the semi-demolished  Azeri opposition are at one with Aliyev's slogan, "No Russian  troops in the republic!" Especially after the noisy hearings on  "investigation into the intrusion of Soviet troops in Baku" in  January 1990. Baku is even more negative on the plans to create  Russian military bases abroad.    Meanwhile, speaking a recent conference of border troop  commanders in the city of Odintsovo, Andrey Nikolayev,  commander-in-chief of the Russian Border Guard Troops, expressed  special concern over the situation at the Azerbaijan section of  the CIS borders. In Moscow's opinion, Baku does not observe the  provisions of the Commonwealth Declaration on Border Protection,  while the republic has long turned into a "sieve" through which  not only foreign spies but also drugs and arms are getting into  Russia. At the present moment Baku is considering a draft  bilateral agreement on border protection presented by Russia (it  is to expand into a multilateral agreement, with the  participation of Armenia and Georgia). In all likelihood, the  draft, which provides for the presence of Russian troops in  Azerbaijan, will be met with a decisive "sovereign `no,'" timed  to coincide with the CIS summit.    Baku may be just blackmailing Moscow on the chance that it  will take fright and let up the pressure. Yet another option is  also possible: Aliyev, faced with the threat of introduction of  Russian troops, will have nothing more to lose. Moreover, his  advanced age and deteriorating health (KOMMERSANT-DAILY has  learned that for this reason he cannot come to the summit but  instead will send along parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev, who is  tipped in Baku as successor to the president), can move Aliyev  to consider that it is time to start thinking of how to go down  in history as a dedicated fighter for Azerbaijan's sovereignty.</p>

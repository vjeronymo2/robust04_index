It was responding to a report in the Financial Times that it had spent Pounds 55.5m on fitting out its new office and Pounds 18m on its previous office, of which Pounds 40m had been provided by the British government. The EBRD said: 'The bank needed a headquarters building that was suitable to its needs as an international public institution with 23 resident directorships representing 56 members.' From April 1991 until the end of last year, the EBRD disbursed Pounds 101m in loans compared with Pounds 201.5m spent on furnishing and equipping its offices, paying staff, travel and administrative overheads. The bank said that by the end of March disbursements had increased by Pounds 56m. It had also 'committed' more than Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.25bn) to projects. It added: 'The bank is proud of its record in central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union which it has achieved in difficult circumstances.' The Treasury yesterday said that the control of expenditure at the EBRD was 'a matter for the bank itself and its board of directors'.

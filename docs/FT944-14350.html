			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Cambodian minister to quit Prince Norodom Sirivudh, Cambodian foreign minister, said yesterday he was resigning after the dismissal last week of his friend and ally, finance minister Sam Rainsy. Prince Sirivudh had threatened to step down if Mr Rainsy was removed from office. Officially, Mr Rainsy departed in the interests of unity between the fractious partners in Cambodia's coalition government. In reality, he had made too many enemies in his battle against corruption, and had become too popular, too independent and too powerful. Mr Rainsy had endeared himself to the international financial community through his skills in economic management.</p>

In the words of  Yevgeniy Belyayev, the committee chairman, just in 9 months of  this year the incidence of measles in Russia increased by 4.2  times, that of whooping cough increased by 29 percent, and that  of epidemiological parotitis grew by 31 percent in comparison  with the same period of last year.    In 1993, 10 outbreaks of dysentery, typhoid fever, hepatitis  and salmonellosis were noted in the country, as a result of  which around 7,000 persons became sick. Diphtheria is assuming  epidemic proportions: The number of patients with this infection  has reached 5,000, and around 300 patients have died, to include  50 children.    In Yevgeniy Belyayev's opinion this situation is the result  of the unfavorable state of the environment, a decrease in the  immune status of Russian, the failure to immunize many children  and adults, and the shortage of vitamins and of therapeutic and  preventive drugs. According to information from the ``Kedr''  constructive ecology movement, which is cooperating actively  with the country's epidemiological services, around 60,000  Russian citizens are living today in places where the maximum  permissible concentrations of toxic substances are perpetually  exceeded. Levels of atmospheric contamination exceeding the  maximum permissible concentrations by 10 times are periodically  recorded in over 80 of the country's cities and industrial  centers. Each year around 28 cubic kilometers of contaminated  liquid wastes are dumped into Russia's water basins, including  8.4 cubic kilometers untreated. Highly toxic organic compounds,  salts of heavy metals, phenols and petroleum products are  detected in water sources.    In the words of Anatoliy Panfilov, chairman of the ``Kedr''  movement, the threat to the health of the population, primarily  children, motivated its members to start a drive to purchase  from other countries a large quantity of medical preparations  that raise immunity, and equipment with which to make them in  Russia. After the needed pharmaceuticals are acquired,  specialists of the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological  Oversight will deliver them with the help of active members of  the ``Kedr'' movement to citizens needing them most in the  threatened regions.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE GRASS IS GREENER -- AT THE GOLF CLUB  </P> <P> The excellent article by James Gomez (June 4) covering the San Clemente water  shortage raises again an ogre that many of us have been unable to effectively  combat.  </P> <P> Residents of San Clemente who don't play golf -- maybe 35,000 of them, or 90%  of the population -- are probably wondering about the shortage and what role  they are expected to play to decrease water use in the coming months.  </P> <P> And they may notice that some inequities exist in the needs for water in the  community, such as the 19.5 million gallons a month of pure drinking water  being used by the new Pacific Golf Club to keep its grass green. 650,000  gallons a day? And this is only one of three golf courses.  </P> <P> But resident aliens without golf bags have no place to register and their words  seem to fall on empty ears, since they don't even own a putter.  </P> <P> If, in fact, somewhere between 35 million and 40 million gallons of drinking  water are being poured onto those three courses each month, all of us must take  shorter showers, forget about watering the lawn, don't flush the toilet and, at  the risk of possible arrest, don't ever wash your car.  </P> <P> But, if some of that golf irrigation eventually comes from recycled and  undrinkable water, it's no problem, unless you wonder where all that money for  recycling is coming from.  </P> <P> Most local citizens will bend and adjust to the constrictions of the water  shortage, and their consumption in May had already decreased. Developers are  anxious, however, to add more trauma to our problems, and they have an enormous  economic clout with the local government.  </P> <P> The average water users may consume 150 to 400 gallons a day. We can apparently  all live with this rate of consumption unless, of course, new homes keep  opening up.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, that one golf course is using as much as 2,166 homes in town (that)  may consume 300 gallons a day. Why has the city condoned this vestige of  special interest and placed a sacrosanct immunity around those 5% who wield the  clubs? Is the revenue to the city all that important?  </P> <P> Those thousands who have sacrificed in the past few months to restrict their  water consumption should expect some reasonable balance between golf,  developers and their own needs.  </P> <P> Yet, maybe my unwashed car is really not as important as making the very tough  4-par on that hole with the fairways of gorgeous green grass. That little  white-dimpled ball wields a clout much greater than those thousands of  residents with brown lawns.  </P> <P> FRED GRUMM  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

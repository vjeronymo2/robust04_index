			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Top benefits for the top people - Planning Your Pension, Executive pension plans / Occupational schemes for senior directors EXECUTIVE pension plans (EPPs) are occupational schemes designed for individuals or small groups of senior executives and directors. As such they offer all the usual benefits of company pensions and can be particularly attractive tax planning vehicles. EPPs were introduced by the Finance Act 1970 and proved particularly popular during that decade. Today EPPs face tough competition from personal pensions, which are simpler to operate although not so flexible for tax purposes. Anyone considering an EPP should be aware of the complex tax regulations that govern these plans and be sure to get independent expert advice. The over-enthusiastic use of EPPs' tax efficiency by high earners in small companies has attracted the attention of the Inland Revenue on more than one occasion. The latest Revenue crackdown will restrict the way these plans can be used to accept extremely high contributions in years of profit to reduce the corporation tax bill. EPPs come from the same stable as small self administered schemes (SSASs), also used by small businesses, especially family concerns. However, executive pension plan contributions are invested entirely in insurance company funds, whereas SSASs generally use external fund managers. There is also a 'hybrid' SSAS which permits free investment choice once a minimum contribution has been paid into the insurance fund. The tax benefits of an EPP include. Full corporation tax relief on the employer's contribution. (Since these are occupational schemes there must be an employer's contribution.) Full income tax relief on the employee's contribution. The pension fund grows free of tax. Death in service benefits, of up to four times salary, can be paid to the member's beneficiaries. Where the plan is written in trust this benefit falls outside the scope of Inheritance Tax (IHT). Some older plans were not written in trust. If you have one of these you should ask your provider to put this right to avoid a potential future IHT bill. Part - and in certain circumstances all - of the fund can be taken as tax free cash. This is because the tax-free cash is calculated as a proportion of the final salary and not as a proportion of the fund accumulated at retirement. Spouse and dependants' benefits are automatically provided. The pension, which can be taken between age 60 and 70, is taxed as income. Although the pension is linked to final salary, contributions under an EPP are invested on a money purchase basis and grow in an investment fund earmarked for the individual employee. Under most money purchase plans the employee and employer contributions are limited to a certain percentage of annual salary. However, under an EPP, while the employee is restricted to a contribution of 15 per cent of salary, there is virtually no restriction on employer contributions. This is because the level of contribution is based on the projected final salary and the Revenue permits employers to vary contributions according to annual profit. For this reason it is still possible to justify employer contributions of over 100 per cent of salary for a member in his or her early 20s. In the past directors have taken advantage of this anomaly and channelled huge chunks of company profits into their plans to avoid higher rates of corporation tax. This was particularly popular in the 1970s when corporation tax for small businesses was 42 per cent, compared with the current rate of 25 per cent. Moreover, due to a loophole in the Social Security Act 1973 young employees could leave service and take the whole of their pension benefits with them even though it was effectively overfunded in relation to the period of service. Earlier this year, the Revenue announced measures to restrict these excessive contributions. The new rules, to be announced over the next few weeks and expected to take effect from the end of 1992, are likely to cut maximum contributions to about 25 per cent of salary in the early years. The maximum pension of two-thirds final salary for new members joining on or after March 17 1987 can be calculated on one of two bases: Salary in any one of the five years preceding retirement; or The average salary over three or more consecutive years ending not earlier than ten years before retirement. (Only this definition can be used for controlling directors and those earning over Pounds 100,000 per annum). EPPs can be used to contract out of the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps) but providers usually recommend that an appropriate personal pension is used for this purpose, leaving the EPP to provide benefits on top of the state pension. A maximum two-thirds final salary pension can be achieved after 20 years service, although those who joined before March 17 1987 can secure this after just ten years. A further set of rules applies to plans established between March 1987 and March 1989, which restrict maximum salary for pension purposes to Pounds 100,000 with a maximum tax free cash limit of Pounds 150,000. To complicate things even further, some employees will be caught by the 'earnings cap', which was introduced in the 1989 Budget to reduce the contributions and pensions of high earners. The cap imposes a maximum salary of Pounds 75,000 for the current tax year that can be taken into account for pension purposes. This limits maximum employee contributions to Pounds 11,250 and the maximum pension to Pounds 50,000. The cap affects employees who joined a new occupational scheme set up after March 14 1989 and new members who joined an existing scheme after June 1 1989. Many providers offer a loan facility for EPP clients, although if you want to use the pension fund for business finance it is worth considering a SSAS. Under an SSAS it is possible to arrange a loanback of up to 25 per cent of the pension fund in the first two years, after which a 50 per cent limit applies. The most popular use of a loanback is the purchase of business property. Since the majority of EPPs are run by insurance companies the investment choice is similar to that of personal pensions and free standing additional voluntary contributions (FSAVCs) discussed earlier in this series. The main choices are deposit, with-profits, unitised with profits and unit linked. Deposit-based contracts are run like a building society account with the added bonus of tax relief on contributions and the fund. This option is suitable for the few years before retirement. With-profits contracts guarantee to pay a sum at maturity. Annual bonuses are added to the sum assured; once allocated they cannot be taken away. On top of this there is a final bonus which is discretionary and depends on the fund's performance. The with profits fund invests in a mixture of equities, bonds and property and aims to smooth bonus payments over the term. Unitised with-profits contracts operate an investment structure similar to the with-profits plan but on a unitised basis so that switching between funds is easier. Finally, under unit-linked contract the value of the units reflects directly the investment P6performance of the underlying fund and as such can be more volatile and therefore more suitable for the early years of a contract. According to the FT's handbook Executive and Directors' Pensions 1993*, published last week, there are more than 100 EPPs from which to choose. The book offers some useful tips on picking a plan. In particular, it warns that if you retire earlier than the date selected at the outset you may face a hefty penalty. However, if you select an early retirement date, check what proportion of your contributions is lost in management charges, since some providers deduct proportionately more on shorter term contracts. *Available from FT Marketing Department, 071-799-2002.

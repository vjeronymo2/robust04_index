			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Halt to Arms Buildup Urged" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The United States and  the South Korean rulers must clearly see the strong spirit and  iron will of the Korean people, who never pardon those who  infringe upon the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of  the country, promptly stop aggressive arms buildup including the  deployment of Patriot missiles and discontinue the reckless war  provocation moves at once, urged the Korean anti-nuke peace  committee in a statement released today.    Branding the deployment of Patriot by the U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppets as a total breach of the DPRK-U.S.  joint statement and the North-South joint declaration on  denuclearization and an undisguised military provocation aimed  at unleashing another war, a thermonuclear war in Korea at any  cost, the statement says:    The introduction of the Patriot rejected in other regions is  an inevitable product of the despicable flunkeyist and  treacherous policy pursued by the Kim Yong-sam group, which has  turned South Korea into an exhibition ground for new and old  U.S. weapons and into an arms market.    The Kim Yong-sam group unilaterally broke up the working  contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and  the South which had been arranged with so much efforts and,  later, openly incited a war fever, spreading a rumor about "the  North's scheme to provoke a war against the South," and made  public even a war plan against the North dubbed "New Operation  Plan No. 5027" which had been kept in secrecy. All this was  motivated by its despicable purpose of finding a pretext for a  massive shipment of U.S.-made destruction weapons into South  Korea and legalizing it, thus furthering the interests of the  United States, its master.    It has become clear to everybody that with such a traitor as  Kim Yong-sam left in power in South Korea, the interests of the  nation cannot be defended and our fellow countrymen cannot avoid  a nuclear disaster.    The South Korean students and people must invigorate the  anti-America, anti-war, anti-nuke and anti-"government" struggle  to oust the Kim Yong-sam group from power and establish an  independent and democratic government and to check the  introduction of the Patriot into South Korea.    If the United States and the South Korean puppets finally  started a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, ignoring the  aspiration of the times and the demand of the nation and  steadily reinforcing the aggression forces, the provokers would  never get off scotfree.</p>

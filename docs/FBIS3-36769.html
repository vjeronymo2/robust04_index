Government experts do not rule out the limitation of Russian  oil exports for attaining this goal. They believe that "concern  about falling prices in oil, Russia's main export item, has put  us on a par with the OPEC countries."    The official said that according to Russia's sources, the  OPEC countries are ready to brush away old disagreements and  take coordinated measures to raise prices by $1 or $2 a barrel  in the near future.    Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Minister for  Fuel and Energy Yuri Shafranik told the recent economic forum in  Davos that Russia and OPEC would pursue a coordinated policy to  increase oil prices by at least $1 a barrel.    The government sources point out that Russia may ensure a  rise in oil prices by limiting its exports of crude oil.  Experts of the Economics Ministry believe that in order to  attain the set goal, Russia will have to cut down oil exports by  at least 8% in the first quarter of the year on the condition  that the OPEC states do the same. In their opinion, Russia is  most likely to reduce oil exports to the former Soviet republics.    In 1993, Russia exported more than 80 million tons of oil to  foreign countries. The coordinated oil export quotas for  enterprises and territories for the first quarter of the year  amount to 24 million tons. During the first three months of  1994, Russia will export a total of about 30.2 million tons of  oil.</p>

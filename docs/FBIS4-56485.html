			<p>BFN     [Text] Upon learning through CLARIN of [U.S. Trade  Representative] Mickey Kantor's latest remarks, Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo sought a favorable aspect from the threat.  Cavallo said: "U.S. Ambassador James Cheek told President Menem  that President Clinton has decided not to include Argentina for  the next 60 days on the list of countries that are likely be  punished. Kantor informed me over the telephone of this  decision."    Cavallo noted: "The news is not that we will be punished;  the  news is that any possible punishments will not begin on 30  April, the move has been moved back by at least 60 days. This  represents a positive, not a negative gesture towards Argentina."    Concerning the harsh description of "greatest trade  pirates,"  the minister noted: "Countries that do not protect intellectual  property are involved in a type of piracy. We must not be  offended by these words."</p>

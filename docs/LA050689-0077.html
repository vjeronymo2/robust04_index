			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLD MINING AND WILDLIFE  </P> <P> What fool would pose such a question: "Should we allow a foreign interest to  extract gold from the American soil of a proposed national park and leave us a  seething, cyanide-laced toxic pit?" At best, the popularity of such a proposal  is laughable. Unfortunately, the humor is lost both on the Bureau of Land  Management as well as to our archaic and permissive General Mining Law of 1872.  </P> <P> The responses which predictably range from shock to incredulous disbelief tell  us that Californians are not humored. The BLM hearing, which should have asked  the question "whether," merely asked "how." But despite this breakdown of the  representative process, thanks to the efforts of Levine and the environmental  consciousness basic to almost all Americans, both the bureau and the Viceroy  Resources Corp. will receive their unsolicited reply.  </P> <P> PATRAIC KELLY  </P> <P> Vice President  </P> <P> Citizens for Mojave National Park Inc.  </P> <P> Barstow  </P></p>

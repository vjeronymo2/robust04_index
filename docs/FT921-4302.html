			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Three ports sold to staff for Pounds 78m Tilbury, Medway and Clyde  - are to be sold to their managers and employees for a total of Pounds 77.7m, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, announced in the Commons yesterday. But Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, warned that an incoming Labour government might overthrow the decision to privatise these and other ports formerly run by self-governing trusts. Mr Prescott told MPs: 'We reserve the right, where possible, to review these privatisation deals to ensure that the national interest and employees' interests have been properly taken into account.' The privatisation of the three ports follows the controversial sale of Tees &amp; Hartlepool - the first trust port to be privatised  - to a consortium called Teesside Holdings for a price of Pounds 180m. That sale provoked uproar because the port went neither to its managers and employees, who had expected preference in the sale, nor to the highest bidder - Maritime Transport Services, operator of the Thamesport container terminal in Kent. Yesterday Mr Rifkind emphasised that the management/employee buy-out teams had been the highest bidders for all three ports now being sold. The buy-out team at Tilbury is acquiring Britain's biggest cargo port for Pounds 32m. It fought off one other bid, believed to have been Pounds 500,000 less, from Maritime Transport Services, which had earlier dropped out of the bidding but had been encouraged to re-enter by the Department of Transport. The price is not directly comparable with the Pounds 180m paid for Tees &amp; Hartlepool because Tilbury is believed to have made pre-tax profits of only Pounds 2.2m in 1991 and all the proceeds are going to the previous owners, the Port of London Authority. In Tees &amp; Hartlepool's case, the sale proceeds were split between the port and the government, so half the proceeds reverted to the buyer. In addition, Tees &amp; Hartlepool had cash assets of Pounds 35m and made profits of Pounds 9m last year. Medway made profits of Pounds 3.87m last year. The buy-out team, which bid Pounds 29.7m, faced no competition after Maritime Transport Services dropped out of the bidding. Clyde, which made losses of Pounds 790,000 last year, is going to its managers and employees for Pounds 26m following the defeat of a competing bid from Regis &amp; Regis, a local property company.</p>

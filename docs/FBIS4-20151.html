			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean-Francois Couvrat: "An Extremely Austere </F> Budget With One Target: Unemployment"]    [Excerpt] Reducing unemployment is Edouard Balladur's sole  objective for next year. He will devote to it all the available  state financial resources, in other words, savings made  elsewhere. Hence the extreme budgetary austerity imposed on his  ministers in the guidelines he sent to them yesterday. They are  to reduce their administrative spending by 8 percent with the  franc at its present value, and any operational spending which  does not involve legislative, regulatory, or contractual  commitments by the state by 15 percent. Ministers will have to  justify their equipment spending project by project. Finally,  they will have to implement a redeployment of civil service  staff: The guideline letter does not mention cuts in staffing  levels but, setting the expected productivity increases by civil  servants at 1.5 percent, it aims to form a kind of "reserve"  force facilitating redeployment.    On these bases, the budget negotiations promise to be very  tight, in keeping with the aims defined in these initial  guidelines. There is no doubt that services adopted by vote  will be called into question, that the granting of all kinds of  state subsidies and benefits will be tightened up, or even that  some services regarded as unnecessary may find their future at  stake in the coming weeks. These are all initiatives suggested  in letters sent by Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy to most of  his colleagues at the same time as the prime minister's letter.    The Budget Ministry stresses that this is the only way to  achieve the government's objective, i.e., a reduction in  unemployment, within the narrow framework laid down by the  five-year law on public finances and the Franco-German  convergence plan. And this is to be achieved in an economic  situation which is still fragile: Those who are drawing up the  budget are at present counting on a growth rate of 2.4 percent  in 1995, in other words rather less than the official forecast  (2.7 percent) and than the rate hoped for by Edmond Alphandery  (3 percent).

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Mandela musters 50,000 in peaceful protest AFRICAN nationalism peacefully confronted Afrikanerdom yesterday as Mr Nelson Mandela led more than 50,000 supporters through the heart of Pretoria to the seat of white government. A line of heavily armed police stood between the Union Buildings housing the offices of President F. W. de Klerk and the African National Congress president, who repeated his demand for an early transition to majority rule. Hailing the 48-hour general strike that ended on Tuesday night as 'unquestionably one of the great events in our history', Mr Mandela went on: 'The campaign for peace and democracy must become a tidal wave which will thrust our country into a future where justice prevails, peace is assured and democracy becomes a way of life.' The good-humoured crowd, gathered on the slopes below Union Buildings, responded enthusiastically. 'Forward to an interim government of national unity,' urged Mr Mandela, a slogan which the crowd clearly found something of a mouthful, though dutifully shouting the refrain 'Forward.' It was a day, however, on which the occasion, rich in symbolism, was more important than the speech itself. The massive turnout will have reinforced the ANC's status as the country's most popular party and demonstrated its capacity to marshal its followers. No incidents of violence were reported. The party itself is in no doubt about its prospects. 'Today we are at the door of Union Buildings,' announced Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general. 'Next time, F. W. de Klerk, we are going to be inside your office.' The police - black, white, and coloured (mixed race) - listened impassively. On the slopes below Mr Mandela, the packed crowd engulfed the statue of Louis Botha, Boer war general and first prime minister of the Union of South Africa. Sitting astride his horse, the man revered in Afrikaner history suffered the indignity of being draped in the banners of the Kwathema branch of the ANC and the South African Communist party. On a garden terrace above Mr Mandela, another mounted Boer war hero, JBM Herzog, founder of the party that Mr de Klerk leads and prime minister from 1924 to 1939, gave shelter to bearers of more ANC banners. Unfurled above Mr Mandela was the black, green and gold ANC flag; fluttering behind it the orange, white and blue of the South African counterpart. His amplified voice reverberating in the natural amphitheatre, and certainly audible to the occupants of the horseshoe-shaped, pillared building a hundred yards behind him, Mr Mandela called on the government to take 'practical steps' to curb political violence, agree to form an interim government and demonstrate a 'commitment to a sovereign, democratically elected constituent assembly'. If the demands were not met, negotiations could not be resumed, he warned. Most observers, however, believe that sufficient progress has been made since talks were broken off last June to allow an early resumption. Mr Mandela's speech broke little, if any, new ground, barely touching on the party's strategy should talks remain deadlocked. Instead he left the issue hanging, saying: 'What happens next, and what form the campaign for peace and democracy takes, depends on how the government responds to our demands.' The third day of a week of action that is intended to force an early transition to majority rule was marked by marches and demonstrations in other important centres. The heart of Durban, Natal, was brought to a standstill as thousands of protestors gathered in and around the main post office, a government building and a leading department store. In Cape Town, an estimated 50,000-strong crowd blocked the city's streets, lit a freedom flame and protested against 'taxation without representation'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation remains tense on the border between  Georgia and Abkhazia. Last night, an electric power line was  blown up in the Gali Rayon of Abkhazia. As a result, half of  the republic's territory was left without electricity. The  authorities in Sukhumi believe that Georgian saboteurs are to  blame.    Moreover, the Georgian Army has still not received the  command to withdraw its troops from the line of contact with the  Abkhazian formations. I will remind you that a security zone is  to be set up here, which is provided for in the agreement signed  in Moscow between Tbilisi and Sukhumi.</p>

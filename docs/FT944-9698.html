			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / W German profits optimism Profits in west German industry could jump 150 per cent in 1994 as a result of economic recovery and higher productivity, according to the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute. The institute said total profits could surge to around DM50bn (Pounds 20.4bn) in 1994 after falling an estimated 11.9 per cent to around DM20bn in 1993. Ifo said its figures were fairly speculative but were based on established relationships between economic growth and production factors such as labour costs and employment levels. If the forecasts are correct, 1994 profits would show a return to profit levels last seen in 1989 and 1990. Ifo forecast a real improvement of 5.4 per cent in labour productivity in 1994, the highest increase since 1979 and compared with a 2.2 per cent rise in 1993. Unit labour costs were likely to fall 1.2 per cent in 1994 after rising 3.6 per cent in 1993 and net production in industry was forecast to rise 3.5 per cent after falling 7.7 per cent last year.</p>

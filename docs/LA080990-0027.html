			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE DROUGHT;  </P> <P> VENTURA REDUCES JULY WATER USE BY 22.8% IN 3RD MONTH OF LIMITS  </P> <P> The city of Ventura has cut water use by 5 million gallons per day during July  compared to the same month last year, city officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> However, those same statistics show a slight decrease in conservation compared  to last month.  </P> <P> Officials said this happened because the city's water conservation ordinance  allows more usage in some cases during July, August and September.  </P> <P> Compared to last year, Ventura reduced its water use 22.8% in July, the third  month since water conservation became mandatory.  </P> <P> Venturans consumed 1,825 acre-feet of water, down from 2,365 acre-feet in July,  1989, said Carol Green, a spokeswoman for the city's Public Works Department.  </P> <P> One acre-foot of water equals 325,851.43 gallons and typically takes care of  the yearly needs of a family of four.  </P> <P> But Venturans saved less water last month than they did in June, when the city  used 1,621 acre-feet, compared to 2,195 acre-feet in June, 1989 -- a saving of  26.1%.  </P> <P> City officials said they are not concerned with the small increase in water  consumption and are optimistic that Ventura will soon reach its goal of a 30%  reduction.  </P> <P> "This has been the hottest summer in 25 years, so even though we haven't  reached our goal yet, we are moving in the right direction," said Vice Mayor  Donald Villeneuve, chairman of the city's water subcommittee.  </P> <P> Green noted that based on historical use, July, August and September have the  highest use and are the months in which the city allocates additional water to  customers who show a need.  </P> <P> "Therefore people have more water to use during these months," she said.  </P> <P> Officials at the state Drought Center in Sacramento commended Ventura for its  efforts and encouraged its residents to try to do even better.  </P> <P> "Ventura's doing fine, obviously, but the city would do well in bringing the  water conservation program to everybody's attention once again," said George  Deatherage, a Drought Center spokesman.  </P> <P> "It seems like people are losing interest and the city is slipping away from  its goal."  </P> <P> He cited July statistics from other water conservation programs around the  state that might inspire Venturans.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara has a mandatory program aimed at cutting water use by 45%, for  example, and has achieved a 47% reduction.  </P> <P> Sacramento, whose goal is a 20% reduction, cut water use by 26%.  </P> <P> And the Monterey Peninsula Municipal Water District, shooting for at least a  20% reduction, cut consumption by 30%.  </P></p>

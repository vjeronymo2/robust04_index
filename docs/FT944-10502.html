			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mixed message of share option trends Sir, Alistair Ross-Goobey (Book Review: 'Why pay should be linked to success', November 3) writes that there is no place for conventional share options in executive reward. The truth of Mr Ross-Goobey's comment is widely recognised among larger companies and an increasing number of them are abandoning conventional share options in favour of restricted share plans for their most senior executives. Many, however, are retaining share options for second tier management and some are using both share options and restricted share plans for senior executives. There is a mixed message here. If share options are no longer appropriate for senior executives, why are companies retaining them for lower levels of management? For the future, I believe more companies will push down the restricted share concept to lower levels of management. Indeed, pioneering companies are already looking at phantom restricted stock plans and even phantom management buy-outs at the business unit level. (A phantom plan is one where the cash reward is designed to replicate the actual share price.) It is almost a truism to say that the only thing that really motivates is ownership - the challenge is to create a structure which encourages managers to act like owners while not leading to internal divisions within business organisations. At present, there is often too much fog between the efforts employees put in and the rewards that are generated under their equity-based incentive plans. Winning companies will find successful formulae to dispel the fog and to encourage clarity of vision.

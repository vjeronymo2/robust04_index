			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a news conference held on the afternoon of 31  January, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General  Ichiro Ozawa touched on the ruling coalition parties' future  relationship with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and said:  "If the opposition comes up with a better idea, we should revise  our plans without trying to save face. Even the budget drafting  is no exception." In this way, he indicated the ruling  coalition should take a free and unbiased stance in working out  policies. However, regarding the possibility of forming "a  wide-range alliance" with the LDP, Ozawa clearly denied this,  and said: "If such an alliance were formed, there would be only  one political force as before. One advantage of the current  situation lies in the fact that while more than two political  groups are cooperating with one another based on a free and  unbiased stance, if one group fails in promoting its  administration, another can take over."    When asked about how the ruling coalition should cooperate  in  the next election under the new electoral system following  passage of the political reform bill, Ozawa pointed out: 1) The  five major ruling coalition parties are bound to be defeated if  they conduct their election campaigns without cooperation; 2) to  say nothing of the fact that the coalition's ultimate objective  in forming a thorough-going cooperative network lies in  functioning as if they were one party, it should strive to  establish a framework for promoting thorough-going cooperation;  and 3) such cooperation among coalition parties will be tested  for the first time in the election for the House of Councillors  next summer (if no general election is held in the meantime).  Thus, while keeping the next House of Councillors election in  mind, Ozawa indicated his intention to quickly lay the  groundwork for cooperation among the ruling parties.    As for the timing of holding the next general election,  Ozawa  indicated his negative view on early dissolution of the House of  Representatives, saying: "It is not necessarily logical to hold  the general election as soon as possible just because of changes  in the electoral system."    In response to a question as to why Ozawa excluded reporters  of SHUKAN GENDAI (published by Kodansha) from the news  conference, he stated: "I may file a suit against SHUKAN GENDAI.  I have asked my counselor to study the case." Furthermore, he  added: "My secretary will also file a suit against Tokyo Sports,  (a newspaper publishing company), and we will fight it in the  courts."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Feb 22 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus  said today that in an interview published in the German daily  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG on Monday [21 February], he had  only explained the Czech stance toward individual and collective  rights regarding the Sudeten German question, and pointed to a  collective solution being impossible.    Speaking to journalists after a ministerial session, Klaus  said that the Sudeten German question could be solved only on  the individual level. He was reacting to Monday's statement by  Christian Schmidt, foreign political spokesman of the  parliamentary group of Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU),  in which Schmidt criticised Klaus over the interview.    Klaus said that each German had the right to apply for  permanent residence in any country of the world, including the  Czech Republic. "Individual access on the part of the Czech  Republic is nothing new," he stressed.    In the interview for FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG, Klaus  called the Sudeten German problems "individually solvable," but  rejected any "collective settlement" of the question. He said  the Sudeten German problem was an "unfortunate complication" in  Czech-German relations, inherited by the Czech Government from  the past. "Today we cannot settle all the problems we  inherited," Klaus said in the paper.    In his press statement on Monday, headlined "Not Like This,  Mr. Klaus" Schmidt welcomed Klaus's "evident effort at reviving  and pushing forward Czech-German relations, which have been cool  for a while." But at the same time he stressed that, regarding  the sensitive question of post-war German expellees, it was not  possible simply to "offer nice sounding sentences which pop in  the air upon closer inspection." Schmidt said he considered  Klaus's proposal to settle individually Sudeten German problems,  which Germany views as open, a similar "soap bubble."</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Dividing in order to multiply - BSG's latest purchase and its strategic plans BSG International opened a new chapter in its history yesterday when it split its business into two core divisions, opening the way to the break-up of the group. It also made a recommended Pounds 20m offer for Jessups, the vehicle distributor. The splitting of the group into Britax International, which will hold all BSG's manufacturing operations, and Bristol Street Motors, which hold the group's vehicle distribution and servicing businesses, is the upshot of a strategic review which has been taking place since last autumn. The offer for Jessups is an immediate step to strengthen Bristol Street Motors, a move which also springs from the review. 'One follows the other,' says Mr Richard Marton, BSG chief executive. The shares fell 5 1/2 p to 69p. The division of BSG opens up the possibility that either of the halves could be demerged, floated, made the subject of a reverse takeover or sold. But there is not likely to be any immediate decision. 'What we are doing does not put a For Sale sign up over any of our core businesses,' says Mr Marton. A change of course has been in the offing since last summer. Then Mr Tom Cannon, who had been managing director and expected to become non-executive chairman, was eased into retirement. The growth of BSG from a Birmingham car dealer to a significant components manufacturer and vehicle distributor with turnover approaching Pounds 600m is associated with Mr Cannon more than with any other individual. But the growth had been haphazard; it certainly did not follow any tenets of strategic planning laid down in a business school. Car mirrors and lights, sunroofs and seat belts, pushchairs and aircraft lavatories, quite apart from car dealing and leasing - BSG has them all. Mr Marton, as Mr Cannon's successor and one-time subordinate, has been seeking to put order into the diversity, to apply 1990s thinking to the practice of earlier decades. Any thought that this might be a leisurely process was dispelled in the last quarter of 1993, when BSG saw its manufacturing markets sliding away and had to give a profits warning. But the results of the current review come as trading improves. The board is optimistic 'that a satisfactory recovery in the group's performance compared with that in 1993 is under way'. Last year BSG had pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.5m, but suffered a 27 per cent fall in operating profits. 'There are two distinctive operations sitting together, but not very well together,' says Mr Marton. He talks frequently of 'critical mass' and the need to create more of it. BSG is spread widely, but it is spread thinly. It is active in sectors where there has been considerable realignment. In the automotive components sector, consolidation has been taking place - hence the recent takeover of Linread by McKechnie. Britax now 'is not large enough to be a major player', says Mr Marton. It nearly has the necessary mass to be that in mirrors, it has some way to go in lighting and a long way to go in sunroofs. The hope at BSG is that greater independence will stimulate growth. On the vehicle side, Bristol Street Motors, with Jessups, will be 'reasonably near' to achieving this critical mass. By adding 12 selling sites in south-east England to BSG's 24 in the Midlands and the north, BSG thinks that it will be about sixth in the pecking order of the UK's vehicle distributors. But Jessups, which last year had pre-tax losses of Pounds 600,000, is not coming cheaply. BSG's share offer values its ordinary shares at 140p against an overnight price of 98p. BSG is offering 15 new shares for every eight Jessups ordinaries and 110.35p cash for every Jessups preference. There is a cash alternative of 125.625p for the Jessups ordinaries, but that is dependent on the ordinary offer becoming unconditional. So far BSG has received undertakings to accept the offer for 27.5 per cent of the ordinary share capital and 18.1 per cent of the preference. Through Morgan Grenfell, BSG is issuing 18.7m new shares, about 6.7 per cent of its enlarged share capital. To the extent that some of these need to be sold to meet the cash alternative, Morgan Grenfell is underwriting their sale at 67p. The immediate financial effect of the takeover on BSG will be to raise its gearing to more than 45 per cent, compared with 23 per cent at the end of 1993.</p>

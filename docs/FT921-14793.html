			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / BR chief hints at alternative to rail sell-off SIR BOB REID, chairman of British Rail, yesterday appeared to suggest that greater private-sector involvement in the railway could form a substitute for full-scale privatisation in the short term. Speaking at the Chartered Institute of Transport in London, Sir Bob said he could see no objection in principle to the involvement of private-sector capital in the rail business. 'Much of what was part of BR has already been privatised - ferries, hotels, manufacturing - and some Pounds 3bn of private-sector capital is invested in the business of carrying freight by rail,' he said. 'We look for opportunities to contract out services where it is economic to do so. We work in partnership with the private sector in freight and parcels. The Heathrow Express is an ambitious venture with BAA.' Sir Bob said he wanted to see more joint operations with the private sector. Opening access to other train operators was a government policy aim, he said, and the privatisation debate had to bear in mind the implications of that. 'When they (the implications) are followed through, they may prove a very significant element of the new policies. The current public discussion does not seem to address this.' Sir Bob was speaking as Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, reconfirmed the government's intention to produce its railway privatisation white paper before the general election. The white paper has been delayed by ministerial disagreements on what is probably the most complex privatisation yet attempted by the government. Sir Bob appeared to be using his first public appearance this year to suggest a way out of the stalemate. He denied, however, that he was attempting to advocate a solution. 'The board has consistently said that ownership of the industry is a matter for the shareholder (the government),' he said. 'Our job is not to advocate and not to oppose. It is to advise, as railway professionals, on the practicality of any evolving proposals.' Sir Bob said he had never expressed a desire, as some had suggested, to see the railway sold off as a whole.

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Iran set to choose president it knows: Why Rafsanjani is a certain victor in an election today ONE OF the few certainties in Iran is that Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani will continue to be president after elections today. Of the 128 people who applied to oppose him, only three were approved as candidates. Two of them are good friends of his and the other is a former member of parliament who has of late failed to win re-election. Of the three, Mr Ahmad Tavakkoli, a former minister and economics editor of the Resalat newspaper, which represents the interests of bazaar merchants, has appeared the most credible challenger. A former labour minister and government spokesman in the post-revolutionary cabinet of Mr Bani Sadr, now exiled in Paris, he has been a leading critic of the slow pace of reforms aimed at introducing a free-market economy. Even so, Mr Tavakkoli's attacks have been aimed more at members of the fourth parliament elected since the revolution than at Mr Rafsanjani. The second candidate, Mr Abdullah Jasbi, chancellor of the Azad University (Islamic Open University), owes his survival in the post to Mr Rafsanjani. The university is Mr Rafsanjani's brainchild, even if it produces graduates with degrees that few employers accept. Mr Jasbi has appeared understandably reluctant to bite the hand that feeds him. Mr Rajabali Taheri, the failed Majlis candidate, is very much an also-ran. This triumvirate has also bolstered the impression that there were no more substantial challengers to Mr Rafsanjani. A shattered economy, a fragmented domestic opposition and an ineffective exiled alternative, have left the people with one option: the president they know. Yet, only a year ago, President Rafsanjani was the hope of the nation. Merchants saw him as source of new income, industry liked to believe that foreign investment would pour in once the left was eliminated, and the ordinary man (and especially the woman) looked forward to an easing of the draconian social restrictions that ruled their every movement. Instead, the recent partial unification of the exchange rate has increased inflation. During the past two years the market has been flooded with foreign goods, often imported at unrealistic exchange rates, with the result that many foreign products were cheaper in Iran than in the country of origin. The bazaar flourished but inflation remained the biggest cause of discontent. The irony is that the more economic conditions have deteriorated, the less likely it has become that Mr Rafsanjani would be be deposed. The left, which believes in a controlled economy, needed a complete collapse of the system as proof that Mr Rafsanjani's policies were not working. The riots last summer in five cities caused alarm among the clerics, especially in the camp of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the spiritual leader, who blamed the trouble on the pace of reform. Opposition to the president from above has in turn partially paralysed the government and its reforms. One effect will be to force Mr Rafsanjani to compromise on the composition of his next cabinet. Speculation centres on the vice-presidency which is not an elected post. Mr Hassan Habibi, a Rafsanjani protege, is likely to depart and may be replaced by Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign minister. Although Mr Rafsanjani is certain to win today, his longer-term survival must still depend of his ability to turn the economy around. The exercise of the regime's particular form of democracy matters less to the public than economic benefits and greater social freedom.</p>

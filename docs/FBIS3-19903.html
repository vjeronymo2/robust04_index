			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Elizabeth Noelle-Neumann, head of the Allensbach </F> Institute: "The Myth of the Nonvoter: The Germans Do Not Vote  Rationally, But They Do Vote"]    [Text] In 1993 there were no big elections. The prevailing  opinion then was that the biggest of all parties is that of the  nonvoters. The election in Lower Saxony has shaken this  conviction. At 73.8 percent, the voting participation last  Sunday [20 March] was not even 1 point under that of 1990.    The theory of nonvoting had proceeded from a false  assumption. If the Germans are annoyed with politics, they vote  nevertheless, even if for other than the usual party, perhaps an  extremist one. Thirty percent of the eligible voters in western  Germany say that they have already voted out of protest for a  party for which they would not have voted otherwise. Only 14  percent, on the other hand, have ever failed to vote out of  discontent. But the protest vote is the opportunity of the small  parties.    For this reason, the "concentration point" of the German  party system, expressed in the combined share of the second  ballot vote of the two people's parties, could decrease further  in the Bundestag election in the fall. In the 1970's it was over  90 percent. Since 1980 it has been decreasing. In the Allensbach  surveys of 1993 only 73 percent on the average still intended to  vote for the Union [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union--CDU/CSU] or the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany].    Those who turn away from the people's parties do so mostly  to  give their vote to a smaller party. Only a few stay away from an  election out of protest. Nonvoters are, for example, young  people who as yet have little interest in politics and for whom  voting is not yet civic duty and habit. Or they are elderly  women, who after the death of their husbands no longer go to  vote because no one takes them along. Nonvoters mostly have no  interest in politics. They frequently come from the lowest  social strata. For the heroic, protesting "party of nonvoters"  there is very little left.    Why does the voter vote the way he votes? A public opinion  researcher who inquires directly into the reason for a voting  decision could just as well ask: "Why are you Catholic?" or "Why  are you Protestant?" Such questions do not lead to anything, for  hardly anyone would answer: "Because I was born into a Catholic  (or Protestant) family." But in many cases this would be the  right answer. How, then, are the reasons for a voting decision  to be recognized?    "What on the whole was your family's political attitude, how  far positioned to the left, in the center, or the right?" it was  asked in February and March 1994. And: "How would you describe  your own political position?" It became evident that in most  cases the political position of the parents continued with the  children. If, for example, a family is positioned "strongly to  the left," the children in 4 of 10 cases, too, are positioned  strongly to the left. Only 11 percent of the children from such  families acknowledge themselves as belonging to the center. But  in the political center or on the right, too, the generation of  the parents in most cases passes on its views.    Whether people vote regularly, too, is influenced by whether  father and mother regularly went to vote. The much used concept  of "political culture" really does apply in voting. Because  tradition is so important, it is frequently impossible to  uncover rational reasons for voting decisions through direct  questions.    The liberal theory of "rational choice" cannot be applied to  voting decision and political loyalty in Germany. Hardly half of  the voters expect personal advantages if the preferred party  does well.    Tactical calculations, too, such as not wanting to waste  one's vote, are only marginally effective. It was asked: "Would  you vote for a party which may not get over the 5-percent hurdle  and thus not get into the Bundestag or the Landtag, or would you  not bother to vote for a party that is not certain to qualify?"  More than half of all Germans and more than 80 percent of the  followers of smaller parties say: "I would nevertheless vote for  such a party."    Germans vote out of habit or tradition, and they regard  elections as purposeful. They are not tempted by the idea that  among 60 million eligible voters their vote is only a drop in  the ocean, not worth going to the polling station for in the  first place. One question asked: "Sometimes it is said that  going to vote, after all, makes no sense. Do you at times, too,  have this feeling, or do you not have such a feeling?" To be  sure, 47 percent in western Germany and 54 percent in eastern  Germany know this feeling. But as soon as one probes less  directly and, for example, searches for associations with the  word "voting," another picture emerges. The association  "senseless" then is in next to last place; almost 70 percent  say: "No, one cannot think of this in connection with `voting!'"  Instead 86 percent say: "In connection with `voting' one can  think of `important.'" Eighty-four percent associate  "codetermination"; 64 percent think of "duty."    Here lies the core of the political culture, closely  connected with the belief in the value and superiority of  democracy. Feelings play a large role. "When you have gone to a  Landtag election or a Bundestag election and have voted, do you  then have a good conscience, or have you never had such a  feeling?" it was asked. Forty-nine percent answered: "I then  have a good conscience." Or another question: "Do you know the  feeling of having helped a party with your vote, or do you not  know such a feeling?" Fifty-five percent reply: "I know" such a  feeling. And time and again, when dealing with the subject of  voting, one encounters the role of the parents. In the case of  great closeness to the parents, young people in 79 percent of  the cases say that going to vote is a kind of duty. Among those  who are less close to their parents, only 43 percent say this.  In response to the question of whether they will go to vote in  the Bundestag election in the fall, 69 percent of those who have  a close relationship with their parents say: "Certainly I will  go and vote"; among those who are distant only 44 percent say  this.    Probably it has to do with the large role of tradition that  the program of the preferred party is regarded as more important  than the top politicians of this party. The program, that is the  values of the family tradition. The politicians change.    Sixty-three percent say that there is a party for which they  generally vote. The democratic political culture is evidently  much stronger than the feeling of political homelessness, and  election years are high points in the consolidation of this  culture.    This also illustrates the magnitude of the task of letting a  democratic political culture grow up in the eastern laender.  When one hears words, one can, after all, have different  feelings, whether one likes them or not. How about the word  "voting?" "A sympathetic word," say 51 percent of the west  Germans, with 18 percent opposite votes. Quite differently the  east Germans: The 38 percent who regard "voting" as a  sympathetic word are opposed by 29 percent: "Voting is  unsympathetic."  <H5>  The Public Opinion Climate in March: The Union at a Low Point </H5>   The forecasts of the polling institutes about the election  in  Lower Saxony were not bad. But, of course, they would have been  wrong had the public opinion researchers taken their findings  about the voting intentions of people at face value. In  Allensbach, for example, the raw figures for the election in  Lower Saxony were as follows: SPD 52.5 percent, CDU 28.5  percent. This did not correspond to the subsequent election  results. At the same time, however, the information about how  people voted in the end was distorted. The SPD share of the  votes was much too high, the CDU share--much too low. If this  was corrected and the almost 40-percent undecided, on the basis  of their answers to other political questions, were apportioned,  the results were 45.2 percent for the SPD, 35.4 percent for the  CDU--very nearly the precise subsequent election result. All  German polling institutes today adjust their findings in this  manner.    What is the source of such distortion of information in  interviews? People do not lie. They find themselves under the  pressure of the opinion climate. At the moment the CDU/CSU finds  itself in a serious opinion climate low. Sixty-four percent of  all those polled believe that at present most Germans do not  like the Union. Only 11 percent say that people really like the  CDU/CSU. It is different with the SPD. Forty-four percent are of  the opinion that the SPD is well received, 21 percent contradict  this. In such a climate, a spiral of silence develops. Those who  feel threatened by the opinion climate become silent, refuse an  interview, or declare themselves undecided when asked about  their preferred party. The party which is under opinion-climate  pressure is underestimated in surveys. Only through "political  weighting" can one come close to the real strengths of the  parties, for example now, in February/March 1994, for Germany as  a whole 38.3 percent say they will vote for the SPD, and 32.5  percent for the CDU/CSU. The FDP, with 9.1 percent is far above  the 5-percent hurdle and likewise Alliance 90/Greens with 11.5  percent. Accordingly, the Germans give the SPD and Alliance  90/Greens far better chances in the coming Bundestag election  than the CDU/CSU and FDP. Only 22 percent expect a victory of  the present coalition, but 46 percent believe red and green will  win.    But people know how ephemeral such estimates are seven  months  before the Bundestag election. Only 6 percent believe that the  Bundestag election "has already been decided." For 81 percent,  however, everything is still open.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Antidemocratic Kim Yong-sam Puppet </F> Regime Must Be Overthrown"]    [Text] South Korean youth, students, and people of various  classes and strata are insisting on overthrowing the Kim  Yong-sam regime, denouncing it as an antidemocratic fascist  regime.    This is based on the serious lesson that it is impossible to  achieve independence, democracy, or reunification with the Kim  Yong-sam traitorous clique, which is committing treacheries to  the country and the nation more viciously than any preceding  regime by deceiving and disgracing the masses and drumming up  civilian and reform policies, as it is.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is a more antidemocratic  fascist dictatorial one than any of the successive military  dictatorial regimes.    Although he is advertising civilian and reform policies,  traitor Kim Yong-sam has only brought a greater disaster to the  people by conducting the civilian fascist repressive politics,  which is more vicious than the military fascist dictatorship of  the Fifth and Sixth Republics. The Kim Yong-sam group's fascist  nature is not inferior to and rather goes beyond that of any  preceding military fascist dictator. It is the most malicious  and vicious.    The so-called civilian government of South Korea cannot  coexist with the civilian politics. It follows the legal  grounds of the preceding military fascist rule as they are.    It is traitor Kim Yong-sam that promised to amend the  notorious National Security Law during the election campaign and  said on the following day of his inauguration that it was too  early to amend it.    Not a single phrase of the notorious National Security Law  has been changed, and the unchanged law plays the role of the  civilian government's fascist stick being used in repressing the  people.    The Kim Il-song group has not only maintained the bodies  organized under the previous military fascist dictatorship to  repress the people but also strengthened their functions and  increased their capacities drastically.    Yielding under the people's protest, the fascist clique was  talking about the reduction of the Agency for National Security  Planning [NSP], the place of origin of fascist oppression and  infringement of human rights in South Korea. In fact, however,  only some NSP figures' positions have been changed, and rather  strengthened the agency's function by establishing a new bureau  in charge of planning strategies on the North.    The demonstration-quelling task force unit of the puppet  police, which is being denounced as a fascist stick, a culprit  of the ruling forces, was reinforced with as many as about  17,000 new men. Special detective teams have been established in  the puppet police administration of each city and province. The  length of sticks carried by policemen is longer than that of  ones carried by policemen in the previous dictatorial regime.    Moreover, the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique announced its  plan to sharply increase the budget for puppet police stations  and police boxes across the country annually to suppress the  people.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime has maintained and reinforced  the fascist laws and repressive tools made by the preceding  military dictatorial regimes, pursuing a vicious fascist  dictatorial rule against the people.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is exasperatingly brandishing  a sword of civilian fascist dictatorship against the struggle  and march of the South Korean people and students who call for  independence, democracy, reunification, and the rights to live,  debasing it as an illegal violent riot and a collective egoism.    The civilian fascist dictatorial maniac ruthlessly cracked  down with a 100,000-strong police force on the struggle of the  citizens and students urging the investigation into the Kwangju  massacre, punishment of the murderers which was waged on the 13  anniversary of incident of the Kwangju popular uprising, thus  leaving the injured three times more than the Sixth Republic did.    Branding the South Korean Federation of General Student  Councils [Hanchongnyon]--a successor of the National Council of  Student Representatives [Chondaehyop] that set sail to realize  independence, democracy, and reunification--as an illegal group  benefiting the enemy, the Kim yong-sam fascist clique announced  a emergency state to ruin its inauguration ceremony and brutally  suppressed it by mobilizing some 190-company riot police troops.    Every university in South Korea, including Yonsei and Korea,  is being constantly searched by the civilian fascist  authorities. The theaters of the students' struggle have been  stained with blood and many patriotic students were arrested and  put behind the bars.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet traitor has frozen workers' wage by  shifting blame onto them for the economic crisis in South Korea  which is already in tatters. Furthermore, it has gone so far as  to brutally obstruct workers' strikes calling for the rights to  exist, including the basic wage hike, by invoking the emergency  arbitration power which the preceding dictators did not even  dare to provoke.    The civilian fascist dictators not only intensify its  suppression on patriotic movement organizations but also set up  government-controlled movement organizations and infiltrated  members of the Agency for National Security Planning into  progressive movement organizations. In this way, it is  persistently resorting to cunning maneuvers to reform  [kaeryanghwa] the South Korean mass movements and plunge them  into pure civic movements.    Its antipopular and antidemocratic fascist repressive rule  is  the most crafty, vicious and brutal despotism of a civilian  fascist outstripping the preceding military fascist regimes.    It is traitor Kim Yong-sam who is the most ruthless,  barbarous, fascist, dictatorial maniac who would not hesitate to  slay all the South Korean people if it is for gratifying his  greed for power.    It is a matter of course that the South Korean people and  students strongly call for the removal of the Kim Yong-sam  puppet regime, branding it as the most atrocious, vicious  civilian fascist regime combined with both military and civilian  dictatorship.    Only when the Kim Yong-sam treacherous regime is removed and  a genuine democratic independent regime is established in South  Korea, independence, democracy, and reunification which the  people aspire to could be realized.</p>

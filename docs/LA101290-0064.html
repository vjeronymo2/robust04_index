			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> EARLY ANNEXATION RULING FOR SIMI DELAYED  </P> <P> In a setback for Simi Valley's chances of getting an early ruling on whether it  can annex Bob Hope's Jordan and Runkle ranches, the head of a county planning  agency said Thursday that a study of the city's request for special  consideration will take a month longer than expected.  </P> <P> Simi Valley officials said a delay by the Local Agency Formation Commission in  deciding to change its procedures could hurt the city's chances for a speedy  review of the proposal to expand its sphere of influence to include the two  properties.  </P> <P> LAFCO Director Bob Braitman said his staff needs more time to prepare a report  on the matter and will ask the commission to delay a decision until Nov. 21.  The commission was scheduled to consider the request at its next meeting on  Oct. 17.  </P> <P> "It's taking more time than we have," Braitman said of the staff report. "To  put together a credible report needed by the commission, we're recommending the  matter be held over."  </P> <P> Simi Valley officials said a delay would mean that Simi Valley City  Councilwoman Vicky Howard, who is a member of the LAFCO board, will not be able  to vote on the matter. Howard's four-year term on the board ends Nov. 6.  </P> <P> "We're disappointed," Mayor Greg Stratton said. "I don't think it bodes well  for us."  </P> <P> However, Stratton said there is a strong possibility that the city will still  pursue annexation even though the process could take two years. He said the  council will discuss the issue at its meeting on Monday.  </P> <P> If reelected next month, Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore, a LAFCO alternate,  would take Howard's place at the panel's Nov. 21 meeting. Fiore has said  repeatedly that he is against Simi Valley annexing Jordan Ranch -- where a  750-house development and tournament golf course are planned -- because the  city is separated from the property by a mountain range.  </P> <P> Fiore said he would also oppose any change in LAFCO procedures for hearing the  annexation proposal.  </P> <P> "Why fix something that's not broke?" Fiore asked. He said if the commission  made an exception with Simi Valley, other cities and developers would expect  similar treatment.  </P> <P> Although LAFCO traditionally has not reviewed annexation proposals by cities  until their general plans have been amended and the necessary environmental  impact reports completed, there is no law prohibiting the agency from doing so.  </P> <P> Simi Valley officials had requested an early ruling on the annexation proposal  to avoid the lengthy and costly process of amending its General Plan if it  appeared that the proposal would be turned down.  </P> <P> Fearing that the County Board of Supervisors would reject the Jordan Ranch  development, Hope and Potomac Investment Associates turned to Simi Valley in  July with the annexation proposal.  </P> <P> In addition to 2,308 acres of Jordan Ranch property, Hope has also asked the  city to annex 3,600 acres of Runkle Ranch. The properties are part of the Santa  Monica and Santa Susana mountains.  </P> <P> If annexation goes through and his development is approved, Hope and his  attorneys have promised the city that he would not sell Blind Canyon, part of  the Runkle Ranch site, to the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts to be  developed as a landfill. Runkle Ranch straddles both Ventura and Los Angeles  counties.  </P></p>

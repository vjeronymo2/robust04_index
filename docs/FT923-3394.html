			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US investors appear reluctant to buy Wall Street US STOCK markets failed to follow through on Thursday's big gains as share prices held steady despite a stronger dollar and good inflation news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 0.55 at 3,305.71. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended slightly weaker, down 0.37 at 419.58, while the Amex composite put on 1.64 at 386.45 and the Nasdaq composite advanced 1.78 to 583.02. Turnover on the NYSE was 182m shares. After Thursday's 33-point jump in the Dow, some analysts had hoped that investors would build on those gains yesterday. The dollar was strong, rising almost three pfennigs to DM1.45 amid heavy technical buying, meaning that the beleaguered US currency had rallied more than six pfennigs since Labor Day. The day's main economic news was also positive for equities, with the Labor department reporting that producer prices rose just 0.1 per cent in August. The figures indicated that inflationary pressures in the economy remain extremely subdued, and confirmed the view that if the Federal Reserve wants to ease monetary policy again, fear of inflation should not be a hindrance. In spite of the good fundamentals, investors appeared reluctant to buy. They may have been unsettled by falling bond prices, although the Treasury market's weakness was linked to the heavy supply of new corporate debt, said analysts, and did not suggest that yields were on a long-term upward path. Among individual stocks, trading in shares of Morgan Stanley was delayed due to an order imbalance on the sell side after the New York investment bank announced second-quarter profits of Dollars 119m, 19 per cent higher than a year ago but below analysts' forecasts. The shares fell more than Dollars 1 but recovered in the afternoon to finish up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 49 7/8 . Ford fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 1/4 in turnover of 1.8m after Mr Jack Kirnan, motor analyst at securities house Salomon Brothers, lowered his rating from 'buy' to 'hold' and cut his forecasts for 1992 and 1993. Mr Kirnan said he was downgrading Ford because of the group's exposure to Europe, especially the UK, where sales are particularly weak and where the company is losing ground to General Motors. GM shares were down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 33 5/8 . Medtronic rose Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 88 3/4 in busy trading after the company settled its litigations with the German technology group Siemens. Siemens will make payments to Medtronic, with an initial outlay of Dollars 50m. On the Nasdaq market, Castle Energy jumped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 3 after the company revealed it would buy some of the assets of Atlantic Richfield for a total of Dollars 128m. Electronic Arts rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 32 on the news it had acquired a Texas video game maker for Dollars 35m in stock. Canada TORONTO changed little in active trading, the TSE-300 composite index losing 3.36 to 3440.57, down about 16 points on the week. Declines led advances by 276 to 272 in volume of 36.6m shares. Gold stocks suffered most with American Barrick and Placer Dome, two of the group's most heavily weighted components, falling  5/8 to 36 5/8 and  1/4 to 12 1/4 respectively.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Volume grows at US telecom groups Third-quarter results from several US telecom-munications companies showed continued fast growth in the volume of traffic, but also bore the scars of increased competition. Bell Atlantic reported a 58 per cent rise in the number of its cellular phone customers and a 9 per cent increase in minutes of use on its local networks. However, the Philadelphia-based company suffered a loss of Dollars 1.87bn in the quarter after previously announced extraordinary charges of Dollars 2.15bn, incurred in what Mr Raymond Smith, chairman, called 'an aggressive, multi-year campaign to respond to competition in our traditional markets'. Underlying net earnings for the quarter were down 29 per cent at Dollars 276m. Pacific Telesis announced a 6.7 per cent rise in minutes of use, but flat revenues and a 2 per cent rise in net earnings for the quarter, to Dollars 314m. The San Francisco-based company warned that it would be difficult to achieve earnings growth next year, as a result of 'regulatory rulings, increased competition and strategic initiatives'. Mr Phil Quigley, chairman, said 'a price cap on call charges which is being introduced next year as part of California's new regulatory framework would cut revenues by around Dollars 196m, with an initial Dollars 45m impact on this year's results'. In addition, the company will drop its local toll charges by 40 per cent from the start of next year, when new competitors will be allowed into its market. GTE, the biggest US local phone company, said its cellular customers rose by 48 per cent and minutes of use in its local networks by 9.6 per cent. These factors 'more than offset lower, more competitive telephone pricing,' the company said. Operating profits were up 8 per cent at a record Dollars 1.25bn for the quarter, while earnings per share before special items were also up 8 per cent at 64 cents. MCI Communications, the second largest US long-distance telephone company, in which the UK telecommunications company BT has a 20 per cent stake, said its third-quarter earnings showed an underlying increase of 15 per cent to Dollars 220m, or 38 cents a share, on sales up 12 per cent at Dollars 3.41bn. Traffic grew 10.2 per cent over the year, while international business was up more than 20 per cent. MCI also reported strong growth in the use of toll-free 800 numbers in the US. Sales in the 800 business market grew almost 20 per cent, while MCI's 1-800-COLLECT consumer service, introduced last year, had doubled its number of calls since the start of the year. MCI's newest 800 product, an international directory enquiries service launched earlier this month under the name of 1-800-CALL-INFO, came under fire yesterday from AT&amp;T, MCI's bigger rival. In a formal complaint to the US Federal Communications Commission, AT&amp;T said the service was illegal because it charged customers for a call to an 800 number. MCI denied the service was illegal. Ameritech, the mid-western local telephone company, announced a 15 per cent rise in net earnings before one-time charges to Dollars 419m in the third quarter, with cellular customers up 51 per cent and minutes of use up 8.0 per cent. However, it also took a net charge of Dollars 168m to cover a further 4,000 job losses, on top of the 6,000 announced in March. Revenues in the quarter rose 5.9 per cent to Dollars 3.12bn.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / French air strike appeal Airlines at France's Nice airport, angered by disruption caused by a handful of flight controllers, called on authorities yesterday to intervene to end the 11-day-old dispute. Strikes and go-slows by the 11 flight controllers in the southern French city of Aix-en-Provence have disrupted heavy holiday traffic in western Europe. About 30 of the 43 French and foreign airlines serving the Riviera airport wrote jointly urging the Civil Aviation Board to resolve the dispute over working conditions. Airline officials said some companies might have to alter flight plans until the end of the holiday season if the disruption continued. Aix-en-Provence, one of France's five air control centres, normally handles 2,400 flights a day in peak periods. Flight delays at Nice airport were down to one hour yesterday from three hours on Wednesday.</p>

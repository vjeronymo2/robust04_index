			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Grocers' guide to the east Material deprivation played its part in the collapse of communist rule in east and central Europe. So it is not surprising that knowledge of marketing conditions in these countries is still pretty basic. But the gap is being plugged by market research. Mintel has published a report* produced by KAE Development, a specialist in business development in east Europe, examining various aspects of grocery marketing in the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary and Poland, which together form a market of some 65m consumers. There are some striking east-west differences. While household spending on food, drink and tobacco is on average 19 per cent of total income across EC member countries, it is 70 per cent in Poland and 50 per cent in Hungary. The study also suggests that as much as 25 per cent of spending on groceries still goes on black-market products. Other findings useful for western businesses moving into the region include: high brand awareness of west European goods, but fickle brand loyalty. 'There is no longer such a strong belief that products from western Europe are superior, in fact there is a local patriotism which western European companies ignore at their peril.' The countries concerned have no shortages of consumer goods and 'most grocery sectors are well covered'. Promotions, competitions and similar marketing devices are very popular; a west European coffee company ran a promotion in the Czech republic offering consumers the chance to win a new car and attracted entries from almost one-third of the population. *Grocery Marketing in Practice 1993; price Pounds 3,300, or by individual country at Pounds 1,500 each.

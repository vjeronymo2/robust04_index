			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Letter: Arrangement fees that inflate interest charges Sir, I have read your recent articles on banking charges for small business with interest. My wife is a partner in a small retail business with an unblemished financial record in the seven years since start-up. Loans have been paid back punctually and the account has never been in the red. A few months ago it was offered an opportunity to buy stock in bulk at a very attractive price. On inquiring about an overdraft at its high street bank, it found that, if it had used the overdraft fully for the maximum three-month period of the arrangement, the effective interest rate would have been more than 30 per cent per annum owing to arrangement fees. It would in fact have been cheaper to borrow on her credit card. Anyone who had borrowed from the bank on the basis that it suggested would have been stupid. Maybe it was a customer intelligence test? S R Hunter, 32 Brookmans Avenue, Brookmans Park, Herts AL9 7QJ</p>

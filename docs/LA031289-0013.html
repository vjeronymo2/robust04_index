			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: PRESUMED CASTABLE  </P> <P> Harrison Ford has nabbed the choice lead in Mirage/Warner Bros' "Presumed  Innocent," to film in July for director Alan Pakula. The thriller, based on  Scott Turow's bestseller and adapted by Oscar-winner Frank Pierson, concerns an  investigator for the district attorney's office who is assigned to look into  the murder of his former mistress.  </P> <P> Originally optioned by Sydney Pollack and Mark Rosenberg (as producers) for a  reported $1 million at United Artists, the project was subsequently sold to  Warners last summer.  </P> <P> Negotiations are under way for Brian Dennehy to play Ford's boss, who -- like  Ford's character -- figures in the unraveling mystery.

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: The scourge of God - Radio RADIO 3 resumed its Marlowe season on Sunday with a whole evening of Tamburlaine the Great, both parts. It took almost four hours. There was of course a good deal of cutting, but not of narrative lines, only of repetitive description or of lists of proper names. I was sorry, all the same, not to hear the prologue; where Marlowe promises to lead us from 'jigging lines of rhyming mother-wits' to 'the stately tent of war', for he put the same feeling into the play itself. Minor Asian kings yield their crowns almost at once when confronted, not so much with conquest by Tamburlaine, as with verbal challenge. But there is conquest enough later. The plot tells of little beyond its account of the conquests of Tamburlaine, 'the scourge of God', over every middle-Eastern kingdom he set his eyes on. There is not much account of the fighting; though the so-called incidental music by Paddy Cuneen makes a quasi-military sound between scenes. There is much interest in the encounters between Tamburlaine and his various opponents. Even in appallingly sad moments, Marlowe is as poetic as terrible. Six virgins sue for peace at Damascus. 'Behold my sword,' Tamburlaine invites them. 'What see you at the point?' 'Nothing but fear and fatal steel, my lord.' 'Your fearful minds are thick and misty, then - for there sits Death, there sits imperious Death.' They are impaled on the walls. Not many characters emerge as heroic, apart from Bajazeth the Turk, captured in the victory over the King of Fez and hideously ill-treated instead of being massacred like most of Tamburlaine's captives. Rudolph Walker has an attractive voice with a hint of the West Indies. There had to be romance, and Tamburlaine is matched with Zenocrate, who bears him three sons, two of them like their father, the third a believer in humanity to one's enemies (no future for him). Zenocrate was beautifully played by Samantha Bond, with the right touch of courage, even at her death. Michael Pennington was an admirable Tamburlaine. On air, he did not have to give a bravura performance, only to speak Marlowe's matchless verse just a touch more importantly than his admirable associates, and this he did exactly. The director, Michael Fox, might have been more particular about the 'eds' in past participles, but I won't make any complaint against such a beautiful programme. Back to the 'stately tent of war' on Thursday in Dirty Tricks, a new Radio 4 series about the use of deceit in war, presented by Peter Snow. The first programme was sub-headed The Lessons of Troy, the reference being of course to the wooden horse. Those are fairly broad lessons, and in 40 minutes we were in Yorktown with Washington, in Palestine with Allenby, on the coast with Admiral 'Blinker' Hall, at Amiens with Rawlinson, in the Western Desert with Montgomery. The examples given were based on varying schemes, but clearly, as warfare gets more sophisticated, deceit will be easier to contrive and harder to avoid. The Germans before Alamein relied on our false 'going' maps smuggled into their possession. The genuine wooden horses were the dummy tracks, mock tanks, even the pipeline made of old petrol cans. I look forward to the later programmes; so far we have hardly dealt with aerial 'Tac. R' or codes. The Classic Serial, The Small House at Allington, is going well. Trollope's upper-middle-class characters find contact with the aristocracy bad for them, Crosby has jilted Lily Dale in favour of Lady Alexandrina, although she insists on being called, even at friendly times, 'Lady Alexandrina'. This fictional quality of the people makes Trollope so good for radio.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian and Ukrainian officials meeting in Moscow to  discuss the future of the Black Sea Fleet have failed to reach  any agreement after three days of intensive negotiations.    Speaking afterwards, Ukrainian Vice Premier Valeriy Shmarov  said that although the two sides had toiled in two shifts for  three days, there was still some work to be done because a  sharing out of the Fleet demanded great attention. He said the  two delegations were close to agreement on Wednesday, but had to  break off the talks to "clarify some technicalities".    Shmarov said the two delegations were due to meet in about  10  or 12 days to sign an agreement on the first stage of sharing  the Fleet.    Russia's envoy Yuriy Dubinin has pointed to the constructive  atmosphere prevailing at the talks. He was confident that all  of the remaining technicalities would have been resolved to  enable the prime ministers on both sides to sign the final  agreement in 10 or 12 days from now.</p>

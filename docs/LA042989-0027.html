			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHBISHOP MAHONY'S LETTER AND ABORTION ISSUE  </P> <P> There have been a great many articles and letters concerning the abortion  issue, however, I believe most are missing the point. It seems to me that the  real issue is one of old-fashioned responsibility for one's actions which  everyone wants to evade. It is also an issue of courage and duty.  </P> <P> Certainly, a woman should have the courage to say no to sex. (I am deliberately  not debating incest or rape here.) Once she says yes, then she has to accept  the responsibilities of her action (as must her partner) and if she becomes  pregnant, then her God-given duty is to nurture that child to maturity.  </P> <P> At the moment of conception she loses what rights she may have had in favor of  the unborn child, and even the so-called "point of viability" of a fetus has  nothing to do with it. Of course, she does not have the right to terminate the  life of the child in ordinary circumstances.  </P> <P> Please, ladies, don't try to shift your responsibilities onto other people.  </P> <P> ROGER J. JENSEN  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: AH Ball drops into losses of Pounds 405,000 AH Ball, the civil engineer, announced a drop into losses of Pounds 405,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 406,000, for the year ended March 31 1994. The main problem of the year was a substantial loss on three contracts which brought the gross profit margin down from 28.6 per cent to 14 per cent. This was reflected in a fall in gross profits from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 1.19m on turnover up from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 8.63m. There is no final dividend, as forewarned, so the interim of 1p compares with a total of 3.2p. Losses per share came out at 3.87p (4.42p).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Procedural Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations contained in this interim rule are based on the proposed rule published on October 8, 1993, and take into consideration public comment received on the proposed rule. The Department has made a number of changes to the section 3 regulations in response to public comment. Because of the changes made to the October 8, 1993 proposed rule, the Department is publishing the new section 3 regulations as an interim rule, rather than a final rule. Although the interim rule will be effective 30 days from the date of publication, as would a final rule, the Department solicits additional public comment, and public comment will be taken into consideration in development of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elsewhere in today's edition of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Department has published a final rule that makes conforming amendments to several parts in title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations that include reference, or should include reference, to the part 135 regulations. The section 3 ``conforming amendments'' proposed rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 8, 1993. No comments were received on that proposed rule, and no additional comments are solicited. Accordingly, the conforming amendments rule is published as a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Department's policy on interim rules, the amendments made to part 135 by this interim rule will expire on the twelve-month anniversary date of publication of this interim rule unless extended by notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or adopted by a final rule published on or before the twelve-month anniversary date of publication of the interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Background_Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 8, 1993 (58 FR 52534), the Department published a proposed rule that would implement section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (section 3) (12 U.S.C. 1701u), as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (1992 Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since its enactment, section 3 has been a statutory basis for promoting the award of jobs and contracts, generated from projects receiving HUD financial assistance, to, respectively, low-income residents and businesses of the areas where the projects to be assisted are located. Although the 1992 Act significantly revised section 3, it did not alter the objective of section 3_to provide economic opportunities to low-income persons. The 1992 Act strengthens the section 3 mandate by clarifying the types of HUD financial assistance, activities, and recipients subject to the requirements of section 3; identifying the specific individuals and businesses who are the intended beneficiaries of the economic opportunities generated from HUD-assisted activities; and establishing the order of priority in which these individuals and businesses should be recruited and solicited for the employment and other economic opportunities generated from HUD-assisted activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the comprehensive changes made to section 3 by the 1992 Act, the October 8, 1993 rule proposed to amend part 135 in its entirety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The October 8, 1993 proposed rule provided for implementation of section 3 in each of HUD's three principal program areas: (1) Public and Indian housing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) housing; and (3) community development. The proposed rule specified the types of efforts to be undertaken in these three programs to comply with the training, employment and contracting preferences required by section 3, and the responsibilities imposed on recipients to ensure compliance with the section 3 requirements in their own operations and the operations of their contractors and subcontractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment period for the October 8, 1993 proposed rule expired on December 8, 1993, but comments were accepted through December 31, 1993. By this date, 63 comments were received. The commenters included housing authorities, units of government of State and local jurisdictions, non-profit organizations, legal organizations, and organizations representing public housing residents and other low-income persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of the commenters were critical of one or more aspects of the rule. Housing authorities and State and local jurisdictions criticized the rule for being overly burdensome, and for failing to appreciate the administrative time and cost involved in undertaking the efforts required to provide training, employment and contracting opportunities to low-income persons. Legal organizations and other organizations representing low-income residents stated that the rule failed to provide clear standards and requirements by which recipients and contractors could achieve compliance with section 3, and as a result, economic opportunities would not be directed to low- and very low-income persons as required by section 3. Several commenters submitted lengthy comments on the proposed rule. Almost all commenters offered suggestions and recommendations on how implementation of section 3 should be conducted. The suggestions, recommendations, issues and questions submitted by commenters are discussed in Sections V and VI of the preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bankruptcy threat to Northwest Airlines DIRECTORS of Northwest Airlines' parent company met in Minneapolis yesterday amid rumours they could put the carrier, the fourth largest in the US, into bankruptcy if labour concessions were not secured. The meeting will reconvene on Monday by teleconference. Northwest, in which KLM Royal Dutch Airlines holds a minority stake, has borrowings of well more than Dollars 4bn. It faces a demanding debt repayment schedule over the next few years, and has been trying to persuade its bankers to reschedule payments on the condition that it delivers labour concessions worth about Dollars 300m a year over the next three years. Northwest offered a 30 per cent equity stake to unions as part of the deal and has reached agreement with unions representing its machinists and flight attendants. However, two weeks ago, the rank-and-file machinists voted against the deal. The other key labour group  - the pilots  - has never reached agreement with the company, although talks have been continuing this week. If the bankruptcy threat becomes reality, Northwest would be the sixth large US carrier to have entered Chapter 11 since 1990.</p>

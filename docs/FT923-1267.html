			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Taipei steps up stock default probe AN investigation by Taiwan authorities into an estimated TDollars 8bn (Pounds 184.5m) of stock defaults has intensified with the detention yesterday of four market players in connection with illegal lending and other securities offences. Two of the four - both renowned as 'big hands' - were later released on bail. The move follows the arrest last Sunday of Mr Lei Po-lung, another of the market's big players, which sent share prices tumbling 6 per cent by Monday's close. Mr Lei is alleged to be responsible for at least some of the defaulted payments and has been charged with breach of securities trading laws. The defaults are thought to be linked to Hualon, the textile and insurance group which was allegedly involved in an insider trading scandal last year. Mr Lei has claimed he purchased stocks on behalf of the group, which they then failed to pay him for. Within the past two weeks the government has introduced measures aimed at stabilising the battered market. Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said last week it would tighten trading regulations, and the central bank eased its policy on remittances into the country by foreign institutions for investment in equities. A remittance by Fidelity Investments of USDollars 60m (Pounds 35m) was approved last week; the bank then approved a USDollars 50m application by Pierson Heldring and Pierson of the Netherlands on Tuesday. The SEC has said other applications would be considered speedily. Analysts say these steps will do little in the short term to improve investor confidence, already damaged by the arrest on September 10 of Mr Weng Ta-ming, the ailing head of Hualon, for his alleged involvement in a TDollars 600m insider dealing scandal. Although the market made a slight recovery yesterday, stocks previously associated with Hualon have repeatedly fallen this week by the permitted 7 per cent daily limit.</p>

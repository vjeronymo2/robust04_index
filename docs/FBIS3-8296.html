Lewandowski said that the strikes were taking place in a  variety of forms. The protest action is to draw attention to  the financial problems of employees and their families. The  teams from the raw material departments have not discontinued  the technological processes so as not to make the financial  situation of their steelworks even worse. The strike action has  been joined by the workers of the Bankowa, Zawiercie, Baildon,  Batory, Bobrek, and 1 Maja steelworks, among others. At the  Katowice steelworks, the protest action had been limited to  collecting money for the strike fund, Renata Bytomska, the  steelworks press spokeswoman, told PAP.</p>

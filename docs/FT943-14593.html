			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Alitalia, unions reach accord The management of Alitalia, Italy's state-run national airline, yesterday reached a ground-breaking agreement with the main trade unions that involves the ending of damaging restrictive labour practices. The outline agreement follows a strike on Monday and a series of wildcat strikes which caused chaos to Alitalia's operations last week. The deal centres on a commitment by unions to end their ban on cabin crew being allowed to switch between different types of aircraft, longer working hours, an unspecified cut in wages and a freeze on pay increases through to 1996 plus a stop on new recruitment. Against this, redundancies among ground staff, originally planned at 4,000, will be 1,570. But this figure does not include 800 people approved for early retirement by the previous Ciampi government and natural wastage envisaged at about 800 a year during the course of the three-year restructuring plan. Yesterday Alitalia declined to give details of the agreement, which must now be put before union members for approval. Sulta, the militant cabin crew union, excluded from the negotiations and which caused the wildcat strikes of last week, said it would reject the deal.</p>

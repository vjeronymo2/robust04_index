			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / People: Cottrell quits Midland Alison Cottrell, the much-quoted bond analyst at Midland Global Markets, seems to be living close to the edge. After five years at Midland, part of the HSBC group which has just announced spectacular losses of Pounds 123m on bond and interest rate-related trading during the first half of this year, she is leaving for Kidder Peabody, the US house which has been dogged by a bond trading scandal for much of this year. Cottrell, 30, will start at Kidder, owned by General Electric, in October.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Grievances and Sanctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim final rule revised, redesignated, and reordered the regulatory provisions formerly found at 20 CFR part 29, Subpart D_``Grievances, Investigations, and Hearings'' in a new part 627, subparts E, F, G, and H. The interim final regulations more clearly defined the various JTPA grievance procedures required to be established by section 144 of the Act. The procedures applicable to a particular grievance process level were consolidated into discrete subparts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Grievance Procedures at the State and Local Level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The new part 627, subpart E, sets forth the grievance procedures required at the State and SDA and SSG levels, including State review, that were generally found at 20 CFR 629.52.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter suggested that the reference to the handling of complaints alleging discrimination in &sect;627.500(a) be made a separate paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees with the suggestion and &sect;627.500 is revised to redesignate the last sentence in paragraph (a) as a new paragraph (b), Handling of discrimination complaints. In addition, paragraphs (b) and (c) are redesignated as paragraphs (c) and (d), respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter observed that under the previous regulations, complaints involving fraud, waste, abuse, or criminal activity were to be reported to the Secretary, and that &sect;627.500(b) of the interim final regulations now provides that such complaints are to be reported to the DOL OIG. The commenter's concern was that ETA might not be aware of, but had a need to know of, such complaints, and recommended that the regulations be amended to also include notification to ETA for such complaints. Another commenter suggested that complaints be reported concurrently to ETA and the OIG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the interim final regulations was to ensure that criminal activity was directed to the OIG for resolution. Other processes set forth in the regulations for the handling of complaints are designed for non-criminal JTPA complaints. The provision at &sect;627.500(b) is amended to provide for reporting criminal activity to the OIG, Office of Investigations through the Department's Incident Reporting System, with a copy simultaneously provided to ETA. Other non-criminal complaints will continue to be handled under the procedures set forth at part 627, subparts E and F, and through the Department's Incident Reporting System.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter recommended deleting &sect;627.500(c)(2) concerning a private right of action with respect to alleged violations of JTPA statute or regulations in pursuing non-JTPA remedies since there is no statutory authority for the provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provision at &sect;627.500(c)(2) is not a new provision. Prior to the interim final rule, it was set forth at 20 CFR 629.51(b)(3) since the March 15, 1983 regulations implementing JTPA. It does not preclude a private right of action if one exists, but rather indicates that nothing in the Act or in the regulations creates such a right. No change is made to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter recommended that States, SDA's, and SSG's be required to develop their grievance procedures in such a way as to broadly inform participants under the JTPA system of their rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that the Act and regulations clearly set out the broad outlines of the grievance, hearings, and appeal rights under JTPA for interested parties. The specific complaint and grievance procedures to be followed are appropriately developed at the State and local level in accordance with the provisions of the Act and these regulations. Such procedures are routinely made available to participants upon entering the program, and to subrecipients and other interested parties. No change is made to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter recommended that States should be required to establish timeframes for resolving complaints and recommended a 60-day time period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department expects that State, SDA and SSG grievance procedures already address this issue as an integral and necessary part of their procedures. In any case, the regulations already include a 60-day time period at &sect;&sect;627.502(c) and 627.503 (a) and (c) of the interim final rule. Therefore, no change is made to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter recommended that a neutral third party be included in the grievance processes at the State level under &sect;627.501, and the SDA and SSG level under &sect;627.502, to hear and act upon complaints. In addition, the commenter suggested that programs should be encouraged to take advantage of recent Federal initiatives related to mediation of disputes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim final regulations already provide for the use of neutrals in the JTPA grievance process in certain situations. For instance, such use is included in binding arbitration proceedings under the alternate procedure for handling labor standards violation under section 144 of the Act, and the alternative dispute resolution provisions at &sect;627.805 available to parties to a complaint under &sect;627.801, Procedures for filing a request for hearing. The regulations also provide for an independent review of complaints at the State level pursuant to the provisions at &sect;627.503. No change is made to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter recommended increased DOL participation in monitoring and handling complaint processes at the State and SDA and SSG levels, including regular participation in grievance hearings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

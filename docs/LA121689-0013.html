			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LA QUINTA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> TIPPED PASS, PRAYER SHOT GIVE FOOTHILL VICTORY OVER ESTANCIA  </P> <P> Foothill High School, a team all but beaten in the final of the La Quinta  tournament, survived on its instincts Friday night.  </P> <P> A tipped pass by Mark Wilkinson and a shoot-from-the-hip prayer at the buzzer  by Greg Clark gave the Knights a 49-48 victory over Estancia at La Quinta High  School.  </P> <P> Those two plays spoiled an otherwise solid performance by the Eagles, who  controlled the second half despite a height disadvantage.  </P> <P> Estancia (4-3) appeared to have things well in hand until the final minute. The  Eagles had the ball and a 48-47 lead with time running out.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the ball was in the hands of Augustine Heredia, the Eagles' point  guard, who is not only sure-handed but a deadly free-throw shooter. However,  everything fell apart quickly for Estancia.  </P> <P> With 20 seconds left, Foothill's Mark Wilkinson leaped to deflect Heredia's  pass and then recovered the loose ball.  </P> <P> After a timeout, the Knights looked confused as they worked the ball around.  Finally, with time running out, Erik Gilbertson threw up a 20-foot shot that  wasn't even close. However, the miss fell right into the hands of Clark, who  tossed the ball in as the buzzer went off.  </P> <P> "I didn't even know what I was doing," Clark said. "All I could think about was  the clock. I threw it up and prayed. The next thing I knew, everyone was  jumping on me."  </P> <P> Until the last 20 seconds, Estancia had played a near-perfect half. The Eagles'  quickness frustrated the taller Knights, who turned the ball over 14 times.  </P> <P> Heredia, a senior point guard, was a particular problem for the Knights. He not  only scored a game-high 25 points, but had eight assists and four steals.  </P> <P> "You better have a very quick point guard if you're going to play against that  kid," Foothill Coach Jim Reames said. "He nearly beat us single-handed."  </P> <P> It was Heredia who sparked a 12-2 run early in the third quarter that gave the  Eagles a 38-31 lead. He scored two baskets during the streak, including a  three-point field goal, and had three assists.  </P> <P> However, Foothill's size took its toll in the fourth quarter. Mark Wilkinson, a  6-foot-4 forward, worked inside to score eight points to pull the Knights to  within one, 44-43, midway through in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Estancia tried packing its defense and dared the Knights to shoot from the  outside. For the most part it worked, but Gilbertson (16 points) did make  enough outside shots to loosen the defense in the final quarter.  </P> <P> "Our outside shooting is very suspect," Reames said. "That's why we have to  rely on our bulk."  </P> <P> The Knights outrebounded Estancia, 40-22. Wilkinson had 16 rebounds.  </P> <P> Foothill dominated the inside in the first half, but led by only three at  halftime, 29-26.  </P> <P> In the third-place game:  </P> <P> Huntington Beach 90, Troy 42 -- Mustapha Abdi scored 26 points to lead  Huntington Beach. The Oilers led, 28-4, at the end of the first quarter and  48-14 at halftime. Scott Jahr scored 17 points and Stephen Lucas 14 for  Huntington Beach. Richard Wesley scored 18.  </P> <P> In the consolation championship:  </P> <P> Torrance 84, Cypress 76 -- Rick Robinson scored 36 points to lead Torrance.  </P></p>

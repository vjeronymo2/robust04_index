			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: IBM, HP launch new computers INTERNATIONAL Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard both yesterday launched new aggressively-priced, high-performance PCs aimed at corporate buyers. However, reflecting the cut-throat competition in the PC market, AST Research, a leading clone maker, matched and in some cases undercut IBM and HP prices with new models of its own. IBM launched 12 new models in its PS/2 Premium line and announced a new warranty service. H-P claimed its new PCs were cheaper than comparable products from Compaq Computer and provide more features than similarly-priced PCs from Dell Computer and AST. IBM has called for redemption on November 21 of all Dollars 1.2bn outstanding of its 7 7/8 per cent convertible subordinated debentures due November 2004. It also called for redemption on November 14 of all Dollars 250m outstanding in World Trade Corp 10 1/4 per cent notes due November 1995.</p>

Sergeyev, candidate of military </F> sciences]    [Text] Changes in the world military-political situation  which began in the mid-1980's forced the U.S. leadership to  revise its views on problems of the country's national security  on the threshold of the 21st century. Since 1946, the day of the  well-known speech by W. Churchill in Fulton (USA), the principal  threat to U.S. national security was considered to be the Soviet  Union, the only state in the world which could threaten the  existence of western civilization. But disintegration of the  USSR and of the Warsaw Pact Organization on the one hand and the  rapid buildup of military potential of individual third world  countries on the other led to a change in the correlation of  forces in the international arena.    In the assessment of U.S. political scientists, development  of the world community up to the end of the 1990's will be  characterized by growing political instability, serious economic  shocks and an increasing number of states possessing a  significant military potential. With consideration of the  continuing process of proliferation of modern types of arms,  including mass destruction weapons, all this creates a potential  threat to U.S. security. The likelihood that the U.S. Armed  Forces will be forced to defend the country's interests by arms  remains high, in the assertion of Pentagon specialists, but the  time and methods of their use will undergo significant changes  in the future.    In the situation at hand U.S. foreign policy pursues the  following goals: assist in spreading freedom and democracy (as  the Americans themselves understand it), ensure stability of the  country's economic development (for which a need arises to  protect very important sources of strategic resources and lines  of communication), fulfill allied obligations, exert direct  influence on development of the situation in unstable regions in  U.S. interests, prevent a strengthening of unfriendly regimes,  oppose proliferation of mass destruction weapons, and fight  international terrorism and the drug trade. These provisions  became the basis of new concepts of organizational development  and employment of branches of the U.S. Armed Forces; development  of the concepts were begun by appropriate ministries and staffs  in the late 1980's.    The Air Force was first to advance a new concept for its  development, called "global reach-global power." It was  submitted to Congress in February 1991 as an annex to a  Secretary of the Air Force report on the draft budget for fiscal  years 1992-1993.    Basic provisions of U.S. national security strategy are  formulated in the first part of the document. In determining the  role and place of armed forces in ensuring national security,  the U.S. administration proceeded from the following theses:     -  on a global scale the United States will continue to play  a key role in the world to retain control over areas of its  "vital interests" at any point on the planet;    -  Europe will  continue to be a vitally important region and, despite a  reduction in numerical strength of the U.S. Armed Forces  grouping, ensuring European security (strengthening NATO,  supporting ideas of the Conference on Security and Cooperation)  will remain as before the principal task of the United States in  this zone;    -  as the importance of the Asiatic-Pacific region  grows, the sphere of U.S. "vital interests" is expanding and the  threat on the part of traditional enemies is diminishing:    -  in the  Persian Gulf U.S. interests remain the same--support friendly  states and prevent any foreign power from establishing control  over oil resources and lines of communication.       Independently of the correlation of forces taking shape in  the international arena, it is planned to carry on U.S. Armed  Forces organizational development in the future as well guided  by principles of a reasonable combination of offensive and  defensive capabilities. The following remain fundamental  military policy provisions: strategic deterrence and defense,  forward presence, immediate reaction to crisis situations, and  capability of quickly building up military might to the  necessary level.    These provisions served as the basis for the second and main  part of the concept, which examines main directions of Air Force  organizational development and methods of its employment at the  end of the current century and beginning of the next century.    The Pentagon leadership believes the Air Force has the  necessary personnel and assets for performing missions in  military conflicts of any scale and intensity. It is  characterized by a long operating range, flexibility,  operational efficiency, accuracy in delivering strikes and high  offensive potential of weapon systems. In planning  organizational development of this branch of the Armed Forces,  the U.S. Air Force command attempts to achieve the following  goals: provide capabilities for conducting combat operations in  any TVD [theater of military operations], organize airlifts of  troops and cargoes in a short time on a global scale, and  achieve aerospace superiority. For this it is deemed necessary  to develop nuclear forces; strategic, tactical, military  transport and tanker aviation; and space-based forces and assets.    Provide capabilities for conducting combat operations  in a TVD. Questions of organizational development of Air  Force general purpose forces hold an important place and are  examined in greater detail with consideration of possible  options of their employment both in peace as well as wartime.    The concept assumes that in peacetime regions will remain  such as the European Theater of War, where a potential need is  preserved for conducting large-scale combat operations for a  lengthy time, but the likelihood of initiation of war here has a  tendency to drop. Meanwhile, there was a sharp increase in the  likelihood of the appearance of a threat to U.S. interests from  individual states located a considerable distance from the main  TVD's.    Pentagon representatives believe that military force will be  used in local conflicts primarily in the form of brief,  purposeful, effective operations. In the course of battles the  U.S. Armed Forces must react quickly and adequately to actions  of a well equipped and well trained enemy, deliver powerful  strikes and win victory in compressed time periods.    The Air Force has those capabilities to the full extent. The  capability of promptly concentrating necessary forces and assets  in remote areas of the globe and the flexibility and operational  efficiency inherent to Air Force elements permit the command to  deliver strikes against the most important elements of the enemy  military and military-economic potential in very short time  periods.    The flight range of combat aircraft is such that it enables  them to operate at a considerable distance from base airfields.  Flexibility of employing Air Force elements permits reacting  promptly to a change in the situation and influencing a  situation created in a given region. The time aircraft are  present in the enemy air defense weapon impact zone and the time  of performing the combat mission as a whole are reduced because  of high flight speed.    In the opinion of western military specialists, the nature  of  combat operations by air groupings deployed in a TVD will  undergo no substantial changes. They will perform all primary  missions in the course of independent air operations and  operations together with ground troops and naval forces: winning  air superiority, giving close air support to troops, isolating  the battlefield and combat operations area, and conducting  aerial reconnaissance. Forces and assets assigned for this will  be determined by specific conditions.    At the same time, as the concept notes for the first time,  in  a number of cases aviation will independently perform such  missions as neutralizing the enemy or depriving him of the  capability to resist, and disrupting the cohesiveness of his  troop operations, which may have a deciding influence on the  course of a conflict. The 1991 Persian Gulf war is an example of  this.    The document emphasizes that although joint efforts of all  branches of armed forces unquestionably are needed, judging from  practice of recent years it is most often the Air Force that  places the most combat ready force elements with a large radius  of action at the disposal of the country's leadership. Aviation  is capable of delivering weapons and destroying primary targets  in any region. The Air Force role in protecting U.S. interests  outside the country may grow even more in the future.    Having considerable capabilities for destroying targets,  strategic aviation can deliver a strike at any point on the  globe in compressed time periods. Thus, during Exercise Bright  Star-83, B-52 strategic bombers which took off from airfields in  the continental United States delivered a strike with  conventional munitions against targets on a range in Egypt,  after which they returned to departure bases without an  intermediate landing. U.S. military specialists assume that  measures similar to Operation Eldorado Canyon (delivery of the  strike against Libya in 1986) can be carried out by lesser  forces and assets, but forward air bases or permission to fly  through the air space of other states are necessary for this.    In the opinion of the Air Force command, strategic bombers  with conventional weapons can be brought in in the first hours  (days) of a conflict to deliver a strike against vital targets.  In this case the material costs turn out to be less than in  realizing other options of armed intervention. In subsequent  combat operations they can be used for mass bombings of troops  in concentration areas, on forward movement routes, and against  air and naval bases and infrastructure facilities. Their  capability for performing combat missions at night and in  adverse weather conditions permits the command element to  organize continuous fire pressure on the enemy.    In connection with the aging of B-52 aircraft, in recent  years the Air Force command decided to modify the B-1B heavy  bomber to expand its capabilities for employing conventional  munitions. The B-1B has a number of advantages over the B-52  (less radar cross-section, greater flight speed, improved  electronics) and is capable of performing combat missions more  effectively, especially in initial stage of a conflict.    The question of using new B-2 bombers (Fig. 1 [figure not  reproduced]) developed using stealth technology is being  discussed actively at the present time. This aircraft has  greater survivability and an increased combat operating radius  with the same ordnance payload compared with the B-52 and B-1B.  Calculations showed that a B-2 bomber using two air bases (Diego  Garcia in the Indian Ocean and Andersen on Guam in the Pacific)  is capable of delivering a strike with conventional weapons  against targets in any part of the globe with one aerial  refueling. The U.S. Air Force command considers this aircraft to  be a highly effective means of delivering surprise strikes.    Autonomous operations in the deep enemy rear are the  principal feature of B-2 employment (it is proposed to destroy  the maximum number of important strategic targets). Their use  will permit significantly increasing surprise in delivering  strikes, ensure destruction of any target on enemy territory and  ensure continuity of the effect on his principal installations.    But the primary role in accomplishing swift, adequate  retaliatory operations in conflicts of varying intensity without  use of nuclear weapons belongs to tactical aviation. In the  opinion of the U.S. command, forward-based tactical air units  and subunits providing a constant military presence (Europe,  countries of the Asiatic-Pacific region, and the Persian Gulf)  have a stabilizing effect on the situation in corresponding  regions. Therefore, the planned reduction of air groupings on  overseas territories is being carried out by moving subunits  equipped with obsolete aircraft models (F-4 and F-111 tactical  fighters, A-10 attack aircraft) to the United States. At the  same time, it is planned to deploy units and subunits armed with  modernized F-15E tactical fighters, and in the future also the  newest F-22's (Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]), in forward zones.    Considering the increased likelihood of local armed  conflicts  being initiated in various regions, the Air Force command began  creating composite air wings in accordance with the new concept.  Because they include various types of combat and auxiliary  aircraft, the composite air wings are capable of rebasing  independently and quickly and performing all missions facing a  deployed air grouping. Along with combat aircraft, such a  subunit may include tanker, military transport, and radar early  warning and control aircraft.    The multi-option nature of employing tactical aviation  outside the country depends to a considerable extent on the  presence and preparation of an airfield network in forward  zones. In this connection the country's military-political  leadership believes that when allied interests are threatened,  the requisite number of air bases and forward airfields  supporting a redeployment of units and subunits within several  hours should be placed at the disposal of the United States. In  developing the Air Force organizational development concept, the  command element proceeds from the need to preserve (up to the  mid-1990's), and in the future also to increase, the firepower  of strike aviation with a substantial reduction in its combat  force level. Financial restrictions force certain reductions,  and the latest changes in the correlation of forces in the  international arena and achievements in the development of  aircraft weapon systems provide an opportunity for such  reductions, above all of tactical aviation (up to 30 percent by  1995-1997).    The following basic directions are planned for development  of  aircraft and weapons in the next few years: An increase in  performance characteristics and specifications of aircraft,  above all through achievement of "supermaneuverability," use of  supersonic cruising speed, and use of economical engines;  introduction of automated flight and weapon control systems and  equipment; realization of stealth technology to reduce the  signature and vulnerability of aircraft and aircraft munitions;  achievement of high effectiveness in engagement of airborne and  ground targets by aircraft long-range precision guided weapons;  development of remotely controlled aircraft for various  purposes; expansion in the area of combat application of  aircraft (use of upper layers of the atmosphere and hypersonic  flight speeds); and development of aerospace aircraft capable of  flying in low, near-earth orbits.    Realization of research in the area of foremost technology  under the Forecast-2 program, which unites basic priority  technologies for creation of aircraft weapons and military  equipment (39 advanced technologies and 31 new system  developments), will be the material basis of the concept in  question.    Adoption of the latest aircraft (B-2, F-117, F-22, F-15E)  outfitted with precision weapons and adoption of low-signature  cruise missiles and drones will significantly increase Air Force  capabilities, since they will be capable of engaging mobile  ballistic missile systems, the main elements of reserve troop  groupings in the interior of the country, state and military  command and control entities, and very important transportation  hubs and power and industrial installations. In other words, the  destruction not only of forward groupings of armed forces, but  also of deep reserves, disabling of enterprises of leading  sectors of industry, and a reduction in the enemy military  potential are probable. In addition, this may provide continuity  of action of combat aircraft regardless of weather conditions  and time of day, which reduces the effectiveness of the air  defense system in repelling an air attack and strengthens the  psychological effect on the enemy.    Joint operations of the Air Force and Navy during which they  will reinforce and supplement each other are singled out in  particular in the "global reach-global power" concept. According  to the command element's calculations, Air Force aviation is  capable of substantially assisting the Navy in performing  missions of covering ship groupings and protecting sea lines of  communication in various areas. Should it be necessary, aircraft  carriers in turn should arrive in a conflict area right after  tactical aviation force elements in order to build up efforts.  Combat capabilities of U.S. Navy ships' air defense forces and  assets can be used in organizing defense of territory adjoining  the coast, because of which Air Force aircraft can be retargeted  to perform other more important missions. Thus, a squadron of  B-52 bombers is capable of doubling the strike potential of a  carrier force.    In the course of combat training, strategic bomber subunits  actively perform missions of laying minefields in sea waters and  combating enemy ships by use of antiship missiles.    In accordance with the new concept, missions are assigned to  the U.S. Air Force in the course of special operations both for  comprehensive support of those operations as well as for  immediate involvement in them. (It is proposed to bring in  special-purpose air units and subunits as well as tactical  aviation force elements). One goal which is assuming ever  greater importance is the fight against illegal drug shipments.  The Air Force must assign necessary forces and assets for  conducting aerial reconnaissance and surveillance, intercepting  airborne targets and isolating areas of drug production.    Support of strategic movements of troops and  cargoes. The new concept also reflected a change in views  on the Air Force role, place and missions in supporting Armed  Forces mobility. If one takes into account the scale of the  planned reduction in numerical strength of U.S. troops and  unpredictable development of the situation in certain areas,  support of strategic mobility will be one of the primary Air  Force missions.    The increased likelihood of local conflicts breaking out in  third world countries, which as a rule have a poorly developed  infrastructure, places the Air Force command face to face with  additional missions in organizing airlifts. Among them is the  need to deploy additional command and control systems and  communication lines; the provision of navigation and  meteorological support as well as logistic support, above all  the supply of POL and spare parts.    Guided by these provisions, the Air Force command advances  the requirement to continue production and procurement of the  new C-17 transport intended for replacing the C-141 and capable  of operating from poorly equipped airfields, including from  those with dirt runways.    The second part of the concept ("global power") emphasizes  Air Force strike assets (ICBM's, strategic bombers and tactical  fighters) and its first part ("global reach") reflects command  views on use of tanker aviation. The likelihood of a reduction  in the number of U.S. air bases on overseas territories  substantially increases the role of tanker aircraft, which are a  mandatory, necessary means of supporting operations both of U.S.  Air Force combat aviation as well as auxiliary aviation. Aerial  refueling of aircraft increases the radius of action of combat  aircraft, the flight range of military transport aircraft, and  time in the air of air defense fighters, airborne command post  aircraft and radar early warning and control aircraft, which  contributes to increased effectiveness of U.S. Air Force  operations. In addition, some tanker aircraft can be used for  refueling Naval Aviation aircraft as well as allied aircraft,  thanks to which their capabilities for conducting combat  operations increase.    It also should be noted that in the organization of troop  and  cargo airlifts, tanker aircraft will be used to deliver  necessary aviation fuel reserves to the conflict area.    Use of aerospace for supporting Air Force  activity. The document emphasizes that in the future  aviation will be used on a global scale day and night in any  weather and climatic conditions in delivering strikes  continuously against ground, naval and airborne targets. All  this will require a qualitatively new approach to supporting  aircraft and missile flights. Space reconnaissance, navigation,  meteorological support and communications systems can play a  special role in supporting aircraft operations. They will  support the issue of target designations, battle management,  information exchange, and a precise approach to the target area.    Technical progress permits realizing such important  advantages of space-based systems as global surveillance,  relatively low vulnerability, and independence of operations,  which can contribute to a significant increase in effectiveness  of using aviation forces and assets.    Aviation combat support systems supplement capabilities of  space systems in following the quickly changing world situation.  The AWACS radar early warning and control system as well as the  advanced JSTARS, adapted for swift deployment in the most remote  parts of the globe, are the principal and sometimes also the  only source of information on the enemy in the initial stage of  combat operations.    Strengthening the security of allies and developing  relations with them. The new concept attaches special  significance to this area of Air Force activity as a means of  achieving national policy goals in a corresponding region. In  particular, aircraft deliveries considerably increase combat  capabilities of partners' armed forces and give assistance in  the area of preparing personnel and logistic support, which  helps strengthen and spread U.S. influence and provides for  advance deployment of the logistic support system in potential  conflict areas.    One Brookings Institution study entitled "Strength Without  War" draws the conclusion that following the end of World War II  the Air Force achieved positive results in various conflicts  considerably more often than any other branch of the Armed  Forces. Aviation's role will grow constantly in the future with  a shift of emphasis to preparation for military operations using  conventional weapons and an absence of immediate opposition  (contact) of armed forces groupings deployed in peacetime.    U.S. Air Force organizational development up to the end of  the current century and at the beginning of the next century is  to be accomplished in accordance with changes occurring in the  world. The Air Force must perform assigned missions to the full  extent in any part of the globe in compressed time periods. An  analysis of plans and programs for development of the Armed  Forces as a whole permits asserting that it is specifically  aviation that will conform most fully to basic provisions of the  strategy of U.S. involvement in regional conflicts and will  become one of the means of fire effect against enemy targets  regardless of their location, size, structure, mobility and  other characteristics. Specifically these capabilities will be  built up so that the Army, Air Force and Navy mutually  supplement and reinforce each other. Thus, optimum Armed Forces  will be formed to realize U.S. national security strategy.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Go to Tokyo for a Pounds 2,840 saving on UK-built Nissan A JAPANESE car made in Sunderland and shipped 10,600 miles to Japan costs Pounds 2,840 less in Tokyo than a similar model for sale a few hundred yards from the Nissan plant in the north-east of England. The car buyer in Sunderland wanting a new Nissan Primera eGT, built at the Japanese car maker's Pounds 900m car plant close to the town, could drive it away from the nearby dealer, Reg Vardy, for Pounds 16,215. The racy-looking hatchback is black (a Pounds 120 option) and has air conditioning (a Pounds 795 option) to bring it up to the same equipment level as the car on sale in Tokyo. It also has front and rear spoilers. In Tokyo, a similar Primera eGT is on sale in the Kudan showroom of the Nissan Prince Tokyo Sales Company priced at Y2,788,675 (Pounds 13,375), Pounds 2,840 less than in the UK. Sunderland is the only Nissan plant which makes this model. Before the steep decline of sterling after its withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System the Tokyo price was equivalent to only Pounds 11,994. The cars' varying equipment levels - a favourite justification for car price differences around the world - are not enough to explain the divergence in this example. The Sunderland buyer gets an electric sun roof (not available in Japan) but the Tokyo buyer gets automatic transmission, a Pounds 750 option in the UK. The prices quoted above include the discounts that may be negotiated from dealers - 11.7 per cent at Sunderland's Reg Vardy, and 6.0 per cent at Tokyo's Nissan Prince. Taxes are another big variable. Higher taxes in the UK have certainly inflated the price paid by the Sunderland car buyer - but not by enough to close the gap. Excluding tax, the price in Tokyo would still be Pounds 1,680 less than in the UK - Pounds 11,490 versus Pounds 13,170. Last week a study by Ludvigsen Associates, the UK-based automotive analysts, claimed European car buyers paid as much as 30 per cent more for new cars than consumers in the US and Japan. The Ludvigsen report said inefficiencies in the European motor industry were one of the basic reasons for this difference in prices. Nissan, which pioneered Japanese car production in Europe with its UK plant, says there are 'many factors' behind the price differences but 'the most important is the overall pricing in the particular market. 'New car prices in Japan are relatively low because during the years of consistent growth in demand manufacturers have been able to offset increased costs against rising production volumes. 'Prices have consistently risen at less than the rate of inflation. Japanese inflation has been between 2 per cent and 3 per cent for a number of years. 'By contrast the market leaders in the UK, which are also necessarily the price leaders, have in many years raised prices by more than the rate of inflation. 'This has inevitably caused the general pricing level in the two markets to widen.'</p>

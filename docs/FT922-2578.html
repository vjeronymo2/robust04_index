			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Watchdog moves to protect 40 rivers: Regional water companies are angered by NRA moves to restrict access to supplies WATER companies in England and Wales were angered yesterday by a warning from the National Rivers Authority that they might be banned from taking water from some rivers if they failed to make voluntary reductions. The move could herald a series of confrontations between the authority, the water industry's environmental regulator, and the companies over the scale of water abstraction. If a ban is enforced the companies are likely to demand compensation for loss of supplies, which could amount to millions of pounds. The threat of a ban follows frustration in the authority at the lack of voluntary agreements to curb water abstraction from 40 rivers where low levels of flow have been made worse by the drought. The authority's main target - because of the chronic shortage of water in parts of the River Darent in Kent - is Thames Water, the biggest of the 10 companies privatised 2 1/2 years ago. Thames has been given until September 1 to commit itself to varying its abstraction licences for the Darent to 70 per cent of the 90m litres a day it is now allowed to take. The authority plans to take action itself to vary the licences if Thames fails to do so. Thames Water's Utilities offshoot said it was surprised by criticism of its strategy over the Darent, as for the past two years it had voluntarily reduced its abstraction to 70 per cent of its entitlement. 'We have a very strong commitment to the river and the environment, but we also have a legal commitment to our customers,' it said. As part of a continuing programme, the authority is seeking agreement by April next year for Thames to introduce a further reduction of 15m litres a day from the Darent by the end of 1995. This in turn could lead to even greater reductions later to restore the river's flow. Lord Crickhowell, chairman of the authority, said at a London news conference: 'I want no shilly-shallying over this issue. I want a commitment from Thames that they will make a definitive effort to reduce abstraction . . . if agreement on timetables cannot be reached, the NRA will act unilaterally to vary abstraction licences downwards or revoke them completely.' Lord Crickhowell said that in setting timetables account would be taken of the need for the companies to find alternative supplies. One possibility would be for companies to take firmer action against leakages, which on average involved 25 per cent of supplies. Negotiations are under way between the authority and other water companies, including Wessex and Southern, to seek agreement on voluntarily reducing abstractions from low-level rivers. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, welcomed the authority's crackdown. It added that the government should intervene to prevent financial difficulties for the authority if water companies had to be paid large sums in compensation for loss of supplies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has told the  government to introduce in parliament by September 15 draft laws  to lower the number of taxes, decrease the level of profit tax  and VAT by 10 to 20 percent and also the level of taxes related  to the rate of pay and production. At the same time, his decree  of May 23 raises the level of tax for individuals as well as for  the property of individuals and corporate entities.    The decree, which aims to limit inflationary processes,  reduces the number of goods eligible for a special 13 percent  VAT rate (against the usual 23 percent).    From June 1 the rate of payment to the Social Security fund  will be lowered from 5.4 to 3.4 percent of the sum of charged  wages.    The government is also to adopt a resolution within the next  two months concerning the possibilities of accelerated  amortization of capital funds in highly technical branches of  industry.    The decree lays down that production enterprises, the  foreign  share of whose capital is no less than 30 percent or 10 million  dollars and which were registered after January 1, 1994, will  not have to pay profit tax for the next two years. Profit tax  in Russia is up to 38 percent.</p>

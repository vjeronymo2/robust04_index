			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Japan will not change its  policy on the planned tax reform in line with a reportedly  renewed U.S. demand for freezing a sales tax hike until the  economy recovers, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Wednesday  [15 June].    Fujii, speaking at a press meeting, was referring to a  report  that U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen made a renewed  request in a letter.    "The basic direction remains unchanged," he said, noting the  government and ruling parties are at the "final stage" of  deciding on the tax reform.    Japan promised in its March market-opening package to detail  the tax reform by the end of this month and make it into law by  the year-end. This came after criticism from the U.S. over a  6.2 trillion yen tax cut adopted in February for the current  year only.    The aim is to implement multi-year tax cuts, and a  consumption tax hike not only to offset the tax cuts but also to  secure funds for welfare in the aging society in the 21st  century.    Fujii neither denied nor confirmed the existence of the  letter, saying he is in constant contact with the U.S. side to  exchange views.    The two sides have agreed not to comment on these regular  talks, he added.    According to the letter reported by a Japanese daily,  Bentsen  called for greater income tax cuts and freezing of the tax hike  until the Japanese economy recovers clearly.    The letter dated Tuesday came on the same day as the  government's tax commission prepared the basis of its report due  out next week.    The report will include a three-year gap between tax cuts  and  hike, and a net revenue surplus.    Pressed by reporters about the prospect of winning U.S.  support, Fujii refrained from commenting directly.    The tax issue is a domestic issue but Japan is working on it  from the standpoint of contributing to the world economy as well  to coordinate policy with other leading nations, he said.    "There are some compromises involved, and we must make  efforts to win understanding," he said.</p>

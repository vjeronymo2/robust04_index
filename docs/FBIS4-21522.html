			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK Department of the Environment: </F> "Proposals for a New Policy Framework for Control of Hazardous  Chemicals."]    [Text] Environment Minister Robert Atkins today welcomed  the publication of a discussion document outlining proposals for  a new framework for the assessment and control of hazardous  substances.    Announcing the publication of the Discussion Paper, Mr.  Atkins said:    "The paper seeks to develop a transparent and coherent  strategy for identifying and controlling chemicals which are  particularly dangerous to the environment, especially those  released from diffuse sources. The proposed strategy is based on  internationally accepted criteria for assessing the risks to  human health and the environment and advocates a measured  approach to the control of these risks.    "Our objective is to build upon existing programmes and  measures, so that we remain consistent in our approach and  minimise the burdens on the public sector and industry.    "The proposed new policy framework is a response to the  challenges the Government established in the UK Strategy for  Sustainable Development. It also aims to meet two objectives of  the Governments deregulation initiative - greater clarity in the  operation of environmental regulations and the consideration of  viable alternatives to regulatory action which maintain existing  environmental standards."  <H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>   The Discussion Paper - Reducing Emissions of Hazardous  Chemicals to the Environment was released today for public  consultation. Its publication fulfils a commitment made in the  Sustainable Development Strategy.    The paper describes a new policy framework for reducing  diffuse emissions of hazardous substances to the environment. It  consists of a discussion paper supported by several annexes.    The discussion paper considers components of the proposed  new  framework in a stepwise manner beginning with criteria for  identifying environmentally hazardous chemicals. The proposed  criteria are intended to be consistent with those used in other  UK substance based policy initiatives. This is followed by an  outline of the principles of Risk Assessment; a vital component  of the proposed strategy designed to inform decisions as to the  extent of risk posed by a particular chemical and the degree of  control necessary to manage the risk effectively. The paper then  discusses a proposed hierarchy of measures to control chemical  risks. Alternatives to regulatory control are considered  including voluntary agreements with industry and economic  instruments.    The supporting annexes provide detailed information on  typical point and diffuse sources of emissions of hazardous  chemicals and many of the existing control measures including  international initiatives such as the Montreal Protocol and the  Oslo and Paris Conventions. Technical guidance on priority  setting and risk characterisation for hazardous chemicals is  also provided.    The Government is seeking responses to the proposed strategy  and related issues by the 31st May 1994.

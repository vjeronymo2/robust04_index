Rong welcomed the delegation led by Muradov visiting China.    Muradov said his delegation were impressed deeply during  their five-day trip.    He believed that China had made impressive progress in the  fields of education, natural science and the humanities.    Rong said China and Turkmenistan, with their parliaments,  enjoy good relations. The 1992 tour of China by Turkmenistan  President Saparmurad Niyazov had remarkably promoted the  development of Sino-Turkmenistan relations.    He said the visits of high-level leaders between the two  countries were important for the expansion of bilateral  relations.    He expressed the hope that leaders of the two countries will  increase their contacts in order to enhance the friendly  cooperation concerning politics, economy, culture and other  aspects.    Rong extended greetings from President Jiang Zemin and  himself to President Niyazov through Muradov.    He also briefed the visitors on China's economic development  and reform of the education system.    Muradov said that Turkmenistan is now on the independent  path  of development while learning from foreign experience. So his  delegation visited the economic development zone and bonded zone  in Tianjin, an important industrial city in north China.    He hoped bilateral relations in the fields of economy,  science, culture and education will be developed through more  exchanges between the two countries' leaders.    Also taking part in the meeting was Meng Liankun, chairman  of  the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee of the National  People's Congress (NPC).    Muradov arrived here February 20 for a visit to China as  guest of Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.    Muradov and his party are scheduled to leave for home this  afternoon.</p>

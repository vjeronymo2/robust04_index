			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Increase in prison places given priority - Home Office Home Secretary Michael Howard announced that funding for Home Office services next year will be nearly Pounds 6.3bn. The funding allows for: maintaining the current level of policing extra prison places; new measures to combat juvenile crime. Mr Howard said: 'Home Office planned expenditure fully reflects the government's priorities of maintaining law and order and tackling crime. Alongside the very considerable public investment which we are providing for over the next three years, we expect significant private capital investment in prisons and other areas. 'Spending on the police service in England and Wales next year will increase by more than 4 per cent over this year's provision. This will sustain current levels of policing and provide for the organisational reforms announced in the recent White Paper as well as the changes in pay, conditions and rank structure which I announced in response to the Sheehy report. 'For the prison service, priority will be given to increasing the number of prison places in order to accommodate the offenders we expect to be sentenced to custody. Over 2,000 extra places will be provided by 1996-97 through building houseblocks at existing prisons. 'Alongside this direct public investment, we expect substantial private capital investment in the prison service over the next three years. This will go towards the six new prisons which will be financed, built and run by the private sector. 'The government will also take steps to tackle juvenile crime. Just over Pounds 100m of public expenditure will be provided over the next three years for secure training centres and similar facilities for the hard core of persistent juvenile offenders. In addition, we shall invite private capital investment in the construction of the secure training centres. 'The government's commitment to victims remains strong. For example, we are increasing the funding for victim support next year to over Pounds 10m, an increase of nearly 15 per cent in real terms over this year's provision. This would enable victim support to provide support to witnesses at every crown court in England and Wales. 'I have reduced provision for Home Office running costs to reflect greater efficiency. This includes a 10 per cent reduction per annum in the provision for central administration. 'I have been able to maintain probation spending at broadly its present level, but previous planned increases cannot now go ahead. This will require increased efficiency in all aspects of community sentences, including the closure of some bail and offender hostels which are not being adequately used. But we still plan to provide about 100 additional places in areas where this is justified to meet the requirements of the courts. 'Home Office spending will meet our key priorities, involve private as well as public investment, and be consistent with the government's objective of containing public expenditure. Within the constraints of the current public spending round, with particular emphasis on helping to reduce government borrowing to a level that the country can afford, the government has continued to give high priority to law and order.'</p>

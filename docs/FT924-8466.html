			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Exporters face a taxing time: Charles Batchelor on what new VAT rules may cost businesses THE MOVE to new European Community rules for collecting Value Added Tax will cost UK companies Pounds 100m, according to Customs and Excise. The publication yesterday by Customs of a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the far-reaching changes, which take effect in just seven weeks time with the launch of the single European Market, has initially at least done little to allay the fears. Business organisations have yet to see the basis for the calculations but the initial response was one of extreme caution. The 34-page analysis of the impact of the VAT changes estimates that the cost to business of staff training and 'familiarisation' with the new system will be Pounds 37m. The cost to the 30,000 companies which will have to provide more detailed trade statistics of adapting information and computer systems will be nearly Pounds 50m. Against these are set annual savings from the elimination of export and import documents of Pounds 175m, although the Pounds 40m annual running cost of the new VAT system reduces the net annual saving to Pounds 135m. The changeover also means that between 7m and 8m import and export documents will no longer need to be filled in, delays in customs clearance will be ended and expensive bank guarantees to cover deferred VAT payments will no longer be necessary. Customs and Excise acknowledges that changeover costs for the largest companies - including the 1 per cent of companies which account for two thirds of all UK international trade - will be considerable. Some have quoted costs of up to Pounds 1m although Customs believes they will be able to offset advantages they obtain from upgrading their information management systems. It also says it is aware of the difficulties facing small businesses but identifying their costs, including the opportunity costs, is not always easy. Many small businesses do not engage in international trade so they will not be affected, but those that do may be less happy with the calculations. Morrisflex, a Northamptonshire-based manufacturer of rotary tools and finishing machinery which exports a third of its Pounds 3m turnover, remains unconvinced of the benefits. The company makes most of its shipments by parcel post and air freight and so does not expect to make savings on the removal of border formalities. The extent of its export activity means it will have to fill in the more detailed monthly trade statistics, but obtaining the VAT numbers of overseas customers and putting them on its computer files is proving time-consuming, says Mr Jeremy Theaker, the company secretary. KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, said it had calculated the changeover costs to business at Pounds 200m. At first sight Customs' changeover estimate of Pounds 100m would appear only to cover the cost of employing outside consultants and of updating computer equipment without taking into account internal resource costs. 'We are extremely sceptical of the figure of Pounds 135m for annual savings, given the detailed trade information companies will be required to provide,' says Mr George Michie, partner responsible for the VAT changes. 'The more we dig the higher the costs appear to be. It will only be when the system is up and running that we see the true costs.' In spite of the uncertainty and confusion at many UK businesses, Customs believes they are better informed than many of their Continental counterparts. Business people from the Netherlands have attended the seminars Customs runs in the UK while requests have also come in from continental Europe for copies of its Single Market Report, which regularly updates progress on the VAT rules. Customs authorities throughout the European Community have had to cope with delays in the publication of EC directives to cover the tax changes. Brussels has only just issued a final directive tidying up loose ends. Legislation in other countries is even less advanced. Greece has decided to push through all legislation and start an information campaign in the six weeks before the January deadline. If the proposed VAT changes look complicated now they could have been far worse, according to senior customs officials. The governments of many other countries have been slow to acknowledge the concerns of business, they said. It may be poor consolation to businesses struggling to adapt to the new VAT regime but proposals for a second changeover in 1997 seem increasingly in doubt. If the British government has its way there will be no second round of changes to a full-blooded 'origin' system, where all goods are taxed at the factory gate. That is a welcome but distant relief to those companies struggling to cope with what is already the biggest change in nearly 20 years in the taxation of business.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Bonn politicians alarmed at poll debate in France THE GERMAN political establishment has followed the Maastricht referendum debate in neighbouring France with no little surprise and alarm. But the German citizen in the street, if following the debate at all, seems to be decidedly unruffled. 'If the French vote No in the referendum, it would devastate the political leadership, and probably delight most of the German people,' according to one senior European diplomat. 'It would shake the foundations of the Franco-German alliance at government level and simultaneously reinforce the relationship at the grass roots.' Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision to intervene in the marathon French television debate on Thursday night, and urgently to plead for a Yes vote, was a clear demonstration of just how important a positive outcome is for Bonn. 'If Mitterrand wins, then Kohl wins - and the opposite is also true,' said a senior government official. 'The chancellor has invested a lot of credibility in Maastricht. We were worried, but now less so. We assume the outcome will be positive.' Until the past few days, the German public had paid little attention to the French debate, preoccupied with its own problems of unification, immigration, and the bloody battles in former Yugoslavia. The emergence of Germany itself as an issue in the referendum campaign has started to change that, along with the growing realisation that a Yes vote is no longer a foregone conclusion. Yet there appears to be no contingency planning in Bonn for a French No: 'It is an outcome too ghastly to contemplate,' said one German official. The political establishment in Bonn - the leaders of all the main political parties - is painfully aware that its dedication to European integration is increasingly out of step with popular opinion. The polls have shown a steady and relatively rapid switch in sentiment against further integration, particularly by way of hostility to the exchange of the D-Mark for a single European currency and doubt about the benefits of a frontier-free European market. Dr Dieter Roth of the Mannheim-based Wahlen institute for opinion research says that, in July, there was still a majority in favour of Maastricht in Germany, by 50-34 per cent. He expects a new poll in two weeks to show a far narrower margin. 'We can say very clearly that, since Maastricht, the German enthusiasm for Europe has declined,' he says. 'In particular, a large majority of the population does not want the D-Mark to be replaced by the Ecu. In June, about 70 per cent were opposed to that.' That is a process independent of the French debate. What has upset the commentators is the emergence of the 'German bogey' as an argument on both sides of the French divide. The Yes campaigners say Maastricht is essential to bind the German giant; the No campaigners say European union will simply make France a German lapdog. 'We are a bit concerned about some of the arguments being used,' a German political observer says. 'If they go on talking about German demons, it could have a negative effect here. But, so far, the damage is limited. We have always known that this sort of thinking played a role among the French elite. And they have to convince chauvinist French voters.' The German government still faces a tough ratification of the EC treaty in the two houses of parliament. A deal has been agreed to give the Bundesrat, the upper house, more power to oversee EC legislation and take part in negotiations. Now the Bundestag, the directly elected lower house, is looking for similar powers. Perhaps most problematic of all, both chambers are demanding the right to hold a 'vote of approval' before the EC can pass from stage two to the final stage three of economic and monetary union. That is a concession the government is desperate not to make, for it could call into question the whole European Monetary Union process.</p>

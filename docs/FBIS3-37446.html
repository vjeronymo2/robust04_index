According to preliminary information, between 8 and 12,000  inhabitants remain. They are in an extremely difficult  situation, hiding in tea plantations in the daytime and  gathering in groups of 10 to 15 people at night in order to flee  via mountainous paths to safety.    Mr. Kolbaia called for the immediate arrival in Gali Rayon  of  international experts and observers to establish supervision in  the Gali zone. In order to save the remaining population, it is  necessary to set up a life corridor through which people could  be evacuated.    The Abkhazian separatists and their hirelings are taking  people prisoner, especially young people of Georgian  nationality, whom they drive to Tkvarcheli and Ochamchire. The  criminals commit their atrocities with such ingenuity that no  traces are left. They bring both those who are alive and dead  together into houses and set them on fire, turning residential  quarters into ashes. Every day there are executions and acts of  violence. Innocent people are being burned to death.</p>

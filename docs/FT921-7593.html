			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Appointments: RPC chairman RPC Containers, the rigid plastics packaging company that has had four different owners in as many years, has chosen Lindsay Mackinlay, an ex-Rowntree man, as its non-executive chairman. He takes over from Charles Nicholson, a director at CINVen, RPC's lead institutional investor. Mackinlay, now 55, has made something of a career of assuming non-executive roles since he stepped down as finance director of Rowntree when Nestle acquired the confectioner in 1989. With current directorships including Argos, Steetley, Henry Barrett Group, and Bradford and Bingley Building Society, Mackinlay had turned down various other offers before accepting the RPC assignment, says chief executive Ron Marsh; he believes Mackinlay may have been attracted by a management buyout company that has easily surpassed its first year targets despite depressed conditions in many of its markets. Mackinlay's main contribution to the board will be his financial expertise and City contacts; the talents of the rest of the executive directors, originally managers from the plastics packaging division of Reed International, lie in other directions. If RPC decides to go for a stock market flotation - rather than selling out, as Reedpack did within two years to a Swedish group, a buyout from which formed RPC - he will be particularly useful. ***** Marietta Johns, 50, has become head of sales at Acuma, the fee-based personal financial planning subsidiary of the American Express Group in the UK, with the title of senior vice-president. The appointment makes her the only woman head of sales of a big UK life company. She heads a salesforce of 450, recruited since February 1990 and has a mandate to build it up to 700 by the end of 1992. Johns, an American with three children, progressed from financial planner at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis to senior vice-president within three years. She had earlier spent a decade as a music teacher.</p>

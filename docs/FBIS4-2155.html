			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Main Points of `Chang Jiang Strategy' Plan </F> Revealed by State Planning Commission"]    [Text] This plan sets detailed future development goals  for various regions along the Chang Jiang.    According to the plan, within the next six years from now to  the end of this century, the state will build a number of key  projects in regions along the Chang Jiang, and the scale of  investment will be huge.    According to sources, a relevant department in the State  Planning Commission has formulated the main contents of the  "Chang Jiang strategy" and concrete procedures for implementing  the strategy, and they include:    With Shanghai's Pudong as the driving force, establish an  economic sphere which includes eight regions and 28 large and  medium cities from Chongqing to the Chang Jiang estuary.    Expedite construction of infrastructure and key projects in  these regions. There will be over 100 core projects each of  which will entail investment exceeding 200 million yuan,  including Shanghai's 1-million-tonne Jinshan oil refinery  project, Pudong International Airport, Shanghai's project to  produce 300,000 cars each year, Shanghai's acetic acid project,  the second phase of the Qinshan Power Plant, the Panzhihua  nonferrous metals project, the Beijing- Shanghai Expressway,  Hubei's project to produce 300,000 cars a year, and the  world-famous Three Gorges Project.    Expedite the utilization of foreign funds by the regions  along the Chang Jiang and broaden the scope of the utilization  of foreign funds. Except for the state's first-grade  communications facilities, which are not open up to the outside  world, in principle, other areas may utilize foreign funds,  which must not be used however to construct pornographic or  gambling businesses. It is estimated that the utilization of  foreign funds could reach $10 billion.    Open up domestic markets to foreign businessmen and,  according to the prevailing international practice, that is  through the BOT [build-operate-transfer] [preceding three  letters in Roman script] style, utilize foreign funds. Foreign  businessmen will be responsible for the investment,  construction, and operations for 15 years, and products produced  by foreign-invested enterprises can be purchased by the Chinese  side.    Abolish "restricted areas." On the premise of not hurting  the state's interests, foreign businessmen will be allowed to  invest in trades which they deem appropriate.</p>

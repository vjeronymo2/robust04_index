			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Xu Furui (6079 4395 3843) and Wu Ping (0702 </F> 1627)]    [Text] Stockholm, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  [CPPCC] National Committee who is visiting Sweden, met with  Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt at the prime minister's  residence this morning. The two leaders pledged to exert joint  efforts to promote bilateral relations to a new level.    Li Ruihuan said: China and Sweden have been in contact for  several hundred years. Under extreme difficult conditions, our  forefathers overcame obstacles and dangers in opening up trade  routes between our two countries. After the founding of New  China, Sweden was the first Western nation to establish  diplomatic relations with the PRC. In the past several decades,  the relations between the two countries have been generally  good. Through common efforts, the two countries have  continually expanded exchanges and cooperation in the political,  economic and trade, science and technology, and cultural fields.  With a profound sense of responsibility toward history, the  leaders of the two countries shall cherish still more our  hard-earned friendship and continue to expand the bilateral  relations based on the efforts of our forefathers and leaders of  the older generation.    Li Ruihuan said: China and Sweden are far away from each  other, and have no conflict of basic interests. On the  contrary, there are broad prospects for economic cooperation  because the economies of the two countries are mutually  complementary. China is carrying out large scale economic  development and there is much in Sweden's advanced technology  and management experience that we can make use of. During my  visit to your country, I have personally witnessed Swedish  entrepreneurs' strong desire to strengthen cooperation with  China. There is great potential for bilateral cooperation. Our  two countries should exert joint efforts to push bilateral  cooperation to a new stage, which corresponds with the common  interests and aspirations of the two peoples.    Li Ruihuan said: Differences of views between countries are  natural. Many problems can be resolved properly with the  passage of time, and in the spirit of mutual respect, equality  and mutual benefit; of seeking common grounds while reserving  differences; and of common development. He added: We should  work together to push bilateral relations to a new level bearing  in mind the fundamental interests of the two peoples and  long-range interests of the two countries.    Bildt spoke highly of China's great economic achievements  since the implementation of the reform and open policy, saying  that it is important not only for China but also for Eastern  Asia and the world economy. The Swedish prime minister said  that bilateral relations between China and Sweden have developed  rapidly in recent years. He hoped that bilateral relations will  further develop. He also expressed Swedish support for China's  reentry into the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade.</p>

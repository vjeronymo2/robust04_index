			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREASURE HUNTING: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> GARDEN ROOMS  </P> <P> ITALY'S LUSH "GARDEN rooms," copied by the 16th-Century British, brought  year-round summer to drafty castles. Their popularity grew for 300 years, and  even the humblest Victorian cottages had conservatories filled with ferns and  flowers. During the Depression, America's sun parlors -- costly to cool and  heat -- were boarded up. Ironically, the 1970s energy crisis redeemed them. New  glass windows were leakproof, airtight, insulated, glare-free, energy  efficient. Because solar-heated indoor gardens increase property values and  look terrific, sales have been booming ever since.  </P> <P> England's prestigious, cedar-framed, fully vented and guttered Amdega  Conservatories in octagonal and gabled Victorian styles are now available  locally with high-vaulting, circle-top or Gothic-arch windows, leaded panes,  double doors, sunscreen blinds, ornamental crests and finials. Four Seasons  Greenhouses makes bowed Georgian enclosures, Tudor arches and adjustable-pitch  sun rooms but is best known for curving glass atriums ranging in size from  bump-out herb-garden windows to block-long storefronts. Special features:  environmental heat-control glass, heating/cooling fans, self-cleaning interior  and exterior drainage, power-track shades and half-round sashes.  </P> <P> C-Thru Industries' curved glass and acrylic atriums fit beneath most eaves  without roof remodeling. Patented extras include continuous electric-socket  baseboards, screened sliding windows and adjustable roof shutters.  </P> <P> California Solariums come in many styles and colors, single and double heights,  with varied venting, draining, lighting and shading systems, adjustable  barrel-vault frames and sun-screen films. Solarium Systems builds greenhouse  additions and ultramodern free-standing glass gazebos.  </P> <P>  For Amdega Conservatories, contact Amdega Pacific in Santa Ana. For other  Victorian styles, contact Hawkes &amp; Son Builders in Ventura. Thomas L.  Hooper French Doors and Custom Windows in Santa Ana will build to order.

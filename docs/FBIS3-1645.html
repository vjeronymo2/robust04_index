Statistics show that last year farmers engaged in breeding  of  aquatic products achieved a per capita net income of 1,100 yuan,  300 yuan more than the corresponding figure for those farmers  not engaged in cultivation of such products.    Hubei, known to have a thousand lakes and dubbed as a "land  of fish and rice", has a water area of 1.33 million hectares, of  which more than 400,000 hectares have been used for breeding of  aquatic products of various kinds.    According to Che Guangbiao, director of the Hubei Provincial  Bureau of Aquatic Products, over the past 15 years output of  aquatic products of the province has increased by 50,000 tons a  year.    The output of aquatic products for 1993 surpassed one  million  tons, and the per capita availability of fresh water fish  reached 16 kg in the province, ranking second in the country.    Local officials attributed the quick development of the  breeding sector to reform in circulation of aquatic products and  the application of scientific methods in their cultivation.    Thanks to the reform in circulation of aquatic products,  traders representing different ownerships have all moved in to  engage in the aquatic products trade, effectively solving the  difficulty for growers of aquatic products in selling their  products.    A dozen scientific research institutes in Wuhan City, the  provincial capital, boast more than 2,000 senior experts of  aquatic products.    Besides giving technical guidance to local farmers,  researchers with these institutes have developed bait for young  salmon and the artificial propagation of river crabs, as well as  introduced approximately 40 new varieties of fish from abroad.  The efforts have brought about great economic returns.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town--The building of about 156 much-needed new  schools for black children and extension and renovation work on  hundreds of hospitals, clinics, schools and roads for this year  are to be suspended so as to pay for the election. The  government has instructed that all state budgets this year  should be cut by 4 percent to recover election costs, BEELD  discovered yesterday.    The total election costs that have to be recovered,  including  the expenses of the Independent Electoral Commission and DEBI  [Democratic Electoral Broadcasting Initiative], amount to about  2 billion rands.    As part of the state cutbacks, which affect all the regions  and state departments in the country, state subsidies to all  universities and technikons have been trimmed for the current  financial year.    State and provincial budgets for among others education,  health services and roads have also been trimmed down.  Government orders for these cutbacks come in the wake of  announcements by the government that a thousand additional posts  for civil servants are to be created as soon as possible.    These cutbacks also occur at a time when cutbacks in the  Cape  health services are unavoidable and educational services  countrywide are experiencing lean times. These cutbacks are  unique and are the sacrifices which have to be made for South  Africa's first democratic election, Western Cape MEC [Member of  the Executive Council] for finance, Mr. Kobus Meiring, confirmed.    By virtue of the fact that these cutbacks are unique, mainly  capital expenditures and maintenance costs will have to be  trimmed dramatically.    The Western Cape provincial authority will, like other  provincial and central authorities, do everything in its power  not to trim any personnel posts due to the cutbacks, Mr. Meiring  said.    The country's total education budget has been cut back by  about 200 million rands, Western Cape MEC for education Martha  Olckers said in response to a question. Most of the money is  being deducted from mainly white education. However, 41 million  rands also has to be taken from schools in colored residential  areas.    Although everything possible is being done countrywide to  cut  the budget for black education as little as possible, the  cutback will affect the building of about 156 new schools in  black townships. The building of these new schools has been  postponed from last year to this year due to a budgetary  shortfall.    There are indications that renovation and extension work to  schools and classrooms of most schools will have to be put on  hold.</p>

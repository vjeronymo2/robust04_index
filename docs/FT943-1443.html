			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Inflation fears spark surge in commodity prices Commodity prices surged again yesterday as investors continued to buy precious and base metals as a hedge against the risk of inflation. Gold closed in London at a 13- month high of Dollars 396 an ounce, with traders reporting buying interest from US institutions. Mr Andrew Smith, metals analyst at UBS, said the substantial increase in speculative interest in gold was similar to the buying spree when hedge fund investor Mr George Soros announced his gold purchases in 1993. Silver closed at Dollars 5.71 an ounce, up 6 per cent on the week and close to its high for the year. Base metal prices also rose, with copper and aluminium recording their highest closing prices since 1992 and 1991 respectively. The Economist commodity price index is up 41.8 per cent over the year, in dollar terms. Higher commodity prices increase industry's costs, although competitive pressures mean they cannot necessarily be passed on to consumers in the form of higher retail prices. Fears that inflation is on the rise have increased this year in the face of strong economic growth in the US and recovery in Europe. Bond yields have risen to reflect the perceived inflationary risks and several countries have raised interest rates in pre-emptive strikes against inflation. Equity prices have also been affected by inflationary fears. Earlier this week, the Dow Jones industrial average suffered its biggest one-day fall, in response to poor trade figures and market fears about US inflation. Stock markets were generally quiet yesterday. The FT-SE 100 index closed up 7 at 3,028.2 while the Dow Jones industrial average ended 5.38 lower at 3,831.75.

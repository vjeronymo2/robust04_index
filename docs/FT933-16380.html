			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: How to be a Bond-style survivor - Lucia van der Post visits a shop which can supply peace of mind THE PARANOID will find encouragement by visiting Spycatcher, a shop in London which specialises in 'personal protection and surveillance systems.' There are devices to pander to eternal worriers andgoodies to soothe away their fears. If, for example, you are worried about becoming ill in some country where hygiene is not all it ought to be, take your own kit. Choose from an Aids to Survival Kit (Pounds 26), which has sterile needles bandages, gauzes, and sutures, a Toothcare kit (Pounds 15), and an all-purpose Survival Kit (Pounds 33) which has a combination of medicaments and items including: sutures, salt tablets, potassium permanganate, thread and needles 'for mending clothes, making shelters or stitching wounds', razor blades, lip salve and a wire-saw. If your worries centre more on what is happening back home while you are enjoying yourself there is a panoply of anti-theft devices which could buy you peace of mind. Simple and inexpensive are the series of cans or containers which look exactly like ordinary household products but are in fact small 'diversion' safes. Ranging in price from Pounds 25 to Pounds 30 you could choose from cans of Diet-Coke or Heinz Beanz, tins of furniture wax or tubes of after-shave and shaving cream. For those fearful for their personal safety while abroad there are lots of small personal alarms, a 'touch-me-not' door alarm (Pounds 40, hang it on the inside of your door and as soon as it is touched it lets out a piercing noise), battery-operated portable smoke alarms and a wallet-sized smoke-hood which gives you two or three minutes protection from smoke if a fire breaks out. If you are the sort who cannot bear to be out of touch with the office maybe you should invest in the smallest fax in the world - not cheap at Pounds 1,000, but to the persistent deal-maker it could be worth it. It measures about 6 in by 4 in by  1/2 in - you type in your message, plug it into a telephone, press transmit and off it goes. Then there is a series of small tape recorders specially modified for long play, starting at Pounds 300. Tiniest of all is the credit-card sized version that will record for six hours, Pounds 950. Spycatcher is also the place for the latest in 'toys for the boys' - all sorts of wonderful gadgets for the would-be James Bond set such as spy cameras which double as lighters, briefcases with cameras and pens that are also tape recorders. Finally, some readers might like to know that there is now a portable Muslim Prayer Clock, though at Pounds 2,500 it is clearly only for those who are rich as well as devout. You programme in the location (London, Delhi, Sydney, wherever), the date and the time and the clock (with the help of a gyro compass) will point the way to Mecca. From then on it calls you to prayer at the appointed hours and at the same time chants the prayers. Spycatcher is at 25a Lowndes Street, London SW1. Tel: 071-245 9445. There is no catalogue but any of the items mentioned can be sent by mail.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Dealing in Death"] </F>   [Text] In their blind passion to make money, the Americans  seem to have forgotten all norms of decency. They can go to any  extent. The recent export of contaminated fertilisers to  Bangladesh was not just an isolated incident or a mistake. The  shipment which was returned by the Bangladesh authorities, was  sent by a company quite notorious for such acts of covertly  flouting international rules. It is not only the company which  is responsible for exporting the deadly cargo to Bangladesh but  the US government is also to be blamed. The role of the United  States government in exporting poisonous food stuff and  fertilisers can lead the people of this part of the world to  believe that Washington deals in only death either by arms or by  having the people use poisonous materials.    It is not a secret that food stuff and fertilisers are  subjected to thorough checking before they are allowed to be  marketed in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration  of the United States boasts of very high standards in making  sure that only those goods reach the shelf which are fit for  human consumption. But the same standards are not applied to  the goods which are destined for a Third World country. In fact  every thing that is considered unfit for an American to consumer  is allowed to be exported to Asia, Africa and South America.  Does not this amount to killing innocent and poor people of  these countries? What else can this lead us to believe?  Killing seems to be part of the American way of life.    It is however astonishing that rulers in these parts of the  world always remain oblivious to such criminal acts of the West.  The US is not the only country engaged in this dirty business of  exporting the rejected goods to the Third World. Recently a  Danish company sold an environmentally hazardous plant to a  Pakistan firm. But no action was taken by the Pakistani  government. Technology is very important for development, but  we must not allow the technological advanced countries to play  havoc with our lives. These companies need to be blacklisted for  any business with Pakistan. The government must remain alive to  its duty of protecting the lives of its citizens. We cannot  blame the Danish company for selling us a plant processing  chlorine which has been built according to environmental  specifications of the 1950s. It is we who are at fault. While  buying the machinery the Pakistani firm have saved some money  but it has certainly put many Pakistani lives at risk. It is  the duty of the government to look into the matter and have the  firm close down this factory. Such companies must also be  punished for violating the environmental protection regulations.    The government of Pakistan needs to learn from the erstwhile  East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, which promptly checked the  consignment of contaminated fertiliser and sent it back to its  country of origin. That is what the government of Pakistan must  do.</p>

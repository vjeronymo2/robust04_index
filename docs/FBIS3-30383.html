Here is a report:    [Correspondent] Continuing last evening's talks with the  high-ranking NATO delegation and after stressing that Albania  actively supports the Partnership for Peace [PFP] plan, Defense  Minister Safet Zhulali referred to the letter by President Sali  Berisha to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner in which he  officially expressed Albania's desire to participate in the PFP  and develop extensive cooperation within NATO. The letter also  reads: We are ready to work with the political and military  structures of the alliance, participate in joint military  maneuvers and consultations on defense and security, and take  advantage of other possibilities offered by the PFP. We are  willing to offer a company, as well as our naval and air bases  for the PFP purposes. Albania is the first ex-communist country  to have requested NATO membership. Albania's goal continues to  be membership in the North Atlantic Alliance.    The talks concluded that Albania will be prepared to draft  the position paper and sign the PFP agreement in Brussels. The  meeting also defined those areas in which Albania commits itself  to participate, such as joint exercises, peacekeeping and  humanitarian operations, and the creation of air and port  facilities. They also agreed that Albania will send its own  permanent representatives to the relevant NATO institutions.    NATO Assistant Secretary General Gebhardt von Moltke stated  that he was impressed by Albania's performance and its readiness  to participate in the PFP. We will help to complete the position  paper and everything else so as to ensure Albania's active  participation in the PFP plan. He asked our defense minister to  convey greetings to President Sali Berisha from NATO Secretary  General Manfred Woerner, as well as his high regard and best  wishes on the cordial message and Albania's position considering  PFP participation.    The high-ranking NATO delegation left our country this  morning. Defense Minister Safet Zhulali, Foreign Ministry  representatives, and high-ranking Defense Ministry cadres were  at Rinas Airport to see the delegation off. Greek Ambassador in  Tirana Khristodhoulos Tsalikis was also present.</p>

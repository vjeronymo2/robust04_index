			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel Focus (France): Filling Van Gogh's boots - Christian Tyler introduces a special feature on the delights of cross-Channel holidays YOU HAVE it or you don't. That is what they always tell you. The trouble with this brutal classification is that those of us who don't have it - the majority, I suppose - never think to question a verdict apparently handed down by our genetic code. So, it was only through the accident of being married to someone who does have it that I found myself last year poised foolishly in front of an easel, palette in one hand, a clutch of brushes in the other, in a remote mountain valley in the south of France. The scene is engraved in the memory. Above me, the branches of a thorn tree provided some shade. On one side, the stream clattered down its rocky bed to form a pool among boulders streaked with rusty whorls but as smooth and rounded as the back of a bathing elephant. On the other side, grasshoppers skipped about in a field of bracken and violet butterflies zig-zagged over the water. Each evening, the goat lady came, walking her chestnut-coloured flock over the stepping stones to the sound of a clonking bell. For two days, I stared at that rock pool until I knew every line and contour, every fold and pocket. A painting is never finished, a famous artist is said to have remarked, only abandoned. The thing on my easel looked dreadful and was getting worse. So, I abandoned it. If you have not picked up a paint brush since the age of 10, you will feel as helpless as a child, stubborn and petulant when things go wrong and pathetically dependent on praise and encouragement. You have to learn to forget yourself, forget what you know about the world, and look. For the world is a different, more concentrated place when you are trying to paint it. It is no longer a collection of familiar objects understood by you but a pattern of shapes and shades which have no purpose other than to defy your efforts to describe them. Learning to paint is the kind of challenge best attempted, it seems to me, in some remote place where there are real painters around to help and sympathise but no other holiday-makers to peer over your shoulder in silent mockery. On the first day, I was given a large sheet of paper, a stick of charcoal and two erasers. I had to cover the paper in black, then use the erasers to bring the object (in this case, a cane chair) out of the blackness. It was a back-to-front, inside-out way of drawing, and I cannot draw. But it worked. A day or so later, I was sitting in an apple orchard with a box of gouache (more opaque than watercolours and, thus, easier to manage). That sort of worked, too. So, I demanded to be allowed out with real oil paints - more intimidating but also more liberating - and, after two failed attempts at landscape, produced an unfinished painting, life-size, of a pair of derelict boots (move over, van Gogh) of which I am still desperately proud. Every year, the number of advertised painting holidays in France or Italy seems to double. Some are organised very well, but most charge more than a novice might be willing to risk for a fortnight in a rural retreat. Our choice was basic, informal and - apart from the cost of getting there - cheap. The house, in the hamlet of Randavel, is a former silk-worm farm, the size and thickness of a small fortress and typical of that part of France, which the two owners - one of them a painter who teaches at a London art school - are restoring by slow degrees. Living space is at ground level and studios have been created above in the huge, double-storey chambers in which the silk-worms once were reared. We were fed excellently by the owner herself and sat up every night with her, her visiting art students and her Irish-Breton teacher friend from the village, drinking large quantities of local red wine for the equivalent of 42p a bottle. Her house dominates the hamlet, one of several in the upper reaches of the Herault valley, underneath Mont Aigoual in the Cevennes national park. A few modern villas have grown up along the fast new road, built with European Community subsidy, that runs from the valley mouth at Ganges to the mountain pass at L'Esperou, a small ski resort. But the upper Herault remains a wild area of mediaeval peasant buildings and fierce Protestant sects which has yet to make the transition from silk-farming (destroyed by Japanese competition) to tourism. At either end of summer, the weather is wild. The winds collect around the summit of Mont Aigoual and whip down the valley in storms of impressive ferocity. In mid-summer, the elevation provides relief from the burning temperatures of the plain below, and the water in the rock pools is sharp enough to take your breath away. The valley sides are steep and stony and covered in oak and chestnut: there are paths to challenge the keenest ramblers, and eagles and moufflons to watch. A few kilometres downstream is the village of Vallerauge with its oddly imposing architecture, two cafes, two restaurants and the usual combination of shops. The towns of Ganges and its more bourgeois sister, Le Vigan, have entertaining weekly markets. The Randavel Experience is far from de luxe but it is comfortable enough - especially now that main drainage has arrived - and authentic to the last clove of garlic. You might even find you have a pair of genes that paint. Contact Linda Nugent, Hameau de Randavel, 30570 Vallerauge, Gard, tel: 67-82-25-12. Winter number (London): 071-373-0862.

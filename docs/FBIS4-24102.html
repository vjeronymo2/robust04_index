			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Government soldiers of the 3d Commando Battalion  stationed in Bobole, 40 km north of the city of Maputo, have  erected barricades on national highway No. 1 at 2000 on 21 June,  preventing the free movement of people and goods. We received  that information this morning from Maximo Dias, secretary  general of the Mozambican Nationalist Movement. He was in the  area while traveling to Bilene, Gaza Province.    [Begin recording] [Dias] Feelings are running high. People  are very nervous. A senior army officer who arrived there at  2100 was dragged by the soldiers who detained him. His vehicle  was impounded and the driver assaulted. The situation is  serious and the residents are traumatized. A solution ought to  be found at once. It appears that the situation can be resolved  easily.    [Unidentified correspondent] What are the troops demanding?    [Dias] They want to meet senior officers to discuss their  immediate demobilization. They have also asked for the UN  Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] to intervene, but I told them  Unomoz had no jurisdiction over the matter. I said the matter  can be dealt with by our armed forces.    We have a defense minister and the commander in chief who is  the president of the Republic. I would like to urge them to  take immediate action so that the residents are not subject to  this type of behavior. Whenever salaries are not paid, troops  barricade roads and begin shooting. Though nervous, the  soldiers said they did not want to harass travelers. They have  harmed no one. They merely want to go back home. They have  families to support. They noted that their pay, food, and  shelter are not adequate. [end recording]    A Defense Ministry source says measures have been taken to  resolve the matter. The source declined to elaborate, alleging  that it was a military matter. [passage omitted]</p>

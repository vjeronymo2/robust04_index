			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirudin Aldobasic] </F>   [Text] Tesanj--There have been more victims of exhaustion  and hunger on the free Teslic territories. This time it is the  case of two older people, whom even the doctors unfortunately  could not help. They died from starvation. Let me remind you:  The last convoy with humanitarian aid that reached this region  was exactly seven months ago. Starvation and exhaustion have  also claimed dozens of lives on the free Doboj territories.  Almost 20,000 elderly, women, and children are facing death.    The situation is particularly hard in Matuzici, Ularice,  Alibegovci, Mravici, [word indistinct], Mala Brijesnica and  Velika Brijesnica, Kokotnica, and other places on the free  territory. Over the last seven months, only two kilograms of  flour per household have been distributed here.    There is a real humanitarian catastrophe on the Maglaj  territory, too. Tesanj, with 20,000 refugees from Doboj and  Teslic, has also been for a long time been without food,  electricity, fuel, and warm clothes.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BIG EAST NOTES;  </P> <P> THOMPSON PASSES ON PROP. 48 PLAYERS  </P> <P> If you think John Thompson is denouncing Proposition 42 to save his program at  Georgetown, forget it. The Hoyas have never had a Prop 48 player, which makes  Thompson's actions all the more powerful.  </P> <P> The Big East voted against Proposition 42 nine to one. (Each member school gets  one vote and Big East Commissioner Dave Gavitt also casts one vote.)  </P> <P> Only Villanova favored disallowing scholarships to freshmen who fail to qualify  under Proposition 42 standards. Like Georgetown, Boston College and Villanova  never have signed a Prop 48 recruit.  </P> <P> "We reviewed the issue thoroughly and we felt (Prop 42) put some teeth into the  legislation regulating athletic scholarships," Villanova Athletic Director Ted  Aceto said. "We respect John Thompson, but contrary to what John has been  saying, racism had nothing to do with our position."  </P> <P> Of the 12 Prop 48 basketball players in the Big East since the rule was  instituted three seasons ago, 11 are black. The lone white Prop 48 player is  Connecticut sophomore Marc Suhr, of Cologne, West Germany. UConn appealed  Suhr's case to the NCAA, saying that he should have been able to take an  untimed SAT test because of the language barrier. The appeal was denied.  </P> <P> No one is certain how long Thompson's boycott will continue, but his absence is  felt. "We miss him on the bench, him yelling at us," guard Dwayne Bryant said.  "It means a lot to us to hear his voice."  </P> <P> Three Bronx cheers for balanced scheduling. Seton Hall and Providence -- the  top two teams in the conference right now -- don't meet at all until Feb. 25  and then must play again March 1.  </P> <P> Pitt junior Rod Brookin credits his mother Ethel, of Steelton, Pa., for his  return to his glorious freshman form of spinning drives and sweet jumpers.  "She's my biggest fan and my toughest critic," said Brookin, after scoring a  career-high 24 points with eight rebounds and four steals Sunday in the  Panthers' upset of then-No. 3 Oklahoma.  </P> <P> Brookin called his mother often during his early-season struggles. "She'd say,  'Rod, what's wrong with you? You don't do those things on the playground when  you're home.' Sometimes she even hung up on me. But I don't think she'll hang  up (now). She might even send me some money after this game," Brookin said.  </P> <P> Coach Paul Evans said he regrets humiliating Brookin about taking too many  trips to Burger King when Brookin reported to fall practice at 270 pounds.  "It's not like he wants to be fat," Evans said. "It's an hereditary problem."  </P> <P> Now down to 235, Brookin feels terrific. "Before, it'd get so bad on the court  my eyes would roll back in my head." On days off, Brookin alone must report to  the gym to run sprints.  </P> <P> Jim Boeheim seems baffled by his team's 1-4 Big East virus. Here's a remedy: Go  out and find some not-so-talented players such as Final Four participants  Howard Triche and Greg Monroe to complement his selfish wonders-that-be. In its  loss to Connecticut Monday, Syracuse had but five assists -- all from Sherman  Douglas -- who probably shouldn't have played at all because of his sore lower  back. Even a healthy point guard shouldn't be the only distributor on a team.  </P> <P> The present Orange attitude reads: Why give the ball up when you can keep it  for yourself? So pass it on.  </P> <P> Douglas needs just 24 assists in Syracuse's remaining 11 Big East games to  break Mark Jackson's career record of 342 in league play.  </P> <P> But he'll have to stay healthy to eclipse the all-time NCAA record of 894  career assists set by Northeastern's Andre Lafleur in 1987. With at least 15  games left in the season, Douglas needs to average 7.4 a game to do it.  Overall, he's averaging 8.3 assists, but in league play, he's down to 5.8 feeds  a game after recording no assists against St. John's and five against UConn.  </P> <P> The league's "Freshman of the Week" honor has been renamed "Rookie of the Week"  to accommodate torrid performances from Prop 48 sophomores such as Brian  Shorter's 37 points against Oklahoma. Junior college transfers need not apply.  </P> <P> Villanova reserve forward Barry Bekkedam, a 6-10 junior forward, is out for the  season with a torn ligament in his right knee suffered while swimming in an  Orlando, Fla., hotel pool the day before the team went to Disney World. The  fragile Bekkedam has a career average of three points.  </P> <P> Syracuse's team foul shooting has dropped from 75 percent in 1983-84 to 58  percent this season. At this rate of decline, the Orangemen will miss every  free throw in the year 2009.  </P></p>

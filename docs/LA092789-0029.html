			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANUCKS MAKE IT A LONG NIGHT FOR KINGS AND HRUDEY  </P> <P> It was a long, tough night for goalie Kelly Hrudey, who gave up four goals  before he was felled by a puck to the face mask in the third period, and later  gave up one more goal in the Kings' 6-3 exhibition loss to the Vancouver  Canucks Tuesday night before a crowd of 12,320.  </P> <P> After the Canucks' first four goals, Mike Krushelnyski scored for the Kings  with less than two minutes to play in the second period. Vancouver responded  with another goal, before the Kings made it 5-3 on Krushelnyski's goal from the  right circle and Luc Robitaille's goal, after Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean made  a glove save on a shot by Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> The Canucks later scored on an empty-net goal.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> The Kings, whose exhibition record is 2-4-2, will play the Vancouver Canucks  again Thursday night at Phoenix. The game will be broadcast on KLAC (570) at  7:30 p.m. . . . The Kings' Barry Beck played in his first game since retiring  from the New York Rangers two years ago.  </P></p>

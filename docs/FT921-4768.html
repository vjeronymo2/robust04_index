			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rise in Nikkei fails to brighten sentiment Tokyo WHILE movements in the Nikkei average were dominated by activity in the futures markets, share prices remained mixed overall, construction issues gaining ground against a weak high-technology sector, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed up 128.57 at 20,992.99, falling 1.6 per cent on the week. The index fell to a low of 20,841.47 immediately after the opening and then hit a high of 21,113.54 later on in the session. Traders said that the Nikkei was not reflecting sentiment in the broad market. A total of 122 issues fell to new lows since January last year, dragging the Topix index of all first section stocks down 3.28 to 1,520.45, the lowest since December 1986. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.55 to 1,157.30. Volume fell to 250m shares from 300m. Declines led advances by 495 to 455 with 161 issues unchanged. The market failed to react to the Bank of Japan's tankan - quarterly survey of business sentiment - announced during the afternoon session. The survey indicated a further fall in business sentiment because of the weakening economy, especially in the manufacturing sector. Traders said that the report was in line with expectations. Since Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, was in Switzerland to attend a meeting at the Bank of International Settlements, the earliest that the discount rate could be cut was next week. Market participants are now focusing on the outcome of a by-election this weekend in the Miyagi prefecture, in northern Japan, for a seat in the House of Councillors. Construction and electrical engineering companies rose on speculation that the government would bring forward the implementation of its public works projects. Nishimatsu Construction rose Y40 to Y1,170 and Chudenko added Y40 to Y4,500. Drug issues which were popular during the past week fell on profit-taking by dealers ahead of the weekend. Mochida Pharmaceutical fell Y160 to Y4,000 and Dainippon Pharmaceutical lost Y70 to Y1,900. Blue-chip issues lost ground on selling by corporations ahead of the March book-closing. Many companies had reportedly taken a decision to pull out of stock investments due to heavy losses and the negative image of 'zaitech', or financial engineering. Hitachi fell Y25 to Y777, the lowest since the beginning of last year, and Toyota lost Y40 to Y1,330. Traders noted light bargain-hunting by investment trusts at lower levels. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 40.38 to 22,630.37 in volume of 101.5m shares. Roundup FALLS in Hong Kong and Manila were the outstanding movements in the region yesterday. In Bombay, brokers boycotted trading in protest against delayed settlements, and amid rumours of a payments crisis. HONG KONG slid as rumours that a senior blue chip was planning a rights issue continued to circulate. HSBC Holdings, the parent of the Hongkong Bank, Hutchison and Cheung Kong were all named as possibles as the Hang Seng index fell 55.39 to 4908.90, 0.4 per cent down on the week in spite of several record highs over the past fortnight. Turnover fell from HKDollars 2.54bn to HKDollars 2.29bn. MANILA blamed the US market, uncertainty ahead of the May 11 elections and politics in the electric power industry - after the country's out-of-court agreement with Westinghouse Electric on a disputed nuclear power plant - as the composite index tumbled 38.80, or 3.4 per cent to 1,118.81, 5.5 per cent lower on the week. TAIWAN's weighted index sank 45.45 to 4988.08, 0.9 per cent lower on the week, with construction shares posting the biggest fall on the day. SEOUL was lifted by financials and big manufacturing stocks as the composite index rose 6.86 to 626.09, 1.8 per cent higher on the week, turnover staying buoyant at Won 264bn, but but down from Won343.3bn on Thursday. BANGKOK saw gains by banks and property companies after investors took profits in finance issues. The SET index closed 6.80 higher at 807.65 in turnover of Bt6.99bn.</p>

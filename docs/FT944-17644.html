			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Ucatt ballot Ucatt, the construction union, has delayed a ballot on its merger with the TGWU general union until it has completed its financial survival plan. The union hopes to cut a quarter of its 120 staff in the next few weeks through the use of voluntary redundancies. It also hopes to sell off four of its 12 regional offices in an attempt to restore its financial balance by the end of next year. The union had a Pounds 1.05m operating deficit last year and has an accumulated deficit in its general fund of Pounds 3.17m. It had to pay Pounds 200,000 in interest charges on its Pounds 1.248m overdraft facility with Unity Bank last year. The bank has insisted that the union must carry out drastic cuts for continuing financial support. Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt's general secretary, said yesterday: 'We have embarked on a final phase of restructuring and rationalisation. That process is nearing its completion but the union has undergone a major, though very necessary, upheaval.' He added that the union wanted to see its 'new regional structure bedded in before tackling the major administrative task of a full national ballot on merger'. The union said last night that the merger ballot might go ahead in December but denied that its postponement from this month by the union's executive's was due to concerns in the TGWU about the state of the Ucatt's finances. Ucatt was originally to have an autonomous trade group of the larger union at the start of 1995, if the ballot had approved the merger.</p>

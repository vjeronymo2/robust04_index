			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- The Social Democratic  Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest bloc in the ruling  coalition, adopted its draft action program for 1994 on  Wednesday [12 January] that says the party will remain in the  coalition and realign political forces.    In the final day of the party's two-day convention,  delegates  including party legislators and representatives from local  chapters in 47 prefectures, approved the action program as drawn  up by the leadership. About 400 delegates have registered with  the convention.    At the closing of the convention, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama  presented the political outline and said that the party will  realign political forces and rally liberal and social democratic  forces.    The convention results put the party in alignment toward  pushing political reform bills into law, on which Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his premiership.    Discrepancies among party members, however, were made much  more clear over the political reform process and the party's  relations with the coalition, SDP sources said.    On the back stage, those members mounted a fierce tug of war  over resolutions of their own on such issues.    A group chiefly made up of representatives from local  chapters submitted a resolution which calls for firstly  legislating a law designed to prevent corruption without  sticking to enacting political reform bills as a package.    The resolution also urges the party to leave the alliance if  the coalition government takes policies which contravene the  party's basic stance.    They have expressed dissatisfaction toward leadership,  saying  the party made "too many concessions" on important issues such  as political reform and the partial opening of the country's  rice market.    The newly-formed interparty policy study group "Democrats,"  on the other hand, counterproposed a resolution which urges the  party to stay in the coalition and leave the discretion for  negotiation and political judgment on the government's crucial  policies to the party leadership.    Murayama, however, dissuaded [as received] the two groups to  retract the resolutions, saying that if the convention is forced  to vote for either of the resolutions the party's disarray will  be doomed, party officials said.    In exchange for their conformity to Murayama's request, the  chairman accepted their demands that the party will do its  utmost to get political reform bills into law without amending  the basic points of the bills during the current extraordinary  Diet session set to end on January 29.    The government's package of four political reform bills is  in  the House of Councillors for further deliberation after it  passed in the more powerful House of Representatives last  November.    The bills call for replacing the current multiseat  constituencies of the lower house with a combination of  single-seat districts and proportional representation, as well  as tightening curbs on political fund-raising activities.    The ratio of single-seat constituencies in the dual system  and electoral unit for proportional representation are the key  points over which both the government and the largest opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have been haggling to seek a  compromise.    The LDP wants a bigger ratio for single-seat districts  because the system is advantageous for a large party like the  LDP, while the SDP is reluctant to increasing the figure out of  fear that the party's existence could be at risk.    The government bills aim to introduce 274 for single-seat  districts and 226 for proportional representation.    Murayama also said that the party will not agree to a hike  in  the consumption tax from the current 3 percent level to finance  cuts in income tax expected as part of anticipated economic  stimulus measures.    The SDP chairman also vowed to try to revamp the country's  agriculture following the acceptance of a GATT proposal asking  the country to partially lift the blanket ban on imports of rice.    The SDP, with many legislators from farming areas like the  LDP, had opposed the GATT proposal but ultimately compromised to  approve the government decision to partially open the rice  market as the Uruguay Round of global trade talks reached the  deadline on last December 15.</p>

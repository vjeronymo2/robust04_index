			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (2): The boat has stayed afloat - Angela Long examines the economy and employment prospects Whither the economy of Ireland? Or should that be 'wither'? The Republic has advantages in its highly educated, youthful workforce, its (often perplexingly) healthy economic indicators and its enthusiasm to attract investment from foreign companies. But nothing can deny its geography, and after the Channel Tunnel starts operating at last, Ireland will indeed be the only European Union country without a direct link to the European land mass. Well may Mr Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach, claim that while geographically peripheral, Ireland was 'at the heart of Europe' - as he declared to a meeting of the Irish Management Institute last month. Dependence on Europe, primarily the UK, is a fact of life for the Irish economy. A population of 3m is not enough to sustain a country in isolation, and so Ireland has to look outwards, which perhaps accounts for the much more continental feel that Dublin has, for example, than any English city. Often, because of blood links, the overseas link is with the US. This year has seen growing optimism for the Irish economy. Predictions of growth have risen from near 3 per cent at the end of 1993 to between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. Inflation, at about 2 per cent, is one of the lowest in the EU, comparable only with France. The punt is healthy, and a leading stockbroker, Davy, recently predicted that it could reach parity with sterling by the end of the year. Exchequer returns, a key indication of how the administration's bookkeeping is faring, were good, showing a 25 per cent increase in total tax revenue for the first quarter of 1994. And although Ireland may still be one of the poorer members of the EU, its relative prosperity is improving: average income has risen from 60 per cent of the EU average in 1986 to 74 per cent today. The Reynolds government, with Mr Bertie Ahern a popular and competent finance minister, has kept its head and ridden out the currency storm. Interest rates are fairly stable. The government is entering its second Programme for Economic and Social Partnership (PESP), which features a tripartite agreement between itself, the unions and employers, which should help to restrain wage levels. Public sector pay, however, may prove harder to control than Mr Reynolds and Mr Ahern have hoped, with civil servants using provisions for increased pay as a result of work restructuring. Another awkward acronym to ride with PESP, the PCW, stands for the Programme for Competitiveness and Work. The name may be clumsy, but these are the important issues Ireland will have to address. At present, the PCW has yet to be ratified finally by the unions. The 'Work' side of any plan will be the real test for the government, because it is not yet clear whether unemployment - which has been levelling off in recent months - can be controlled. Certainly enough has been said about tackling it, but the heart of the problem remains intractable. The influential Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) published an upbeat mid-term outlook in April which gave rise to a headline in the Irish Times: 'The rising international tide could lift the Irish boat'. The ESRI, working with computer models, predicted an improving economy 'in the mid-term' - that is, into the next century. Consumer spending, for example, should rise by 3.5 per cent this year, and by up to 6.4 per cent in 1995. There has been some sign that the battered consumer, devastated by the rise in interest rates that preceded the 10 per cent devaluation of the punt in January 1993, has returned to the high street. Retail sales have been showing a slight improvement, and there was a big leap in new car sales in the first quarter, with a 46 per cent increase on the same period in 1993. However, this is partly due to a reduction in Vehicle Registration Tax announced in the Budget. But the ESRI report (by Sara Cantillon, John Curtis, and John FitzGerald, son of Garret FitzGerald, the former Taoiseach) warned that without a 'major policy change' long-term employment would remain a grave problem. A mixed blessing for the country came last November: the Republic's football team qualified for the World Cup by defeating Northern Ireland. People who might otherwise have bought a new car or even a house will now be spending any surplus - or borrowed - cash on a trip to the US, or on a new wider-screen television for the month of matches. The ESRI justifies its optimism, in part, by the way in which the Irish 'boat' has managed to stay afloat during recent stormy times, complimenting its 'robust performance in the face of international recession over the past couple of years'. Despite bad conditions last year, the economy managed about 2 per cent growth. Exports rose by about 8.75 per cent compared with growth in world trade of only 2.6 per cent. But ESRI sensibly qualifies its cheery view: 'The one uncertainty about the future is that the actual outturn will be more eventful than the smooth path we have plotted.' The effect of demographics will be watched with interest. Ireland's high birth rate has meant a crushing ratio of wage-earners to dependants; the highest in Europe. For every 10 people at work, there are between 20 and 30 dependants compared with three in, say, Denmark. 'The rate of increase in employment necessary to provide jobs for the young people entering the labour market in Ireland is 15 times greater than in the rest of Europe,' wrote Garret FitzGerald recently. But in the past five years the Irish birthrate has dropped dramatically, as members of the current generation tailor their families to their pockets and life styles rather than to the traditional Catholic model: 'as many as heaven sends.' The implications of this are many. For example, the ESRI forecast notes that the population change will have 'traumatic' effects for the teaching profession, where jobs are already a big issue, and for the health care sector, which will have to concentrate on an ageing population. Since 1972 employment in health and education services has risen from 90,000 to 140,000  -according to last month's meeting of the Irish Business and Employers Congress. These areas are now likely to shrink. Other job sources will have to be found. The running sore on the Irish economy for nearly a decade has been unemployment; Ireland has competed with Spain for the dubious title of having the highest unemployment in the EU. Last year the Republic suffered about 19 per cent unemployed compared to Spain's frightful 21 per cent, but since late last year the figures have been dropping - save for December. (Officials put that down to 'reverse emigration'.) The unemployment figure fell in March for the third successive month, with 290,600 people on the live register; 6,500 fewer than a year ago. The Central Statistical Office's figures for this time last year showed 1.146m people at work compared with 1.139m in 1992. Much of the rise in employment has been among female workers. Many women who previously stayed at home to look after their families are now being forced by circumstance, or liberated by changing attitudes, to seek work. Only 18 months ago you could read angry letters written to newspapers by graduates in Co Galway, complaining of the 'cheek' of married women in taking jobs. The statistics do show a stasis in the numbers of men at work, whereas female employment has risen by 55,000 since 1987. Many of these women are in the services sector - many, too, have lower pay than men, and inferior conditions. What is the government doing to create jobs? Tax breaks for small employers and drives to persuade overseas companies to set up in Ireland are two - perhaps too common - solutions. The Industrial Development Authority is campaigning to draw multinationals, and has had success with some telemarketing companies, creating hundreds of jobs. But the problem remains; when things go badly for the multinational, as for any creature on earth, it wants to go home.</p>

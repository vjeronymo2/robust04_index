			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, 23 May (AZERTAC)--Today, State Adviser of  Azerbaijan Mr. Vafa Gulizadeh has made a statement, which says  that the Armenian armed forces are committing barbarian actions  on the occupied Azeri territory destroying dwelling houses,  communications and agricultural installations. According to V.  Gulizadeh, this information has been confirmed by a deserter  from the Armenian Army. The deserter said that the Armenians  committed those actions since they knew that they would soon  leave the occupied Azeri territory.    V. Gilizadeh has also said that the Azerbaijani President  Geydar Aliyev appealed to the Chairman of the CSCE's Minsk Group  J. Eliasson and regular member states of the CSCE with a request  to bring pressure to bear upon Armenia to stop committing  barbarian actions on the Azeri territory. The President Aliyev  has also appealed to the UN Secretary General Mr. Butrus-Ghali  and asked him to inform the members of the UN Security Council  about these crimes committed by Armenians. The state adviser  thinks that the world community must pay attention to the  felonies committed by the Armenian armed forces and take  measures in order to stop barbarian actions.</p>

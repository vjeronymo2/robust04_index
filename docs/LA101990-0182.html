			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UPI, REUTERS END PHOTO DISPUTE  </P> <P> United Press International and Reuters today settled their court dispute over  photo services, agreeing that Reuters will continue to supply UPI with foreign  news photos but will cover the United States for itself.  </P> <P> A 1984 agreement called for UPI to supply Reuters with photographs from the  United States and for Reuters to provide UPI with pictures from other  countries.  </P> <P> The agreement was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985.  </P> <P> Reuters later sued to void the picture exchange, and UPI filed a counterclaim  saying Reuters negotiated in bad faith.  </P> <P> No compensation or monetary damages will be paid by either organization under  today's settlement, the news organizations said. The announcement said UPI will  have the option of ending the exchange agreement by giving Reuters 30 days  notice.  </P></p>

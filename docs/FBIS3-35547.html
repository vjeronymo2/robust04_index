Hundreds of Palestinian citizens were murdered or  wounded in this act.    In a statement to the JORDAN NEWS AGENCY, Prime Minister Dr.  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali described what happened at the Ibrahimi  Mosque as an unprecedented crime, and as an indication of  fanaticism, extremism, and lack of respect for human rights and  sanctities.    Dr. al-Majali said that this criminal act constitutes a huge  obstacle on the road to achieving a just and comprehensive  peace, which Jordan has been tirelessly seeking to achieve. He  stressed the need for a full Israeli withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories and for the removal of settlements as  a guarantee to prevent the recurrence of such criminal acts that  are in conflict with all humanitarian and religious values.    Dr. al-Majali said: At this time, when our region is  witnessing immense events, we are in a dire need for a unity of  stands and ranks on the Arab and Islamic levels in order to be  able to confront challenges.    In his own name and on behalf of the Jordanian Government,  Dr. al-Majali extended condolences to the Palestinian leadership  and to our people in the occupied territories. He said: We  consider the misfortune of our people in Palestine as our own  misfortune.</p>

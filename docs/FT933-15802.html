			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Observer: Wooing the Latins Tristan Garel-Jones may have made himself frightfully unpopular with the opponents of Maastricht, but he went down pretty well in Latin America where they were notably less sensitive about the minister's role in guiding the treaty through the house. So his departure from the foreign office in the May cabinet reshuffle appeared to leave a gap in the British government, which is trying to cosy up to Latin America now the continent's economic performance is looking up. Into the breach, however, steps chief secretary to the treasury Michael Portillo. Also a fluent Spanish speaker, Portillo is at this very moment on a trip to Mexico and Chile with a group of British businessmen in search of export and investment opportunities. At first blush, Portillo's direct treasury style might look a trifle dull beside the flamboyant Garel-Jones and his trade-mark cape. But Portillo does have some things going for him. A taste for the good life  - and a liking for the odd glass of champagne - never goes down badly with Latin American elites. And, though he's on the political right, Portillo has other bases covered. His father fought against Franco in the Spanish civil war and there are plenty of Franco exiles scattered all over Latin America.</p>

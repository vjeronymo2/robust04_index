			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Aetna credit rating cut again Aetna, the US insurer, suffered another cut in its credit rating this week, the latest in a rash of downgradings that has hit the US property/casualty insurance industry in the wake of growing concerns over pollution and asbestos liabilities. Others to be downgraded in recent weeks include Cigna, which on Monday announced a withdrawal from the reinsurance business to help rebuild the profitability of its property/casualty operations, and Continental, which last month set aside Dollars 400m for possible future pollution claims. AM Best, the specialist insurance rating concern, said it had reduced Aetna's rating to single-A minus from single A. It cited the company's long drawn-out attempts to cut costs, as well as poor conditions in the commercial property/casualty business and 'the ongoing earnings drag and volatility associated with emerging environmental and asbestos claims'. Aetna surprised Wall Street in July by announcing big pollution-related costs. The company lost its double-A credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's in August, and in September was cut to A2 from A1 by Moody's. At the end of June, the company's reserves against environmental losses stood at Dollars 334m - far less than other big insurers, such as Cigna, whose reserves were Dollars 775m, according to insurance industry analysts at Oppenheimer in New York. The contrast suggests that Aetna will have to put aside significantly greater reserves in future, Oppenheimer said. Cigna, meanwhile, lost its single-A standing in August when Moody's reduced its rating to Baa1, citing in part its 'exposure to adverse loss development from asbestos and environmental claims'. Both Aetna and Cigna contested the agencies' decisions, arguing that they failed to take account of efforts made by both to boost profitability in their property/casualty businesses. Mr William Wilt, an associate analyst at Moody's, said yesterday the agency believed US insurers generally had adequate reserves to meet normal claims. However, he added that catastrophe losses among insurers of personal insurance, along with environmental and asbestos losses among commercial insurers, could eventually prove these reserves to be totally inadequate. Commenting on the possible scale of the future losses, Mr Wilt said: 'They're unquantifiable. It's anybody's guess, really.'</p>

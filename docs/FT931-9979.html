			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Air Canada forecasts deficit of CDollars 200m GLOBAL recession, domestic overcapacity and heavy Canadian fuel taxes will bring a CDollars 200m (USDollars 158.7m) loss for Air Canada this year, Mr Hollis Harris, chairman, said yesterday. The country's biggest airline, locked in a competitive struggle with rival Canadian Airlines and the small Nationair, will also reveal next week that 1992 will show a record deficit. In the first nine months a net loss of CDollars 307m was incurred after special charges, following losses of CDollars 218m for 1991. Mr Harris told the Canadian Commons transportation committee his airline would break even on an operating basis in 1993 but this was before financial and special charges. It should return to overall profitability in 1994 with the full impact of manpower cuts and cost reduction programmes. He said Air Canada had sufficient cash to complete its bid for 25 per cent of Continental Airlines of the US and he was confident the alliance would be approved by the US authorities. He said forming one Canadian carrier was the solution to the Canadian airline industry's woes and he held out the possibility again of a merger with PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines.</p>

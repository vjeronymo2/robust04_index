			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The project includes the removal of an estimated minimum 183,000 cubic yards (140,000 cubic meters) of sediment downstream of the Morelos Dam intake structure in Mexico, assigned to Mexico, and removal of an estimated minimum 314,000 cubic yards (240,000 cubic meters) of sediment, assigned to the United States, immediately upstream of Morelos Dam in the Colorado River, also in Mexico, up to the NIB. The Mexican government has requested the United States government perform the part of the work assigned to Mexico at full reimbursement to the United States Government because the existing Mexican equipment does not have the capacity to remove the amount of sediment necessary to restore the intake canal capacity to 5,650 cubic feet per second (160 cubic meters per second). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Work will be performed utilizing dredging equipment. It may also be necessary to use earth moving equipment along the Mexican bank of the Colorado River. The spoil material will be temporarily placed in Mexico just upstream of Morelos Dam. Mexico will remove the spoil material to a permanent disposal site in Mexico in the near future. The United States will advise Mexico on disposal site preparation in that country. The sediment has been tested for the presence of pesticides and heavy metals. The result of the tests will be furnished to the interested resource agencies when they become available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This alternative will improve the flood carrying capacity in the Colorado River to pass flood flows through the NIB similar to those experienced during the 1993 Gila River floods. The Morelos Dam system will also allow Mexico to fully divert the waters delivered by the United States under the 1944 Water Treaty along with small flood flows that may arrive at the NIB. The United States would be acting in furtherance of the 1944 Water Treaty requirement to recommend and carry out flood control activities and the 1970 Boundary Treaty requirements for boundary preservation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Sediment Removal and Flood Control Alternative would result in the United States and Mexico concluding an international agreement through a Minute of the IBWC for sediment removal in the Colorado River from the confluence of the Gila River to the lower end of the Mexicali Valley Irrigation District, including the Morelos Dam intake canal. This action would restore the carrying capacity of the river channel to about 25,000 cubic feet per second (708 cubic meters per second) to permit passage of the 100-year flood discharge of approximately 40,000 cubic feet per second (1,130 cubic meters per second) with overbank discharges that will not overtop or endanger flood control levees in either the United States or in Mexico. This activity would also improve the Colorado River channel gradient in the lower end of the Mexicali Valley Irrigation District to increase the velocity of flood flows into the Laguna Salada diversion channel and to the Gulf of California. This alternative would also allow the United States and Mexico to resolve existing boundary issues and other differences in a cooperative manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This alternative would be a major federal undertaking which could not be accomplished within the short time needed to correct water diversion problems or handle potential significant flood events during 1994. An undertaking of this magnitude would also involve a consideration of river stabilization and river rectifications in addition to sediment removal. Such activities would require extensive cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact evaluation. This alternative was therefore not given further consideration. Instead, the elements of this alternative were considered as elements that merit considerable binational study for a possible longer term activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Revised Draft Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The USIBWC met with the interested resource agencies on February 15, 1994, in Yuma, Arizona, to discuss the proposed action. The Revised Draft Environmental Assessment (RDEA) for the proposed project was completed on February 16, 1994, and made available for review and comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the basis of the consensus reached with the interested resource agencies and the RDEA, the USIBWC has determined that an environmental impact statement is not required for the United States Government and the Government of Mexico to engage in a joint project for immediate emergency removal of sediment in Mexico from Morelos Dam to the NIB and hereby provides notice of a finding of no significant impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An environmental impact statement will not be prepared unless additional information which may affect this decision is brought to our attention within thirty (30) days of the date of this Notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RDEA and Draft Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) have been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency and various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of these documents are available to fill single copy requests at the above address. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Dated: February 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Manuel R.

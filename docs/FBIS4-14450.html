			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was the most  influential political figure in Russia last February, according  to a survey conducted by the Vox Populi public opinion service  (its head Professor Boris Grushin is a member of the  presidential council). President Yeltsin who headed the list  last December was the second.    The rating was determined by 50 experts: editors of leading  publications and prominent political analysts.    The composition of the fist five changed considerably  compared with January: Yegor Gaydar, Vladimir Zhirinovsky and  Vladimir Shumeyko dropped out. Their places were taken  accordingly by the Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev and the Chairman of the Central Bank Victor  Gerashchenko.    The greatest change in rating happened to the Deputy Foreign  Minister Vitaly Churkin who skyrocketed from position 98-99 to  16-16 which can be accounted to his key role in Russian  diplomacy in Bosnia. The Tatar President Mintimer Shaymyev  moved from 27th to 10th place which is attributed to the signing  of the agreement between Russia and Tatarstan.    The other politicians whose influence grew included Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev (8), presidential national security  advisor Yuriy Baturin (12), the Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy  Shafranik (25), the secretary of the Security Council Oleg  Lobov, the chief of the External Intelligence Service Yevgeniy  Primakov.</p>

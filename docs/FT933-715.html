			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Thatcher picks at Tory wounds STERLING should stay out of the European exchange rate mechanism, Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister (pictured above with Sir Teddy Taylor), told Conservative loyalists last night in a speech which threatened to reopen Tory wounds on Europe just a week before the party's annual conference, David Owen writes. Making a rare speech to a Conservative constituency association, she also said that it would be a mistake for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to raise taxes in his November Budget. Lady Thatcher said she would never have signed the Maastricht treaty because of the shift towards federalism it would bring about. Speaking in the Southend East constituency of Sir Teddy, the arch Euro-sceptic Tory MP, she said the British people had their own way of doing things and did not want to be swamped by Europe. Tory activists at the Pounds 35-a-head event - which was marked by a huge police security operation - could not recall her making a single reference to Mr John Major, the prime minister, or to the current state of the Tory party.</p>

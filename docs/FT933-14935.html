			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Thatcher renews attack on Maastricht TORY arguments over Europe resurfaced last night as Lady Thatcher said she would back moves in the Lords to win a referendum on Maastricht, and the government's difficulties in a Commons vote later this month appeared to deepen. Lady (formerly Mrs Margaret) Thatcher, the former prime minister, intends to speak when the House of Lords debates the referendum amendment on Wednesday. But yesterday she denied her intervention would amount to an attack on Mr John Major. 'It will be a furtherance of what I have believed in for a very long time,' she said, adding that she had 'never' sought to damage her successor as prime minister. 'That is the interpretation put on every time I speak. That is why I speak very rarely.' Government business managers are confident that her call for a referendum will be comfortably defeated by peers. But there is more nervousness about debates in the Commons and the Lords on Maastricht's social chapter, expected to be held on July 26. Mr Bill Cash, Tory MP for Stafford and a prominent opponent of Maastricht, indicated yesterday that he might vote for the social chapter in the hope of it wrecking the treaty legislation. The government, which fiercely opposes the social chapter, agreed to hold the debates as a concession during the bill's passage through the Commons. Technically the government could ignore the result if the Commons voted for the social chapter, but Labour would claim a moral victory if ministers went ahead with ratifying the treaty without the social chapter. Although he also opposes the social chapter, Mr Cash said it was 'certainly on the cards' that he would join Labour MPs on July 26. 'It would not be voting for Labour. It would be voting against a cosmetic exercise which is going to happen anyway,' Mr Cash said. Business managers believe that many Euro-sceptics will be under pressure from constituency associations not to vote for the social chapter. They are also hoping that the support, or abstention, of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs will avert an embarrassing government defeat.</p>

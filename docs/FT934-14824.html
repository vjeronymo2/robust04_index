			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Portugal plans broad changes to withholding tax PORTUGAL is planning changes to its withholding tax, which has long discouraged foreign investment in its bond market. It hopes to introduce a system under which non-residents are refunded within one day, effectively scrapping the withholding tax on foreigners. Investors based in tax havens such as Luxembourg or the Cayman Islands are likely to be excluded. The system is expected to take effect in January. Portugal levies a 20 per cent withholding tax on government bonds. While there are a number of double-taxation treaties for non-residents, the cumbersome and time-consuming reclaim procedure has led to an interest rate premium on Portuguese bonds over other markets. The reforms will apply to all non-residents, including investors in the US and Japan, which have no double-taxation treaties with Portugal. 'This is part of the process of opening up of our capital markets to foreign investors and of bringing conditions in line with international capital markets generally,' said Mr Jose Braz, secretary of state for the Treasury. The plans are contained in the 1994 budget, which goes before the cabinet today. If agreed, it will be presented to parliament tomorrow. The effective abolition of the withholding tax for non-residents 'will remove one of the major deterrents to investment in Portuguese bonds', said Mr Andrew Roberts, of UBS. Long-dated Portuguese bonds jumped about 1 1/2 points on heavy foreign buying in anticipation of the announcement. The 10 5/8 per cent 10-year benchmark yielded 9.22 per cent late yesterday, down from 9.45 per cent on Tuesday. Portugal's bond market has undergone sweeping reforms over the past year in an effort to boost liquidity and attract foreign buyers. It is estimated that foreigners own some 5 per cent of the market, but the Treasury is said to want to increase this share to between 25 per cent and 30 per cent. Compared with other European bond markets, Portugal's is relatively small. The five-year sector has some Es217bn of bonds outstanding, the seven-year sector some Es129bn and the 10-year some Es78bn. The Treasury recently shifted most of its issuance to long-dated paper, which is sold at regular auctions. Nevertheless, fundamental factors favour Portugal, with its stable political situation, easing inflation and declining debt-to-GDP ratio. According to OECD forecasts, that ratio is expected to drop to 4.3 per cent this year from 5.1 per cent in 1992. With the exception of South Africa, Portuguese long bonds offer the highest nominal yields, which makes them attractive to investors, Mr Roberts pointed out.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Markets: Utilities and the lure of income - Serious Money PRIVATE INVESTORS have come to know and love the utilities sector. In part, this is because it consists almost entirely of privatised companies, which the government has done its best to sell at an attractive price (see the package on BT on page III). But it is also because the nature of the businesses, providing everyday needs such as electricity and water to everybody, helps protect against the cyclical downturns that afflict other sectors such as retailing. So a portfolio of utility stocks would seem a natural for the private investor. Hence the launch this week of Johnson Fry's Utilities Trust. When writing about new issues last week, I suggested that investors should always look to see if there was an existing trust covering the same field trading at a discount. This caveat does not apply to the Johnson Fry fund, since there is no existing investment trust specialising in utilities. Perhaps that is surprising, although the utilities sector is still relatively new. Cazenove launched a unit trust with a high utility content earlier this year, Gartmore also has a utility unit trust. Both the Cazenove and the Johnson Fry funds focus on one particular aspect of the utilities' attractions: their ability to pay high, and increasing, dividends. With many private investors desperate for income at a time of 6 per cent base rates, this is a natural marketing ploy. However, the quality of the dividends paid by utilities has already been recognised by the stock market, with the result that yields in the sector have fallen. Cazenove addressed this problem by topping up with bonds; Johnson Fry is achieving the same end by using preference shares. The Johnson Fry trust also intends to earn extra income in the options market. It will write call options (giving other people the right to buy shares at a set price) against part of its utility holdings. This will earn premium income, but it does mean that the trust may have to give up some capital growth. But even these devices were not enough. The higher the income you can offer these days, the more money you can raise. The portfolio Johnson Fry is assembling will yield 7.7 per cent (6.75 per cent after charges). By giving the trust a split capital structure, Johnson Fry can boost the income to 9 per cent. How is this magic achieved? All the revenue will flow to the income shares which constitute three quarters of the trust. So instead of revenue of Pounds 6.75 being earned on Pounds 100 of capital, the same revenue is earned on Pounds 75, giving a 9 per cent yield. Put those shares into a Personal Equity Plan, and you have an appealing return. You cannot, of course, have something for nothing. The other class of shares in the trust is a zero dividend preference share, which has first claim on the assets. The trust's assets must grow at 3.7 per cent for the income shareholders to expect repayment in 2003 at 100p. That may not seem a daunting rate but remember that 25 per cent of the trust is in fixed rate preference shares, which are unlikely to grow at all. So in effect, the required growth rate from the utility portion of the portfolio is 5 per cent per year. Of course, that could be achieved (much may depend on future inflation). But investors should realise that buying the income shares could involve them in turning some of their capital into income. There are further risks. The current government could impose a tougher regulatory regime on the utilities, perhaps in response to consumer unrest about excess profits or higher prices. A Labour government could even renationalise part of the sector. Doubts must also exist about how well the trust will perform, given that Johnson Fry has no record in the investment trust field. One aspect of the issue which may appeal is the chance to convert old privatised utility holdings into income shares. Such old holdings can, of course, be sold through a conventional stockbroker but, given the small size of the allocations in privatisations, minimum dealing commissions can take a hefty bite out of the proceeds. Johnson Fry will buy utility holdings at the bid price at no dealing cost. However, it will only perform this service for those who are investing Pounds 3,000 in cash, on top of any exchanged shares. What about the zeros? They offer a redemption yield of 9 per cent, if held until the trust's anticipated wind-up date in 2003. The return on the zeros is taxed as capital gain, not income, and so may well appeal to higher rate taxpayers who have not used up their annual CGT allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1993-94). Furthermore, the zeros look very safe. The trust will have more than enough assets at outset to repay the zeros at their final redemption value - the cover figure (to use the industry jargon) will be 157 per cent. Those who need immediate income will probably ignore the zeros. (They could in theory buy a large chunk of zeros, sell 9 per cent each year, and take the proceeds as income. Whether this makes sense depends on the dealing costs). Are the income shares worth buying? If held in a Pep, they attract an extra charge of Pounds 30, which reduces the yield on Pounds 6,000 to 8.5 per cent. Viewed purely as an income play, that is reasonably appealing. It is higher than the 7 per cent yield on the Cazenove unit trust, although that fund is less exposed to the risk of capital loss.</p>

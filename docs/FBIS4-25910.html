After his talks with his visiting Vietnamese Counterpart  Nguyen Manh Cam, Kozyrev recalled in an interview with reporters  that Russia has proposed holding an international conference on  security and nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula.    This idea is now under consideration, he added.    "There has been a proposal to impose sanctions. We do not  rule out the possibility, quite unfortunately, that it may come  to that. But it would be a very unreasonable development of the  situation. It would be also unreasonable if North Korea (DPRK)  withdraws from the nuclear non-proliferation regime," the  Russian foreign minister added.    "I think that not all chances have been lost and there is  still hope that this door has not been closed yet," he said.</p>

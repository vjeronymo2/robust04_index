			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DWORKIN ON JOHN MACK  </P> <P> The John Mack case is a particularly horrific example of a justice system  lacking any semblance of justice. To have smashed a woman's skull in with a  hammer, stabbed her in the chest and slit her throat and then serve a little  more than two years of prison time is morally reprehensible.  </P> <P> Should John Mack have resigned his post as top aide to Speaker of the House Jim  Wright? One could reasonably argue that he should never have been there in the  first place!  </P> <P> In fact, one could even more reasonably argue that he should still be behind  bars for the incredibly evil act he perpetrated.  </P> <P> BRUCE A.

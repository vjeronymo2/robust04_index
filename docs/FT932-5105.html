			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Exchange ruling on enhanced scrip price THE STOCK exchange has taken steps to ensure that the cash alternatives for enhanced scrip dividend schemes are set fairly. It has issued rules to ensure that underwriters of such schemes do not manipulate the price of the shares during the three-day period when the cash reference price is struck, determining the number of new shares to be issued. Although there is no suggestion that any manipulation has occurred, the exchange was concerned to ensure that trading taking place during the reference period should accurately and fairly reflect buying and selling. Accordingly, it said that while it is acceptable for a market-maker to adjust quotations to reflect the flow of two-way business, the market maker should not initiate a change in the price of the stock where the intention is deliberately to lower or otherwise manipulate the price. In the event of these rules not being obeyed, the exchange reserves the right to call for an adjustment in the final reference price. Meanwhile, shareholders in Ladbroke, the hotels, racing and property group, are to receive a higher cash alternative from Swiss Bank Corporation than they were originally offered by BZW, which designed the enhanced scrip scheme. It has been agreed that all shareholders will receive 9.15p per share, compared with the original cash dividend of 6.23p and BZW's enhanced offer of 8.88p. Forte, the hotels and leisure group, also announced that enhanced scrip dividend elections had been received on behalf of 90.15 per cent of its ordinary shares. The reference price for the enhanced scrip had been calculated at 196.39p, which will result in 26.89m new shares being issued, representing an increase of 3.28 per cent in the ordinary share capital.</p>

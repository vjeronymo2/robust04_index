			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARXISM IS OUT; GRINGO-BASHING, TOO;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: DEMOCRATIZATION OF CENTRAL AMERICA IS COMPLETE; ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS  ON POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITHIN THE REGION AND WITH NORTH AMERICA.  </P> <P> The Nicaraguan election has dealt the all-but-final blow to Marxist-Leninist  revolution as an alternative in this hemisphere. It initiates the closing  episode of the tumultuous era that began in 1959 with the Cuban Revolution and  will conclude with the fall of Fidel Castro.  </P> <P> Thankfully, this part of the world, like Eastern Europe, has finally given up  Marx for Montesquieu. The Sandinistas, by showing mature acceptance of their  defeat, have apparently learned to value the checks and balances on power that  are the fundamental guarantee of Western civilization.  </P> <P> Even if the Sandinistas had won the election Sunday, it was already clear to  them that their primitive attempt to establish a Marxist-Leninist government in  Nicaragua was doomed. Although the U.S.-backed Contras contributed to the  pressure on the Sandinistas to accept free elections, they were not the  decisive factor. The transformation of the Sandinistas was primarily a  consequence of the momentous changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It  had became clear to them that the kind of help they needed to carry out their  revolution would not be forthcoming from Mikhail Gorbachev or their rapidly  collapsing Communist allies in Eastern Europe. And without Soviet backing,  Cuba's support was useless.  </P> <P> As realists, the Sandinistas decided to save what they could of their  revolution. Although a free election posed the risk of their losing power, they  thought that at least they could salvage their legitimacy as the major unified  presence capable of influencing Nicaragua's future. The only other alternative  was to suffer the same isolation as Cuba. Unless they undergo a significant  split, the Sandinistas still have a viable future.  </P> <P> The effect of the Nicaraguan election on the enigma of Cuba is unclear. History  is not only a matter of impersonal social forces but of human beings; of chance  and accidents. Fidel Castro is a historical accident. Persons are  unpredictable, and Cuba is a personalized regime. But the election in Nicaragua  makes Castro's choice strikingly clear: Either he can take the path of Daniel  Ortega -- who followed the lead of Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia --  or he can follow the path of Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania. With each passing  day, Castro seems less disposed to take the path of the Sandinistas.  </P> <P> As it relates to Mexico, the defeat of one-party rule at the Nicaraguan polls  will certainly be used by the opposition to Mexico's ruling party, the PRI, to  press for more rapid democratization. Although the pace of democratization  might be too slow, it has been solidly under way in Mexico for some time. Under  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the PRI realizes, as the Sandinistas did,  that democratization is a matter of their life or death as a viable party.  </P> <P> Significantly, the Sandinista defeat can also be read as something of a defeat  for the anti-gringo sentiment that has plagued Latin America long past its  historical reality. After all, the Nicaraguan people elected the candidate  openly endorsed by the President of the United States, George Bush, who was a  key supporter of arming the Contras. And, contrary to predictions, the U.S.  invasion of Panama last December did not unleash a nationalist backlash to  cement the Sandinista hold on power. The abandonment of anti-gringo sentiment,  which is evident across Latin America, will be a key factor in confronting the  problems of a Central America at peace.  </P> <P> The new peace will present President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro with the  pressing tasks of Nicaragua's reconciliation and reconstruction. These can be  effected only through broad integration, not only with the rest of Central  America, the Caribbean and Mexico but with the heretofore customarily vilified  United States as well.  </P> <P> The division of Central America into six countries is an artificial remnant of  extreme decolonization. Since these countries don't have historic national  identity and lack economic and political viability on their own, the only  solution for them is to unite into a regional common market and political  association like the European Community. These would be linked in turn with a  larger integration in a North American community.  </P> <P> If these tiny countries remain alone in the 21st Century, they will remain the  poor and impotent pawns of outside powers, a situation that has already led to  so much bloodshed in this century.  </P> <P> Now that the ideological rift has diminished in Central America, the main  threat to the promise of integration, as in Eastern Europe, will be resurgent  nationalism. Here, too, democratization is the best guarantee against  nationalist reaction. In Latin America, anti-U.S. sentiment has resided mainly  in intellectuals and aristocrats who inherited Spanish tradition. The  Conservative Party of Mexico, for example, asked the help of Napoleon III to  defend against the "gringo menace." In this century, the custodians of  anti-Americanism have been on the left, not the right. Anachronistic  intellectuals, primarily of the left, are the last to change.  </P> <P> The kind of democratic developments we have just witnessed in Nicaragua,  however, will make economic integration more appealing than nationalism  </P> <P> Economic integration alone, of course, will not close the gap between rich and  poor or reconcile freedom and equality. It will only be the condition for such  a possibility. As in the United States and Europe, the likely order will be a  mixed economy: a free market with state intervention to alleviate gross  inequality.  </P> <P> The Sandinista defeat, like the defeat of the Marxist left generally, is the  defeat of fantasy. The communist remedy to social injustice proved worse than  the malady. Now our challenge is to find the political imagination to address  those injustices that have outlived their untenable solution.  </P></p>

Under the terms of the resolution, Parliament authorizes  the government to submit the application to the Commission of  the European Union [EU].    Prior to the vote, Prime Minister Peter Boross noted that  representatives of the parliamentary parties spoke with approval  concerning Hungary's membership in the EU.    Deputies also approved a draft resolution on assistance to  the national and ethnic minority organizations. Accordingly, of  the 220 million forints approved, the individual federations of  minorities in Hungary will receive 130 million forints, while  the remaining 90 million forints will be distributed among the  78 Gypsy organizations.    In 1994, the largest budget assistance of 36.4 million  forints is to be given to the Federation of Germans in Hungary.  The Democratic Federation of Slovaks in Hungary is to receive  23.5 million forints, the Federation of Croats in Hungary 21.1  million, the Democratic Federation of Romanians in Hungary 13.4  million.    Parliament also approved the law on prevention of money  laundering through money and capital market systems. The law  obliges financial servicing organizations to identify the client  in cases of cash deposits or payments of 2 million forints or  more.</p>

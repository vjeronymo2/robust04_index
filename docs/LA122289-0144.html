			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE'S NEW LINEUP SAME AS THE OLD ONES IN OVERTIME DEFEAT  </P> <P> UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan tried out his sixth starting lineup Thursday  night against Loyola of Chicago and, quite frankly, it began no better than the  previous five.  </P> <P> For a half, No. 6 was downright dreadful.  </P> <P> The Anteaters, with two freshmen and a gimpy point guard starting, were  scoreless for the first three minutes before freshman Jeff Von Lutzow made a  layup.  </P> <P> But Mulligan did a little tinkering and came up with an effective combination  in the second half. Irvine rallied from 12 points down to force overtime, then  fell flat, 78-72, before 1,437 in the Bren Center.  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive loss for Irvine (2-7).  </P> <P> Keir Rogers had 35 points and Keith Gailes 28 to lead Loyola (3-3). Every time  Irvine would come close, Rogers or Gailes would get a key basket or free throw.  </P> <P> As it turned out, the Ramblers needed every one of their points. No other  Loyola player scored more than six points.  </P> <P> "Every time we got it going, somehow Rogers ended up at the line," Mulligan  said.  </P> <P> Irvine had no one to turn to in the stretch. After tying the score, 66-66, the  Anteaters missed two chances to win in the final seconds of regulation.  </P> <P> Rod Palmer's eight-footer in the lane was too short. Justin Anderson rebounded,  but his off-balance try bounced off the rim as the buzzer sounded.  </P> <P> In overtime, Loyola scored first on Rogers' free throw and never trailed.  </P> <P> His three-point play (a layup and free throw after a steal at midcourt) put the  game out of reach, 72-67.  </P> <P> Gailes added four free throws and Danny Stevens two in the final minute to seal  the victory.  </P> <P> Von Lutzow and Anderson each had 17 to lead Irvine.  </P> <P> By halftime, Irvine trailed by seven and was lucky it wasn't down by more. The  Anteaters' top two scorers, Jeff Herdman and Ricky Butler, didn't have a point  between them and Palmer, making his first start since spraining his knee Dec. 2  was one of eight from the field.  </P> <P> Herdman finished with just seven and Butler, who fouled out with 32 seconds  left in regulation, 10. They each average 15 points a game.  </P> <P> Palmer's knee may be healed, but his jumper was hurting Thursday night. He was  a miserable four of 19 from the field (21%) and had 10 points and eight  assists.  </P> <P> "I'm mystified, absolutely mystified," Mulligan said.  </P> <P> Things got better in the second half as Mulligan tinkered with his lineup and  finally found an effective combination.  </P> <P> Still, he said later that Will Rey, in his first season as Loyola coach,  outcoached him.  </P> <P> "I got outcoached and they beat us with two great players (Rogers and Gailes),"  Mulligan said.  </P> <P> Irvine's customary poor shooting and penchant for turning the ball over also  contributed to the loss.  </P> <P> The Anteaters shot 37.5%, 34.5% in the first half, from the field. They also  had 18 turnovers, one more than their average.  </P> <P> Only once, in a 85-79 victory over Bucknell, has Irvine shot better than 50%  this season.  </P> <P> "Every time we threw it away, they came down and scored," Mulligan said. "We  just didn't get real good shots."  </P> <P> By contrast, Loyola shot 53.2% and had only 11 turnovers.  </P> <P> But the Ramblers started slowly, too, and led just 4-2 with 15:44 left in the  first half.  </P> <P> But that changed as soon as Rogers got his jump shot warmed up. Rogers, who had  16 points in the first half, made a three-pointer to start Loyola on a 15-0 run  and a 16-point lead.  </P> <P> Von Lutzow's dunk with 8:50 left finally broke the streak.  </P> <P> Irvine began to snap out of its offensive slumber, cutting the lead to 25-22  after Rob Doktorczyk's layup.  </P> <P> But Loyola pushed the lead back up to 30-23 by halftime.  </P> <P> Irvine finally made it close late in the game.  </P> <P> Doktorczyk's layup tied the score, 63-63, with 2:14 left.  </P> <P> A free throw by Craig Marshall, Irvine's other freshman starter, put the  Anteaters ahead for the first time, 64-63. Gailes hit a free throw at the other  end to tie it.  </P> <P> A jumper by Palmer from just inside the three-point line put Irvine back ahead,  but Gailes made two free throws with 57 seconds left.  </P> <P> Neither team could score and the game went into overtime.  </P></p>

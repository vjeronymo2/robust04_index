			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- The Republic of China  [ROC] will continue to strive for closer economic cooperation  with Southeast Asian countries as part of its commitment to  playing a more active role in Asia-Pacific economic development,  Premier Lien Chan said Wednesday [6 April].    Addressing the opening ceremony of the 29th Conference of  Governors of the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN), Lien  said the ROC now ranks high on the list of foreign investors in  most SEACEN member nations and its bilateral trade with these  countries has increased tremendously.    "Even though our overseas investments have shown a slight  drop in the past couple of years," Lien said, "the ROC remains  among the top three foreign investors in most of SEACEN member  nations."    Lien said Taiwan will discuss the issue of double taxation  and reach agreements on the promotion and protection investments  with each of these countries. "We hope to reduce as much as  possible the many obstacles to economic and trade interflow," he  noted.    The premier continued that Taiwan is drawing up plans to  eliminate restrictions on the establishment of financial  institutions and their range of operations, to gradually relax  the control of capital flow, and to encourage competition from  more foreign financial institutions so as to further liberalize  its financial markets.    "We are also cultivating talent, promoting a free flow of  commodities and information, and making the best use of Taiwan's  strategic location and economic conditions to develop the Taiwan  area into a multinational operations center in the  Asia-Pacific," Lien said.    He added Taiwan hopes to attract both domestic and foreign  capital to create a bright future for Taiwan's economic  development.    Speaking on the same occasion, Lord Kingsdown, former  governor of the Bank of England, said the world has become  steadily more inter- dependent and economically integrated.    Against this background, Kingsdown said, international  monetary cooperation has become very important. He noted that  the volume of international financial transactions has grown  substantially in recent years. He cited as an example that  United States cross- border transactions in bonds and equities  grew from 2.8 percent of gross domestic products (GDP) in 1970  to 92 percent of GDP in 1990.    Central bank governors and other senior financial officials  from 10 SEACEN member states -- South Korea, the Philippines,  Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Nepal,  Myanmar [Burma] and the host ROC -- attended the opening  ceremony at the Taipei International Convention Center.    Central bank governors from Cambodia, Laos, Fiji and Tonga  were also present at the meeting as observers.    This is the first time Taiwan has hosted the annual SEACEN  conference. Taiwan became a full member of the forum in 1993.  The government-level regional financial cooperation  organization was founded in 1966.    The participants will review regional financial situations  and discuss possible financial and economic cooperation projects  over the next two days. A joint statement will be issued at the  end of the annual conference Friday.    President Li Teng-hui is scheduled to receive the Southeast  Asian central bank governors Thursday.</p>

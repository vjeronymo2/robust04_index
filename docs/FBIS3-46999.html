			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hong Linh article in "recent" issue of QUAN DOI NHAN DAN: </F> "Discordant Voices Under the Pretext of Religion"]    [Text] External anti-Vietnamese forces have tried hard to  advance slanderous and distorted allegations against Vietnam in  a bid to portray Vietnam as violating democratic principles and  human rights. They are looking for excuses to interfere,  supposedly to protect human rights in Vietnam. They want to  initiate a permanent and long-term anti-Vietnam campaign to  foment instability and obstruct our people's national renovation  now being initiated and led by the Communist Party of Vietnam.    Of late, taking advantage of the complex situation created  by  the extremists in the former An Quang Buddhist Church, the  external forces have added fuel to the fire. Promptly seizing  this opportunity, they have unjustifiably linked the human  rights issue with religious causes. They have resorted to every  trick to internationalize this issue by taking advantage of  foreign forums to give slanderous testimonies against Vietnam.    Earlier, a number of foreign strategists who are unfriendly  to Vietnam held that to carry out a long-term anticommunist  campaign, it is necessary to rely on the force of religion.  These strategists also predicted that the puppet army, the  puppet regime, and other parties would fall apart and that in  Vietnam, the religious problem is one of the factors that could  be exploited to stir up the situation, and thus create permanent  instability.    Taking advantage of religion at home and abroad, a number of  people in priests' robes have been and are following the advice  of the above strategists. They are allying themselves with one  another in setting up various single-religion or inter-faith  organizations and committees. Their purpose is to rally and to  get external forces to cooperate with internal forces in a bid  to pressure other countries and international organizations into  intervening or offering help. They have vociferously claimed  that at many places -- such as in front of the parliamentary  buildings of many countries, by the side of the new cathedral of  the Rome Missisonary College, at the Vienna Human Rights  Conference, and at the 1993 youth gathering in Denver -- that  human rights, with freedom of religion being the most important,  are the yardsticks to measure the degree of democracy of a  country. Turning to Vietnam, they slander Vietnam for  persecuting religion and for violating human rights.    Everyone knows that assisted and agitated by exiles such as  Vo Van Ai from France, Thich Quang Ba from Australia, and Thich  Ho Giac and Thich Vien My from the United States, a number of  evil elements in the An Quang Buddhist Church have done many  things at variance with Buddhist scripture. For instance, they  have driven a wedge into Buddhist unity. They have written  documents distorting the truth and have taken advantage of our  open-door policy and our expansion in international exchanges  and telecommunications to slip these documents out to the  external forces, rigging up a myth about Vietnamese Buddhism  crying for help for having suffered from persecution for the  second time.    Taking advantage of exiled Buddhists, a number of elements  converged on the headquarters of the European Paliament to stage  a hunger strike to press the parliament -- in session at the  time -- to pass an anti-Vietnam motion.    Regrettably, due to this pressure, representatives of  various  groups in the parliament drafted a motion and kept it handy.  Citing the petition of the exiled Buddhists as an excuse, the  European Parliament issued a motion calling on member countries  of the European Coordination Committee to pressure the  Vietnamese Government into respecting the freedom of religion.    In early October 1992, sponsored by a number of on-site  forces, the Rome-based Central Office of Overseas Vietnamese  Catholic Apostle Affairs Committee headed by Monsignor Tran Van  Hoai organized an inter-religious ceremony on behalf of various  overseas Vietnamese religions such as Buddhism, Protestanism,  Cao Dai, and Hoa Hao to pray for peace in Vietnam.    In their speeches, the head delegates all resorted to false  arguments to distort the truth, claiming that peace does not  mean an end to or the absence of war. Instead, peace  necessitates the respect for human rights, including freedom of  conscience and freedom of religion for all individuals and  organizations. In their opinion, the objective of this function  was to provide each religious group with a chance to think about  its responsibility toward the cause of democracy-building in  Vietnam. The Cao Dai group ambitiously maintained that since  mundane affairs are handled by the United Nations, so should  religious affairs. The United Religions may request the United  Nations to intervene with Vietnam in the human rights issue. At  last, the function gave birth to an extranenous body, the `92  Roma Group, formed by representatives of different Vietnamese  religious organizations overseas to continue to give advice to  the action program for peace and human rights in Vietnam.    A survey of the history of the Vietnamese revolution  indicates that for more than a half a century, the Communist  Party of Vietnam has guided the entire people in making the  great August Revolution a success, and henceforth, bringing  about national independence, civil rights, freedom, people's  material and moral welfare, and happiness. With the victory of  the two wars of resistance which lasted for 30 years, the nation  was reunified and people in both parts of the country now live  under the same roof. What was lost due to the division and  separation caused by the war of aggression can be recovered in  full now through a unified country which opens her arms to  welcome everyone, including different religious organizations.  The rumors about a bloodbath following the end of the war  turned out to be unfounded. We closed a final chapter,  conducting educational activities to help those criminals who  had participated in the old regime to mend their ways and become  useful citizens in society. Afterward, those elements also had  the chance to make their aspirations come true by obtaining  permission to leave for resettlement in foreign countries of  their choices under the ODP [Orderly Departure Program] and HO  [expansion unknown] Programs. It could be said that only a few  countries in the world have adopted the same humanitarian policy  like Vietnam where great importance is attached to human rights  and peace whereas repression, retaliation, and bloodshed are  nowhere to be seen. These traits mark the traditions and moral  values of the Vietnamese people.    Over the past years, in the framework of the renovation  policy, Vietnam has opened its doors to welcome all friends and  made every effort to integrate itself into the world community.  It is Vietnam's policy to befriend all countries of the world.  Vietnam has attracted investment to develop the national  economy and enhance everyone's material and moral welfare. The  people's lives have constantly been improved both materially and  spiritually. Society has become more and more civilized with  each passing day. The Vietnamese people in general and faithfuls  of different religions in particular are making joint efforts to  achieve and preserve noble goals, namely genuine peace and  respect for human rights that Vietnam has gained and is now  making sustained efforts to consolidate. There is no such  things as harsh treatment or discrimination based on religion  the outsiders are trying to accuse us of.    In our opinion, those who have left the fatherland and use  religion as a pretext to call on Vietnam to show respect for  human rights and to look squarely at the truth should follow the  examples set by overseas Vietnamese residents who are seeking  ways to contribute to national reconstruction, no matter how  insignificant their contributions may be. Let them stop  clinging to the human rights float as soon as possible and avoid  using religion as a smokescreen to cover up their crimes against  their fatherland and compatriots.</p>

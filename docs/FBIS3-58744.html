			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Quartermasters Leave For Bosnia </F> Tomorrow"]    [Text] A group of 21 members of the Dutch military are  leaving tomorrow for the Bosnian enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa  in order to prepare for the arrival of the reinforced battalion  of the light mobile brigade. This unit of 1,100 men is to  relieve the Canadian soldiers currently in the area. The  battalion may be able to leave as early as mid-February.    The Dutch Government yesterday received a further request  from the United Nations to send the 1,100 Dutchmen to Bosnia.  The soldiers' job will be to protect the population in the  Muslim enclaves and ensure the safe transport of humanitarian  aid.    An earlier mission by Dutch quartermasters failed when the  Bosnian Serbs refused their entry. The Dutch battalion had been  due to leave for Bosnia at the beginning of the year.    Military circles say the reason the Dutch are now being  allowed in is due to NATO's threat to use air strikes to ensure  the relief of the Canadians. At the Defense Ministry, however,  they are not so sure Bosnia's Serb fighters are not still going  to block the work of the quartermasters or the arrival of the  battalion, despite the fact that leaders Karadzic and General  Mladic have now agreed to the relief of the Canadians by the  Dutch.    The quartermasters need 10 days in order to inspect  locations  for the encampment of the men in the reinforced battalion. The  Dutch unit consists of 800 men from the light mobile brigade and  300 support troops. The light mobile brigade has armored  vehicles with heavy machine guns, mortars, and TOW [antitank  missiles] and Dragon antitank rockets. The mandate is to return  fire in self-defense. Ter Beek described this as `robust'  action in the Dutch Parliament.    The arrival of the light mobile brigade will bring the  number  of Dutch soldiers in and around the former Yugoslavia to almost  3,000.</p>

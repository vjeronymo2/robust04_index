			<p>BFN     [Text] The Economic Planning Agency's (EPA) research group  for strategic trade and industrial policy has put together an  analysis of government-led research projects. The analysis  indicates that the projects tend to be rigid with regard to  advances in technology and that the results cannot meet current  technology needs.    The agency is harshly critical of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] on the issue of  government-funded joint projects involving a number of  corporations. The research group's analysis is that there is  insufficient exchange of technical information among the  participating corporations, a considerable departure from the  essence of joint research.    EPA's research group has taken as examples three  representative joint development projects in the field of  information/electronics that MITI ran from the 1970's to the  1990's, analyzing their significance and problems.    The agency's research group had high praise for MITI's Very  Large-Scale Integrated Circuit [VLSI] Project (fiscal years  1976- 79) aimed at developing high-performance semiconductors,  in which Japan's major electronics manufacturers participated.  EPA's group praised the project for raising Japan's  semiconductor manufacturing technology to the highest level in  the world, laying the foundation for the development of the  nation's semiconductor industry.    However, the Supercomputer Project (fiscal years 1981-89)  and  the Fifth Generation Computer Project (fiscal years 1982-92),  two projects begun in the early 1980s, were found by the EPA  research group to have set development goals which were less  clear than those for the VLSI Project. In particular, the Fifth  Generation Computer Project's goal of developing artificial  intelligence despite declining interest in the technology was  judged to have left the project behind developments.    EPA's research group indicated that, although a number of  corporations participated in the joint development projects,  participation amounted to nothing more than each corporation  being given separate development subjects. The problem was that  there had been no joint development in the true sense of the  term. EPA's group is calling for more emphasis on the merits of  such practices as sharing technical information.</p>

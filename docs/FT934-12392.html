			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Scottish industry more confident COMPANIES in Scotland painted a markedly more positive picture of their situation in the Confederation of British Industry's industrial trends survey than that depicted by the UK-wide survey. Whereas a balance of only 1 per cent of respondents in the UK survey said they were more optimistic about the business situation than they were four months ago, in Scotland the margin was 21 per cent. That reflected a stronger trend in new orders both from the domestic and the export markets, although both areas did less well than expected. Output was higher, though less than expected, and stocks of finished goods were higher. For the first time since January 1990 Scottish manufacturers reported an increase in numbers employed, while those in the rest of the UK recorded another sharp drop. A 24 per cent positive balance of Scottish companies said they intended to increase investment spending in the next year, compared with a negative balance of 1 per cent in the UK as a whole. The planned increase in spending on plant and machinery was the greatest since 1988. The CBI's Scottish industrial trends survey analysed replies from 119 companies that are surveyed regularly.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / E Europe environment plea Environment ministers from east European countries meeting in Copenhagen yesterday called on the international development banks to provide them with soft loans for environmental investments. The conference, called by the Danish minister, Mr Svend Auken, to give the east Europeans a chance to put their views to the banks, was attended by ministers from 16 east European countries and by representatives from the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Nordic Investment Bank and the European Commission. The east European governments made clear at a conference last year on the environmental condition of the Baltic Sea that they would not be able to make environmental investments unless loans were granted on especially favourable terms. Clearing up the most serious sources of pollution in the Baltic would require at least Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn), according to Mr Auken: 'It is impossible to find financing of this order without changes in the rules of the game.' The development banks have insisted so far that all loans to east Europe, including environment loans, must be based on 'sound banking principles'.</p>

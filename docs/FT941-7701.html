			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commissioner rejects Gatt attack on EU banana regime Mr Rene Steichen, European agriculture commissioner, has rejected a report by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade attacking the European Union's preferential trade with banana producers in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. He said the report was unacceptable because of the political and economic consequences for the former colonies if the EU was forced to open its market to cheaper Latin American bananas. The Gatt report, published earlier this month, upheld a complaint by five Latin American banana exporters that trade with ACP states under the Lome convention contravened Gatt rules. 'Banana exports to the EU are the mainstay of certain ACP economies and the community is not prepared to walk away from these countries,' said a commission official. The commission has withdrawn an offer to increase access to Latin American bananas from 2m tonnes to 2.2m tonnes over two years because those countries did not accept the condition that they drop their complaint to Gatt. Brussels is due to submit proposals on market access, including bananas, to Gatt in the next few days. 'If those five countries came back before that and said we can accept (the increased offer), I can imagine one could find a means of putting it back on the table,' said the official. However, the Latin Americans want an increase in the quota to 2.5m tonnes, and reductions in tariffs for bananas both within and above the quota. They also want a reform the import licence system for bananas entering the EU, which they say discriminates against new producers. Mr Steichen said there might be a need for a one-off increase in imports, which would benefit Latin American growers, because of a recent shortage of supplies. But this would not affect the quota.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Gardner Merchant rises 50% after break from Forte Gardner Merchant, the contract caterer bought by the management from Forte for Pounds 402m at the end of 1992, lifted profits by 50 per cent for the year to January 31 and took turnover through the Pounds 1bn barrier. Europe's biggest caterer said no date had been set for its flotation, but City analysts suggested that if it were to come to the market this year, it could be valued at Pounds 600m or more. Gardner reported profits before interest and tax of Pounds 46.9m (Pounds 31.3m) on turnover up from Pounds 980m to Pounds 1.02bn. Margins improved from 3.2 to 4.6 per cent. The results were good, said one analyst, but they should have been better in 1992 when the management was distracted by bids and buy-out plans. Mr Garry Hawkes, chief executive, said the first year of independence had been 'one of the most successful years in our history'. He cited strong morale, helped by the fact that 1,000 managers were shareholders. Their 8 per cent stake is expected to rise to 20 per cent when the company is floated. A further 6,800 employees have been granted the right to share options. Mr Hawkes said the group was 'under no pressure from our investors' to float. But he added that the four-year gap mentioned at the time of the buy-out 'is longer than I would anticipate'. Strong cashflow enabled the group, which employs 47,000 worldwide, to cut its senior debt from Pounds 200m to Pounds 163m. Forte, the hotels group, has been criticised for disposing of two cash generative businesses in Gardner Merchant and Alpha Airports, the airport caterer. Shares in Alpha, floated in January at 140p, closed last night at 170p. However, Forte has retained a 25 per cent stake in both businesses. Yesterday also saw the Pounds 55.3m sale of Solartron, the instruments group bought by the management from Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, for Pounds 35m in November. Solartron has been acquired by Roxboro, the recently floated maker of specialist electronic and electrical products. Roxboro, Page 21</p>

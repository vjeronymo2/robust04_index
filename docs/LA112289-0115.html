			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MIXED COMPANY: Freshman Republican Assemblyman Curt Pringle of Garden Grove has  joined the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in an effort to repair his image with  the Latino community after his involvement in the posting of security guards at  poll sites last year. . . . But that hasn't won everybody over. . . . In fact,  Pringle's membership has outraged some members to the point that they are  threatening to quit, prompting board member Manuel Pena to put the Pringle  issue on the agenda for the next meeting.

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEAL FOR STRAWBERRY SEEMS TO MAKE FANS OF BOTH SIDES HAPPY  </P> <P> Daaaaaaryl. Daaaaaaryl. The hometown kid is coming home. Thanks to Dodgers'  Vice President Fred Claire (and $20 million), Crenshaw High's Darryl Strawberry  will be a Dodger for at least the next five years.  </P> <P> This is the best thing Claire or the Dodgers have ever done. Without  hesitation, Claire went after and got baseball's premier power hitter. The  die-hard Dodger fans are all well aware of the Dodgers' bad luck with free  agency (with the exception of one swing by Kirk Gibson), and so, we all held  our breath, praying that Claire and the Dodgers didn't let Strawberry get away  like a certain slugging free agent did in 1977. That slugger, Reggie Jackson,  of course, proceeded to then help the Yankees to two straight World Series  victories over the Dodgers.  </P> <P> Those of you who bleed blue blood became instant fortune tellers as soon as  Strawberry filed for free agency, sure that the Dodgers wouldn't sign him and  have the Mets beat up on the Dodgers for the rest of Strawberry's long and  fruitful career. But unlike past disappointments, Claire came through, so let  the championships start flowing in.  </P> <P> MATT ALBERT  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

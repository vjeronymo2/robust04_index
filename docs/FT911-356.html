			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Centrist party favourite in Nepalese poll NEPALESE voters went to the polls yesterday in this nation's first multi-party elections in 32 years, the outcome of which will determine the future of democracy in the tiny Himalayan Hindu kingdom. The Nepali Congress party, a centrist group backed by India, was the favourite going into the polls. But many observers believe no single party will muster an absolute majority. This would force the Congress party leaders to join the smaller parties, the Communists or the National Democratic parties, representing royalist interests, in a coalition government. There was a 60 per cent turnout at the polls, according to the Nepal Election Commission. Voters chose 205 MPs from among 1,345 candidates, representing 20 political parties, including 219 independent candidates. Twenty-five people were injured in election-related violence, the commission said. Police and soldiers were deployed throughout the country and the army reportedly fired shots over the crowd at two centres. Two ballot boxes were stolen in the Pyuthan district in mid-western Nepal, the sole constituency where the election is to be re-held. The Congress party and the Communist (United Marxist-Leninist) party were both seeking seats in the election. The two had joined forces just over a year ago in a popular revolt against Nepal's monarch, King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. That uprising resulted in a new constitution and the promise of a multi-party political system. Since then the Congress party and the Communists have ruled Nepal jointly through an interim cabinet led by prime minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai of the Congress party. Preliminary results were to be announced by this morning.</p>

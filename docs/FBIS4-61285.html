			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Maloveriyan] </F>   [Text] Tallinn May 5 TASS -- Russia and Estonia are toiling  over a draft agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops from  that Baltic republic. According to the leader of the Estonian  delegation Vaino Reinart, Estonia is ready to sign the agreement  and "the only obstacle to the signing is Russia's desire to link  the problem to the provision of social guarantees to the Russian  Army pensioners residing in the republic".    The Russian delegation leader Vasili Svirin met Estonian  President Lennart Meri on the eve of the today's round of  negotiations. According to him, the results of their  conversation provide grounds for the hope that the parties to  the drawn-out "divorce procedure" between Russia and Estonia  will be able to muster enough strength and desire to get down to  the search for compromise solutions.    "Russia pursues no military aims or interests in Estonia,"  Russian President Boris Yeltsin declared in the Kremlin on  Wednesday. He stressed that "Russia intends to withdraw all  troops from Estonia, but we want this to be done on a legal  basis, as is being done in relations between Russia and  Lithuania, Russia and Latvia". If Estonia manifests good-will,  we for our part will respond with full accord", Yeltsin said.    Negotiations behind closed doors will last for two days.  After the end of this, the nineteenth round of negotiations,  the heads of the delegations are expected to hold press  conferences on the results of negotiations.</p>

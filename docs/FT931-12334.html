			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Watson pays Pounds 21m for Circle K stores WATSON &amp; Philip, the Dundee-based wholesale and retail food group, is buying Ensign Holdings, the holding company for Circle K, a privately-owned convenience store business, for Pounds 21m. The shares jumped 30p to 333p on announcement of the deal which entrenches W&amp;P's position in the lucrative convenience store market. The group will issue 4.4m shares to Circle K and pay Pounds 7.66m in cash. Mr Ian Macpherson, chairman, said the acquisition was 'an exciting extension of W&amp;P's business into the growing convenience store market'. Mr David Liddle, managing director of Circle K, was not available for comment. Mr Macpherson said that, since acquiring Amalgamated Foods for Pounds 35.5m in April 1991, W&amp;P had been looking for ways of achieving sustainable growth. Market research it commissioned showed that the convenience store sector was an area of real growth potential. The group had been expanding its network of stores only in 'ones and twos', but the Circle K deal had increased its stores from 100 to 300 in England and Scotland. W&amp;P's core business was wholesale delivery of food to shops it did not own. It would benefit from economies of scale and access, for the first time, to franchising and forecourt stores, increasingly common at petrol stations. Mr Macpherson noted recent research showed discount food retailers had doubled yearly sales to Pounds 10bn in the past decade, while sales of goods at petrol forecourt shops rose by 10 per cent in 1992 to about Pounds 1.7bn. W&amp;P would also benefit from Circle K's modern retail computer system, based on electronic point of sale systems used by supermarkets but tailored to convenience stores' needs. About a fifth of the W&amp;P's pre-tax profits, which fell to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 11.8m) in the 53 weeks to October 30 1992, derived from retail stores, but that share would increase to 35 per cent. Circle K would be run initially as an autonomous business alongside W&amp;P's cash and carry, catering services, retail stores, and retail services divisions. Circle K management accounts show pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.8m for the eight months to November 29 last year, compared with Pounds 1m (Pounds 832,000) on sales of Pounds 125m (Pounds 126m) in the year to March 29. W&amp;P will assume its net borrowings of Pounds 3.3m, but benefit from Pounds 24m in unused tax losses. In March 1991, management at Circle K staged a buy-out of the company from owners Circle K Corporation of the US and News International, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group. Circle K Corporation, which owns 3,400 stores in 32 states, has traded under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1990.</p>

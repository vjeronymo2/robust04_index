			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arben Karapici] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] You will now hear two reports on  economic cooperation between our country and the world. An  agreement on Albanian-Austrian economic cooperation has been  reached in Vienna, but both sides are of the opinion that the  potential of cooperation relations between Austria and Albania  is still unexploited. Based on information provided by our  diplomatic representatives in Vienna, our reporter Arben  Karapici has prepared the following report:    [Karapici] The intensification of Albanian-Austrian inter-  governmental contacts and the exchange of visits to Vienna and  Tirana have inspired experts and observers to express the  opinion that economic cooperation between Albania and Austria  seems to be frequent and fruitful.    After the agreement on freeing the Albanian foreign debt,  which was reached in Vienna in early March by our bank governor,  Dylber Vrioni, another important document has been signed in the  Austrian capital -- an agreement on bilateral economic  cooperation. The agreement was signed by our industry and trade  minister, Selim Belortaja, and his Austrian counterpart Wolfgang  Schuessel. According to the agreement, the Austrian side is  committed to encouraging the development of projects with  priority in our country's economy through financial means. This  applies to industries dealing with the extracting and processing  of minerals, metallurgy, energy, forestry, etc. This latter  Albanian-Austrian agreement of Vienna also anticipates direct  Austrian investment in all the priority fields of bilateral  economic cooperation, with the participation of third countries  as well.    This concrete Austrian commitment has already been expressed  with the introduction into Albania of companies such as Rogner,  Suag [as heard], OeMV, etc., which are already involved in  important projects in tourism, airports, aqueducts, etc.    According to all the experts and observers who closely  follow  the frequent Albanian-Austrian cooperation, the results of the  economic revival of our country should not be far away, as long  as Austria shows itself as a very active partner in Albania.    More convincing is the argument that both parts still see  unexploited potential in the economic exchanges between Tirana  and Vienna. This was pointed out during the visit of Minister  Belortaja to the Austrian capital, where they held long  discussions about further cooperation possibilities. Thus, the  support that Austria is committed to granting to projects of  railroad network privatization should not be far off. In this  regard, it is reported that Vienna has accepted Tirana's  proposal to sign a new agreement in the field of goods and urban  transportation. There are chances to achieve this, and they are  considered high if we add the special interest shown in this  case by the Austrian Industrialists Association and businessmen  during Minister Belortaja's visit to Vienna.</p>

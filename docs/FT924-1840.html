			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Monopoly probe into Kent buses SIR BRYAN CARSBERG, director-general of fair trading, yesterday asked the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to investigate bus services in mid Kent. This is the first probe of its kind ordered into local bus services and represents a change of tactics by the government in its attempts to inject greater competition into the business. The investigation follows complaints from other bus operators about alleged anti-competitive behaviour by Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services, the largest operator in the mid Kent area. The allegations range from pricing below cost in an attempt to drive competitors out of the market to refusing other operators use of a bus station managed by Maidstone &amp; District. The commission has been given six months to report. The investigation will cover the state of competition in the districts of Maidstone, Rochester, Gillingham, Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells, Sevenoaks and Gravesham. Sir Bryan's announcement about mid Kent came ahead of today's House of Lords judgment in the Sheffield bus mergers case. In November last year the Appeal Court upheld an earlier High Court ruling overturning an MMC recommendation that South Yorkshire Transport should sell four rival bus companies acquired in 1989. That decision placed a severe limitation on the powers of the competition authorities to vet mergers leading to concentrations in local markets. The Sheffield case turns on the meaning of 'a substantial part of the UK' within the context of the market-share test set out in the 1973 Fair Trading Act. The High Court ruled in March last year that the Sheffield mergers should not be dissolved because the area of operation investigated by the MMC was not a 'substantial part of the UK' within the terms of the 1973 Act. When the Appeal Court upheld that ruling, the MMC tacitly accepted that, unless the House of Lords reversed it, the only effective way for the government to challenge local bus mergers and promote competition in services would be to ask the MMC to carry out an investigation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 1 Apr (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Jarcevic,  minister of foreign affairs of the republic of Serb Krajina  [RSK], today welcomed the UN Security Council resolution  extending the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate by six  months.    Noting that due to financial difficulties the United Nations  will send only 3,500 fresh soldiers, Jarcevic stressed in a  statement for Radio Yugoslavia that the shortage of soldiers  would be made up with the authority of the United States and  Russia because "they guaranteed that peace along the border  between the RSK and the Republic of Croatia would not be  violated."    The RSK foreign minister also welcomed the fact that NATO  will surveil the air space between the RSK and Croatia in order  to "protect the blue helmets."    Jarcevic expressed the hope that the RSK will be  internationally recognized in the next six months, that Zagreb  will understand that it cannot defeat Krajina militarily, and  that the Croatian demand to the United Nations to force the  Serbs to return to Croatia with NATO's help cannot be fulfilled.    "In its actions, Croatia must take as the starting point the  current state of affairs and the fact that Krajian exists,"  Jarcevic told Radio Yugoslavia.</p>

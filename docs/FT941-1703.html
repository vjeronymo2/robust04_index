			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Cashflow audit compliance stressed Companies must continue to comply with the requirements of the cashflow statement in spite of plans to revise it next year, the UK accounting standards watchdog warned yesterday. The Financial Reporting Review Panel said that companies must fully obey the provisions now contained in FRS 1 - the cashflow statement standard introduced in September 1991. The panel's statement was intended to remove any suggestion that revisions of FRS 1 being considered by the Accounting Standards Board would permit less rigorous compliance with existing requirements. The panel has already publicly reprimanded four companies for failing to implement FRS 1 effectively. Control Techniques, Breverleigh Investments, BM Group and Intercare have all been criticised on these grounds. In none of the cases did the auditors - Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Copeland &amp; Co, Kingston Smith and Price Waterhouse respectively - qualify the accounts. The panel is also believed to have considered several other companies which failed to comply with FRS 1, but which it chose not to pursue. The companies argued that the misclassifications in the accounts were trivial and were explained by the difficulties in interpreting the new standard.</p>

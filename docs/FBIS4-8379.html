			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by the government of the republic of Kosova"; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] The Greek terrorist attack on the Albanian military  barracks is one of the most grave infringements of Albania's  territorial integrity and is a flagrant violation of  international rights. This is not the first time that certain  Greek circles -- for which the Greek Government swears it has no  knowledge of -- have provoked the escalation of a situation of  violence and tension south of Albania with the aim of  destabilizing the new Albanian democracy and creating the  conditions for the realization of Greater Greece aspirations.    Statements by representatives of the most nationalist clergy  in the presence of Greek Government officials and the case of  the Greek priest who, fairly enough, was shown his proper place,  and many others culminate in the act of open terrorist attacks.    The government of Kosova expresses the outrage of its people  and cannot but assess that in these actions, it sees a  coordination with the Serbian policy in Kosova and Serbia's  efforts to open the southern front.    On this occasion, we want to remind Greece and Serbia that  any kind of attempt to open this front will be confronted with  the common answer of all Albanians and all the consequences it  can bring.    The government of the republic of Kosova thinks the chairman  of the EC Presidency should clearly dissociate itself through  concrete actions to condemn state terrorism and prevent such  phenomena before they take on Balkan dimensions. The statements  on a policy of good neighborliness and barbarous terrorism do  not correspond to the European climate.    Reminding that our neighbor has problems with more than one  country on its borders, we call on the international community,  the European Union, and other organizations to examine the  respect of international rights from its members and take  relevant measures to preserve democratic, common European  values, the statement by the government of the republic of  Kosova states.</p>

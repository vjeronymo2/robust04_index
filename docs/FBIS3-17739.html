He was analysing the preliminary results  of elections to the republic's Supreme Soviet at a press  conference today.    According to Chornovil, far more candidates, supported by  Rukh and democratic forces than were expected, have entered the  second round of the elections to the Ukrainian parliament. The  Rukh leader himself received over 62 per cent of the total  number of votes cast today. The most important thing is not to  let the second round of the elections disrupted, Vyacheslav  Chornovil said.    When asked whether he will present himself as a candidate  for  the probable presidential elections, Chornovil said that this  question will be decided at the second stage of the V Congress  of Rukh scheduled to be held in the second half of April.</p>

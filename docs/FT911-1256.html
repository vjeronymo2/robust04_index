			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Lloyd's Feltrim probe SUBSTANTIAL losses at the Feltrim underwriting agencies will be the first to be investigated under a procedure instigated last week by Lloyd's of London, the insurance mar-ket. Measures announced last week included the launch of an inquiry whenever a syndicate's net loss at the end of a three-year accounting period amounts to 150 per cent or more of the amount of premium a syndicate is allowed to write. Published figures for losses at Feltrim exceed this ratio, Lloyd's said, but exact figures for the losses have yet to be established. A meeting of Feltrim Names - outsiders who back Lloyd's with their personal wealth - is set for tomorrow. Editorial Comment, Page 18</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have received for publication the text of the  following press communique from the spokesman of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs:    Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: As is known,  on 6 March 1994, in a sociological poll initiated on the basis  of a presidential decree of 4 February 1994, the citizens of the  Republic of Moldova were called upon to answer the following  question:    Do you want the Republic of Moldova to develop as an  independent, united, and indivisible state within the borders of  the date of the proclamation of its sovereignty, 23 June 1990, a  state that will promote a policy of neutrality, maintain  mutually advantageous relations with all world countries, and  guarantee equal rights to all its citizens in accordance with  the norms of international law?    The poll was explained through the absolute need to  stabilize  the sociopolitical and economic situation, create favorable  conditions to strengthen the independence of the Republic of  Moldova, and ensure its territorial integrity.    For us, it is only an exercise of testing public opinion and  we will treat it as such. We note, however, the tendency of  certain forces to unilaterally and generally view it as a firm  answer to a question to which only history has the right to  provide an answer. It is regrettable that these forces continue  to make efforts to win political capital and to exacerbate  Romaniaphobia.    At this time, too, we very firmly reject such attempts to  distract public opinion from the real problems and causes of the  situation in the Republic of Moldova and from the real threats  to its independence.    Romania was the first state to recognize the independence of  the Republic of Moldova, to which it has granted and continues  to grant its entire political, diplomatic, and moral support to  contribute to its affirmation at the international level.    The Romanian Government has pledged to grant material  assistance for the benefit of all the citizens of the Republic  of Moldova to overcome the difficult times generated by the  economic and social difficulties they are confronting.    Romania will continue to support the consolidation of the  independence of the Republic of Moldova and will work toward  economic integration of the two Romanian states and toward  strengthening our common cultural and spiritual area, the press  communique of Romania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs concludes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Emergency Decree" issued by President Carlos Roberto Reina </F> during a Council of Ministers meeting in Tegucigalpa on 21  April; read by reporter Lourdes Bonilla at the Presidential  House -- live relay]    [Text] Whereas, the expansion of electrification programs  carried out in the last few years throughout the country has  resulted in a substantial increase in demands for energy by  users in the productive sector and by individuals,    Whereas, the power-generating capacity of hydroelectric  plants and complexes, as well as that of state-owned thermal  centers, has been seriously reduced by today's energy demands,    Whereas, the power-generating capacity has been affected by  rainy seasons characterized by little rain, as a result of which  water levels required by dams to secure the energy supply have  not been maintained,    Whereas, the Valle de Sula region in particular has  witnessed  accelerated growth in the use of energy because of the demand  required for the installation of assembly processing plants and  industrial plants,    Whereas, it is evident that during the previous  administration no timely measures were adopted to try to resolve  the looming energy crisis,    Whereas, the deficit in energy production in the face of  high  demand forces the state to consider the need to incorporate the  private sector into the sector for power generation and  distribution of energy, thus allowing the National Enterprise  for Electric Power [ENEE] to devote greater efforts and  resources to the search for other sources for generating  electric power,    Whereas, the state, through ENEE, is forced to guarantee the  energy supply in an efficient and timely manner, so as to  preserve the nation's energy security to guarantee the  development of the national economy and national social  interests,    Whereas, until Congress approves the Energy Sector Draft  Bill, which is now before the Congress awaiting discussion,  debate, and passage, it is necessary to adopt urgent measures to  meet energy demands in a way that will provide maximum benefit  to users and the country in general,    Whereas, since 28 March of this year the president of the  Republic, in light of the emergency confronting energy supplies,  created an executive branch commission to study the causes and  effects of said crisis in order to adopt the most appropriate  measures for resolving the same,    Whereas, according to Article 245 of the Constitution, it is  the responsibility of the president of the Republic to  administer the state and as he has the specific power to decree  special measures regarding economic and financial matters, as  required by the national interests and provided he notifies the  national Congress,    The Presidency of the Republic -- in exercising the powers  granted it by Articles 24, Paragraph 1 and Points 11, 20, 35,  and 252 of the Constitution of the Republic; Articles 11, 22, 9,  and 117 of the General Law of Public Administration; and Article  160, Paragraph 1 of the Law of Contracting by the State --  resolves:    Article 1: To authorize ENEE to proceed, considering the  existing critical circumstances, through simultaneous bidding or  direct contracting, to obtain the required energy from national  and/or international sources. This will permit the country to  secure the appropriate continuity and effectiveness of the  energy sector to the benefit of different national sectors.    Article 2: To create the Energy Sector Emergency Commission  to advise, support, and aid ENEE in examining and handling the  crisis, as well as in making whatever decisions are necessary to  deal with the crisis in an effective, concrete, and appropriate  manner.

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL NCAA REGIONAL;  </P> <P> UCLA RETAINS MASTERY OF STANFORD  </P> <P> Saturday night's match between top-ranked UCLA and No. 3 Stanford could well  have been played for the national championship, had regional scheduling  cooperated.  </P> <P> It didn't, and Stanford will have to try again next season.  </P> <P> The top-ranked Bruins, utilizing the balance and consistency that has become  their trademark, pounded away methodically at the Cardinal, winning the West  Region in three games, 15-10, 15-8, 15-12, before 2,250 at UCLA's Wooden  Center.  </P> <P> For Stanford (27-4), the frustration continues against the Bruins, who are 3-0  against the Cardinal this season and 24-9 overall -- including the last eight  in a row.  </P> <P> The Bruins (34-1), who will meet Louisiana State in the Final Four semifinal  next Thursday in College Park, Md., have now won three consecutive NCAA  regional finals and are 7-1 in regional finals play.  </P> <P> "We were put in a tough situation," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said of his team's  placement in the West along with the Bruins.  </P> <P> "Here we have two of the top three teams in the nation and we have to play in  this situation."  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski agreed.  </P> <P> "Stanford is probably the most underrated team in the country," he said.  </P> <P> "I've thought all along that they should be No. 2. (Saturday night) was a good  example of high-quality volleyball and it's a shame the whole country won't be  able to see it."  </P> <P> After a fairly close -- and lengthy -- first game, it was clear that the  Cardinal was indeed a tough situation. A tough serving game and the setting of  Holly McPeak served to take the Cardinal out of its offense.  </P> <P> "It was a long game, but we gave them too many contact points," Shaw said.  "That kept them in the game."  </P> <P> Perhaps, but McPeak had 61 assists and did an excellent job of reading  Stanford's blockers, and providing for a balanced offensive attack from all  areas of the court in all three games.  </P> <P> "Their outside blockers were cheating in, so I tried to set a lot of flares and  run more to the right side to avoid Bev (Oden) and Jessica (Benton)," McPeak  said.  </P> <P> She was successful as Oden, the Pacific 10 Conference player of the year, was  largely kept out of the game with only 18 kills, a team high but well below her  usual performance. Benton finished with 10 kills.  </P> <P> "UCLA didn't really take me out of the game," Oden said. "They did a good job  blocking everyone."  </P> <P> Four Bruins were in double figures in kills, with Natalie Williams leading the  way with 26.  </P></p>

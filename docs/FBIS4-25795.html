			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 14 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese road  construction company has been awarded a government project in  Malaysia to upgrade a road section in the City of Ipoh, Perak.    Under the 35 million ringgit (about 13.5 million U.S.  dollars) contract signed here today, China Road and Bridge  Corporation will widen a six km stretch of Jalan Tasek from two  lanes to four within 30 months, involving also the construction  of two bridges, 150 km and 30 km long respectively.    The contract was singed by Public Works Department Director  General Wan Abdul Rahman Yaccob representing the Malaysian  Government and Yao Haidong for the Chinese company. Malaysia's  Works Minister Leo Moggie and Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia  Qian Jinchang witnessed the signing.    Yao told reporters that although the project is his  company's  first ever awarded in Southeast Asia, it has been an  international contractor since 1979, with 235 contracts of  construction and labor service worth a total of one billion U.S.  dollars concluded in many countries of Asia and Africa.</p>

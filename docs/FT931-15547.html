			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Dai-Ichi shuts Bombay office DAI-ICHI Kangyo Bank, the big Japanese bank, is closing its representative office in Bombay after seven years of operation. The closure of the office, which has a staff of three, is part of a restructuring of Dai-Ichi worldwide. The move partly reflects the fall in the volume of Indian government commercial loan issues following the downgrading of India's credit rating 18 months ago by Standard and Poor's, the US rating agency.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERIORS: BORDERS: THEY'RE NOT JUST FOR WALLS ANYMORE;  </P> <P> PAPER OFFERS DECORATING POSSIBILITIES ON CEILINGS, FURNITURE, DOORS AND EVEN ON  THE FLOOR.  </P> <P> They're off the walls.  </P> <P> Now they're on furniture, ceilings, around windows, on closet doors and even on  the floor. And the decorating possibilities on the wall are more creative than  ever before.  </P> <P> They're wall-covering borders, and they're one of the hottest looks in home  fashions today, reports the Western Wallcovering Distributors Assn. (WWDA).  </P> <P> Borders, which have been available for many years, have surged in popularity as  consumers and decorators recognize the versatility and nearly limitless  decorating possibilities they offer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Classic to Contemporary  </P> <P> Available in styles and colors to coordinate with wall-covering patterns that  range from classic to contemporary to country, borders can be found to suit the  infant, active teen, cook or man of the house.  </P> <P> Patterns can even be found to reflect the resident's personality or hobby,  adding a bit of whimsical charm to a room, such as teddy bears, soccer players,  cooking utensils or mallard ducks. Colors span clean neutrals to soft pastels  to bold primaries.  </P> <P> "Borders are ideal for the person who's using wall covering for the first time.  They're economical, pre-trimmed, easy-to-hang and easy to update," according to  Peter Hermann, vice president of design for Imperial Wallcoverings. "Moreover,  many are pre-pasted and strippable or peelable for easy application and  removal.  </P> <P> "Borders can do for a room what the right scarf can do for a plain dress: give  it a dose of color, dress it up, and add to its creative potential. They're  also one of the simplest and fastest ways to give a room a face lift -- even on  a budget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Open Their Thinking  </P> <P> "Borders can also provide solutions to many of a room's decorating problems.  They can create architectural interest, emphasize a room's unique architectural  elements, tie a room together or even hide a room's imperfections."  </P> <P> Hermann advises the do-it-yourselfer to open up their thinking when working  with borders and not be limited to traditional applications. Here are some  starter ideas from Hermann and WWDA:  </P> <P>  -- Apply a wide wall-covering border on plywood to create an unusual window  valance. For added drama, extend the valance with the border around the room or  use a coordinating fabric in the room's accent pillows or fabrics.  </P> <P>  -- Create an easy stencil look by applying a stencil-type wall covering on  kitchen cabinets.  </P> <P>  -- Dramatize a dull window by framing it with wall covering borders, and  running the border around the room.  </P> <P>  -- Borders make a natural frame. Create architectural details in a boxy room  by framing doors and windows, or even a picture or mirror.  </P> <P>  -- Dramatize a fireplace by making it a room's focal point, placing a border  above the mantel or around the perimeter.  </P> <P>  -- Too-high ceiling? Bring a room down to size by applying a wall-covering  border at the wall height you prefer.  </P> <P>  -- Tie a room together by trimming a room's accessories and accent pieces --  such as a lamp shade, window shades, planters, shelves, bookends and blotters  -- with a border in a coordinating color and pattern.  </P> <P>  -- Outline a window seat and alcove with borders. Use coordinating fabrics for  throw pillows.  </P> <P>  -- Create an inexpensive chair rail effect by running one of the popular wide  borders around a room at chair level. For a wainscotting effect, hang  coordinating wall coverings above and/or below the border.  </P> <P>  -- For a child's room, add color by trimming toy boxes, hampers, chests of  drawers with borders.  </P> <P>  -- Create an inexpensive headboard by framing the headboard area with a  border. Fill in headboard area with a coordinating wall covering.  </P> <P>  -- Create your own custom "rug" by gluing a rectangle cut from a roll of wall  covering to a wood floor and edge with an accenting border. Coat with  polyurethane for protection.  </P> <P>  -- Accent dormers with borders mounted on plywood strips for a dimensional  effect.  </P> <P> For a 20-page, illustrated step-by-step guide to measuring and hanging wall  covering, send $1 for postage and handling to Western Wallcovering Distributors  Assn., 3600 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 200, Los Angeles, Calif. 90010.  </P> <P> </P></p>

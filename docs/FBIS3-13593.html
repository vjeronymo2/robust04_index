			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 15 Mar (INA)--Foreign Minister Muhammad  Sa'id al-Sahhaf has asserted that the position of the  international community at the UN Security Council [UNSC] has  clearly tilted in Iraq's favor.    In an interview with Iraqi television aired tonight, the  minister added that most UNSC members have actually begun to  call for the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687,  and that their consciences are now burdened by the Iraqi  people's sufferings, which are caused by the continued  enforcement of the criminal and unfair embargo.    The minister maintained that Iraq is bound to emerge  victorious, noting that the Iraqi people's patience is  matchless, because they have held out in the face of the most  ferocious onslaught in history.    The minister went on to say: Since inspection teams started  their work, there has been full compliance with the unfair  resolutions passed against Iraq.    The minister wondered how many paragraphs of the unfair  resolutions passed against Iraq have violated its sovereignty  and independence, how many violations Iraq has suffered, and who  drew up the parallels that encroach upon Iraq's national  sovereignty.    Al-Sahhaf noted that the game of the handling of Resolution  687 has become clearer, not only to politicians, but also to all  citizens, and to all observers who take an interest in this  matter, which is in violation of all UN conventions and  international laws.    The minister said: Resolution 687 was passed on 3 April 1991  after it was submitted to the UNSC by the arch-leaders of  colonialism. Sixteen drafts of this resolution were made.  After that, new amendments and changes were introduced into it.  Only then was it put to a vote. Twelve members of the UNSC  voted in favor of the resolution. Cuba voted against it,  because it is a courageous and audacious country. Two  nonpermanent members of the UNSC, Ecuador and Yemen, abstained.    Certain countries, such as China, voted in its favor, but  explained their positions, criticizing several paragraphs of  this resolution.    The foreign minister added: This resolution consists of an  introduction and 34 operative paragraphs. It is lengthy and  complicated. Its operative paragraphs were deliberately divided  into nine sections, the pivotal points are in Section C, which  was addressed by leader President Saddam Husayn in his valuable  speech the day before yesterday. On 3 April 1991, the  resolution was passed. On 6 April 1991 Iraq informed the UNSC  of its frank and clear stand on the resolution in a lengthy and  refined message grounded in the rules of international law and  the UN Charter. Iraq addressed all these paragraphs in  accordance with the rules of international law. It explained  how these paragraphs violate the rules of international law. At  the end of the message, and this is an important thing that I  must mention, Iraq, through then Foreign Minister Ahmad Husayn,  said "while noting these principled, legal, and legitimate  remarks, Iraq urges conscientious members of the international  community and the public to see the facts as they are, and to  vindicate justice as appropriate. Given all of the above, Iraq  has no choice but to accept this resolution." We demanded that  this message be circulated as a UNSC document. The request was  fulfilled.    The minister went on to say: The purpose was to confirm our  legal and legitimate rights, which are grounded in the UN  Charter and the rules of international law, so that these rights  could not be mistaken, even though we accepted this resolution  under the circumstances. The second remark I would like to  make, which is an extremely important one, is the following:  Line 3 of the preamble of Resolution 687 stipulates that all  member states are committed to safeguarding Iraq's sovereignty,  territorial integrity, and political independence. The authors  of this resolution violated the basic concepts enshrined in this  sentence in several paragraphs of the same resolution. Several  paragraphs of the said resolution conflict with these basic  concepts, which are cherished by the international community.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf noted that this remark should be  made so that we may understand the facts pertaining to the  unfair and sweeping embargo clamped on Iraq.    Al-Sahhaf added: Resolution 661 of 6 August 1990 explained  why this unfair embargo was imposed. It said that the embargo  was imposed because Iraq had not accepted Resolution 660 of 2  August 1990. What about Resolution 660? Resolution 660  consists of two paragraphs calling upon Iraq to withdraw from  Kuwait, and urging Kuwait and Iraq to negotiate to resolve their  problems. It also states that the UNSC welcomes all efforts to  achieve this, especially the efforts of the Arab League.    Al-Sahhaf went on to say: Iraq later accepted all these  resolutions, including 660, 661, etc. As for the UNSC, it did  not honor its commitments. Then, they drafted this resolution,  thus "forgetting about" all their previous resolutions. They  set new conditions and brought about a new situation that  exposes the true motives for the aggression against Iraq.</p>

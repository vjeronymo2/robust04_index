The statement reminded that scores of innocent Muslims had  been martyred or wounded in the bombardment and added that the  incident was one aftermath of the treacherous policies of some  in their dealings with the Zionist regime and of the so-called  appeasement policies in the region.    It said such incidents are proof that aggression and  trespass  against others is the inherent nature of the Zionist entity and  that any effort aimed at conciliation with the Zionist regime  will bring only misery and self-humiliation (to the Muslim  nations).</p>

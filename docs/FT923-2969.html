			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Letter: How to stop Italy's debt pile Sir, Italy's national debt now amounts to more than Dollars 25,000 per inhabitant. Other countries are not far behind, including the Irish republic and Belgium, perhaps. In days of inflation of a good 10 per cent or so, the national debt could be halved in value or purchasing power in less than seven years, if not increased meanwhile; but if we are now to expect 3 per cent inflation then 23 years will be needed to halve the real debt in the unlikely event of debt stability. Italy is exceptional in that the country's savers themselves fund almost all the burden of debt. In effect, the Italian Treasury bonds lead to a vast exchange of lire between taxpayers and bondholders - the same individuals. What I ask is whether this piling of debts on top of each other can be stopped. If around 40 per cent of gross national product is about the maximum that an electorate is prepared to pay in taxes to prop up the state, how can debt payment of 12 per cent and more in interest be supported?

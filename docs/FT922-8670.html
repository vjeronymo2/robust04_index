			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London's robusta COFFEE managed to hold the gains established by midday, rising by Dollars 26 in near July to close at its high of Dollars 701 a tonne. Dealers said the market had become heavily oversold during the recent fall to the lowest levels for around 22 years, so the upward correction was not unexpected. New York arabicas were also ahead at midday. Dealers were keeping one eye on a meeting in Brazil between the government and the private sector. Last week, the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters said it would seek emergency measures to boost prices, and would also propose co-ordinating with other coffee nations. Costa Rica confirmed that it was considering taking some form of measures as a gesture of protest. 'All this may lift the market for a few weeks, but the oversupply is still going to be there,' one London dealer said. London COCOA prices closed mixed after trading in a Pounds 10 range. 'There's really nothing you can say about today, other than there was less origin selling,' one dealer said. The possibility of further sales later this week, however, was dampening any possibility of a rally. Compiled from Reuters</p>

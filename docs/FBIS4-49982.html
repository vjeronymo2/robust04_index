			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] The head of the civil service, Anson Chan Pang  On-sang, yesterday warned any attempts to destabilise the system  would be resisted. She also rejected a proposal for civil  servants to indicate before 1997 if they would be willing to  serve the Special Administrative Region government.    Mrs Chan, the Chief Secretary, said arrangements for the  continuity of the civil service had been set out in the Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law.    "Indeed senior Chinese officials, including the Director of  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, have already repeatedly  assured Hong Kong civil servants on this point," she said. "The  continuity of service provisions are very clear and we do not  believe that any further action is required."    The political sub-group of the Preliminary Working Committee  recently proposed that civil servants should indicate their  post-1997 plans. The proposal was criticised as a form of  political vetting.    Mrs Chan said civil servants did not have a political role  and their duty to serve the community should not alter before or  after 1997. The civil service would not pursue private agendas  or promote the policies of individuals, she said.    Despite China's refusal to discuss the line-up of senior  civil servants, Mrs Chan said the Government believed a dialogue  should begin as soon as possible. Only 22 positions would be  affected by requirements, regarding the nationality of civil  servants, in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, she said.    In the meantime, the Government would continue to fill the  most senior government posts with local officers while adopting  measures to restore the confidence of civil servants.</p>

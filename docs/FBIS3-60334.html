			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK Department of the Environment: </F> "Energy Efficiency First Signed by UK and Russia"]    [Text] An agreement that will take British energy  efficiency expertise to Russia was signed today by Environment  Secretary John Gummer and representatives of the Russian  Federation.    It is the first time that a western country has signed such  an agreement with Russia.    Speaking at the signing with Aleksander Kouzmitski, [name as  received] Deputy Minister of Science and Technology, Mr Gummer  said:    "I am delighted that the UK is at the forefront bringing the  benefits of energy conservation to Russia and that my  Department's Energy Efficiency Office has played a major role in  making this possible. This country has companies that are the  leading edge in this field and have much to offer."    "I warmly welcome this very practical sign of co-operation  between our two countries which I hope will blossom further. Our  companies can benefit through new trade opportunities while the  people of Russia will have warm, but energy efficient homes."    "All energy conservation is good for the planet. The more  energy efficient Russia can become the better it is for everyone  as pollution is reduced and fuel saved."    Through the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe  Energy Committee's Energy Efficiency 2000 programme  demonstration projects are being set up in Eastern Europe  including Russia.    British companies including Rolls Royce are interested in  taking part in a scheme aimed at improving energy efficiency in  10,000 Moscow flats owned by Gasprom, the Russian gas company.    As the projects are established it is hoped their ideas will  spread throughout the country offering increasing business  opportunities to British companies. The improvements would be  paid for from the saving in energy bills.  <H5>  Note to Editors </H5>   Also present at the signing at the Department of the  Environment in Marsham Street was Mr Boris Pamkin, Russian  Ambassador, and representatives of Rolls Royce, March Consulting  Group, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the  Russian Federation, the Foreign and Commonwealth office and the  Department of the Environment's Energy Efficiency Office.

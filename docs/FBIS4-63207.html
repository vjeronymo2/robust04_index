			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Kozlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Struggle against nationalism  in all its manifestations, for strict observance of human rights  should become a top priority area of cooperation between Russia  and the Council of Europe, said here on Thursday Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev at a meeting with Miguel Angel Marinez,  president of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe.    The minister noted that the Russian side feels concern over  the position of the Russian-speaking people in the Baltics.    Kozyrev confirmed Russia's desire to join the Council of  Europe and expressed hope that the practical solution of this  issue will not take more than one year.    The minister noted that May 21 marks another anniversary of  Andrey Sakharov's birth, a date which traditionally fills the  hearts of honest Russian people with a hope for the successful  continuation of the cause of this outstanding champion for human  rights.    "I believe that Russia will be Sakharov's Russia rather than  Zhirinovskiy's," stressed Kozyrev. He underlined that the  operating Constitution and democratically elected Russian  parliament are a guarantee that the present changes will be  irreversible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Israel and Post-Geneva Tricks"] </F>   [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin's government is trying to exploit  Arab contradiction and the lack of coordination among the Arab  parties participating in the peace process. One time it says it  is going to give precedence to the Syrian track over the other  tracks, and other times it says it is going to focus on making  the self-rule negotiations in Taba a success because it cannot  divide its interests and make concessions on two tracks all at  once.    While Rabin announced Israel's agreement to the "principle"  of withdrawing from the Arab Syrian Golan Heights, Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres warned the Palestinians that Israel may  give precedence to its negotiations with Syria over the  negotiations with the PLO. He said: "We have several options,  and we can change direction by moving from the Palestinian track  to the Syrian track, whereas the Palestinians have no other  option."    These Israeli threats would not have been made had it not  been for the present regrettable estrangement between the Syrian  and Palestinian sides since the announcement of the signing of  the Gaza-Jericho First agreement.    Just as the Israeli Government is trying to exploit the  Palestinian side's weakness, it is also using the same maneuvers  with the Syrian side and trying to undermine the successful  summit meeting held in Geneva last Sunday between Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton.    The Israeli response to the Syrian commitment to peace and  to  all its results--like exchanging ambassadors and trade relations  and opening borders in return for Israel's withdrawal from all  the occupied Arab territories--was suspicious and cautious. It  is represented in the prime minister's statement about  conducting a referendum before agreeing to withdraw from the  Golan Heights.    Proposing the referendum idea is part of the old Israeli  tactic designed to thwart any Arab peace plan. Rabin's  government knows well that the Syrian president has put the ball  in its court, as attested by the leader of the sole superpower  in the world, the United States. It is trying to get out of  this dilemma by looking for ways out that enable it to play for  time and to obstruct the driving force resulting from the Geneva  meeting, hence it has come out with the referendum idea. Thus  all that is being said in Israeli circles about disagreements  over this question is merely a kind of throwing dust in the eyes.    So all these Israeli maneuvers should not fool the Arabs,  especially the Palestinians and the Syrians. Because it is  untrue that they have no other options as Rabin and Peres say.  On the contrary, the Arabs of the occupied territories and the  men of the Islamic national resistance in southern Lebanon are  daily carrying out the most important option through their  daring operations against the occupation.    What is required is to restore organized coordination among  the Arab parties participating in the peace process as soon as  possible in order to close any gap through which the Israeli may  infiltrate to sabotage the peace process and exploit Arab  contradictions and differences.</p>

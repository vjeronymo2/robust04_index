Concerning the problem of  security, the situation remains confused in some estates of  Bujumbura, notably at Cibitoke, Kamenge, and Gikungu where  gunfire was heard last night. We contacted the commander of the  2d Intervention Battalion, Commander Appolinaire Ndayizamba, who  described to us the situation in the northern section of the  town last night. Commander Ndayizamba answers questions from  our colleague, Gregoire Nijimbere:    [Begin recording] [Ndayizamba] In the course of last night,  we heard sporadic shooting, notably from Gikungu, Gihosha,  Cibitoke, and Kinama districts of Bujumbura. I must tell you  that even if [word indistinct] conditions include leaving the  Kamenge area, this is not good enough, as long as these people  are not disarmed because those who acquired weapons did so for  their own aims. [passage omitted].    [Nijimbere] You were requested to withdraw, but after the  meeting between the prime minister and the president you were  requested to deploy wherever necessary and to intervene swiftly,  and to withdraw once security is restored. We would like to  know your reaction. Does this make your task of restoring peace  easier or does it complicate it?    [Ndayizamba] [passage omitted] We believe that the decision  is a political one. Those (?who made) it probably thought that  those shooting would stop but the fact is that they are  continuing to shoot. What we can say is that as long as these  people, who I would describe as.... [pauses] Well, these people  who are using weapons. As long as they are not disarmed,  security will continue to be problematic.    [Nijimbere] It seems two grenades exploded in the Gikungu  area. I would like to know about the situation there.    [Ndayizamba] The current situation there is that there were  some gunshots, some shots with handguns. Grenades were launched  with grenade launchers, rather, they were [word indistinct]  shells. There were no casualties among the Gikungu area  residents. After the shots -- I believe it was at 2000 -- there  were no further shots. The rebels withdrew, probably towards  the mountains, or hiding places, probably (?Kamenge). [end  recording]</p>

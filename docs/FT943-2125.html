			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Travel companies hit timing trouble: A look at the effects of launching next year's brochures during the summer The Travel Trade Gazette dinner - a black tie affair at London's Grosvenor House hotel - is usually an opportunity for the holiday industry to congratulate itself on its outstanding performance. As travel company executives gathered for the annual dinner last night, however, many were prepared to admit they had got this year's marketing badly wrong. By Christmas, bookings for summer 1995 could be down by as much as 10 per cent on last year. Some blame fragile consumer confidence, but several travel companies said they must take some of the responsibility themselves. Tour operators launched next summer's programme earlier than ever before - in the first week of August, when a third of travellers had not even taken this year's summer holidays. Mr Charles Newbold, managing director of Thomson, the largest tour operator, said sales of summer 1995 holidays had so far kept level with last year. But there were signs, he said, that sales were slowing down. By Christmas he expected them to be up to 10 per cent lower than last year. Thomson was the first operator to start selling summer 1995 holidays, publishing an 83-page brochure of family holidays at the beginning of August. Airtours, the second largest operator, hit back by publishing its full range of brochures, with 1,600 pages of holidays to destinations from Turkey to Thailand. Mr Newbold admitted that by launching brochures in August his company and its competitors missed out on selling to people on holiday at the time. He added, however, that there were competitive advantages - an early launch means you can take market share off competitors. Mr Peter Shanks, commercial director of Thomas Cook, the travel agents, said that while he understood tour operators' desire to be first to market, they managed to confuse both customers and travel staff. In August travel agents were expected to sell summer 1994 holidays, winter 1994-5 trips and summer 1995 packages all at the same time. Mr Shanks, who expected sales to have fallen 8 per cent by Christmas, said some tour operators announced their programmes in such a hurry that the brochures were not ready for another five days. Mr Ian Smith, managing director of travel agents Lunn Poly, which is owned by Thomson, said of the early brochure launch: 'It was a complete and utter farce from the travel agents' point of view. You couldn't cope with the number of customers coming through the door and people got disenchanted. We also had a number of staff on annual leave. 'We would much rather see brochures launched in September or October. I sincerely hope that the operators have learned something from this. There's no competitive advantage in an early launch because everyone else then does it too.' In spite of the confusion caused by the early brochure launch, Mr Smith disagreed with his colleagues about the effect it would have. He said demand was strong and he did not believe sales would be substantially down by Christmas. Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, also predicted there would be no slowdown in sales. Did he accept the criticism of the early brochure launch? 'Categorically not,' he said. 'He would say that, wouldn't he?' said Mr Francis Baron, chief executive of First Choice (formerly Owners Abroad), the third biggest operator, which published its brochures later than its two larger competitors. Mr Baron believed the market would be 7 per cent to 8 per cent down by Christmas. He said this was partly due to consumer caution about the durability of the economic recovery but he added: 'The message this year was very confusing. If you try to be too clever, consumers get suspicious.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Corporate and individual PC users here will have  easier access to a vast library of high-quality information  possessed by renowned foreign research institutes as Korea  Telecom (KT) launched a commercial Internet service in Seoul  yesterday.    Internet is the world's largest academic computer  communications network linking 63,000 host computers and LANs in  60 countries.    More than 2 million PCs are connected with each other  through  Internet and about 10 million subscribers are currently using  the service all over the world.    The new service, dubbed Kornet, is expected to provide  Korea's ordinary PC users with up-to-the minute information in  such fields as economics, culture, science and technology, by  way of E-mail, remote login, or file transfer, a KT spokesman  said.    The remote login service, for example, will enable Internet  subscribers in Seoul to freely operate super computers in the  United States.    "High-class information made public by world-class think  tanks such as NASA, Bell Laboratories, MIT, FDA, and Harvard and  Stanford Universities will be conveniently available to PCs at  home and offices here," he said.    The Kornet service will most certainly provide a turning  point in the upgrading of the nation's economic and  technological bases and form an important part of the proposed  information super-highway project, he noted.    So far, the Internet service has been offered to only a  small  number of state-run research centers.    Critics, however, say that Kornet's service charges ranging  from 25,000 won to 5.2 million won per month are "too expensive."    They also fear that a flood of "unhealthy" information would  be indiscriminately imported from abroad.    KT plans to expand the Kornet service by the end of this  year  to cover Pusan, Taegu and other large cities, the spokesman said.    Meanwhile, the state-funded telecom giant yesterday began to  offer a new DB (data base) service to help parents locate their  missing children through its PC communications network, Hitel.    "Parents whose children are missing can send their  children's  picture, age and address to Hitel and simultaneously check the  network's list of lost children through PCs.    A KT official said Hitel has been linked with police  computer  networks and a children's foundation responsible for taking care  of lost children, adding that information on a total of 8,000  missing children is currently available.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Pressure on Dollars Investor support for the dollar weakened yesterday following the release of weak sales and inflation data and uncertainty surrounding trade talks with Japan, writes Philip Gawith. Market attention was focused on the Washington summit between President Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. Trade was initially directionless, but the dollar started to slide when pessimism set in about the talks. It closed in London at Y107.9 against Y108.450 on Thursday. Sterling finished the week slightly stronger after earlier falling more than 5 pfennigs in a negative response to Tuesday's 25 basis point cut in interest rates. It closed in London at DM2.5685, up from DM2.5625 on Thursday. The dollar lost ground against the D-Mark as the release of weak data combined with scepticism about the likelihood of a Bundesbank rate-cut on Thursday. It closed in London at DM1.7517, marginally down on Thursday's close of DM1.7534. Seasonally adjusted total retail sales fell by 0.5 per cent compared to a forecast increase of 0.4 per cent. January producer prices rose by 0.2 per cent, lower than the 0.4 per cent gain forecast. The market sold the dollar reasoning that these figures made a further tightening in US policy more distant. Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the figures which were distorted by bad weather and an earthquake. Against the yen, meanwhile, the succinct view of one observer was that 'most people don't have a clue where the rate is going.' The tenor of comments emerging from US and Japanese officials was not encouraging. Late yesterday US Commerce Secretary Mr Ron Brown told a TV station that the trade talks were not going well. 'We are very disappointed. They (the negotiations) still don't look good.' Earlier the yen rose against the dollar after a senior US official refused to rule out retaliation if the talks failed. 'We want a good agreement or no agreement. We won't settle for anything less,' the official was quoted as saying. Earlier comments from US vice-president Al Gore also had an air of preemptive damage limitation about them. Mr Clinton and Mr Hosokawa sought agreements which offered cheaper foreign goods to Japanese consumers and new export opportunities for US companies. Some observers took comfort from the fact that both leaders have reputations as dealmakers. Mr Paul Lambert, currency economist at UBS, said if a deal emerged, attention would shift towards economic fundamentals which favoured a stronger dollar. The recent strength of the yen has been largely a function of political considerations, although foreign buying of equities has also helped the currency. Sterling fell below DM2.56 and Dollars 1.46 on news of a higher than expected trade gap with the rest of world in November. It later recovered to finish the day half a cent higher at Dollars 1.4663. The D-Mark was firmer across the board in late European trade with the prospect of a Bundesbank rate cut on Thursday increasingly discounted. It closed at Ffr3.40 and L965.3 respectively against the French and Italian currencies, marginally stronger in both cases. The Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 950m of assistance in line with its revised forecast for the day.</p>

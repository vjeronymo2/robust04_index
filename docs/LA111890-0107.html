			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROADWAY MALADIES;  </P> <P> ALL HIS JAZZ; THE LIFE AND DEATH OF BOB FOSSE BY MARTIN GOTTFRIED (BANTAM:  $24.95; 460 PP.);  </P> <P> INVENTING CHAMPAGNE; THE MUSICAL WORLDS OF LERNER AND LOEWE BY GENE LEES (ST.  MARTIN'S PRESS: $22.95; 352 PP.)  </P> <P> It used to be called the longest street with the shortest memory. No longer.  Today, just about all Broadway has is its souvenirs. The American musical, one  of our few native art forms, is shuffling off to extinction. Of the seven  home-grown productions currently on display, five are revivals of a time that  will come no more.  </P> <P> And yet until quite recently, the Broadway melody was our unofficial anthem.  You don't have to go back to the palmy days of the Gershwins, Rogers and Hart,  Jerome Kern or Cole Porter. After all, it was only three years ago that one of  the theater's most influential directors suffered a fatal heart attack on a  Washington street. The 60-year-old had been rehearsing numbers half a block  away.  </P> <P> Bob Fosse went out of show business the way he came in: full of an  inexhaustible appetite for success and self-annihilation. This is no news to  anyone who saw "All That Jazz," Fosse's autobiographical film that oscillated  between hagiography and hatchet job. But as critic Martin Gottfried shows in  this intelligent anecdotal study, the man was neither as imperial as he claimed  nor as vile as he felt.  </P> <P> Fosse was brought up in a religious home on the North Side of Chicago. Pop sold  insurance; Mom saw to it that the five kids got an education. Bob's was in a  dancing school, and then as part of an act called the Riff Bros. The innocent  teen-ager hoofed and puffed his way into burlesque. "I was really unhappy and  scared," Fosse was to recall. "It left certain impressions on me that weren't  too good. I was too young to be exposed to naked ladies."  </P> <P> Fosse never really outgrew that period. In his work, sex became tinged with  guilt and voyeurism. In private life, the permanent adolescent, doubtful about  his masculinity, kept trying to reassure himself with nonstop affairs. They  persisted through three marriages -- the most enduring to Gwen Verdon -- and  they continued beyond his early success as a $100-a-week choreographer of  "Pajama Game," past the time in 1972 when he won a Tony for "Pippin," an  Academy Award for "Cabaret" and an Emmy for a Liza Minnelli special. By then,  he was living on Dexamil, and no sexual or professional triumph could last.  After receiving the triple crown, he told friends that he felt "terrific for  six days. Then, after seven, I thought, 'It's all false.' They made me feel I  fooled everybody."  </P> <P> But as "All His Jazz" painfully records, if Fosse fooled anyone it was himself.  From opening night to final curtain, he kept the con in confidence. His nervous  energy provided the supercharge in all of his shows, but the theater and its  audiences were changing before his myopic eyes.  </P> <P> Fosse's last production flopped out of town. The musical he was rehearsing when  he died was a revival of an old hit, "Sweet Charity." It was an irony he might  have relished: Broadway's progressive force was looking in the rear-view mirror  when he crashed. Fosse could have made a movie of it. But not a musical. These  days, British imports entice the advance sales: "Phantom of the Opera," "Cats,"  "Aspects of Love," "Les Miserables," "Miss Saigon."  </P> <P> Then again, the American theatergoer always has been an Anglophile, something  that Alan Jay Lerner and Fritz Loewe emphatically demonstrated on March 15,  1956. That was the night "My Fair Lady" opened at the Mark Hellinger. Recalling  the epochal moment, Gene Lees writes, "Lerner and Loewe, were now the royalty  of the theater." That is a fair summary of the collaborators' professional  status -- and the prose style of "Inventing Champagne": Lees, author of books  about Oscar Peterson and a number of jazz singers, seems far more comfortable  with the ambiance of smoky nightclubs than in the autumnal atmosphere of  Schubert Alley.  </P> <P> Still, his subjects are so complex and contradictory that they might elude a  gaggle of Pulitzer Prize authors. Loewe was the ur-Viennese composer whose  forebears included Lehar and Romberg. Lerner was made in America, born to  wealth, educated at Choate and Harvard, where he was a classmate of John F.  Kennedy.  </P> <P> Loewe was married (and divorced) once, and had one main collaborator. Lerner  was married eight times, and had eight creative partners. Loewe refused to get  excited by adverse criticism or bad luck; disdain was his weapon. Lerner was  born with sand under his skin; any slight, real or imagined, was enough to  upset him for weeks. Out of these differences arose a creative tension that  produced "Brigadoon" and the lesser "Love Life" before the team crested with  "My Fair Lady."  </P> <P> They were never to find that form again. The rich score of "Camelot" brought  them renewed attention, but the production was in fact a slovenly and hazardous  affair. In the end, nobody seemed to know what it was trying to say or be.  Especially Lees.  </P> <P> "The story," Lees informs us, "is about two men who love each other having an  emotional and continuing physical relationship with the same woman, which after  a time becomes obvious as a homosexual fantasy." (This interpretation would  come as a surprise to Lerner and Loewe, to say nothing of Thomas Malory, who  started the whole thing by writing "La Mort d'Arthur" in the 15th Century.)  </P> <P> Director Moss Hart suffered a heart attack during the production of "Camelot."  So did Loewe. Lerner avoided the cardiologists. He had bleeding ulcers. "We  will all be replaced tomorrow by hospital orderlies," Loewe cracked. It was  truer than he knew.  </P> <P> In better times, the elegance of "Gigi" burnished the reputation of the  composer and lyricist, but today the movie has a slightly cobwebbed look, as if  it had been written about another century in another century. Loewe eventually  retired to his yacht, his gambling and his harem of young women. Asked whether  he missed the creative process, the composer replied, "I have discovered the  bedroom."  </P> <P> Like Fosse, Lerner persisted in the craft that would destroy him. Addicted to  amphetamines and recognition, he worked with a series of collaborators on shows  as varied as "On A Clear Day You Can See Forever" with Burton Lane to the  catastrophic "Dance a Little Closer" (dubbed "Close a Little Quicker") with  Charles Strouse.  </P> <P> Nothing came close to the adventures of Liza Dolittle, and one day Lerner awoke  to find himself irrelevant. His bitter observation seems more valid now than at  his death at 67 in 1986 (Loewe passed on two years later, as old as the century  itself.) With certain rare exceptions, Lerner noted, "the music in the theater  today bears no resemblance to the music that is popular on the outside."  </P> <P> Unless things change dramatically -- and melodically -- that line should serve  as an obituary for the American musical. Then, in death, it can finally recover  its singularity: Throughout all history, no art form will ever have fallen so  far so fast.  </P></p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Management: Hostage to fortunes - Kidnapping / A look at the role played by insurers The abduction of estate agent Stephanie Slater has aroused fears that kidnapping and extortion could become one of the biggest commercial crimes in Britain. As companies tighten security, protecting premises with closed-circuit television and installing safes that are impossible to crack or blow open, criminals may be turning to abduction and blackmail as more effective routes to a company's assets. Insurance brokers which arrange cover against such incidents - so-called kidnap and ransom insurance - are predicting growth in what remains one of the least-publicised and most sensitive sectors of the market. Slater's case has provoked widespread publicity because a Pounds 175,000 ransom was paid and the kidnapper - so far - has not been caught. But it was not an isolated incident. Control Risks, a company specialising in corporate security, has reported that recorded kidnaps increased 42 per cent in 1989 and 66 per cent in 1990. Of the 4,890 kidnaps that have been recorded by Control Risks since 1975, however, only 109 were insured. Kidnap and ransom insurance has yet to catch on, possibly because of its low profile. Annual premium income is only Dollars 70m worldwide, Dollars 40m of that underwritten at Lloyd's of London. But Gus van Lanschot, deputy managing director of Willis Faber and Dumas, the largest broker in the field, warns that the latest incident could spawn copycat cases and could prompt more companies to investigate cover. Most K and R packages, he says, go far beyond simple indemnity against loss incurred in paying ransoms. They include advice and training from security specialists on lessening risks, and, in the event of an incident, a full 'crisis management' programme. This means an experienced consultant being assigned to the company to discuss what action to take, to manage relations with the press, the authorities and members of the victim's family, and to conduct negotiations with the kidnappers. This, insurers say, can lessen the amount of any ransom paid and often give the authorities more time to find the abductor. Advisers can be particularly useful when the incident occurs overseas, where attitudes of the authorities towards kidnappings can be different from the softly-softly approach employed in Britain and the US. Cassidy Davis, the largest Lloyd's underwriter of K and R policies, stresses that specific conditions are always attached. Policies provide only for reimbursement after a ransom has been paid. No insurer would pay or fund a ransom payment. Confidentiality is paramount, and the existence of an insurance policy is never disclosed. Insured parties must always co-operate with law enforcement agencies. Tony Colla, managing director of the risk benefits division at Sedgwick, another broker offering K and R policies, says clients range from multinational companies to wealthy individuals and small family businesses. He advises companies to cover all employees: it is a popular misconception that the most likely targets for kidnapping are company directors. The subject of kidnap insurance remains a sensitive one. Italy, where commercial kidnapping has been a serious problem for many years, has moved to outlaw such cover. In the 1980s the EC considered doing the same, following a call for a Europe-wide ban by Garret Fitzgerald, the former Irish prime minister. The charge is that the very availability of such cover may act as an incentive to kidnappers. Colla counters that kidnapping has been happening for hundreds of years, while insurance policies have been available only since the early 1970s.</p>

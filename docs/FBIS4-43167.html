			<p>Europe   <F P=102>   94P20795 </F> <F P=103> 94P20795 </F> <F P=104></F>    CSO     [Editorial Report] President Francois Mitterrand's  statements on a nuclear test moratorium and his stance on  strengthening European institutions were the subjects of  commentary in the French press.  <H5>  Nuclear Moratorium </H5>   Alain Chastagnol discussed Mitterrand's opposition to  nuclear  tests in the 6 May Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN. While nuclear  deterrence was not mentioned in the French Government's defense  white paper, the president has consistently opposed renewed  nuclear testing, in contrast with Rally for the Republic (RPR)  leader Jacques Chirac, who remarked that "French credibility  requires that testing start again." To counter this opposition,  Mitterrand used "mental gymnastics" to appear as the firmest  guarantor of the nuclear strike force while simultaneously  opposing renewed testing, Chastagnol wrote. In his latest  statements, the president attempted to "impress" by discussing  at length the already-existing nuclear warheads, as well as  reaffirming that, as president, he has the exclusive right to  make decisions in this field. Chastagnol cited him as arguing  that President Clinton himself had extended the testing  moratorium and that France "did not wish to offend the whole  world" by renewing an armaments race and would substitute  simulated nuclear tests. According to Chastagnol, these  arguments are not convincing. Even if the United States decided  to prolong the moratorium until September 1995, it could at that  point end it, while relying in the interim on a simulation  program admittedly superior to France's. Chastagnol also  questioned Mitterrand's stated conviction that his successor in  the presidency would not start nuclear testing. France's  Council of Atomic Energy (CEA) has launched a study program to  prepare for a "limitation" of nuclear tests before achieving  successful simulations; however, Mitterrand has rejected  previous testing and asked that simulation proceed without it.  According to Chastagnol, the president's statement was clearly  not aimed at national defense, but at needling Chirac while  pleasing ecologists. The statement was also not convincing to  those white paper skeptics disappointed by the current delays,  postponements, and reduction of forces. "In military issues,  uncertainty still reigns," Chastagnol concluded.    Writing in the 8 May LE QUOTIDIEN, Philippe Reinhard  commented that the goal of Mitterrand's statements on defense  was "tactical," not "strategic." Faithful to his custom before  elections, the president wished to emphasize the differences  between the Right and the Left and sow discord within the  majority. He succeeded, Reinhard remarked, as part of the Right  is "indignant" over the nuclear test ban while Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe "more sensibly and circumspectly" said that the  president "cannot anticipate what his successor will do."  According to Reinhard, Mitterrand has chosen the "right theme."  A unilateral French decision in this field would be unpopular  and weaken Paris' international position. While public opinion  overall shows little concern over this issue, it is obvious that  most of those who care are opposed to ending the moratorium,  especially when France is "mobilizing" to close the Chernobyl  site, according to Reinhard. It is also important to determine  whether tests are needed for continued French deterrence  capabilities, Reinhard wrote. A majority of experts, though not  all, believe it is. However, a decision entailing troublesome  diplomatic consequences for France ought not to be made under  the pressure of the "military-industrial lobby." Continued  nuclear testing is demanded by those who wish to modify indepth  the French doctrine of deterrence. Such a "radical" change can  only come after a national debate, Reinhard warned.  Presidential candidates should present their proposals next  spring and should not be drawn by President Mitterrand into a  "politicians' polemic in which the Right has more to lose than  the Left."  <H5>  Mitterrand Dubbed `Last European' </H5>   Alain Duhamel published a commentary on Mitterrand titled  "The Last European" in the Paris daily LIBERATION of 13 May.  "Alone in the European minefield," Mitterrand is openly in favor  of Europe, Duhamel wrote. The European Union (EU) is blamed for  "unemployment, insecurity, violence, anxiety, and  marginalization." Brussels, Duhamel continued, is seen as a  "bureaucratic multiheaded monster." Europe is used either as a  "scapegoat," a "foil," or a "scarecrow" by politicians as  different as Citizens' Movement leader Jean-Pierre Chevenement,  National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, rightist Philippe de  Villiers, Socialist Party secretary general Michel Rocard, and  the Right's Dominique Baudis. Duhamel commented that among his  European peers, Mitterrand is also "the last of the Mohicans."  Europe, Duhamel wrote, "is in retreat." Mitterrand reminded  his listeners that peace and stability require a stronger  Europe, that France's "weight and ambition" are strengthened  through Europe, and that the only way to fight North America or  Southeast Asia with equal economic and political weapons is the  EU. Duhamel observed that France, following Germany, will hold  the EU presidency during Mitterrand's last six months in office.  This will favor Franco-German initiatives and the launching of  a more broadly supported European effort.</p>

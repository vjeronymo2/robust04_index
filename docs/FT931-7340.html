			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / US denies killing nine in Mogadishu THE US denied its soldiers or allies had killed anyone during riots in Mogadishu yesterday, after reports had alleged American troops shot nine dead in the Somali capital, Reuter reports from Mogadishu. 'According to Unitaf (the US-led task force), coalition forces were not responsible for any of the deaths,' said Mr Joseph Snyder, State Department acting spokesman. He said he had seen news stories of nine Somalis killed in demonstrations involving thousands of supporters of a Somali warlord who had tried to storm the US and French embassies. But the US had received unconfirmed reports of only three Somalis killed and an 'undetermined' number of wounded. Mr Snyder said the protests against the US were triggered in part by 'totally false' information that the US was taking sides among battling warlords. He said demonstrators put up barricades, burned tyres, threw rocks and bottles and fired gunshots, but that the protests ended at midday. Earlier the Defence Department said it could not confirm reports by witnesses that US troops had killed at least nine rioters. Navy Lieutenant-Commander Joe Gradisher, a Pentagon spokesman, said a US Marine captain had been shot in the leg and that a Marine corporal had received shrapnel wounds from a hand grenade.</p>

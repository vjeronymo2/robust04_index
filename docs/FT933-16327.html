			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Recs surge Yet another hefty hike in the dividend payout gave the regional electricity companies a further excuse to move sharply forward. London unveiled a 16 per cent dividend increase, putting it in second place behind Southern - which posted a 17.6 per cent rise on Thursday - in the 'dividend race'. A warning from one rec chairman that the high dividend payout will upset the regulator went unheard in the market, as shares across the sector rose strongly. London added 11 to 477p, Southern 15 to 497p and Yorkshire 11 to 531p. There was some switching reported out of the water stocks, with Kleinwort Benson said to be recommending the move, among which Yorkshire lost 8 to 482p and Anglian 12 to 467p. British Aerospace followed the market lower, the shares giving up 8 to 392p, in trade of 1.9m. Reasons for the decline included talk of technical problems for the SA 80 gun it supplies to the British army. Another story doing the rounds was that Lockheed of the US was to join the BAe/Taiwan aerospace regional jets consortium agreed last year but still seeking funding. However, such a move was dismissed by several analysts. Profit downgradings from several brokers saw Glynwed International run back 5 to 294p. Bid speculation in engineering group James Wilkes continued and drove the shares 6 forward to 88p. Stake holder Suter, which firmed a penny to 164p, remains the favourite to launch a bid with a price tag of 100p-a-share mentioned. Shares in business services group Securiguard jumped 25 to 340p, with turnover rising to 12m, after Rentokil Group launched a market raid early in the session which increased its stake to 29.7 per cent. Rentokil announced it was raising its offer to 345p per share from 270p, leaving one market watcher to comment: 'It is all over for Securiguard bar the shouting.' Securiguard later said it wanted to meet Rentokil to discuss recommending the offer. The revised offer values Securiguard at Pounds 75.4m. Rentokil edged a half-penny forward to 206 1/2 p, on volume of 3.6m. The rise in the gold price and platinum's move to a four-year high boosted Lonrho shares 3 to 123p. Strong two-way business in BET brought turnover to 9.1m by the close, with the shares remaining unchanged at 115 1/2 p. Hoare Govett has warmed to the company and moved from being negative to calling it a 'measured risk worth taking.' Hotel group Forte continued its positive run, as talk in the market focused once again on the meeting, rumoured to be 'imminent', between executives of the group and Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund. He is said to be considering making a substantial investment in Forte. The shares added 2 to 229p in good turnover of 3.7m. The oil majors remained under heavy selling pressure ahead of next week's talks between Iraq and the United Nations which could result in the resumptiom of Iraqi oil sales. Dealers also pointed to the recent strength of sterling against the dollar, which has driven down the sterling price of oil from Pounds 12 to Pounds 11.30 a barrel in the past two weeks. BP gave up 9 1/2 to 296p, in heavy trade of 10m shares, while Shell Transport lost 15 to 612p, on volume of 7m. Cautious comments from Goldman Sachs, the US securities house, on selected chemicals stocks had a bad affect on BOC, which fell 18 to 667p. Recent negative comment by SG Warburg continued to gnaw away at Coats Viyella, which gave up 5 to 236p in a volume of 1.1m. Courtaulds, the stock Warburg advised investors to switch into, edged up to 540p. In banks, Abbey National edged forward a penny to 412p supported by a recommendation from Kleinwort Benson. Broadcasting stocks held firm against the market with Carlton Communications adding 2 to 781p, Anglia moving up a penny to 343p and Scottish TV and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees holding their price at 551p and 204p respectively.</p>

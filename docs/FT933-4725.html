			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Major rallies party against threat of Liberal Democrats: Prime minister to visit regional activists in effort to restore morale THE Conservatives are launching a sustained offensive against the Liberal Democrats, whom they now believe pose the main threat to traditional Tory strongholds in the south. Mr John Major, the prime minister, will lead the fight with a visit to the west country today to rebuild morale after the battering the Tories have taken over the past year. It will be the first in a series of meetings with party activists ahead of the Conservative party conference in October. Mr Major is to visit other regions this week, probably including the Midlands and Scotland. His itinerary is being kept secret for security reasons. Switching targets from Labour to the Liberal Democrats, especially in the south-west, is a recognition by Tory party strategists that they must win back disaffected voters in those areas if they are to win the next general election. In July, the Liberals won a spectacular by-election victory in Christchurch in Dorset, while at the local elections in May they took control of Cornwall and Somerset county councils from the Tories, and became the largest single party in Devon and Dorset. Another disastrous performance in the European elections next June might put Mr Major's leadership in jeopardy. The switch of focus from Labour, whom the Tories believe are mired in their own difficulties, to the Liberal Democrats is also designed to prevent that from happening. The Conservative campaign will seek to portray Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, as an untrustworthy politician who tailors his arguments to his audiences and so cannot be trusted to take a consistent line. The campaign will also spell out elements of Liberal Democrat policy in areas such as Europe and defence, which the government believes are least likely to appeal to traditional Tory supporters - even when they are disenchanted with their own party. The initiative comes less than two weeks before the Liberal Democrats meet at Torquay for their annual conference, at which they hope to build on their recent electoral successes. Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, spent two days in the south-west this week as part of his tour of local associations, talking to constituency chairmen and their deputies. Speaking in north Dorset yesterday, Sir Norman said: 'The Liberal party take a supportive view of a federal superstate, a federal Europe, the kind of Europe we stand against. That distinction is not recognised by the public, and we want to underline it.' Renewed efforts to drive home the contrast between the Liberal Democrats and themselves over the European Community are important for the Tories, since they will help to set the stage for the elections to the European parliament next year. The government is concerned about a possible strong vote for Mr Ashdown's party in the European elections, which might lay the groundwork for a successful general election campaign. Only as the bitter divisions within the Tory party over Maastricht have moved out of the political spotlight have Conservative strategists felt it safe to focus on European policy. Special responsibility for the campaign against the Liberal Democrats will go to Mr Patrick Nicholls, a party vice-chairmen. TUC reports, Page 10 Smith pledges, Page 20</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Under the Aegis of the UN"] </F>   [Text] Today we are presenting to the readers excerpts from  the Aide-Memoire of the Interdepartmental UN Mission in  Azerbaijan.    Our newspaper has already reported on the trip to New York  by  the UN representative in Azerbaijan, Dr. Mahmud el-Said. As a  result of the negotiations that took place during the high-level  meetings at the UN headquarters, a decision was made to send a  special mission to Azerbaijan consisting of representatives of  various departments, commissariats, commissions, and councils of  the UN.    On the whole the presence of the mission in Azerbaijan can  be  considered to be a very important event. According to  preliminary information, agreement has already basically been  reached with the donor countries.    We asked Mr. Mahmud el-Said to comment on the results of the  mission's work.    "The fact that the mission is coming here is the result of  our close cooperation with the headquarters in New York and  Geneva. The resolution previously adopted by the Security  Council concerning the need to render humanitarian aid to  Azerbaijan was of great significance. I am very glad that our  efforts were not in vain. And the arrival of such a  representative mission is a very significant result. This is the  first time for many departments and commissions to send  representatives to us. I am confident that from now on  humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan will be increased considerably  and, the main thing, it will become more diverse and targeted,  responding to the republic's essential needs."  <H5>  From the Aide-Memoire of the Interdepartmental UN Commission </H5> in Azerbaijan for Preparing the Appeal to the World Community    The UN interdepartmental commission visited Azerbaijan  during  6-12 March 1994 to determine the humanitarian needs of the  refugees who were forced to resettle and other of the more  vulnerable segments of the population during the period from 1  April through 31 December 1994. The information gathered by the  mission will be used when preparing the interdepartmental UN  appeal for Azerbaijan, which will be submitted for mobilization  of funds by donor countries in April 1994.    The mission was headed by the UN Department on Humanitarian  Issues (OGV). It consisted of representatives from UNESCO,  UNICEF, the UN Volunteer Program (PDO), the World Food Program  (VPP), United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),  the World Health Organization (WHO), and International  Organization for Migration (IOM). The mission was greeted and  accompanied by the UN representative in the Azerbaijan Republic.  The mission was given support from local representatives of the  aforementioned organizations and also from the representative of  the UN PR [expansion not indicated]. The mission would like to  express its special gratitude to His Excellency Mr. President,  the speaker of parliament, the deputy prime minister for  humanitarian issues, the ministers and members of the  government, and also the authorities of Imishli, Bardy, and  Svatly, who rendered able assistance to the mission.    The mission conducted a survey of the number of refugees who  were forced to resettle and the vulnerable groups of the country  and evaluated these people's needs for targeted emergency aid.    The mission was informed by the government that the number  of  refugees in the republic comes to 250,000 (the majority from  Armenia) and the number of people from within the country who  were forced to resettle is 658,000. The latter were saved by  fleeing from Nagorno Karabakh and regions of conflict in the  western part of Azerbaijan. Of the 908,000 refugees,  approximately 60,000 are living in tent camps that have been  built and are well kept up and are currently controlled by the  Red Crescent Societies of Iran and Turkey and the International  Islamic Humanitarian Organization. Some of the rest have moved  in with families, and others, the majority, are living in public  buildings and facilities located all over the country.    The World Food Program (VPP) will provide the resettlers and  the most needy refugees with additional food products, above all  those who are living in public institutions.    In order to render aid in material and technical preparation  for deliveries of humanitarian aid to the region the VPP has  founded the Caucasian Organizational Consultative Department  (KOKO). The main spheres of aid that were earmarked include  increasing the handling capacity of the railroads and ports  during circulation and transportation of humanitarian cargo.    The Office of the High UN Commissioner for Refugees will  continue to satisfy the needs of most groups of refugees and  those who have been forced to resettle. The Office of the High  Commission will supply household goods through deliveries of  nonfoodstuffs such as blankets, plastic sheets, soap, kitchen  items, clothing, and footwear.</p>

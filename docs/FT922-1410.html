			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Leading Article: South Africa on the brink SOUTH AFRICA has reached a watershed in its search for democracy. Constitutional negotiations have ground to a halt. Not coincidentally, political violence is increasing. The danger that now confronts the country is that only more violence and civil upheaval will break the impasse in the battle to reconcile majority rule and minority rights. The fearsome possibility that the country could tilt towards ungovernability will undoubtedly be uppermost in the minds of Mr Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC) executive at their meeting today, not to mention President FW de Klerk and his cabinet when they meet tomorrow. Looking into the abyss should be enough to give fresh and urgent impetus to negotiations. The events of the past week, horrific as they were, do not in themselves signal a turning point in South Africa's prospects. Since Mr Mandela's release over two years ago, there have been killings as savage as those that took place in Boipatong township last Wednesday. They have been accompanied by the same allegations that supporters of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party were responsible, together with accusations of security force complicity. The South African police force once again showed on Saturday, when it fired on a grieving crowd and killed three people, how ill-equipped it is for its role in post-apartheid South Africa: badly disciplined, trigger happy and hostile to change. But when they are set against the background of the breakdown of constitutional talks last month, these latest acts of violence take on a greater significance. The government's insistence on what amounts to a white veto in a new constitution, coupled with its inadequate response to political violence, has persuaded an increasing number of black South Africans to make a fundamental shift in their assessment of President de Klerk's commitment to reform. A year ago Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress (ANC) leader, could assuage his constituents' anger by reaffirming his belief in Mr de Klerk's integrity, and holding out the prospect of multi-party talks at a Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). Progress at these talks, which would have joint supervision of the security forces on the agenda, he argued, was the best way to tackle the country's seemingly endemic political violence. Last weekend Mr Mandela's message to angry and disillusioned supporters was very different. The negotiations were in tatters, he had to admit, and he could no longer use Codesa as a political safety valve. Talk now is of 'mass action' - strikes, marches, demonstrations, boycotts. The ANC has yet to show that it can sustain such activities; but the shift in tactics risks delivering a heavy blow to government hopes for new investment and fresh borrowing, both essential if the economy is to pull out of its recession. Moreover, the ANC's campaign carries an obvious risk of further violence, whether in confrontation with security forces or with Inkatha. While Mr Mandela may not intend as much, a generation of angry young blacks who sacrificed their education in order to man township barricades, will take this as a mandate for insurrection. The answer is not, as President de Klerk hinted at the weekend, reintroduction of tougher security measures. He should instead be restoring his credibility by ordering an independent inquiry into the police role in both the Boipatong tragedies - last Wednesday's massacre and the shootings on Saturday - including allegations that the authorities failed to act on warnings of impending slaughter. He ought to encourage rapid reform of the grim, all-male hostels in the townships, source of so much tension. He should also authorise a more rigorous investigation of the so-called 'third force', right-wing extremists set on destabilising the peace process by instigating violence between black parties. A convincing demonstration of government good faith is needed if negotiations are to resume and South Africa is again to pull itself back from the brink.</p>

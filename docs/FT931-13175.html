			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Worries on sterling The week starts with uncertainty hanging over the immediate direction of both the dollar and sterling, writes James Blitz At the end of last week, the US currency dipped below the DM1.60 level against the D-Mark, with some dealers wondering whether its five pfennig fall since the start of this year is more than just a technical correction. There is lingering uncertainty about the scale of the economic upturn in the US, and some dealers continue to think that US interest rates, which are currently at about 3 per cent, may be lowered again by the US Federal Reserve. Wednesday's testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Chairman, before the Joint Economic Committee will be closely scrutinised for any policy indications it gives. Tomorrow's consumer confidence figures from the Conference Board and this week's jobless figures, out on Thursday, should also give further clues as go whether the pick-up in the US economy can be sustained. Sterling will also be in the spotlight, with strong speculation that the Bank of England might cut base rates this week to give a new impetus to economic growth. The pound was trading below DM2.45 against the D-Mark for most of Friday, and there is a growing belief in the market that it may go as low as DM2.40. Today's CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey will add further light to last week's gloomy unemployment figures for December. The December current account and trade balance, due out on Friday, may have a particularly significant impact on the pound as far as foreign investors are concerned. The French franc has performed very strongly in the last two weeks, and has been trading more than 5 centimes above its ERM floor against the D-Mark. There is strong speculation that the Bank of France will cut its main lending rates when it intervenes in the market today and Thursday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MMA/MJN: "International Heroin Trafficking: </F> Major Chinese Network Uncovered"]    [Text] Liege, 19 May (BELGA) -- An investigation carried  out by the BSR [Special Research Force] in Liege and the police  forces in Luxembourg and the Netherlands has succeeded in  uncovering a major "Chinese" network for running heroin into  several European countries. The Liege police apprehended a  41-year-old Croat, Nemad Lukic, a Luxembourg resident, in  possession of two kg of heroin. A further three arrests were  carried out in Maastricht by the Netherlands police. The three  persons concerned are currently being held in the Netherlands  with a view to being extradited to Belgium, as requested by the  Public Prosecutor's Office in Liege. The arrested individuals  comprise one 39-year-old Maltese called Wooi Kok Geok, a  43-year-old Indonesian named Hadi Kesuma Bn Djimin, and a  43-year-old Chinese called Kuang Jeniy-Zhou. Finally, a  businessman of Chinese origin, considered to be at the hub of  heroin trafficking in Europe, was arrested in Luxembourg.    The first four individuals arrested had been under close  surveillance by various police units. Recently they met in  Maastricht where Lukic took delivery of 2.15 kg of heroin. The  moment he received the package, Lukic was unwittingly followed  by police belonging to the Liege BSR branch, who then followed  him to the Post House Hotel by the Liege-Herstal freeway.    There Lukic was caught in possession of the drug, which  turned out to be a Chinese variety of heroin, 80 percent pure,  according to analyses carried out in a specialised laboratory at  Liege University.    When interrogated by the police, Lukic denied all the facts  although he had been caught in possession of the drug. A  warrant for his arrest was issued by the Public Prosecutor's  Office in Liege and he was then locked up in Lantin prison.    Two of the three individuals apprehended in the Netherlands  were in possession of firearms.    In Luxembourg, the investigation also led to the arrest of a  41-year-old Chinese trader named Wong Suk Yin, who is considered  to be the key person for reselling heroin in several European  countries. Wong Suk Yin told his investigators that he could  regularly provide 10 kg of heroin of the same quality as that  seized in Herstal. The confiscated heroin, which still had to  be "blended" before being sold, because its purity made it  potentially lethal if consumed in that form, had a market value  of approximately 100 million Belgian francs. Various police  departments are continuing their inquiry.</p>

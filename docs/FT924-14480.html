			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Lamont's letter The main points of proposals to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee The European exchange rate mechanism: Britain will resume membership but only when a number of conditions have been satisfied, including an end to turbulence on currency markets and a narrowing in the difference in interest rates between Germany and the US. Those conditions are unlikely to be satisfied soon. Inflation: Britain needs to aim for a rate of inflation in the long term of 2 per cent or less. For the remainder of the current parliament, Britain should keep underlying inflation (based on the year-on-year growth in the retail-prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments) within a range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. Special circumstances affecting prices: We have to acknowledge that events outside our control may take us temporarily outside the range. That could arise, for example, if there were a sharp movement in the terms of trade, particularly through commodity prices. Monetary policy: The government will judge inflationary trends according to a wide range of factors, including domestic monetary targets. There will be a general emphasis on reaching a judgment on inflationary trends and whether the government's objectives are likely to be achieved. Exchange rate: The Treasury will give full weight to the exchange rate in assessing monetary conditions, but there will be no target range for the pound. Equally, the exchange rate will not be allowed to go where it will. The lesson from the 1980s is that exchange rates can move a long way, upwards or downwards, if markets come to believe the authorities do not care. Narrow measure of money supply (M0): The target for M0 - year-on-year growth of 0 to 4 per cent - will be retained. M0 has proved a reliable indicator and its relationship with current spending in the economy has proved remarkably stable. Broad money measure (M4): M4 contains important information on monetary conditions. But experience indicates that the relationship between these aggregates and either money GDP or future inflation is not close enough to justify establishing M4 as a formal target. The government is to give some idea in the Autumn Statement of the values for the growth of M4 which may indicate a build-up of inflationary pressures. Composite monetary indicators: It is premature to give such indices a formal place in the system of monetary assessment, but the Bank of England and Treasury will be looking at them further. Other indicators of inflation: The Treasury will monitor money market interest rates, and asset prices including house prices. Officials will pay particular attention to periods when house prices are falling or accelerating sharply. Fiscal policy: If industry is to be able to take advantage of the opportunities the lower exchange rate has now presented, it will be essential to keep tight control over public spending and borrowing. The government will be seeking to maintain firm downward pressure on the growth of public-sector pay. This will also ensure that the public sector matches industry's efforts to contain its own wage costs and so hang on to the improved competitiveness. The government will also pursue a tight policy on public spending.</p>

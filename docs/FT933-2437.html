			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Unions split on plan to freeze public-sector pay: GMB fears attempt to 'trap' workers into strike DIVISIONS emerged yesterday among trade unions opposed to the government's plan to freeze public-sector pay next year. Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said strike action by public-sector workers might play into the hands of the government. His warning is likely to anger the more militant leaders of Unison, the 1.4m strong public-service union, and the smaller Fire Brigades Union, who favour industrial action. The split appeared as unions representing more than half a million nursing staff submitted a 10 per cent pay claim and come just days before a TUC meeting to discuss opposition to the freeze. Earlier this week, teachers called for an 8 per cent increase and a Pounds 1,000 one-off payment. Mr Edmonds told a conference of Labour councillors in Manchester yesterday: 'The chancellor's pay freeze is an attempt to trap public-sector workers into a strike and to take the spotlight off his own difficulties.' Mr Jack Dromey, the chief local government officer of the Transport and General Workers' Union, said: 'It is clear that part of the government's agenda is to trap us and thereby trap the Labour party.' Together, the two big general unions represent 500,000 of the 5.5m public-sector workers, but they will carry disproportionate influence on the TUC committee. The nurses and teachers have submitted their claims to their pay review bodies. Doctors, the armed forces and top civil servants have still to submit claims. None of the bodies, which are independent of the government and make recommendations on pay, has yet met to consider the implications of the Treasury's freeze. This week Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said pay rises in the public sector would be allowed only in exchange for productivity increases. The unions say productivity is impossible to measure in many parts of the public sector. Ms Judith Carter, of Unison, said yesterday: 'We find no evidence that performance-related pay will improve service quality.' Many public-sector managers welcome the shift to more local bargaining, which is likely to be one consequence of the pay arrangements for 1994-95. The civil service agencies, such as the Benefits Agency, are already scheduled to take control of pay bargaining for more than 250,000 civil servants next year. They are also expected to make efficiency savings of 2.5 per cent, and some managers fear that further efficiency gains will be clawed back by the Treasury rather than paid to staff. Ms Susanne Brierley, head of the organisation representing personnel managers in NHS trusts, welcomed the greater flexibility that should be provided by moving away from a pay norm.

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> WORDS, MUSIC AT SOCIETY BRUNCH  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Jazz Society offered a double-header of sorts Sunday, at the  weekly brunch in the Hollywood Holiday Inn: words (provided by the society,  announcing this year's award winners) and music (by the Cunninghams and the  Marty Harris Trio).  </P> <P> Saxophonist Bob Cooper, this year's main honoree, was on hand, as was Vi Redd,  the educator, saxophonist and singer, who received the society's Lifetime  Achievement Award.  </P> <P> Joel Leach of Cal State Northridge was named Educator of the Year. One of his  students, 25-year-old guitarist Steve Gregory, received the Shelly Manne  Memorial New Talent Award. Southland-based Horace Silver was selected as this  year's composer/arranger.  </P> <P> The recipients will be honored at a Sept. 10 awards dinner and tribute at the  Hyatt Regency Hotel. Information: (213) 469-6800.  </P> <P> Don and Alicia Cunningham, the vocal duo, are a tall, striking couple who  leaned toward the traditional in their choice of material. Alternating between  lyrics and scat versions, they tackled Ellington, Basie, Harry (Sweets) Edison  (who was in the room when they sang their version of his celebrated blues  "Centerpiece"), and Charlie Parker, represented in vocalese treatments of  "Yardbird Suite" and "Confirmation." Their version of "Lush Life" was a  uniquely moving treatment of the 50-year-old Billy Strayhorn masterpiece.  </P> <P> Don Cunningham, who doubles on alto sax now and then, also got into a  high-spirited carnival groove playing congas on "Tristeza."  </P> <P> Pianist Marty Harris led a sympathetic accompanying unit; Harris could hardly  be blamed for the fact that the piano was sorely in need of tuning. John  Leitham, the southpaw bassist, was his usual supple, swinging self; Mel Lee on  drums completed the backup. Trumpeter Al Aarons added his horn for a couple of  numbers.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We recognize the value of family input in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey process, and direct surveyors when interviewing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide the opportunity for all interested parties to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> give what they believe is pertinent information. We expect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this to include accommodating family members who wish to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speak with the survey team but are unable to be at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility at the time of the survey. It is possible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family members to call surveyors at the facility and be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either interviewed over the telephone or scheduled for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal meeting as the survey schedule allows. The survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> team is in a better position than HCFA to know how to best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate these groups within the time and personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constraints of the standard survey, and for this reason it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be unduly restrictive of us to require evening and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> week-end meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither will we require that there be an exit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference specifically for family groups. If survey teams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct an exit conference for facility residents, family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members are not prohibited from attending. If such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference does not take place, family members still have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many other opportunities to learn about the outcome of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey. Survey results are available to family members  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whenever they visit a facility, because facilities are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to accessibly post the results of the most recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey. These survey reports are thorough and detailed, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if a family member has any difficulty understanding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results, he or she may resolve it by contacting either the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term care ombudsman or the State survey agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter proposed that we allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey team to expand the standard survey when it identifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care instead of requiring it to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct an extended or partial extended survey to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigate the extent of the facility's problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We must reject this proposal. We are bound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by sections 1819(g)(2)(B) and 1919(g)(2)(B) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which require a facility to be subject to an extended survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when it is found to have provided substandard quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care during the standard survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter proposed that we specify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the audit of written plans of care outlined at proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.155(a)(3) must include an investigation of whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written plans were implemented and subsequently reevaluated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and revised, as necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Appendix P of State Operations Manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transmittal No. 250, surveyors are directed, when conducting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an audit of written plans of care, to determine whether care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans were consistently implemented, evaluated, and revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as necessary. We believe such detailed instruction is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate in the manual than in the regulation itself, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so we are not including it in the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.307&blank;Unannounced Surveys  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters agreed that all surveys  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be unannounced. Some commenters stated that survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedules should be more unpredictable and one suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that there should be even more unannounced inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters emphasized that many nursing homes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aware that they are about to be surveyed. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that randomness of surveys has not yet been achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that HCFA should require States to demonstrate through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey scheduling that chronically substandard facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been targeted. Another commenter stated that annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensure cycles, such as billings and certificates, may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compromise unannounced surveys. Several commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that we require that the States provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> randomization plan or scheduling methods which would ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the timing of inspections is not predictable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

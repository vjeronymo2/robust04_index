			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Laso D'Lom and F. Cortes: "Borrell Asserts </F> That `Users or Taxpayers' Should Pay for Investment Effort in  Infrastructures"]    [Text] Madrid -- At its meeting yesterday the cabinet  approved the Infrastructure Master Plan [PDI], which envisions a  total investment of 18.753 trillion pesetas up to the year 2007,  with an annual average of 1.250 trillion pesetas. Out of the  total amount of investments, 13.173 trillion pesetas will come  from the budget, while the remaining 5.580 trillion pesetas will  be funded from nonbudget sources. That is, they will have to be  paid "either by the users of the services, the autonomous  administrations, or the taxpayers in general," Borrell asserted  yesterday following the plan's approval by the government.    At the presentation of the PDI, Jose Borrell, minister of  public works, transport, and the environment, said that a  "rational" debate on how to finance infrastructure should now  begin: [At issue is] whether the financing should come from  taxpayers, as hitherto, or users of the projects carried out  should contribute more, as is currently the case with the tolls  on some highways.    Borrell asserted that neither he nor the government has a  set  position on whether or not user fees should be applied, and  asked that the debate begun in this connection should not be  "Manichaean," and that people should not seek to say that the  Spanish people will pay twice for highways -- once as taxpayers  and then as users.    The minister cited as an example the fact that maintaining  the current highway network, with the new projects recently  completed, will cost the administration 100 billion pesetas this  year, and asked who should pay for them.  <H5>  Charges </H5>   The ministry has studied the introduction of user fees for  infrastructure -- especially highways -- and even examined the  amount which could be charged, this being an annual fee of  around 5,000 pesetas per light vehicle and 10,000 pesetas for  heavy vehicles.    However, since this kind of charge is not the responsibility  of the Ministry of Public Works, Transport, and the Environment,  Borrell asserted yesterday that it is the Ministry of the  Economy and Finance which should promote this debate in Spanish  society, as has been the case in other European countries.    Over 75 percent of the investment (around 14.2 trillion  pesetas) will be earmarked for transport infrastructure.  Specifically, 10.7 trillion pesetas will be for regional areas,  while another 3.4 trillion pesetas will be allocated for urban  areas.    Investment in water projects will exceed 2.2 trillion  pesetas  (12 percent of the total), while 9 percent (1.8 trillion  pesetas) will be allocated to environmental infrastructure  (water drainage and purification and waste management). Coastal  projects will receive 0.5 trillion pesetas, which will be mainly  devoted to improving and regenerating beaches.    An investment of 45 billion pesetas is planned for research  and development in technologies related to transport and  infrastructure.    "This," the ministry states, "is the first strategic  planning  conducted in Spain to affect the basic infrastructures as a  whole."    The ministry also states that the PDI is characterized by  being a master plan, and thus "outlines a coherent framework for  action," and is conceived as "an instrument of dynamic and  flexible planning, adaptable in time to society's economic and  technological evolution."    As far as intercity roads are concerned, the 5.4 trillion  pesetas earmarked make them the most important part of the PDI.    The section devoted to high-volume roads includes the  construction of 5,300 km of new freeways and expressways, and  1,400 km of link roads. The construction of a turnpike between  Madrid and Tudela is also proposed.  <H5>  Railroads </H5>   In the case of railroads, the PDI envisages an investment of  3.2 trillion pesetas, aimed at improving the layout and  extending the busiest routes. Suburban services will be  boosted, and part of the investment will be devoted to  preserving over 3,000 km of track.    The plan also consolidates a high-speed network through the  Madrid-Barcelona-Frontera lines, the so-called Basque "Y," the  Navarre corridor, and a new Madrid-Albacete-Valencia line.    Some 0.8 trillion pesetas and 1 trillion pesetas are  earmarked for ports and airports respectively, aimed at  optimizing the functioning of the port and airport systems and  carrying out projects such as the enlargement of Madrid's  Barajas Airport.    Another 3.3 trillion pesetas will be devoted to resolving  transport problems in 18 metropolitan areas and in medium-sized  and small cities.  <H5>  Water Projects </H5>   The PDI includes a section whose aim is to increase water  resources, including water conservation and recycling programs.  The planned projects include increasing regulating capability  within each basin, interbasin transfers, and seawater  desalination.    Some 0.3 trillion pesetas will be earmarked for improving  and  regenerating beaches.</p>

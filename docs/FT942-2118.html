			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Commission loses in PVC cartel case - European Court Court has dismissed the European Commission's appeal against the decision of the Court of First Instance in a case involving an alleged cartel in the European chemical industry. The ECJ annulled the Commission's decision for procedural irregularity because it failed to authenticate the decision in accordance with its rules of procedure. However, the court set aside the CFI's ruling of 27 February 1992 on the grounds that it had been wrong to decide that the Commission's decision was non-existent. In December 1988, the Commission adopted a decision ordering several chemicals companies to terminate an alleged cartel agreement in the plastics sector and imposing fines totalling Dollars 27.5m. Fourteen PVC companies appealed to the CFI. In the course of the court proceedings, the Commission admitted that it could not produce a copy of the original decision signed by the president of the Commission and the executive secretary as required by the Commission's internal procedural rules. The CFI also found breaches of the Community law principle of the unalterability of Community decisions. Differences existed between the various legally binding language translations of the decision published in the Official Journal and notified to the parties after adoption by the Commission in December 1988. The CFI decided that the lack of authentication of the decision by the Commission was so serious that Community law required the Commission's decision to be declared non-existent. The Commission appealed against the CFI's ruling to the ECJ. It relied on four grounds. The ECJ only considered one, since it found in favour of the Commission and set aside the CFI's decision of 27 February 1992 because it contained an error of law. The ECJ agreed with the Commission that a procedural defect such as the Commission's failure to authenticate a measure in accordance with its procedural rules had to be of sufficient gravity before it could be treated as legally non-existent. The ECJ said acts of EU institutions are in principle presumed to be lawful and accordingly produce legal effects, even if they are tainted by irregularities, until such time as they are annulled or withdrawn. By way of exception to that principle, acts tainted by an irregularity whose gravity is so obvious that it cannot be tolerated by the Community legal order must be treated as having no legal effect and as legally non-existent. The purpose of the exception, it said, was to maintain a balance between two fundamental, but sometimes conflicting, requirements with which the legal order must comply, namely 'stability of legal relations' and 'respect for legality'. The ECJ went on to state that when it sets aside a decision of the CFI, it had the power to give final judgment in the original appeal where the state of the proceedings permitted. The court only dealt with the argument raised by the PVC companies relating to the Commission's failure to comply with the authentication requirements in its own rules of procedure. They stated: 'Acts adopted by the Commission, at a meeting or by written procedure, shall be authenticated in the language or languages in which they are binding by the signatures of the president and the executive secretary.' The ECJ said that contrary to the Commission's claims, the authentication rule was not a mere formality but was intended to guarantee legal certainty by ensuring that the text adopted by the College of Commissioners became fixed in the languages which were binding. In the event of dispute, it could then be verified that the texts notified or published corresponded precisely to the text adopted by the college. The ECJ, therefore, annulled the decision for infringement of essential procedural requirements, ordering the Commission to pay costs. On 15 June, the Commission stated in a formal press release (IP/94/538) that it intended to adopt the decision again without any procedural defects.

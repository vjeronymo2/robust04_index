			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / People: Charter acquires directors - only Charter, the industrial group, has named three new non-executive directors - but denied that their identities gave any clue to the group's well-flagged intention of making a substantial acquisition. Charter was left with about Pounds 150m in cash after unwinding its links last year with Anglo American Corporation, the South African mining group. Sir Chips Keswick, joint deputy chairman of the merchant bank Hambros, is retiring after six years as a non-executive director. Jeff Herbert, Charter's chief executive, says Sir Chips had been appointed to the board to represent the South Africans, but had agreed to stay on until the restructuring process was completed. Sir Chips's role as City heavyweight will be filled by Peter Allen, who will join the board as a non-executive when he retires from Coopers &amp; Lybrand at the end of April. Allen, 55, has worked for the accountancy firm since 1963. He became managing partner in 1985 and was appointed deputy chairman in 1990. The two non-executives appointed with immediate effect are John Neill and Neil Johnson. Neill, 46, is chief executive of Unipart Group and has considerable experience in the automotive supply industry. Johnson, 44, has spent most of his career in engineering. He was formerly director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, following a period with British Aerospace. He is general secretary of the RAC. Herbert says the background of neither man gives a lead on his plans to add an extra leg to Charter's businesses, which supply equipment to the mining and rail industries, and building products, including quarrying. He says: 'Both have considerable experience in industry - that is the important thing. They are also slightly younger - which should give them more energy.' Charter believes most quoted UK companies look overvalued and is more likely to buy a division from a multinational or consider countries where companies are on a lower rating. Herbert says: 'We have been casting our net a bit wider. There are several interesting things we are looking at right now - but we've been doing that for some time.'</p>

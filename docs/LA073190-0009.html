			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> BOND SALE TO BENEFIT INDUSTRIAL PARK OKD  </P> <P> City officials are moving forward with plans to sell $5 million in bonds after  landowners overwhelmingly agreed to finance public improvements in an  industrial park with new taxes, an official said Monday.  </P> <P> The 128-acre industrial park is the largest commercial project planned in  Fillmore.  </P> <P> An estimated 1,500 jobs may be created when it is completed, officials said.  </P> <P> Thirteen property owners where the park will be located approved new property  taxes in a special mail-in ballot, City Manager Roy Payne said.  </P> <P> The measure won by a 91% margin in last week's vote, he said.  </P> <P> The City Council is expected to certify the election results when it meets Aug.  14.  </P> <P> Approval of the new tax gives Fillmore officials authority to issue bonds to  raise money for road, sewer and storm drain improvements to develop the  industrial park.  </P> <P> Landowners will later be assessed to pay off the bonds.  </P> <P> The per-acre assessments are $655 for water lines, $787 for sewers and $2,950  for storm drain and street improvements.  </P> <P> Construction of the improvements will begin in early 1991, although landowners  will not have to pay the new taxes until a year later, Payne said. The taxes  will be spread out over 20 years, he said.  </P> <P> Development of an industrial park is part of a strategy to lure new businesses  to the town of nearly 12,000. The park is expected to change Fillmore's  agricultural employment base to industries that generate more assembly and  office jobs.  </P> <P> The industrial park will be located north of Old Telegraph Road on a site now  occupied by citrus groves and a few businesses.  </P> <P> Plans conceived by city officials call for an industrial park occupied by  assembly plants, warehouses and small distribution centers.

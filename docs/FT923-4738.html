			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: CIBC falls 7% in third quarter CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce's third-quarter earnings dipped by 7 per cent, with higher loan loss provisions and expenses offsetting increases in interest and fee income. Loan-loss provisions rose to CDollars 188m (USDollars 157.9m) from CDollars 168m a year earlier. But the bank, which is Canada's second biggest financial institution and one of the biggest lenders to ailing property developer Olympia &amp; York, has left its total 1992 loan-loss estimate unchanged at CDollars 1.75bn. CIBC wrote off CDollars 1bn in the second quarter to cover expected losses from O&amp;Y and other problem loans. Earnings fell to CDollars 186m, or 85 cents a share, in the three months to July 31, from CDollars 201m, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Return on equity slipped to 12.3 per cent from 13.4 per cent, and return on assets to 0.57 per cent from 0.67 per cent. Non-performing loans stood at CDollars 2.7bn on July 31, an increase of CDollars 282m from the previous quarter. The bank ascribed the rise mainly to further difficulties in its real-estate portfolio. The CDollars 1bn second-quarter write-down pushed CIBC to a CDollars 33m loss for the nine months to July 31. But Mr Al Flood, chairman, said the bank would report positive earnings for the year as a whole, and would maintain its quarterly dividend. Mr Flood, who took over as chairman in June, late yesterday announced nine new senior management appointments as part of a drive to improve the quality of CIBC's loan portfolio, focus its business on North America and integrate its corporate and investment banking divisions. CIBC is the last Canadian leading bank to report third-quarter earnings. The others ranged from a 14 per cent improvement at Bank of Montreal to a 57 per cent fall in net income posted by Royal Bank of Canada.</p>

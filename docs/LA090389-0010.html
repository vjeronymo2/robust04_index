			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DEFENDER  </P> <P> "The Defender," by Joy Horowitz (July 23), was subtitled "Some Say Leslie  Abramson Is the Best Female Criminal Defense Lawyer Around. Others Say She's  the Best, Period." That leaves me with one question: Best what? She's a leader  in keeping California killers off Death Row. Is that something to be proud of?  Some of these same people will be released to kill again. Others that remain in  jail feed off of tax dollars for the rest of their worthless lives. To what  end?  </P> <P> MARJORIE LYMAN, Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

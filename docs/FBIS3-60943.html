The reshuffle will involve 90 percent of the  officers and undercover detectives in the State Security and  Criminal Investigation Departments. The changes were approved  after it was confirmed that terrorists know the names of most of  the police officers operating in Asyut and can identify them.    The changes will be made in light of a new security strategy  to confront terrorism. It involves staging intensive mobile  patrols and fixed and mobile ambushes throughout the governorate  and reinforcing the undercover police presence in the streets of  the city of Asyut.    The new plan will change the locations of fixed civilian  police ambushes. One plainclothes policeman will stand guard in  front of the target that is being protected, while the other  members of the ambush team will scatter over a 10-meter distance  around the target so that they will not be easily hunted, like  the victims of the recent terrorist attack were.    This plan was being developed at the same time that a large  number of officers from the criminal investigation and special  operation departments from the various governorates were  arriving in Asyut.    In reaction to these security measures to crack down on the  terrorist dens and the terrorist leaders, the Islamic Group in  Upper Egypt has proclaimed its defiance, claiming that it has a  strategy to confront them.</p>

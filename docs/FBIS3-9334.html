Only two percent of those polled were definitely for the  return of property to aristocrats and eight percent were  definitely for the return of church property.    A total of 58 percent of the respondents said they were  against the return of property to people who emigrated from  Czechoslovakia and did not come back while only three percent  said they favored the return of their property.    The restitution of church property and the return of  property  to emigrants was supported mostly by inhabitants of North  Moravia.    Views of potential voters for various political parties  differed considerably. Among those who favor the restitution of  church property, 28 percent would vote for the Civic Democratic  Party (ODS), 11 percent the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), 11  percent for the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), and four  percent the Left Bloc (LB).    Among those who support the return of property to  aristocrats  19 percent would vote ODS, 8 percent ODA, 6 percent CSSD, and no  one LB.    The return of property to Jewish communities is supported by  54 percent of ODS voters, 50 percent CSSD, and 20 percent LB.</p>

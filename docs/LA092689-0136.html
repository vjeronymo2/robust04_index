			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AT LONDON AUCTION, ART'S NOT REAL, IT'S MEMOREX  </P> <P> A man from Barcelona who copies famous works of art brought 244 of them to  London and sold them all Friday for $238,600.  </P> <P> "They represent the work of about six months in my studio," said the painter  Miguel Canals in an interview during the sale.  </P> <P> "I am an artist and this is my hobby, but as I am a Catalan, people say it's my  business," he confided as auctioneer Nicholas Bonham briskly rattled through  the copied Titians, Monets, Goyas and van Goghs.  </P> <P> They took from 20 to 40 seconds to sell for a few hundred to a few thousand  dollars each in the packed Bonhams salesroom in Chelsea.  </P> <P> "I am happy with the prices," said Canals, a short, dark man in his mid-50s,  watching the sale impassively with his wife Fernanda.  </P> <P> From across the floor the Renaissance Madonnas, Dutch interiors, English  hunting scenes, life-size portraits and sun-kissed impressionists looked very  much like their celebrated originals.  </P> <P> Some had been treated to look aged, and tiny, deliberate mistakes could  sometimes be spotted, "so that future experts will be able to distinguish them  from the originals," said Bonham.  </P> <P> Naturally, a copy of the world's most expensive painting, Vincent van Gogh's  "Irises," was there. The original sold for nearly $54 million at Sotheby's in  New York in 1987 but the copy cost only $4,080 after 40 seconds' bidding on  Friday.  </P> <P> Top price was $7,500 for a canvas after Claude Monet of the bridge over the  artist's famous waterlily pool in his garden at Giverny near Paris.  </P> <P> The Canals are the same size as the originals, in the same media -- oil,  pastel, crayon or watercolor -- and set in elaborately gilded plaster or wood  frames. On a quick glance they appear to be the real thing. Each is stamped on  the back, "From the Studio of Miguel Canals."  </P> <P> Among the buyers were interior decorators who said the pictures would look good  in smart homes and restaurants.  </P> <P> Irish rock singer Bob Geldof looked in and said: "I think these are a good buy.  After all, half the paintings hanging on the walls of the world's museums are  fakes."  </P> <P> Merle Birkmyre, a Londoner, said when asked why anyone would buy one of the  paintings from Spain, said: "I feel people will buy a copy of a painting after  growing up with a print of it which they love."  </P> <P> An attorney who specified that he not be identified -- "because I have two van  Gogh original drawings" -- said he bought a "van Gogh" and a "Seurat" because  "they look authentic and they will look very nice, and most of my friends won't  know the difference from the originals by midnight."  </P> <P> One copy of a familiar beach scene by Eugene Boudin, was miscatalogued as  "After Eugene Canals."  </P> <P> "That's wrong," said Bonham to giggles from the floor. "This is definitely a  Boudin."  </P> <P> It went for $600.  </P> <P> Bonham said later that Canals' clients include owners of very expensive works  of art who commission him to paint a copy for the wall while they keep the  original in a safe.  </P> <P> Canals has half-a-dozen assistants who may all work on one painting as each is  a specialist in something -- faces, dresses, flowers, trees or ships.  </P> <P> He said, yes, he also paints originals -- "but it is not important."  </P></p>

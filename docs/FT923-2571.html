			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Warning issued on pork products THE GOVERNMENT last night issued about a warning about pork products sold in several supermarket chains and distributed to small shops through a number of wholesale operations. It said there were 'indications of pre-formed clostridium botulinum toxin' in uncured cooked pork products made by Baron Meats of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, a subsidiary of Hazlewood Foods. The health department said it knew of no cases of illness associated with the products, but advised that they should not be eaten. Hazlewood said it was trying to establish how the contamination occurred and which shops were involved.</p>

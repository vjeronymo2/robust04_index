			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Rich pickings from the public: The role of Revenue investigators Tom Winship, investigations manager of the Inland Revenue Compliance Unit in Slough, believes that most people are basically honest and willing to pay their taxes. 'We are not in the business of putting people out of business. We just want people to join our club and be contributors,' he says. His team of four officers is one of the few branches of the Civil Service that can show a financial return on its activities. For every Pounds 1 spent, it collects Pounds 5 from tax evaders. 'People are apprehensive of us but we do generally try to be understanding,' he says. 'We don't seek to crush people to death. After all nobody likes paying tax and we don't get a discount because we work here.' Winship's team pursues unpaid schedule D Taxes - those levelled on the self-employed. Slough has between 8,000 and 9,000 people registered to pay schedule D, and the office investigates about 1,000 separate cases of suspected evasion in that tax category every year. 'Many of our inquiries arise from telephone calls from informants and anonymous letters,' says Beverley Stainer, a member of the compliance unit. Her job is to develop and follow up leads by making house inquiries. She also looks at specific occupations. One that tends to attract scrutiny is taxi operations. Lists of licence holders are obtained from the local authority by the unit and names are checked against lists of operators provided by local taxi companies. The Revenue officers use various profit and turnover statistics to check the purported income of businesses, from public houses to taxis and cleaners. These are collated on a district basis and help the officers decide whether tax might have been unpaid. 'A taxi driver, for example, will always claim back his fuel costs, and we can compare those against his takings in his accounts,' says Winship. This makes it risky for drivers to carry passengers without using their meters, and then claim back the cost of the fuel used on the journeys. Licensed traders can also be a fruitful area for the compliance officers, according to the team. Market stall holders and food-hawkers are regularly checked. Moreover, the team monitors the classified advertisements of local newspapers, which might feature a rental property or advertise the services of home entertainers, such as a magician or clown for children's parties. 'We can then check the name in the advertisement against our data base which lists the names and addresses of each of the 24.5m people in the UK who pay tax. If the name does not appear, the investigation begins,' says Stainer. Sometimes individuals are referred to the office by the police. One referral involved a man prosecuted for drug trafficking and found not guilty. He told police that the Pounds 20,000 in Scottish Pounds 20 notes they found stored under his bed had been legitimately earned. When the man walked free from court, police made sure his earnings were notified to the tax office. 'We accepted his story and came to an arrangement whereby all the Pounds 20,000 was paid as tax,' says Winship. In another case, a man who had never paid a penny of tax found he was suffering from a terminal illness and came voluntarily to the office. His life-savings of Pounds 60,000 were tied up in the value of his house. A tax assessment was arrived at to pay over the whole amount and both parties parted amicably. The investigators are not always successful, however. They discovered one boss of a manufacturing company who wanted to spend Pounds 15,000 on new machinery. His accountants told him he could not afford it but he told them he had some cash tucked away that the tax man did not know about. The man was warned by his accountants that the purchase would be queried by the inspectors. Winship says: 'When we asked him how he came by the money he said he found it in a paper bag on the bus. As proof he produced a receipt from the police station where he had handed in the package and from where he retrieved it when it was unclaimed. We believed him and moved on.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F> announcer Anne Sinclair; from the "Sept sur Sept" program;  monitored in progress -- live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Sinclair] We heard today,  Alain Juppe, that Israel has announced the release of 800-1,000  Palestinian prisoners, and that 'Arafat considers the Israeli  proposals to disarm extremists only as superficial, since he is  asking for the disarming of all the settlers. France has said  that it condemns the massacre. What can you add to this?    [Juppe] Grief, first of all, of course, and our sympathy for  the families of the casualties. Nothing is sacred any more in  the world today. Even places of worship are becoming places of  barbarism and places of killing.    [Sinclair] And today in the Lebanon, since today in the  Lebanon, in a....    [Juppe, interrupting] I was indeed thinking about Juniyah  too, where people were killed in a church. First and foremost,  our condemnation and the horror we feel at such barbarism, as  well as the desire to find out what really happened, since, as  shown in the reportage you have shown, there are contradictory  theses. It is necessary to get right to the bottom of what  really happened.    [Sinclair] Have you got an opinion? Do you think that it was  indeed the act of a madman, as the Israeli government has  claimed was the case, that is an isolated act? Or do you think  that it is a genuine plot....    [Juppe, interrupting] I do not have more information than  you  do. You know, for six months now, it had been what we feared.  Let me remind you that there was a declaration of principles on  13 September, and, over the following days, the mutual  recognition between Israel and the PLO, the Palestinian  Liberation Organization. It was a moment of joy at a time when  the international situation was not always rosy, unfortunately.  We thought: Peace is on the rails, at last. At the same time,  we were all aware that all the hawks on all sides, and even the  madmen on all sides, would do their utmost to break this  process. This is the question which is being asked today: Will  the peace process come to a halt? Or will we be able to give it  another boost?    [Sinclair] For you, could this, on the contrary, trigger a  process which would be a bit quicker? Indeed, things have been  dragging on since 13 September.    [Juppe] This is what should be done, and this is a role  France can play. Those involved in the peace process will need  courage for this. I would like to hail those who have committed  themselves to this; the Israelis, of course, Rabin, Peres, and  also Yasir 'Arafat, for whom I have special thoughts this  evening. I raise my hat to him, because he will need courage to  continue on the way he has chosen. At the same time, it is  necessary for the Israelis to react quickly and firmly.    [Sinclair] What exactly are you expecting from the Israeli  government? Do you think that the PLO is right when they ask  for the disarming of all the settlers -- 120,000 of them?    [Juppe] It is necessary to disarm all extremist movements  who  do not hide the fact that their objective is to halt the peace  process. Disarming all settlers is a different matter, because  many of these settlers have also been threatened, and there were  casualties among Israeli settlers.    In any case -- and this is an idea which I support -- it is  necessary that the disarming of extremist movements and the  security measures, which are indispensable in the occupied  territories -- since it is still Israel, the Israeli government  who is responsible for security -- give rise to the sending of  UN observers so that they can control whether the proposed  measures are efficient indeed.    It is also necessary for the Israeli government to take  confidence measures. They should release prisoners, yes, but  they should do more than that. You said that there were between  800 and 1,000. I think that there are more than 10,000 in  Israeli prisons. The issue of settlements must also be raised,  i.e. the presence of these Israeli settlers in the occupied  territories. [passage omitted]    Change in the daily life of the people in the occupied  territories -- and especially in Gaza -- is also a credibility  test for peace. If peace is not better than war, why should the  people in the occupied territories opt for peace? They must be  given reasons to choose peace, and this is why their daily life  must be changed.    [Sinclair] You said earlier on that a number of measures  must  be taken. The Security Council has met and parted without any  agreement. They will meet again tomorrow. What are you  expecting from the Security Council precisely? You said that  you were expecting it to send UN observers?    [Juppe] I for one do not believe in sending an intervention  force. We can see all the problems this causes, and we will  probably come back to this later when talking about Bosnia. I  do believe on the contrary that observers, who make it possible  to control, to check what is happening, could be useful. It is  not because the Security Council did not agree on anything  today, this Sunday, that they should not continue on Monday.  Experience has proven that tenacity in diplomacy is a cardinal  virtue.    [Sinclair] Alain Juppe, the cease-fire was violated in  Mostar today. Three mortar shells were fired in Sarajevo  yesterday. Two Bosnian soldiers were killed in Sarajevo on  Thursday, and French soldiers were targeted at the airport. It  is generally agreed that 20-30 percent of Serb batteries may not  have been totally dismantled. Given the circumstances, can we  say that the Serbs have yielded -- as you put it in an interview  with LE MONDE'this week -- or is it a false defeat, as the  magazine LE POINT put it?    [Juppe] Nobody is crying victory, and I am not either, far  from it. My first reaction last Monday, when we knew what was  happening after the ultimatum deadline, was to say: This is a  first step, the main things remain to be done. It is now  obvious, the most important things remain to be done. Having  said that, a number of facts must also be recalled.    The first fact I would like to recall is that in Sarajevo,  for three weeks now, there have been no further bombings. Three  mortar shells were fired, it is true -- as you said --  yesterday. One was fired by the Muslims, two by the Serbs.  However, on the whole, people can now go out on the streets.  This is a change.    [Sinclair] People can go out on the streets, but they cannot  leave the town.    [Juppe] No, of course not, it is only a first step.    [Sinclair] There is still no water, no electricity, no  telephone, and they cannot go out. It is still a besieged town.    [Juppe] This is why our next objective -- after this first  step, which means that children can get out of cellars and go  sledging in Sarajevo, and I hope it will last, I hope it will  with all my heart -- we must now come to the next stage  [sentence as heard]. The next stage is what we call the lifting  of the siege of Sarajevo. What is a besieged town? It is a  town one cannot leave, one cannot enter, which supplies do not  reach normally. We must put an end to all this. This is why we  have asked -- not to place Sarajevo under UN protection, as the  report suggested, I took it down on my piece of paper, we never  used such words ...    [Sinclair, interrupting] UN-administered.    [Juppe] We suggested it should be administered. We hope --  and I hope this will be possible for the Security Council  tomorrow or the day after tomorrow -- that the United Nations  will appoint, that the Security Council will appoint a  high-ranking administrator who will address right away the  restoration of daily necessities: water, gas, electricity, as  you have said, and supply facilities. This is the second stage.    [Sinclair] You said: It is not protection we advocate, it is  administration. What is the difference?    [Juppe] There is a significant difference.    [Sinclair] Does it mean that UN troops will be in Sarajevo  for 20 years, as was the case in Berlin?    [Juppe] This is another matter, because, beyond Sarajevo and  the effective lifting of the siege, that is the restoration of  almost normal conditions of life in that town -- which cannot be  taken for granted yet -- we have other two tasks to carry out.    First of all, we must deal with the other zones in Bosnia  where fighting is still taking place: Mostar, Maglaj, and  others. This is why France, in the draft resolution which is  currently being discussed by the Security Council at the  initiative of France, has also suggested that the list of safety  zones should be extended.    And finally, it is necessary to think about the global peace  plan, because, as I have said on several occasions, all these  operations will not make any sense if there is no political  settlement.    [Simclair] I would like to come back to Sarajevo, just a  couple of words. Is Sarajevo the capital of Bosnia or is it  not? If it is, the capital of which Bosnia? Or will it be a  town with a special status -- this is why I mentioned Berlin?    [Juppe] No, there is no doubt today. As long as Bosnia-  Herzegovina is a UN member-state -- which is the case -- its  capital will be in Sarajevo and the Bosnian government is the  government of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is why, a while ago, I  dismissed the word "protection." The aim is not to place the  Bosnian government under any protection. The aim is to make  sure that the necessities of daily life can be met as quickly as  possible in Sarajevo.    Who are our opponents today in that race against time, if I  may put it this way -- but time goes by so slowly in Bosnia that  the expression may not be relevant. We have two opponents,  three maybe. First of all, the inability of those signing  documents to respect what they signed. There has been some talk  about a fresh cease-fire between Croats and Muslims. You saw  that a few hours later, it was violated again. It is thus  necessary to maintain the threat, this seems vital to me.  Fortunately, France is there to say it, together with a few  others, the Americans especially. It is not because the  ultimatum deadline is behind us that the threat is no longer  there. The possibility to use air strikes to gag those who would  not respect their commitments must be maintained.    [Sinclair] I wanted to ask you something on this subject.  When does one consider that commitments are not honored? Is  there not a difference about this between NATO and the United  Nations? The United Nations seems to be dreading military  actions against the Serbs. This is what we saw the other day at  Tuzla airport. Tuzla, after all, was declared a zone protected  by NATO as far back as January. However, not only has Tuzla not  been re-opened -- there has been some talk of the 7 March  deadline, the United Nations extended it to the 18th [pauses],  when does one consider that all the conditions are met for the  threat to be used, as you put it?    [Juppe] I am not the one who will decide. I am the minister  of foreign affairs, I am not an officer, I am not on the ground.  We have devised a precise procedure. It is up to the UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] command, and you know who exercises  it; a French general in Sarajevo, General Soubirou; a British  general for the whole of Bosnia, General Rose; a French general  for the whole of Yugoslavia, General Cot. It is up to them, who  are on the ground, to say: In this particular case, we are  asking for permission to use air strikes. We, the politicians,  have said that we were ready to do so. In Tuzla, the question  has been raised indeed, and I personally called the UN secretary  general to tell him: If the UNPROFOR command ask you to order  air strikes, I would like to tell you that France agrees to  that, because the conditions were met.    [Sinclair] Do you believe that the UN forces staff were  timorous?    [Juppe] It is up to the staff to decide; don't expect me to  pass sentence on soldiers who are risking their lives on the  ground. I said earlier that we had three enemies. I mentioned  the inability of the belligerents to keep their word. The  second enemy, or the second adversary, if I may say so, is the  UN lack of resources, and I believe that this must be repeated  again. It is not enough to vote through resolutions in the  Security Council; money and troops are also needed. When  security safe havens were set up, the UN secretary general said:  I need an extra 7,500 soldiers to guarantee their existence.  Only three countries in the world answered his call, which one?  First, in July 1993, France which sent an extra 1,000 soldiers.  Then two small countries, and this much to their credit, the  Netherlands and Nordic countries [as heard].    [Sinclair] When we read your remarks in LE MONDE, you  clearly  called on the Americans to join us today.    [Juppe] I call on everyone. In this tragedy everyone is  lecturing us. I believe France has paid its fair share and even  more than that, I recall that we had many killed on the ground.  Finally, our third enemy, is the dissipation of diplomatic  efforts. You showed it earlier in a video clip, negotiations are  currently under way everywhere, In New York, in Bonn, in Geneva.    [Sinclair] We will come around to this later. When you say  more soldiers are needed, it must be understood that to run  Sarajevo and all the other zones, that every time the Serbs pull  back from positions they hold, these must be occupied by UN  soldiers, this explains why more men are needed.    [Juppe] Obviously.    [Sinclair] Now to return to the issue of other safe havens,  particularly the Muslim enclaves in Serb territory such as  Gorazde, Zepa, Srebrenica, and others, do you believe that the  same method used in Sarajevo, namely an ultimatum, should be  used?    [Juppe] I believe that today, the ultimatum as a method is  not justified.    [Sinclair] Why?    [Juppe] Because it is an unwieldy tool and because  conditions  are met to use force. Let's take the example of Tuzla. What  was decided regarding Tuzla on several occasions, the last time  on 10 and 11 January? Things are decided and then people are  needed to recall what had been decided and to get things moving.  It was decided to reopen the airport. [Juppe explains with  help of map] It is an airport which is in a Muslim zone, the  green zone [on the map], but it is under the threat of Serb  guns. What was decided? It was decided to reopen the airport  simply to dispatch humanitarian aid which is only reaching  Sarajevo airport.    [Sinclair] It must be recalled that a million and a half  people rely on this humanitarian aid in this region.    [Juppe] It is obvious that if aircraft could land here with  food and medical supplies this would greatly help the action of  non- governmental organizations and of the United Nations. The  Serbs are refusing and say: If aircraft land, they will bring  in weapons in the Muslim zone. The Atlantic Alliance decided to  go in regardless and said that if the Serbs were opposing this  and were shelling then they would be neutralized by the use of  air power.    [Sinclair] That was back in January.    [Juppe] Yes, indeed. We were told from New York that this  would take place on 7 March, this was then postponed to 18  March. I believe that it takes a great deal of time and that  this operation could take place much earlier if a stronger  political will were expressed. The same holds for Srebrenica  [showing it on the map], a Muslim enclave within a Serb zone,  where freedom of movement does not exist anymore. Once more the  Atlantic Alliance has decided to restore this freedom to enable  UN convoys and troops to move freely. In this case we have been  discussing this for two months or six weeks, this is under way,  but with great difficulties.    [Sinclair] I am asking my question again: Do you believe  that the United Nations is not as willing to react to this  situation as NATO, which seems to be taking resolutions which  have been followed by results in Sarajevo but not in these zones?    [Juppe] Yes and no, but this is in keeping with the nature  of  each one of these organizations. What is NATO? It is a  military alliance. What is the United Nations? It is an  organization dispatching peace soldiers. Therefore, it is not  unusual for the logic of the two organizations to be different  and this is why the Alliance had to step in to support the  United Nations.    [Sinclair] I can sense your impatience.    [Juppe] You see, as far as this case is concerned, if I were  not impatient I would be unaware, well I have been trying to do  something for the past 11 months and I can see that it is  difficult. [passage omitted]    The sensitive issue of access to the sea [for Bosnia] is  that  Bosnia-Herzegovina stops here, as we can see on this map. If we  want to have access to the sea we must move through Croat  territory, through Croatia itself, and the Croats are saying, we  will not cut our own territory, we will not isolate Dubrovnik,  therefore we refuse. We found a way to solve this issue which  is one of the issues under discussion in New York today, it is  to attempt to get Croats and Muslims together and to set up what  we call a Croatian-Muslim federation. With this condition it  seems that the issue of access to the sea could be solved more  easily. This is a path which must be explored, it worries me  somehow and I will tell you why. It looks as if in current  diplomatic talks every issue is being dealt with bit by bit. We  try to get Croats and Muslims to agree, and I am simply asking  what will happen later with the Serbs? We must not forget that  no global peace will be achieved if we do not reach a solution  acceptable to all parties. Therefore I find it extremely  important -- I was mentioning diplomatic efforts -- to get  together all the pieces of the puzzle.    [Sinclair] The Russians made proposals for an international  conference but Western countries -- with the exception of  Germany -- do not seem to fully agree, why?    [Juppe] The idea as such is not bad. However, the Russians  made proposals for an international meeting at the highest  possible level, that of heads of state and governments. Can you  imagine President Yeltsin, President Clinton, President  Mitterrand and a few others meeting tomorrow or the day after?  To decide what? An international conference must be prepared,  we will be in favor of such a conference the day we have made  progress, the day we have outlined a preliminary agreement  between all parties. Meanwhile, and this must take place  rapidly, this week, next week, talks at the level of experts,  possibly at the level of ministers must move forward in order to  find a solution acceptable to all.    [Sinclair] When we speak of an agreement acceptable to all,  what does it mean? The old Bosnian dream of a multi-ethnic  Bosnia is over. Today we regret this Bosnia which has  disappeared forever and we are moving toward something else,  namely toward a Bosnia divided into several ethnically  homogeneous republics, if I may so.    [Juppe] In France we are lucky enough to have many  ideologues  who have set ideas, who have plans for Bosnia and their plans  are that Bosnia should be a united state in which various ethnic  groups would live together, as they are saying.    [Sinclair] This was initially a Bosnian dream, before being  adopted by the ideologues.    [Juppe] Yes, but this dream does not fit reality any more,  we  must have the courage to say so. I am not convinced that we are  helping the peace process by brandishing this idea which has  been superseded by events today. First, I strongly question the  use of the term multi-ethnic, this is the same people; cultures  and religions are different but this is one people. When three  communities have been tearing each other apart for several  months, for several years, when they have been killing each  other, raping each other and so on, how can you -- even if you  are writing for a famous French weekly -- decide that they will  be forced to live with each other? This is why the whole of the  European Union, in agreement with the [warring] parties, moved  toward the preservation of a Bosnia-Herzegovina member of the  United Nations but made up of three entities: a Croat entity, a  Muslim entity and a Serb entity maintaining very flexible links  between themselves. The percentage of territory to be given to  each one of this community was even very precisely drawn up.  They accepted this and what I am wishing now is that we will  not move too far away from this plan.    [Sinclair] [passage omitted] When you say I question the  term  multi-ethnic, are you also questioning the term ethnic cleansing  used this week again by the former Polish prime minister,  Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who is the author of a report for the United  Nations. He said this week that 2 million people had been  forcibly displaced in this war and that ethnic cleansing was  still continuing.    [Juppe] I never questioned this. I am simply speaking of  religious cleansing, these are religious communities, Orthodox,  Catholic, Muslim caught in the middle.    [Sinclair] There has not been any similar movement of  population in Europe since the war.    [Juppe] In Europe, but -- and this does not excuse these --  there were others elsewhere, when India and Pakistan divided in  1947, millions of people were displaced. There were movements  of populations between Greece and Turkey too following the  Trianon Treaty, and I condemn them.    [Sinclair] Europe had another idea, namely to ban this on  the  continent. You hope that the diplomatic process will be cleared  on the ground before this international conference which, I  believe, you would like to be held in Paris following a French  initiative.    [Juppe] Why not? But this is not the issue, I believe that  we should avoid any kind of chauvinistic behavior or  competition, we must find ways to an agreement. I am tempted to  say that the best peace agreement is not the one which is  decreed to be the best following questionable norms, but the one  accepted by all parties. [passage omitted]    [Sinclair] Before we discuss French politics, let us talk  about Algeria. The leader of the Armed Islamic Group was killed  by the Algerian security forces today. This group threatened  foreigners and all those who may cooperate with the Algerian  government, and claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of  French nationals, including that of the Thevenot couple.    There is endless violence in Algeria, an extremely difficult  economic situation and the danger of social unrest. Where do  you place General Zeroual's action against such a background?    [Juppe] I would like to quote President Mitterrand. I  believe he used this sentence about Bosnia: This concerns us.  I don't think I need to explain why, apart from history,  geographic closeness, and the importance for France to find a  stable partner in Algeria. Because the instability in Algeria,  the destabilization of northern Africa -- I need not go on -- we  know what sort of results this can bring. I would like to pay  homage to Mr. Joachim Grau, who has just been featured [in video  report]. This interview [with him, last January] was moving, he  explained that he had always lived there and that was his  country -- he is the sixth French national to be killed.    I would like to repeat -- I believe it is my duty to do so  --  that we have taken every precaution to protect our community,  which is significantly large there. Two-thirds of the children  registered with French schools have returned to France. The  number of diplomatic staff has been reduced. Relatives of  private companies' employees working there have also returned,  but none of these measures can be one hundred percent effective.  The solution must come from Algeria, this is self-evident. For  months now, we have been saying that first of all the Algerian  economy must be reformed because what has been taking place  there, in Algeria, is the result of 30 years of economic chaos  and the blatant failure of a collectivized economy. Things must  change.    [Sinclair] The IMF has firmly asked for....    [Juppe, interrupting] Absolutely. The main news is that over  the last three or four months, the Algerian government has  established contacts with the IMF, has negotiated with the IMF  and we, the French and the Europeans, have said that, should  there be an agreement, we would be ready to offer Algeria our  help so that it may try and get out of its economic slump which  is fuelling the young people's unease.    The second prerequisite is that there should be political  dialogue. As General Zeroual himself said, the security  solution is not a solution at all because we can see that the  escalation of violence is continuing week after week.    [Sinclair] Do you mean political dialogue between the  Algerian authorities and members of the Islamic Salvation Front  [FIS]?    [Juppe] Absolutely, as well as the Algerian factions or the  political movements who accept dialogue and leave their  Kalashnikovs behind, including those members of the FIS who  reject violence. It seems that this discussion process is now  under way. Unfortunately, violence does not seem to decrease,  and this is why I am still extremely concerned by the situation  in Algeria.

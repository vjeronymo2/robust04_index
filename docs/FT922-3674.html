			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Pechiney agrees to sale of nuclear-related businesses THE FRENCH government has asked Pechiney, the state-controlled aluminium group, to sell for FFr2.2bn (Dollars 411m) its nuclear-related businesses, in a reorganisation of one of the world's leading nuclear industries. Pechiney has agreed to sell nearly all its nuclear businesses by the end of the month to Framatome, France's monopoly builder of nuclear reactors, and Cogema, the nuclear fuel retreatment group. The companies for sale are Comurhex, a fuel refining group; FBFC, a fuel producer; and Zircotube, a maker of zirconium tubes used in corrosion resistant fuel claddings. In addition, Pechiney is selling a 50 per cent stake in Cezus, the world's largest zirconium producer, to Framatome and Cogema jointly, with an undertaking to sell them the rest at the end of 1994. Pechiney's withdrawal from the nuclear industry, which accounted for 3 per cent of its sales last year, leaves France with two nuclear industrial groups: Cogema, which specialises in the fuel cycle from mining to enrichment transport and waste storage; and Framatome, which makes reactors, fuel and related products. Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister, said the idea was to simplify the industry's organisation to help it form international alliances. Pechiney agreed to the nuclear disposals because it accepted it 'did not have the right cards in its hand to follow its strategy in the long term' in that sector, said Mr Jean Gandois, chairman. The French nuclear industry needed 'fewer players, each with better defined powers'. The businesses involved contributed between FFr130m and FFr140m to Pechiney's FFr820m profits, and FFr2.2bn to its FFr74.4bn turnover last year. This did not include Cezus, which remains a Pechniney subsidiary, with Pechiney controlling of its titanium unit until its disposal is complete in two years. Cogema's sales, FFr21.7bn last year, will rise by between 6 and 7 per cent thanks to the deal, while Framatome's nuclear-related turnover, FFr8.5bn in 1990, will grow by between 10 and 15 per cent. Pechiney has been involved in the nuclear industry since the end of the Second World War, when it was asked by the atomic energy commission to make graphite for early experimental reactors. However, this has always been a small part of its business. Mr Gandois said the cash would be used to reduce Pechiney's borrowings of more than FFr20bn.</p>

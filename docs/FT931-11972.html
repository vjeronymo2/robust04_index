			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wholesale Fittings dips to Pounds 934,000 INTERIM pre-tax profits at Wholesale Fittings, the distributor of electrical goods, declined from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 934,000 on turnover up by Pounds 300,000 at Pounds 30.3m. Mr Leonard Rose, joint managing director, said that margins had 'held up reasonably well', but redundancies and the cost of the company's new integrated computer system helped knock operating profits back from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 797,000. Interest receivable slipped to Pounds 137,000 (Pounds 156,000). The workforce was reduced by 50 people, or 7 per cent, and the branch at Telford - the smallest - was closed in December 1992. Trading conditions continued to be 'extremely difficult and highly competitive'. The interim dividend is held at 3.23p, payable from reduced earnings of 4.4p (5.6p).</p>

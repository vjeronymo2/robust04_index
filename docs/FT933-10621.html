			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Whitecroft ex-directors share Pounds 165,000 pay-off WHITECROFT, the Cheshire-based mini-conglomerate which reported a Pounds 41.8m pre-tax loss in the year to March 31, paid a total of Pounds 165,000 in compensation for loss of office to two former directors. The payments were made to Mr Peter Goold, former chairman, and Mr Graham M'Cardell, finance director, and were disclosed in the company's annual report. The total payment was not broken down between the two men. Mr M'Cardell retired from the board in early March after reaching normal retirement age, while Mr Goold resigned later that month after 24 years with the company, the last two as executive chairman. Mr Goold's resignation was seen as an attempt to appease the group's institutional investors, who had watched the share price tumble. He was succeeded in a non-executive capacity by Mr David Kendall, chairman of Bunzl. Mr Mike Derbyshire - brought in by Mr Goold as managing director last year - became chief executive, and Mr M'Cardell was succeeded by Mr Martyn Ellis.</p>

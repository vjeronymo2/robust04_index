			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Sharp strategies create a buffer against electronics slump - Steven Butler on president Haruo Tsuji's recipe for resilience in the fiercely-competitive world of computer technology THE consumer electronics industry is supposed to be in a slump, groping about for new products. If it is, someone ought to tell Mr Haruo Tsuji, president of Sharp, the Osaka-based Japanese electronics company. In the past two months, Mr Tsuji has pulled off two important cross-border alliances - with Apple Computer and Intel - that will put it at the centre of emerging technologies for a new generation of products. At home, Sharp caught the rest of the industry napping when it launched a television receiver that promises to revolutionise the market for high-definition television in Japan. It simplified the functions of the standard HDTV and managed to undercut competitors' prices by 75 per cent. As a result, a mass market for HDTV is just around the bend instead of years away. 'We don't make the same things that other people make, because if we do we will lose out,' says Mr Tsuji. Yet Sharp's strategy of avoiding a well-trodden path may not work for much longer. Technologies it has been perfecting for years - such as colour liquid crystal display (LCD) screens - suddenly look like becoming mainstream. Competitive advantage in the electronics business is at best a fleeting affair. Yet, thanks to clever strategic choices, Sharp is well-prepared to cope with the difficult business conditions of the 1990s, where many product markets have reached saturation. This is apparent as much in what Sharp has chosen not to do as in what it is doing. Sharp is big in the semiconductor memory business, controlling 44 per cent of the world market for mask read-only memory chips that contain, for example, electronic instruction sets for computer games. Yet, even though its scientists have stayed in the development race for the latest generation of dynamic random access memory chips (D-Ram) - a key component of personal computers - Sharp decided not to manufacture them. 'It is even more cost-effective to buy D-Ram from other companies,' says Mr Tsuji. With D-Ram makers unlikely ever to make a profit on the hundreds of millions of dollars spent to develop and manufacture the latest generation of high-capacity chip, the four-megabit D-Ram, Sharp's restraint looks wise. It has left the company in a stronger position to pay for the next round of research, to which it is devoting 8 per cent of sales, or Y98bn (Dollars 742.42m) a year. Similarly, Sharp does not have the same huge presence in the saturated markets for audio and visual equipment that is weighing on giants like Sony and Matsushita, whose profits are down sharply. Almost alone among Japanese electronics companies, Sharp has not yet had to revise downward profits projections for the fiscal year that ends today. This is not to suggest its sales have been buoyant. Sales of cordless phones, where Sharp has been a leader, have been sluggish and are hurt by the appreciation of the yen. Mr Tsuji says a small downward revision in projections of roughly flat year-on-year profits may be necessary. Yet its ability to absorb a downturn in the industry is much better than its rivals. Instead of spending billions to buy movie and music studios to acquire 'software' to go with its hardware business, Sharp instead devoted its funds to selected technologies. It is now an unrivaled world leader in laser diodes, a key component of compact disc players, mask ROM memories, and liquid crystal display screens. LCD production in the 1991 fiscal year grew 71 per cent to Y115bn, after 53 per cent growth the year before. Mr Tsuji says growth is likely to reach 43 per cent in 1992. Sharp has led the technological advance since it introduced the LCD calculator in 1973. In the last year, however, it has been joined by hefty competitors in the field. NEC, Toshiba, Matsushita and Canon have all commited large funds to the LCD business. They are expecting demand for LCD screens to follow the rising popularity of portable computers. The flat, lightweight screens will also begin to replace office computer displays, and eventually some picture tubes in televisions. The market will be huge, but the potential for oversupply and cut-throat pricing will be high. Mr Tsuji professes not to be worried. 'Of course there will be competition, but technological development is the important factor,' he says. Long term, he wants to gradually re-weight Sharp's business areas. Consumer appliances as a proportion of Sharp's Y1,220bn in sales have been brought down from 60 to 55 per cent, with a near-term goal of a 50-50 split with business related information devices. The concentration on technologies for electronic devices - which Sharp will sell to others and use in its own products - is at the heart of growth strategy. It was partly because of Sharp's expertise in read-only memories and LCD screens that Intel and Apple selected it as tner. Intel, which controls 85 per cent of the world market for microprocessors, is sharing with Sharp its advanced technology for flash memory devices, easily erasable and recordable integrated circuits that retain information when the power is switched off. These could be used in place of magnetic tape recorders or hard disc drives in portable computers, and will make it possible to build smaller and lighter equipment which uses little electric power. Similarly, Apple offered its software to Sharp because of the latter's expertise in LCD displays, which will be a key component in some of the pocket-sized electronic devices Apple is planning. Another attraction was Sharp's proven ability to turn technology into consumer products that sell. Indeed, Mr Tsuji refuses to forsake the older lines such as refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners and microwave ovens, because he believes microcomputers, sensors, and optical devices are about to revolutionise home appliances.</p>

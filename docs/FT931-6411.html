			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Coal chief warns of stockpile dangers MR NEIL CLARKE, chairman of British Coal, warned yesterday on the dangers of keeping pits open by maintaining electricity generators' stockpiles. He suggested that such a solution would deter potential buyers in privatisation. His comments to the Coal Industry Society in London came amid growing fears among British Coal officials that the white paper on coal will depend heavily on persuading the generators to keep stocks at high levels. The generators currently hold stocks of about 35m tonnes but want to reduce them by about a third. Mr Clarke said that any additional demand for coal should result in it being burnt and 'not simply put to stock'. British Coal needed a durable solution to its problems. Such a solution could only come from creating a more substantial market for coal now, while not neglecting what happened beyond the five-year contracts likely to be agreed shortly. 'The longer-term risk is in creating an artificial demand for coal. The end of the five-year contract period would then almost certainly see further intense pressure on our collieries.' Mr Clarke said that any assessment of potential demand for coal must be linked to a redesign of contract structures between British Coal and its customers. The issues he had raised would have a fundamental impact on the potential for privatising the business. Behind Mr Clarke's comments is a growing feeling at the corporation that the government's apparent solution will merely delay the closure of pits, with the biggest danger point in 1998. In that year the five-year contracts already tentatively agreed for 160m tonnes between British Coal and the generators will end. Additional contracts under discussion for a further 40m to 65.5m tonnes would also expire then. If stocks remained at their current level, the generators would be able to produce electricity without buying coal for more than six months. Mr Clarke said he found it sad and regrettable that leaders of the National Union of Mineworkers were campaigning for strike action in a ballot to be held later this week. He said: 'Industrial action could not be a worse signal to send after we have rebuilt belief in the security of our supplies.'</p>

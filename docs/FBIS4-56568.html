			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez to the </F> National Assembly of the People's Government at the Havana  Convention Center on 1 May -- recorded]    [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro; Comrade Ricardo  Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's  Government [ANPP]; comrade deputies; and guests.    When we began the discussions of the problems related to the  internal financial imbalance in our country during the last ANPP  session in December 1993, we all knew that we were facing one of  the most serious economic, political, and social problems the  Revolution has ever faced throughout its history. However, our  people have grown accustomed to these hardships and have  demonstrated, since our fights for liberty, that there are no  obstacles or difficulties that cannot be overcome if one acts  with resolution, patriotism, and loyalty to principles.    Today we have come to this special ANPP session, in  recognition of 1 May, supported by a massive discussion -- an  example of the people's participation in decision-making, which  allows us to count on the collective thinking of the grassroots  and on their understanding of the solutions to these red hot  problems.    Before beginning the debates, allow me to submit some  principles, which in our opinion, must precede solutions to the  internal financial imbalances. To do this, we will submit the  ideas prepared by the Ministry of Finance, and the opinions on  which we must meditate and work. These opinions stem from the  workers' parliaments and from the opinions gathered from the  Cuban Communist Party [PCC] cadres and partisans; and in  general, from the opinions [words indistinct] by all our people.    First of all, we must stress the fact that the best  technical  solutions will be feasible only if we can also count on the  patriotism and honor of our fellow citizens and on their  willingness to do whatever might be necessary to save the  Revolution.    These solutions also claim that the principles of social  justice and solidairty must prevail. In our country, no one will  be neglected. No honest worker will see his essential interests  overlooked or sacrificed, and no neoliberal adjustment policy  will be implemented in Cuba.    Moreover, we must realistically assume that the measures we  might adopt will demand an undeniable share of sacrifice, which  we must face with the wisdom of he who is the defender of the  essential things that guarantee our economic stability and the  Revolution's survival.    The current financial imbalance in the Cuban economy  synthesizes an imbalance that for years has been growing in the  areas of production and distribution. It is appropriate to  recall that this phenomenon is found both in the monetary area,  through excess currency; and in the fiscal area, through the  deficit in the state budget.    The solution to this imbalance is found -- as repeated  several times -- essentially and ultimately -- in an increase in  supply of goods and services, stemming from an increase in  production.    However, due to the impossibility of achieving this growth  to  the extent demanded in a short term, we must reduce the demand;  we must quickly revalue the national currency to motivate work;  and finally, we must achieve an increase in production and  services.    The initial basis of a fiscal streamlining policy has  already  been adopted, with substantial reductions to the 1994 budget  deficit, to which I will refer later.    We must also take into account the fact that monetary  circulation in the country at this moment includes both national  currency and freely-convertible currency. Both must be  considered when analyzing these problems.    In terms of national currency, by the end of March 1994, the  excess currency amounted to 11.636 billion pesos. Of this total,  59 percent was deposited in savings accounts with the People's  Savings Bank, and 41 percent was circulating among the  population. Over the first two or three months of the year, this  amount of currency in the hands of the people has been  increasing, and if the necessary measures are not adopted to  curtail this trend, we will reach a much higher figure by the  end of the year.    The primary income source of our population shows that,  according to the latest available estimates, 44 percent of  workers earned basic salaries of up to 148 pesos monthly, while  32 percent earned between 149 and 198 pesos. Moreover, pensions  were set between 60 and 99 pesos for 62 percent of all  pensioners. In general, also according to the latest available  data, families considered low income represented approximately  24 percent of the total number of families throughout the  country.    This situation calls for income distribution with certain  modification levels. Considering the existence of a previous  redistribution process and the existence of a certain amount of  freely-convertible currency which, since the decriminalization  of the dollar last year, has been having an impact on, but not  essentially changing, many of these realities.    Considering the adoption of measures to streamline the  country's monetary-fiscal system in accordance with the analysis  we have made at the Finance Ministry, and which we are  submitting for consideration by the ANPP today, we believe that  the monetary-fiscal process must also be closely related to the  reestablishment of other policies, which are being adjusted in  the country in the labor and salary areas.    In the entrepreneurial area, for the sake of achieving the  greatest economic efficiency and production growth possible, we  have followed the recommendations of the workers' parliaments  where these problems were discussed.    Moreover, the streamlining of the monetary-fiscal system  demands the adoption of a set of consistent measures, the  overall effect of which must be clearly established. Thus, the  order, the discipline, and the pace of implementation of the  agreed-upon measures will yield gradual effects, which will be  perceptible within a period of at least 18 months.    The measures adopted therefore demand a great deal of  political authenticity and feeling so as to achieve the greatest  support possible from all of our population at this moment.    Let us now talk about the measures we have been analyzing  throughout this discussion process. First of all, the measures  adopted to reduce the budget deficit represent an essential  element in assessing the country's financial situation. We can  therefore state that for the 1994 budget, our government has  decided to reduce that fiscal deficit by approximately 1 billion  pesos during the current year. According to the estimates that  have not yet been concluded, this represents a 24-percent  reduction of that deficit. As we also reported during the  session held in December, the reduction of subsidies for losses  also plays an important role because in the 1994 budget, losses  amounted to 1.3 billion pesos. For this reason, we are seeking  efficiency and productivity efforts by our entrepreneurial  institutions.    Also, among the overall financial problems, and in light of  the discussions of these issues in December, the amount of  accounts receivable and payable in the country were mentioned.  At that moment we provided the data for a representative sample  of companies and institutions, which were samples of others up  to the end of the sessions on 30 September.    We were later able to complete the data from the information  provided by each central state administration organization and  by the local ANPP organizations, reaching the end of last year  with accounts receivable totaling 3,898,800,000 pesos, 97  percent of which belong to the entrepreneurial sector.    These accounts were divided in the following manner: 41  percent were due in 30 days, a payment period which can be  considered normal; 28 percent fell due between 31 and 90 days;  while 31 percent fell due after more than 90 days. As a general  rule, the accounts to be paid in more than 30 days represented  only 12.4 percent of the overall value of sales during the year  to date.    An analysis made by the majority, not to say all the state  companies and the local ANPP organizations, has led to a  reduction of these bills during the first quarter of the year by  11.3 percent, which represents the collection of 440 million  pesos which were pending as of 31 December last year.    Moreover, accounts receivable in freely-convertible currency  [words indistinct] have reached a surplus of approximately  209,800,000 pesos. However, of this total, 47.5 percent is the  result of operations in currency among national institutions,  and only 52.5 percent was the net total to be paid by companies  abroad.    Moreover, from this total, which can represent a net flow of  the country's income, 73.9 percent were in a normal payable  situation, and only 26.1 were in an unpayable situation. Thus,  after these analyses we can say that it has been confirmed that  there is no negligence in charging the debts in freely  convertible currency and that the pending debts are part of  normal situations in the country's income.    Lastly, taking into account the situation of accounts  receivable and accounts payable, the problems analyzed for each  organization, and with the purpose of preventing current  problems and situations in the detected cases from being  repeated, a set of measures has been adopted to guarantee an  improvement of the situation and to see that such an  accumulation of accounts receivable is not repeated in the  future. These measures are already in the process of being  implemented.    Concerning measures to encourage savings, a few minutes ago  we said that approximately 59 percent of the excess currency in  the country is deposited in savings accounts. Thus, it is  essential to consider the measures to be adopted to see that  that money remains in the banks. We have considered several  alternatives, taking into account our current economic situation  and being careful not to imitate formulas that in other cases  would yield some results, but which in our particular situation,  might not be the most suitable.    Thus, we have thought that a set of options could be  considered, options which are not always or necessarily related  to the increase in interest rates, because with the excess  currency in the country, it is not always the case that an  increase in interest rates would necessarily increase the  motivation for savings. We must look for other alternatives.  These other alternatives contemplate the possibility of relating  savings accounts to specific ends, as some have mentioned here  and in the workers' parliaments themselves, which might imply a  freezing of funds for a given time with guarantees given by the  bank for the saver, so that these funds can be converted into  some type of special savings bonds. In due time we might also  consider the possibility of having fixed-term savings accounts  in foreign currency.    These measures, in addition to others that might be  considered, can be a guarantee for freezing most savings  accounts deposited in banks. These savings must increase,  because it is good for the country to have increased savings.  The measures we might adopt must preserve the mechanisms that  will encourage savings and the people's savings bank, and we  must also see that this amount of money is out of circulation as  long as possible.    We have also considered the possibility brought up in the  workers' parliaments of issuing public-debt bonds. This we can  consider within the possibilities which have not been used in  our country for many years but which represent a method employed  by the state, and a method employed by other countries  worldwide, to request a long-term loan from our people, a loan  often payable in more than 10 years, perhaps in 15 or 20 years.  This loan would help recover with different interest  alternatives, or without interest, those bonds. We also  considered the possibility of implementing other variables which  would appeal to collective subscriptions to these bonds, to a  movement of patriotic support for this type of debt emission  which, I repeat, could also yield some results which would  contribute to long-term freezing of those resources.    We must adopt measures that will promote better control of  the circulation of freely-convertible currency in the country.  This is a new phenomenon which we began implementing last year,  and with which we do not have full experience concerning the  implications and measures we must definitely adopt to achieve  better control. But undoubtedly some of the ideas brought up in  the workers' parliaments and other forums, and the ideas brought  up by the people themselves, are being considered. An example of  this could be, for instance, changing the currency for one that  could play that role, a currency that could be called a  convertible peso [peso convertible] or foreign exchange peso  [peso-divisa] in the country. This is one of the possibilities  and it offers a number of benefits because it places that  monetary circulation under the direct control and sovereignty of  the Cuban state. This is one of the options we must consider.    There are other measures intended to strengthen the state's  policy to attract the freely-convertible currency through the  dollar-collecting stores. It is worth repeating that the  established policy seeks to obtain through high prices the  highest profit levels possible from those currency holders in  order to redistribute them equally among other needs the country  has. We must work toward that purpose and we must also gain the  understanding of the spirit of this policy because those high  prices must lead us to understand the reason for implementing  them.    There are other measures which imply the need to strengthen  the circulation of the peso, and which in some way contribute  toward compensating for the imbalance created when a  freely-convertible currency is implemented in the country. Thus,  the gradual increase in supply of national goods and services  obtainable in pesos by selected sectors through the stores which  exist, for example, in our Basic Cooperative Production Units  [UBPC], the stores created for specific sectors, makes it  possible, that with the pesos charged by the workers to those  sectors, a related market is created to give an answer to the  Cuban peso with a supply which is more or less limited at this  moment but which can be expanded. This is a measure that will  contribute toward gradually balancing the purchasing power of  the peso.    Together with this, we must also implement, or study the  implementation of measures that will provide incentives to the  workers to increase the supply of goods and services available  in the national currency in accordance with the country's needs.    Some decisions have been made recently, such as in the case  of the workers involved in the generation of electricity, to  implement a program of this nature.    To the extent possible, this could imply that, when we have  more production, we can increase the free sale of certain  products at prices which are in line with the current situation  we have to face due to the financial imbalance prevailing in the  country. The possibility of analyses or inventories which are  still outdated, or some reservations in this distribution  channel, have not been ruled out.    Among the services that could be supplied we can mention,  for  instance, the sale of personal, property, and civil  responsibility insurance which has not been implemented in the  country to this date. This is a type of mechanism we must  consider and we must assess as a supplementary mechanism which  helps protect the people from risk, without directly undermining  the state's budget.    There are other types of measures, such as the advanced  payment, with a certain level of discount, of the people's debt  to the People's Savings Bank, debts stemming from personal  credits or from credits granted for housing. We have made an  analysis, for instance, that a reasonable discount rate for  immediate or short-term payments could be granted, according to  different combinations, and that this could yield between 350  and 500 million pesos. This idea, if implemented, will surely  increase the country's potential.    We must also consider measures for a selective increase in  prices and rates. Comrade Ross has submitted several proposals  collected from different opinions conveyed in the workers'  parliaments, and we have been analyzing a set of those opinions  which because of their economic importance, or because of the  consensus level, are obviously measures that must be taken into  consideration.    Thus, we have discussed the possible implications of the  elimination of product subsidies, replacing them with subsidies  to low-income people. This is a measure within our capability  and which, if implemented, in a short term could yield some 200  million pesos yearly.    The increase in prices of nonessential products: many things  have been said about different combinations, but undoubtedly  there is a major level of consensus concerning the adoption of a  set of measures among which we can mention the possibility of  increasing cigarette prices.    On discussing these matters on different occasions we have  talked about this measure and that it implies some  organizational rules. This implies a certain level of control of  inventories in order to face a demand which has not been  satisfactory for a relatively lengthy period of several months  -- since last year -- and how to reach an organization of this  measure so that this increase in prices will not become an  additional channel leading to the underground economy and to the  black market.    In our analysis we have realized that prices can be  increased  without necessarily eliminating the different distribution  categories that now exist. That is, it seems advisable to  consider the possibility of maintaining the distribution  categories and to increase prices which, among other  alternatives, could be established in this manner: for instance,  we are considering the idea of increasing the price of a  cigarette pack to two pesos in a regular distribution category,  and to six pesos in the extra-quota category, and to 10 pesos in  the unregulated category.    This, comrades, would probably yield an additional income,  maintaining an organized distribution and a minimum inventory,  of 1.954 million additional pesos yearly, if all those  cigarettes are sold. That is, with or without these prices,  these measures can yield an amount that is not inconsequential.  But undoubtedly this is one of the most important measures  concerning price increases, and cigarettes are not an essential  article vital for the existence of man.    Prices of alcoholic beverages have also been considered,  taking into account the same characteristics we mentioned  previously in the case of cigarettes, and the production costs  that must be considered before putting anything into effect. And  considering the different categories, of rum and other alcoholic  beverages, starting from prices in those three scales, for  instance of 30 and 40... [changes thought] excuse me, from 40,  30, and 20 [not further specified] for 750 ml bottles. In this  scale, this increase in prices would provide an additional  income of 328 million pesos yearly. This is another important  element we must take into consideration within our analysis.    We have also analyzed the possibility -- and all these  figures stem from an analysis of the production behavior this  year -- of implementing this measure, not from the point of  view of potential production, but of production that can be  achieved. In the case of beer, for instance, and we cannot  guarantee that it will be achieved, but if the minimum  production of beer can be achieved every year, only by doubling  the average price of the bottle of beer in the different  categories, from retail to wholesale distribution, this could  yield $135 million pesos yearly. This is a very small amount, I  repeat, but still it yields some resources that cannot be  rejected.    We also discussed a vehicular fuel price increase as one of  the possible measures to be adopted, and according to different  combinations of the premium gasoline, the regular gasoline, and  diesel, taking into account what appears to be this year's true  distribution -- which is less than last year, as you well know  -- it could also yield, according to different combinations  which in some cases would demand doubling or tripling the price  per liter, some $80 million more, notwithstanding the reduced  deliveries we are facing.    Concerning utility rates, and Comrade Ross already mentioned  this, one of the services which has obtained the highest level  of understanding has been the increase in electricity rates in  residential areas. Recently, in a television program, our  comrade [Basic Industry Minister] Marcos Portal explained that  increasing the electricity rates at this moment is practically  indispensable, not only to increase the country's income but to  foster savings in electricity consumption.    In the analysis we have jointly made with our comrades from  the Basic Industry Ministry in an effort to protect the  low-level consumers, that is, those who consume up to 100  kilowatts monthly, we have decided to maintain one of the  variables: not to change the price of nine centavos per  kilowatt, but increasing it in the other two levels: that is,  from 100 to 300 kilowatts, and those above 300 kilowatts of  consumption. These consumers will be charged higher rates, at  least 20 centavos per kilowatt, and 40 centavos per kilowatt.  This, in addition to exerting better control and a motivation to  reduce consumption, could yield approximately 112 million pesos  more yearly.    We have also considered the possibility of increasing  nonurban transport tariffs, taking into account different  alternatives and different proposals submitted by our comrades  from the Transport Ministry, considering the increase in costs:  fuel, et cetera. This, not to fall into excessive details, and  if implemented in a short term, could also provide an additional  income of approximately 100 million pesos.    Telephone rates were also mentioned in relation to the  improvement of services. In this case we have been considering  some alternatives to increase the telephone rates, not too much,  but sufficiently only to cover costs and to reduce losses. This  would yield the small amount of approximately 11 million [pesos].    Other types of services to the people were also considered,  namely the price of the workers' cafeterias. After thoroughly  analyzing the proposals submitted by the workers' parliaments,  we thought that this must be a decentralized decision. That is,  a central organization cannot say that prices will be increased.  However, if we manage to achieve -- and this is the calculation  we have made -- that if the workers' cafeterias manage to cover  their costs, or whatever the mechanism, in whatever period, and  with the discussions in each workplace, the country would save  and also collect an additional 100 million pesos yearly. This is  the cost the government has to pay in terms of subsidies for  charging prices lower than the costs. In some cafeterias this is  not the situation, but in most of them food is sold at current  prices.    We have also studied other services for the population,  including something we have seen recently, something proposed by  the Communications Ministry and which has been very little  mentioned in our discussions: the postal services.    The country has for many years maintained the same rates,  rates which have been unmovable for many years, but the country  has to cover a loss of approximately 15 million every year in  order to maintain those services without counting the  expenditures in hard currency, because the international mail  also affects us.    However, following a proposal we are studying with our  comrades from the Communications Ministry, -- and this is a  reasonable proposal -- we have realized that our rates are below  the rate which is charged abroad throughout the world, and even  though we are charging a lower rate, we will probably collect  some 30 million additional pesos with a little increase in  postal rates.    I am mentioning this case becase the service is so broad and  today we could not discuss in detail all the points assessed,  but we have found this proposal very interesting.    We have also considered the possibility of charging for  those services that used to be free. It has been explained since  the previous ANPP session how these measures can have a double  objective. They can be adopted to increase income, and they can  also be of educational nature. We have made a thorough  evaluation of the range of services which are free of charge and  which could be considered in this case.    We have also discussed matters with which we could agree,  and  matters with which we could not agree, at least in our opinion,  but our intention has always been to evaluate almost everything  proposed and which can be evaluated, because there are some  matters that are impossible to evaluate.    However, we have considered some of these measures perhaps  because of their economic importance or perhaps because they are  feasible, namely those which could yield something additional.  For instance, in the educational area we have taken into  consideration those points which have been consistently  mentioned in the workers' parliaments, such as charging for  lunch served in boarding schools, at least a minimum rate, which  in this case has been set at 35 centavos. This, according to the  number of fees and the days of the week when the students eat in  the schools, could yield approximately 29 million pesos yearly.    As you see, this is not a very high figure, but this is one  of the areas in the area of education which it was believed  could yield the largest amount of pesos, and it is one of the  points we can consider.    We have also discussed the reduction of allowances granted  to  university students, although 20 percent of the population,  which is the percentage of the population with the lowest  income, would not be included in this reduction. That is, this  measure would be implemented among those people not considered  of lower income. Concerning the reduction of allowances granted  to university students, excluding the foreign grantees who would  not be affected, obviously, would yield some 17 million [pesos]  should this decision be adopted.    School supplies distributed among students have also been  the  object of discussions in the workers parliaments. For the level  of school supplies distributed at this moment we could obtain  approximately 4.7 million pesos yearly by charging very low  prices which would be accessible to the people.    Many proposals were submitted in the health area, and after  analyzing them, we thought that not all of them were in line  with the policy outlined by our revolution, concerning public  health. But there was one which circulated with some force and  some argument, concerning the free distribution of neovitamins.  And how much could be collected if the people were asked for  only the cost of that medicine? Well, this and other medicines  which could be added would yield 103 million pesos yearly.    There are other proposals which we did not consider  appropriate, such as charging something for ambulance services  or other services which, although they do have a cost, we  believe that, from our point of view, cannot be considered.    We also considered the possibility of charging fees for  cultural and sports activities. One of the proposals which have  received major support, according to the reports by the workers  parliaments, is charging for a ticket for sports events.  However, if we consider charging a reasonable entrance fee, it  would yield approximately 4.5 million pesos yearly, but there  are many who oppose this idea.    There are also measures related to culture. Charging  entrance  fees for artistic shows would yield some 4.8 million pesos, but  excluding again the lowest income people, who make up some 20  percent of the population. Thus, the reduction of subsidies,  which is currently paid to some institutions, centers, and  provincial councils for culture, could also yield some 11  million pesos.    The other element also discussed in the previous assembly,  referring to classes in preparation for sports events, was  activities that can be organized during vacation periods to  offer a recreational activity that might contemplate the  practice of some sports, thus charging a modest fee during the  school recess periods, during the school vacation periods. This  would also yield some 15 million pesos yearly.    This means that in the field of free services there is a  broad range of subjects to be discussed. We could spend hours  here talking about this matter. We have only mentioned those  which we think have greater possibilities of being approved and  which could yield some relatively large amount of resources. But  as you will see, these cannot be compared to other categories of  measures we have to evaluate.    Measures for a gradual implementation of a tax system on a  sector of the population: this is one of the most controversial  measures, as it was explained here. The workers have expressed a  clear position in the workers parliaments against the imposition  of a tax on wages. We must remember, however, comrades, that  income tax in our country not only affects the salary earners.  We also have a tax on self-employed workers. The state is  expected to collect this year 126 million pesos from this tax.  Yesterday, during a meeting with the presidents of the  provincial and administrative councils, we considered the  implementation of this measure and the system of payment, and  especially the manner of increasing the minimum tax installment.  By December only nine municipalities in the country were  implementing this measure, but today we can report that 76  municipalities in 11 provinces have already increased those  installments. In some cases, as in Holguin Province, these  installments have gone up to 1,000 pesos monthly for certain  types of employment. There are other tax installments amounting  to 600 pesos and to 200 pesos. By the closing of the March  report, Holguin was the only province that could talk about a  per capita income resulting from the increased tax installments  which are already being paid, and for this reason its income is  higher. Holguin thus has one of the highest tax rates in the  country.    This would be a type of tax which we must preserve and which  we must increase as a regulating and an income element. These  two elements must be maintained until we can get to the  progressive tax on income. We are already preparing a proposal  to be submitted to the government so that when the conditions  are appropriate, it can be implemented.    I must also inform you that other rates and tariffs are  being implemented, and not only the tax to be paid for the right  to be self-employed, but we are also charging a tax for the  right to use space and means. The marketing right is also being  taxed in 77 municipalities throughout the country, which means  that the self- employed worker carries out his activity outside  the province where he was originally registered. These taxes are  already in effect.    This means that we are beginning to implement a policy of  tax  on these workers' income. Today there are more than 153,000  self- employed workers in the country, and it is appropriate to  impose a tax policy on their income. And as you can see, this  tax is not paid only on salaries but also on income.    We have been studying the possibility of reviewing the tax  on  the income of peasants and cooperative members. We must study  and evaluate this because the CPA [Agricultural-Livestock  Cooperative] is paying 5 percent over its net income while the  peasants pay another 5 percent individually. However, we must  still consolidate these taxes in accordance with the tax that  the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] must pay. We are  still studying these taxes.    We have also considered the possibility of charging a tax on  foreign currency income. There are some people in the country  who earn an income in foreign currency, not through salaries but  through other payments. I want to explain that we are not  thinking in this case of remittances, but of those people who,  after being authorized, receive these payments for exercising  certain activities compensated in hard currency, or which  receive a bonus or an extra payment in foreign currency. This is  another option we will probably analyze.    There is another thing brought up in the assemblies, such as  the tax on properties which we have analyzed, that is, the tax  on home ownership. Today most homes are owned, and this can also  be considered in due time, concerning what kind of tax can be  charged on home ownerships, and not only on homes but also on  empty lots, and on a number of properties existing in the  country, such as real estate.    The workers' possible contribution toward social security  has also been analyzed. This possibility has been discussed  taking into account the deficit existing between the  contributions to social security and what the country spends on  social security, a deficit which amounts to some 500 million  [pesos]. We have been studying several options, different  categories, and the different times when this could be  implemented. This is one more of the measures we have in our  arsenal to be considered.    And there are other types of taxes we must not forget, such  as the tax on ground transportation, and according to results of  the analysis, this could yield approximately 10 million pesos  annually. Allow me to tell you also that this year there was  better discipline concerning the payment of the tax on ground  transporation. The people seem to have acquired some tax  knowledge to such a point that we ran out of tax forms [laughs].    There is a reaction to the payment of this tax. And we also  have the tax on documents and the seal on stamps, and these  together will yield 23 million pesos.    And we also have other types of taxes the state would like  to  implement. One of them could be the tax on aqueduct service,  better known as the water bill. As you know, the country today  has only one way of collecting these bills, and this is done  through water meters, although this service is not extended  throughout the country and we cannot think about this  possibility today. We could consider a fixed rate for aqueduct  service, and if only one peso were charged per person monthly,  it would yield some 90 million pesos yearly, and thus we would  be covering an important service which at this moment is  receiving a minimal income by way of the water meters.    Fines for personal delinquency also increased this year.  Violations of Decree 186 on special delinquency of self-employed  workers have increased in several provinces. This income could  amount to some 17 million pesos this year. Last year the fines  dropped by a little more than 4 percent. During the first  quarter ending this month fines increased a little more than 9  percent. This means that there is still much to be done in this  area, but we are working on it.    We have also considered the possbility of changing our  money.  We must put this measure within the arsenal of possibilities. As  Comrade Ross said, there are many ways of doing it, there are  many variables, and I can tell you that the variables that prove  to be suitable might be implemented. This is not a problem we  cannot solve, but we do have the obligation to take up this  measure as a possibility.    So, comrades, we have tried to analyze all these problems  with the sole objective of providing to our government and to  you in this parliament, some facts which, once the causes of  these problems and the possible solutions are known, will help  us work toward the achievement of those solutions. But we do  have to adopt the measures that will definitely guarantee an  effective solution to the excess currency in the country. To  achieve this we must understand that we must willing to do  anything possible because this is the essential obstacle we are  internally facing today in making our economy successful.    These measures would not be complete if we did not also  demand, considering the sacrifice our workers are making, the  repression of those who have accrued wealth illegally either  through theft or speculation, taking unscrupulous advantage of  the scarcity our people face to achieve their personal wealth.  These deeds cannot and must not remain unpunished.    The process which will be implemented through the agreements  adopted by this National Assembly will play a role which will be  decisive in itself in accordance with the order and discipline  which we might impose, without hastiness but with a sense of  responsibility we must all share. The measures to be adopted by  the government to implement these measures will also be  decisive, keeping in mind that this will be a gradual process  that will demand indispensable adjustments or changes to the  extent that we keep advancing.    Starting from these discussions, we are certain that the  vital interests of the people will be respected. We feel  optimistic therefore, and in good spirits. We know that if we  have resisted thus far, we will will not lack strength and  intelligence to keep taking steps forward.    We believe that our people will have the great privilege to  celebrate this 1 May as protagonists aware of their own  solutions to the serious problems we are facing, certain of the  victory with Fidel as leader as it has always been and as it  will always be, because all Cubans will fight with him for this  goal. Thank you very much. [applause]</p>

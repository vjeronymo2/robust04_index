Western Ave., Hollywood; 7 p.m, Warner Grand  Theatre, 478 W. 6th St., San Pedro  </P> <P> Tracey Moffat's piercing vignette of an aboriginal woman coping in a desert  cul-de-sac with the nerve-fraying illness of her mother. A mood piece in which  the Outback is recreated mostly on the soundstage -- in shockingly vivid  primary colors and images that suggest a Douanier Rousseau painting.  Cobalt-blue skies, painted backdrops, a purringly ingratiating gospel singer,  flashbacks to the ocean and a present full of sweat and misery -- Moffat weaves  it all together with erratic but sometimes genuine power.

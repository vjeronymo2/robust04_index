			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'STREETCAR' STALLS; 'HOME' A SATISFYING, EMOTIONAL TRIP;  </P> <P> CASTING PROBLEM ASIDE, TENNESSEE WILLIAMS' MONUMENTAL PLAY ABOUT EROTIC TENSION  IS BESET BY TECHNICAL PROBLEMS, LACKLUSTER PORTRAYALS.  </P> <P> The question of alternative casting in Eastern Boys Productions' contemporary  staging of "A Streetcar Named Desire" was almost irrelevant at Friday's opening  night -- various problems were more pressing.  </P> <P> But let's address that issue at the start. Director Walter Brown's decision  (with input from assistant director Steve Scholl) to have a black Stanley  Kowalski (R.A. Blankenship Jr.) did not necessarily add to Tennessee Williams'  estimable drama, but neither did it dilute the play's integrity.  </P> <P> It was an uncomfortable choice at times -- especially with all the references  to Kowalski's Polish origins, without a word about this Stanley's obvious  African heritage -- but Williams' themes of class struggle and erotic tension  and vulnerability still peeked through.  </P> <P> However, casting a black actor (Mellow Martin) as Mitch, Stanley's friend and  Blanche's suitor, was wrong. Considering Blanche's vast affectations built on a  foundation of old-time Southern propriety, it was too large a stretch.  </P> <P> Her vehement speech to sister Stella, when she describes Stanley as "an ape,"  reinforced a notion of her barely concealed bigotry. Of course, this was not  Williams' intention -- the lines are meant to show a disdain for Stanley's  barbarity and her repressed attraction to it, not his color -- but in Brown's  concept, it reads like a bald, racial slur. In this framework, would Blanche's  biases allow her to feel closeness to Mitch?  </P> <P> The troubles were more basic than the casting. Technical problems, stalled  pacing and unresounding portrayals all worked to neuter the power of this  "Streetcar."  </P> <P> In the production's defense, the actors did have to endure the Santa Ana City  Hall Police Annex Auditorium's lousy acoustics. Dialogue was routinely  swallowed, and the cast didn't do much to overcome the predicament.  </P> <P> Of all the performers, only Deirdre West as Blanche approached the pathos of  "Streetcar." West was often self-conscious, but at least she tried to locate  the human conflicts and contradictions that can make Blanche and her story so  compelling.  </P> <P> 'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE'  </P> <P> An Eastern Boys Productions staging of Tennessee Williams' drama.

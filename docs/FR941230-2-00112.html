			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange's proposal also increases the current fine levels for such violations. Thus, the lowest fine on the schedule is raised from $50 to $100, while the highest fine remains $2,500. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  For most of the fine increases, the Exchange is increasing the fine levels from $100, $250, and $500, for first-, second-, and third-time violations, <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  respectively, to $250, $500, and $750, respectively, for such violations. In addition, the Exchange is proposing to increase the minimum fine for position and exercise limit violations as follows: for between one and three violations (during a running two-year period), the minimum fine would be increased from $100 to $250; <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  for between four and six violations during such a period, the minimum fine would be increased from $100 to $500; and for seven or more violations during such a period, the minimum fine would be increased from $100 to $750. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the MRP, the Exchange may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000 on any member, member organization, or person associated with a member or member organization.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  PSE Rule 10.13(a).

In addition, the Exchange may, at its discretion, proceed with formal disciplinary action if it determines that a given violation is not minor in nature.

Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public. In addition, the Commission finds that the Exchange's proposal is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(6) of the Act that the rules of an exchange provide that its members are appropriately disciplined for violations of the Act, its rules and the rules of the exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the Exchange's ability to effectively enforce compliance with Commission and Exchange rules by its members and member organizations is central to its self-regulatory functions. The inclusion of a rule in the Exchange's MRP should not be interpreted to mean that it is not an important rule. On the contrary, the Commission recognizes that the inclusion of minor violations of particular rules under a minor rule violation plan may make the Exchange's disciplinary system more efficient in prosecuting more egregious and repeated violations of these rules, thereby furthering its mandates to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed additions to the MRP are either objective or technical in nature and are easily verifiable, thereby lending themselves to the use of expedited proceedings. The fine level increases will enhance the Exchange's ability to enforce compliance with its rules through the appropriate discipline of members and member organizations in a manner that is proportionate to the minor nature of such violations. The Exchange has represented that its membership will be informed of the amended Recommended Fine Schedule via a regulatory bulletin. In addition, the Recommended Fine Schedule will be recirculated periodically (approximately yearly) pursuant to PSE Rule 10.13(f). <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Telephone conversation between Michael D.

			<p>BFN     [Text] As Interfax reported earlier, on Tuesday evening  President Yeltsin sent copies of the draft agreement on civic  peace to the potential signatories.    The only difference between that draft and the one prepared  earlier was the absence of the provision on measures to increase  wages in accordance with inflation and to ensure their timely  payment, to check the rise in prices on staple food stuffs, to  create jobs and to help the regions where the danger of  unemployment is the greatest.    Head of the president's experts Aleksandr Livshyts told  Interfax on Wednesday that such an amendment had been motivated  by the need to scrupulously work out this provision. He said  that the amendment did not mean Yeltsin denied the importance of  those measures. He said, however, that the initial variant  sounded rather abstract because it did not say who was  responsible for implementing them. Livshyts believes that this  drawback will be done away with in the final draft.</p>

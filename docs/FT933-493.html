			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Hillary steps up campaign on healthcare THERE WAS no apple pie but a whole lot of motherhood yesterday as Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton took the administration's campaign for healthcare reform to the committee rooms of Congress, writes George Graham in Washington. Speaking 'as a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, a woman,' Mrs Clinton urged members of Congress to 'craft the most important social policy that our nation will have confronted in many decades.' But members of the House Ways and Means committee, the scene of yesterday's hearings, have mothers too, and they wanted more reassurance. 'My reference is my mom, and she's concerned that you want to cut two hundred billion bucks out of Medicare,' said Mr Pete Stark, a California Democrat who is a staunch defender of the government-run Medicare programme which finances healthcare for the elderly. Mrs Clinton was not to be outmothered, however. 'I have a mother too, Mr Stark, so if we can't pass the mother test we are not going to be able to succeed, are we?' she retorted. The administration is expected to take another two to three weeks to produce detailed legislative plans for the reforms outlined by President Bill Clinton in a speech to both houses of Congress last week, so Mrs Clinton stuck to generalities in her opening statement yesterday. But in answering questions from members she had to tackle a clear current of concern, even among Democrats, about the effects of the administration's proposals on small businesses. Mrs Clinton firmly defended the administration's proposal to require all employers to provide health insurance to their workers and pay for most of the premium, a proposal that has provoked apocalyptic warnings of massive firings in small businesses in the US. 'It doesn't strike us as fair that those businesses that have made the commitment to healthcare should not only bear the burden for their own employees but literally the burden of the employees of others who have not made the same choice,' she said. This proposal is expected to be one of the most controversial in the debate on healthcare legislation.</p>

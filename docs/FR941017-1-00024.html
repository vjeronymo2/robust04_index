			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Where unfavorable physical characteristics of the site exist, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed site may nevertheless be found to be acceptable if the design of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility includes appropriate and adequate compensating engineering safeguards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;100.11  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Determination of exclusion area, low population zone, and population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> center distance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) As an aid in evaluating a proposed site, an applicant should assume a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fission product release <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  from the core, the expected demonstrable leak rate from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the containment and the meteorological conditions pertinent to his site to derive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an exclusion area, a low population zone and population center distance. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of this analysis, which shall set forth the basis for the numerical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values used, the applicant should determine the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The fission product release assumed for these calculations should be based upon a major accident, hypothesized for purposes of site analysis or postulated from considerations of possible accidential events, that would result in potential hazards not exceeded by those from any accident considered credible. Such accidents have generally been assumed to result in substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release of appreciable quantities of fission products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) An exclusion area of such size that an individual located at any point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on its boundary for two hours immediately following onset of the postulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fission product release would not receive a total radiation dose to the whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> body in excess of 25 rem <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  or a total radiation dose in excess of 300 rem to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thyroid from iodine exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The whole body dose of 25 rem referred to above corresponds numerically to the once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose for radiation workers which, according to NCRP recommendations may be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure status (see NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, neither its use nor that of the 300 rem value for thyroid exposure as set forth in these site criteria guides are intended to imply that these numbers constitute acceptable limits for emergency doses to the public under accident conditions. Rather, this 25 rem whole body value and the 300 rem thyroid value have been set forth in these guides as reference values, which can be used in the evaluation of reactor sites with respect to potential reactor accidents of exceedingly low probability of occurrence, and low risk of public exposure to radiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) A low population zone of such size that an individual located at any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point on its outer boundary who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passage) would not receive a total radiation dose to the whole body in excess of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25 rem or a total radiation dose in excess of 300 rem to the thyroid from iodine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A population center distance of at least one and one''third times the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distance from the reactor to the outer boundary of the low population zone. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying this guide, the boundary of the population center shall be determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon consideration of population distribution. Political boundaries are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling in the application of this guide. Where very large cities are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved, a greater distance may be necessary because of total integrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population dose consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For sites for multiple reactor facilities consideration should be given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If the reactors are independent to the extent that an accident in one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor would not initiate an accident in another, the size of the exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, low population zone and population center distance shall be fulfilled with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to each reactor individually. The envelopes of the plan overlay of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas so calculated shall then be taken as their respective boundaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the reactors are interconnected to the extent that an accident in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one reactor could affect the safety of operation of any other, the size of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion area, low population zone and population center distance shall be based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon the assumption that all interconnected reactors emit their postulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fission product releases simultaneously. This requirement may be reduced in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relation to the degree of coupling between reactors, the probability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concomitant accidents and the probability that an individual would not be exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the radiation effects from simultaneous releases. The applicant would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to justify to the satisfaction of the Commission the basis for such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in the source term.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The applicant is expected to show that the simultaneous operation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple reactors at a site will not result in total radioactive effluent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  releases beyond the allowable limits of applicable regulations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  For further guidance in developing the exclusion area, the low population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zone, and the population center distance, reference is made to Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information Document 14844, dated March 23, 1962, which contains a procedural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method and a sample calculation that result in distances roughly reflecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current siting practices of the Commission.

KOTRA quoted statistics from the Japanese Ministry of  International Trade and Industry as indicating that Korea  suffered a trade shortfall of $420 million with Japan last  month, up 46.3 percent from a year before. The country's exports  to Tokyo in January increased 14.3 percent from the  corresponding period of last year to $970 million, while its  imports from it grew 22.4 percent to $1.39 billion.    "The increase in the trade shortfall with the neighboring  country will continue for the time being because Korea has to  buy more parts from Japan at more expensive prices as a result  of the strong yen," a KOTRA official said. He said Korea will  find it difficult to correct the chronic trade deficit with  Japan as it still heavily relies on Japanese imports of capital  goods to make more products and increase exports. Shipments of  light industrial goods and electronic products face an uphill  battle in maintaining their market shares in Japan now that  those products made by China and Thailand, Japan's major  overseas production bases, are expected to take bigger shares.  China posted a $596 million surplus with Japan in the first  month of this year, down from $753 million a year ago, KOTRA  said citing Japanese estimates.    Japan's whole exports stood at $25.9 billion in January, up  7.5 percent from the same period of last year and its imports  rose 4.8 percent to $19.8 billion. Its trade surplus increased  17 percent to $6.1 billion. As advanced countries, mainly the  U.S., mounted trade pressure on Japan to correct its huge trade  surplus, Japan's exports to industrialized countries declined by  21 percent last month, while those to developing countries grew  by 27.4 percent. Japan saw an increase in exports of such  manufactured goods as electronics parts (39.2 percent), metal  products (54.3 percent) and auto parts (15.1 percent). However,  Japan reduced shipments of vehicles by 16.6 percent, audio  equipment 7.5 percent and automatic data processors 11.1  percent. Japan's imports of crude oil and petrochemical products  declined by 21.9 percent and 18.3 percent, respectively, while  those of semiconductors rose by 50.5 percent, autos 42.9 percent  and machinery 27.8 percent.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Food and Drink: A taste of two cities - Giles MacDonogh goes in search of the classic cafe in Vienna and Berlin You will still find the classic cafe of the German-speaking world in Vienna. It survived world and cold wars as an extended living room where you waste time; keep out of the cold; talk; read newspapers and drinks all sorts of different sorts of coffee. Some drink beer or schnapps. Wine you approach with caution. It is best adulterated with fizzy water as a gespritzter. Without the water the wine can be pretty poisonous. You occasionally see people eating in a cafe. It is nothing special: a Schnitzel (vom Schwein), a potato salad and a sticky cake to follow. If you want good wine or refined food, you go to a restaurant. Some of Vienna's cafes have preserved that out-at-the-elbow feel about them. For many, the best is Hawelka in the Dorotheengasse, with its rickety chairs and crumbly waiters. The Eiles in the Josefstadt is refreshingly dowdy. The seediest is the Alt-Wien, which houses a peculiar collection of gnarled old chunks of humanity until the early hours of the morning. The cafes which have been dolled up have lost their charm. This happened to the Landtmann opposite the Parliament. The Schwarzenberg on the Schwarzenberg Platz now looks like a 1960s milk bar, even if there are good cakes and excellent Gluhwein in winter. In the Imperial Hotel is the chichi Cafe Imperial where people break the rules by eating delicate dishes of un-cafe like food. In Berlin, the Third Reich drove out cafe life - along with the artists and intellectuals. Their haunt used to be the Romanische Cafe by the Kaiser Wilhelm-Gedachtniskirche. The church's ruin is a poignant symbol of post-war Berlin with its uncomfortable blend of pompous old and badly dated modern. Alas, the old 'Romanischen' was destroyed in the war. Its site is occupied by the beastly Europe Centre. Bombs also smote the old Cafe des Westens where George Grosz went to shock the bourgeoisie. The name alone is preserved on a building which looks like a lot of suitcases laid on their sides. I have never had the courage to climb the stairs. Long before the Nazis ruined Berlin the Cafe des Westens had transmogrified into the Cafe Kranzler in the Kurfurstendamm. Kranzler was rebuilt in the 1950s. It is not nice: the coffee is vile; the waitresses grumpy and the place is filled with bewildered provincials. Also on the Kurfurstendamm are two branches of Cafe Mohring in surviving Wilhelmine buildings. The cakes are said to be good, but I have never had any luck with the coffee; and neither Mohring has a gram of atmosphere. Game, set and match to Vienna. On the other hand a new style of cafe-life has sprung up in Berlin. Arty cafes have become the alternative to the rough-and-tumble Kneipe, where people go to get drunk. I was alerted to the Cafe Hegel in the Savigny Platz by Berlin's best daily, Der Tagespiegel. A home-sick Austrian said the only thing he would miss in Berlin was the Cafe Hegel. This I had to see. It certainly had the tattiness of a Viennese cafe; a proper Stammlokal which looked after its regulars. Signs and posters in Russian pointed to the possibility of Russian artists forming a part of its clientele, but there were none there that night. A solitary man came and sat at the bar; issued impossible instructions to the waitress on how to pour a wheat beer; noisily rearranged the furniture; then proceeded to carry on a vigorous conversation with himself. I left in despair. Intentionally much more like Vienna is the Cafe Einstein in the Kurfurstenstrasse. It is in one of the Tiergarten's few surviving villas. Unlike its Viennese counterpart, however, customers drink decent wine and eat refined, new wave, Austrian food. Like many Berlin cafes, Einstein functions chiefly as a restaurant. Similar in style is the Cafe im Literaturhaus in the Fasanenstrasse. Which serves good wines and decent food. A special feature is the readings which take place in an old, panelled room on Monday nights. I went to one on Greek love given by a man who was clearly partisan. He spoke for an hour and a half about Spartan gymnopaedes, Zeus and Ganymede and Socrates and Alcibiades. He illustrated the talk with lurid pictures, occasionally taking a big slurp from a heroic bumper of wine. I gave up trying to find a cafe with Viennese style. I went instead to the most historic wine house in Berlin: Lutter und Wegner in the Schluterstrasse. It used to be in the east, but after the war it moved to smart Charlottenburg and this small room with its dark wainscotting and nicotine yellow paint work. It is a restaurant now. In the early 19th century it was a tavern; the Stammlokal of ETA Hoffmann (of the Tales) and his friend, the actor Ludwig Devrient. Here they swallowed oceans of champagne. Lutter once tried to present Hoffmann with a bill. He and Devrient were incensed and stormed off to Schonert in the nearby Mohrenstrasse. Lutter realised his mistake: Hoffmann and Devrient had created his fame. He rushed round to Schonert and tore up the bill before their eyes. When Hoffmann died (to some extent from drink) in 1822, Lutter wiped the slate clean a second time. Devrient died 10 years later, his gaze fixed on a portrait of his dead friend. This Lutter und Wegner serves good, modern food: a 'carpaccio of courgettes' with plenty of parmesan came with a bloody piece of lamb fillet (it was better than it sounds); but the duck on a roquefort sauce was salty (they had bought the wrong roquefort). Here I had to drink a glass of champagne for Hoffmann and Devrient: probably the first men to bring style to the old Prussian capital.</p>

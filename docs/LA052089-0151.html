			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'JERUSALEM'S' PLEA FOR END TO STRIFE;  </P> <P> SWADOS' ORATORIO DRAWS ON ARAB, JEWISH, CHRISTIAN, ARMENIAN MUSIC  </P> <P> Elizabeth Swados' oratorio "Jerusalem" makes a plea for peace in the  strife-torn Holy Land by drawing on Jewish, Arab, Christian and Armenian  musical traditions.  </P> <P> "It's meant to be a way of capturing the city through sound," Swados said in a  recent phone interview from New York.  </P> <P> "Not just the dialects or the moods, but the passions that are so strong that  the people could build magnificent places of worship and also kill each other.  And I was always curious, what kind of passion is that?"  </P> <P> Swados, 38, has composed opera (including rock and pop operas), musicals,  political revues and film scores. She said that "Jerusalem" incorporates the  poems of Yehuda Amichai and echoes of the biblical book of Jeremiah.  </P> <P> Alan Weiner, cantor at Temple Bat Yahm in Newport Beach, will conduct the work  Sunday at Loyola Marymount University in Orange and Tuesday at the University  of Judaism in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "A tourist comes to the land to warn the people or to learn from the people  about the conflict," she explained, "and no one listens to this prophet and the  city burns."  </P> <P> A timely subject?  </P> <P> "It's meant to be."  </P> <P> But she does offer some hope.  </P> <P> "The city burns, but the last thing is a prayer, which really implies that the  next generation will make it better.  </P> <P> "And the piece itself is hopeful because of the work I had to do to get those  people (the original multicultural cast) to sing together, to become friends  who have done it many times together. . . .  </P> <P> "You see those people on stage working together -- that itself is a statement  of hope -- whereas in the beginning they would never even sit next to each  other."  </P> <P> Swados said the work got a "very mixed" reception when it was presented in  Jerusalem in 1987.  </P> <P> "They interpreted it only politically, and, whereas my work is very popular  there, some people felt I was trying to preach to them about not fighting  within their country or something," she said. "So I got slapped around a little  bit for that.  </P> <P> "Israelis really hate it when Americans do Israel-type shows, and in a way you  can understand it," she added. "I don't know how I would feel if I saw a bunch  of Israelis coming over here and doing some type of show about American girls  from Buffalo. I don't know how I would feel."  </P> <P> Despite the controversy, Swados calls writing the work "one of the most  positive things I ever did."  </P> <P> "I'm not grandiose. I don't think that my work has the power to effect social  change or alter people's opinions. But I do think that you can create new forms  that move the heart and wake people up to their emotions, and that is a very  heady thing to do."  </P> <P> "Jerusalem," which had its premiere in 1983 at La Mama Annex in New York, grew  out of a 6-month workshop underwritten by the Ford Foundation, according to  Swados.  </P> <P> At first, she did not see "Jerusalem" as a work of art.  </P> <P> "First and foremost, I saw it as an experiment, a musical exchange that might  evolve into a piece of work.  </P> <P> "All along the way, I was very conscious of any problems or toes I might have  stepped on once I began to put the thing together. And everyone was very vocal  about what would be right or wrong considering his or her religion.  </P> <P> "I respected everything that everyone said. I did it even if they were going  too far with me, picking on me. There was so much to draw from -- they had  given me so much I could write from -- it didn't matter. . . . I think that  made the piece special because no one is uncomfortable when they sing it."  </P> <P> She said that she did not attempt to "balance" the differing viewpoints by  allocating equal time to each.  </P> <P> "That's where music is very helpful," she said. "I don't think the intellect  comes in there. You know, 5 minutes for the Jews, 5 minutes for the Christians.  The piece balances itself musically. And there is a lot (of) stuff that is not  anything, like sounds of a marketplace. . . .  </P> <P> "The music dictated its own distribution of time, and if something was too  much, it didn't matter what (religious) quarter it was in, it was too long."  </P> <P> Swados said that she provides no translations of the 13 languages incorporated  in the work. "I just let the sound tell you" the meaning, she said.  </P> <P> "I've always found that the most important ingredient in making my music work,  besides technical expertise and energy, is intention. . . . What would hurt  ("Jerusalem") would be somebody presented to be holy or a muezzin or an  Orthodox priest who is (just) an actor. That would really be blasphemous and  wrong."  </P> <P>  Cantor Alan Weiner will conduct Elizabeth Swados' oratorio "Jerusalem" Sunday  at 7:30 p.m. at Loyola Marymount University, 488 S. Batavia St., Orange.  Tickets: $15 and $25. Information (714) 552-7654. The program will be repeated  Tuesday at 8 p.m. at Gindi Auditorium, University of Judaism, 15600 Mulholland  Drive, Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE OFF, RUNNING AT HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> HORSE RACING: THE CROWD IS SMALL, BUT BIGGER THAN IT WAS AT LAST YEAR'S OPENER.  PROFIT KEY WINS DEBONAIR STAKES.  </P> <P> Initiating its 52nd season, Hollywood Park attracted 18,250 fans Wednesday.  </P> <P> No matter that 50 opening-day crowds have been larger. At a track where  business has declined steadily for more than a few years, Wednesday's figure  signified some progress.  </P> <P> The 16,675 who showed up last year was the smallest opening-day attendance.  Perhaps Wednesday's gain was a result of a promotional glass giveaway because  the handle was down slightly from 1989. The total was $4,091,641 compared to  $4,104,495 the previous April.  </P> <P> Factoring in the 10 intertrack locations, the total attendance of 26,310 was up  more than 15% from last year and the handle increased 3.4%.  </P> <P> Those who came to Inglewood or watched the races at one of the satellites  probably felt as if they were still at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> Gary Stevens, the runaway leader among the jockeys at Arcadia, and Wayne Lukas,  the top trainer, combined to win the $81,100 Debonair Stakes with Profit Key.  </P> <P> Earlier, there were a rash of upsets and form reversals, topped by Lucky  Street's $128.40 surprise, which keyed a $1,233 exacta and a $7,897.50 triple.  Five of the nine winners paid double digits and nobody was able to isolate even  five winners in the Pick Six.  </P> <P> Another talented 3-year-old, Profit Key made it three consecutive victories  with a come-from-behind victory over Doyouseewhatisee and four others in the  seven-furlong Debonair.  </P> <P> Second in a pair of starts last summer at Del Mar, the son of Desert Wine  hasn't made any mistakes since returning to the races March 25, but he  displayed an extra dimension Wednesday.  </P> <P> Never far off the lead and well-placed outside in his two victories at Santa  Anita, Profit Key was outrun early and down inside in the Debonair. Seemingly  in trouble after a half-mile, he accelerated when room developed and won by  three-quarters of a length in a stakes-record 1:21 2/5.  </P> <P> "I was getting a little concerned, but, as it turned out, it was a  ground-saving ride," trainer Jeff Lukas said. "When he was behind horses there,  it was a little bit unclear if he was going to have room. When it did open up,  he responded real well.  </P> <P> "Until this time, he had looked good and looked like he had a lot of potential.  Today, he established himself by stepping into the stakes ranks, beating stakes  winners and setting a stakes record. He's a proven horse now.  </P> <P> "For right now, we'll just stay with a short program with him. Chances are  he'll stay right here."  </P> <P> A half-brother to highly regarded sprinter Vinnie The Viper, Profit Key, the  8-5 second choice, acts as if he will be able to handle extra distance.  </P> <P> "I think this was a pretty good indication that he can probably get a middle  distance," Stevens said. "He was kind of a push-button horse to ride today. He  was really easy to get along with.  </P> <P> "He's got a ton of pure ability. I was on him after I rode him for the first  time at Del Mar. He's still got a lot of room for improvement. He's still  studdish and he was really acting up with the pony going to the gate.  </P> <P> "I was really impressed with the way he finished the last eighth of a mile.  Once he got head and head with those two horses, he was just gone."  </P> <P> Doyouseewhatisee, the 9-2 third choice, was 3 1/2 lengths better than Jacodra,  the 7-5 favorite. Troubled when he finished second to Profit Key April 8 in his  first race since June, Jacodra battled with 13-1 shot Master Lypheor through  :22, :44 2/5 and 1:09 splits before faltering.  </P> <P> It was Doyouseewhatisee's first appearance since he ran third in the Hoist The  Flag Nov. 25. "He was running easy and I could have won it, but the other horse  was able to get through," Martin Pedroza said.  </P> <P> Mister Flyer, a 2-year-old half-brother to Mister Frisky, was purchased  Wednesday by Clover Racing Stable. A son of Fire Dancer, Mister Flyer brought  $245,000 as a 2-year-old in a training sale in Ocala, Fla. The colt will come  to California and will be trained by Neil Drysdale.  </P> <P> Pat Valenzuela was ill and took off his mounts Wednesday. The rider, who has  had a history of substance abuse and was suspended last fall after testing  positive for cocaine, drove to Hollywood Park and voluntarily submitted a urine  sample to the stewards. Valenzuela hopes to ride today.  </P> <P> Attempting a comeback, Kenny Black, Corey Black's older brother, will ride two  horses Friday: maiden Current Climate in the second and Showerstime in the  fifth.  </P> <P> Black tested positive for cocaine in 1984 and hasn't ridden locally since.  </P> <P> Licensed as an exercise rider, he had a hearing in front of an officer of the  California Horse Racing Board last month and was again granted a jockey's  license.  </P> <P> "He's been through the process and he had to present a lot of positive things,"  steward Pete Pedersen said. "He's been involved with the Winners Foundation and  he had to present a lot of evidence from horsemen and other responsible  people."  </P> <P> For a time late last year, Black, who has also had problems with his weight,  served as his brother's agent.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Martin Pedroza and trainer Sandy Shulman combined for a double with Suit Up in  the third and Watch 'N Win in the seventh. . . . David Flores also had two  winners: Lucky Street, who had finished last in his other two starts this year,  and Sparshott, who took the first at $19. . . . Sunday Silence, who is likely  to make his 1990 debut in the Californian June 3, is scheduled to work five  furlongs this morning. . . . Steinlen, who won the El Rincon Handicap in his  last start, worked five furlongs in 1:01 2/5 this morning in preparation for a  likely appearance in Sunday's Shoemaker Handicap at a mile on the turf.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Slovak correspondent of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY: </F> "Statisticians Are Balancing the First Quarter--According to the  Slovak Republic Statistical Office, a Trend Indicating a  Slowdown in Price Increases Has Been Evident Since the Beginning  of the Year"]    [Text] Bratislava--During the first three months of this  year, Slovakia achieved a positive balance of trade amounting to  2.2 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] in its business transactions  with the Czech Republic, according to Stefan Condik, chairman of  the Slovak Republic Statistical Office, at yesterday's press  conference in Bratislava. During the period under consideration,  imports from the Czech Republic were valued at Sk14.3 billion,  which represents 30.2 percent of total imports to Slovakia; on  the other hand, Slovak Republic exports to the Czech Republic  were valued at Sk16.5 billion, which corresponds to 37.9 percent  of total Slovak exports. However, these data do not include  reexports. Statistics kept by country of commercial transaction  indicate that the balance of trade between Slovakia and the  Czech Republic was on the negative side to the extent of Sk3.6  billion.    Stefan Condik noted that, in the first quarter of 1994, a  trend showing a slowdown of price increases was manifested in  Slovakia. According to data provided by the Slovak Statistical  Office, inflation grew by a total of 2.6 percent in comparison  with December of last year in the first quarter of 1994 and was,  to a certain extent, influenced by wage developments. Compared  to February, wages in industry increased by 16.3 percent to  Sk6,291; wages in the construction industry rose by 15.7 percent  to Sk5,919; salaries in trade increased by 10 percent to  Sk4,714; and wages in transportation rose 6.7 percent to  Sk6,119. Average monthly wages for the entire national economy  in the first quarter amounted to Sk5,400, which is 14-15 percent  (Sk700) more than was the case in the same period of last year.    In March, Slovakia had 370,500 unemployed, which is about  14.7 percent of the labor force. Compared with February with an  unemployment rate of 14.8 percent, the number of unemployed  declined by 5,500 persons.    In March, the effects of introducing the import surcharge  were felt, and the negative balance of trade increased by only  Sk35 million. Overall, the balance of trade for the quarter  ended up with a deficit of Sk3.7 billion. During the first three  months of the year, Slovakia imported goods valued at Sk47.2  billion, which is 1 percentage point more than was the case for  the same period of 1993. Exports amounted to Sk43.5 billion,  which represents a 2.6-percent decline when compared to last  year.    The value of foreign capital in the Slovak economy by the  end  of March was Sk11.5 billion. In comparison with the last quarter  of 1993, this represents an increase of 6.7 percent. The main  share in investments in the Slovak economy is still held by  Austria (23.4 percent) and Germany (21 percent). During the  latest period, the Czech Republic, whose investment share rose  to 13 percent, outstripped the United States with a 12.1-percent  share. Foreign capital is now part of 5,719 corporations. Since  the beginning of the year, the Slovak Republic has seen the  failure of 35 firms with foreign property participation, and an  additional 80 firms are in liquidation.</p>

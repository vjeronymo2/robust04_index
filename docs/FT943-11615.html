			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Technology: Matchmaking trap for woodworms - Worth Watching Buying a house can be a risky business and many purchasers err on the side of caution and spray for woodworm whether or not an infestation exists, writes Daniel Green. But from next year, it should be easier to discover if there is a true problem. A UK company, Oxford Asymmetry, has developed a way to mass-produce woodworm pheromones, the sex hormone that brings male and female woodworms together. Scientists at Oxford University divided the structure of the hormone and Oxford Asymmetry built a synthetic chemical 'scaffold' around which identical molecules would form in its laboratories. The company has now signed an agreement with Cardiff-based Agrisense which will market a woodworm trap: the idea is that new homeowners first test for the presence of woodworm before committing themselves to the dirt and expense of pest control. Oxford Asymmetry, 57 Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxfordshire OX14 4RX. 0235 861561.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yang Qi] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said today he will reaffirm a future-oriented  Japan-China relationship when he meets with Chinese leaders in  Beijing this weekend.    Before flying to Beijing on Saturday [19 March] for his  first-ever three-day official visit to China, he told a group of  Chinese journalists here that "Japan's relations with China have  entered a new stage." Tokyo and Beijing should double their  efforts to develop "the already mature relationship" into a  future-oriented one that will benefit the international  community, said the prime minister who assumed office last  August.    "I hope that the two sides will hold very meaningful talks  and exchange views frankly with each other," the prime minister  said.    Hosokawa is scheduled to meet President Jiang Zemin and  Premier Li Peng in Beijing to discuss bilateral and  international issues. The trip will also take him to shanghai,  China's largest city.    Trade between the two countries totalled 39 billion U.S.  dollars last year, a 33-fold increase over 1972, the year China  and Japan normalized relations.    Japan became China's largest trading partner last year,  while  China emerged as Japan's second biggest after the United States.    The prime minister expects trade between the two countries  to  reach 70 billion dollars by the end of 2000, and 190 billion  dollars by the end of 2010 if it maintains an average annual  growth of 10 percent.    He said that Japan's investment in China amounted to 5.17  billion dollars by the end of last September, one third of which  was invested in fiscal 1992.    The prime minister told the Chinese journalists, who are  here  on a week-long visit at the invitation of Japan's Foreign  Ministry, that Japan will "pay much attention" to development in  Shanghai's Pudong Development Zone, China's industrial hub,  which he will visit Monday. He also said that his country will  provide more aid to China's northeastern provinces.    On security in the Asia-Pacific region, Hosokawa voiced his  concern over "unstable elements," an apparent reference to the  alleged nuclear development program on the Korean peninsula.    He hoped that Tokyo and Beijing will work hard to seek  solutions to this problem through bilateral and multilateral  cooperation.    Expressing concern over the prolonged conflicts in the  former  Yugoslavia, Somalia and other troubled areas, the prime minister  said that Japan will offer economic support to help resolve  these problems.    The prime minister said his government will work under  Japan's war-renouncing Constitution to "make greater  contributions" to world peace.</p>

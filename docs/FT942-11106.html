			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Mitterrand rules out nuclear tests President Mitterrand forecast yesterday that France would never again set off test explosions of nuclear weapons, unless another major atomic power broke the test moratorium which the French leader set in train two years ago. Mr Mitterrand reaffirmed that he would not allow nuclear tests during his remaining year in the Elysee, and predicted that his successors would not dare resume testing for fear of 'offending the whole world by relaunching the nuclear arms race'. Delivering a 90-minute discourse on his nuclear policy to France's military establishment, Mr Mitterrand's statement was as much a challenge as prediction to Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister who sat poker-faced in front of him. Like most in the conservative government, Mr Leotard is committed to at least re-examining the nuclear test issue once the socialist president leaves office next May. Indeed the president challenged the French military establishment to have the 'talent and imagination' to keep France's atomic arsenal up to date by simulating tests in laboratories rather than by setting off more explosions in or under its Mururoa atoll in the south Pacific. The FFr10bn set aside for nuclear test simulation in the defence spending programme for 1995-2000 gave it sufficient resources, Mr Mitterrand claimed. Most French conservative defence experts believe that France still needs a few more live tests, if only to calibrate laser, radiographic, and computer techniques used in laboratory simulation. But the president claimed France need not fear 'any nasty surprise' by renouncing testing, and so setting an example to other near-nuclear countries in the renegotation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty next year. The US was the only nuclear power which could make gains relative to France, because Washington had been working on simulating tests since the early 1960s, and Franco-American relations were sufficiently good that France had nothing to fear from that quarter. However, Mr Mitterrand yesterday showed himself a traditional gaullist in every other aspect of nuclear power. A French president could not share the decision to use nuclear weapons 'with any foreign authority', he said, and that was why France had been right to leave Nato's integrated command in 1966 and to stay out. Eventually, Europe might be sufficiently united politically for France to consider its vital national interests synonymous with those of its European Union partners. But the pro-European president implied that day was still distant.</p>

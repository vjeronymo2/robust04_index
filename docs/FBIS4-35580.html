			<p>BFN     [Text] In a few months Israel will send a medical team to  Angola which will operate within the framework of the UN  peacekeeping forces. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz  reports that a plan was worked out today in a meeting at the  deputy foreign minister's office which aims to incorporate  Israel into various UN activities. The Israeli team will  establish a field hospital in Angola manned by about 80 nurses  and physicians, all of them from Israel.</p>

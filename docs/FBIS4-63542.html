			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 21 TASS -- A new Russian negotiator to  the talks with the Chechen Republic will be appointed in the  near future, Russian Presidential Administration Chief of Staff  Sergey Filatov said on Saturday.    Filatov made it clear that the removal of Vice-Prime  Minister  Sergey Shakhray from the post of nationalities minister is  connected with the need to find ways to enhance relations  between Russia and the Chechen Republic.    Shakhray had a firm position at the talks, insisting on  early  elections in the Chechen Republic and participation of the  Chechen opposition in the talks as a pre-condition.    Filatov confirmed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  intention  to meet with Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev in the near  future.</p>

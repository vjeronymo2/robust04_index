			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Hurd warns of dangers in a lurch to the right A powerful warning against a lurch to the right by the Conservative party in domestic policy and a retreat into isolation in foreign affairs was issued yesterday by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. As the conference continued to debate the party's response to the electoral threat posed by Mr Tony Blair's modernisation of the Labour party, Mr Hurd said the Conservatives must not cede the political centre ground. He accompanied a strong rebuttal of the suggestion by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, that Britain should consider withdrawal from the European Union with an equally firm insistence that the Conservatives must not lose touch with 'common-sense convictions'. Mr Hurd said the 'poison' in Tory divisions over Europe had 'ebbed out of it a good deal', especially in the light of the more Eurosceptic stance adopted by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in this year's Euro-elections. Heading a move by a series of centre-left ministers to apply the brakes to a drift to the right in the party's rhetoric, he said it must demonstrate that it has a vision of society which stretches beyond the free market. Mr Hurd told the Tory Reform Group: 'Conservatives need to show that our vision of society is broader and richer than capitalism. The market can only deliver its promise within a social amd political context.' He accused Mr Blair of attempting to 'clamber onto our platform, paint it a different colour and claim it as his own'. But just because Labour was trying to capture the fundamental Tory concepts of citizenship and community, the Conservatives should not respond by abandoning them. Instead the government should show it had an agenda for change which 'goes with the grain of what people want'. In his speech on the conference floor, Mr Hurd said that the government must craft a foreign policy based 'not on the world as it was, not on the world as we would like it to be, but as it is'. That meant recognition that wielding influence on the world stage depended on Britain playing its part in the big international institutions - the UN, Nato and the Commonwealth - and playing an active role in the European Union. In a brusque rejection of the xenophobia of some on the right of the Tory party, Mr Hurd dismissed the 'siren sounds' of those who believed Britain could turn its back on Europe. He told the conference: 'We can enjoy ourselves morning, noon and night, poking fun at foreigners . . . But if we indulge ourselves in that sort of way we won't have a strong and effective foreign policy; we won't be influencing events; we won't be advancing British interests.' Lord Plumb, chairman of the Conservative members of the European Parliament, referring to the Eurosceptics, said: 'We don't need hindrance and knocking when we are trying to get on with the job in the European Parliament,' Roland Rudd writes. Mr Tom Spencer, chairman of the Conservative group in the parliament, described Mr Norman Lamont's intervention attacking the European Union as 'a new touch of bitterness'.</p>

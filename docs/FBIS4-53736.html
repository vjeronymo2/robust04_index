			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand and Vietnam have reached a new aviation  agreement which allows more destinations and higher seating  capacities, according to Civil Aviation Department  director-general Sisuk Chantharangsu.    Mr Sisuk led a Thai delegation to negotiate the agreement  with the Vietnamese Civil Aviation Department in Hanoi from  Monday to Wednesday.    The agreement signed on Wednesday would allow Thai Airways  International's [THAI] aircraft to land in Danang apart from  Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh as now, he said. With an old airport  built by the U.S. and lots of new hotels, the seaside town of  Danang was a potential spot for tourism as it was only 100  kilometers from the ancient town of Hue, Mr Sisuk said. THAI  would be asked to study feasibility of traffic to Danang.    The route between Bangkok and Danang should be realized as  Bangkok International Airport was the hub for as many as 72  airlines and tourists would take only about an hour and a  quarter to continue to Danang, he said.    It would take about six months for THAI and Vietnam Airline  to study the air traffic demand between Bangkok and Danang so  direct flights for the route could begin next year, he said.    The new aviation agreement also increased seating capacity  for both countries from 2,350 seats per week by 620.    The increase was prompted by "high yield" traffic demand  between Thailand and Vietnam, he said, citing as many as 200,000  passengers travelling between Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh last year  12.3 per cent more than the previous year.    Of the 620-seat increase, national airlines of the two  countries could have an immediate increase of 120, he said.    THAI flew seven times a week to Ho Chi Minh and three times  a  week to Hanoi, he said. Vietnam operated sever flights each on  the Hanoi-Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh-Bangkok routes.</p>

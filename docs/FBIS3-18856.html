			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Flemming Rose: "Big Migration Threatens </F> Scandinavia"]    [Text] Russia is anticipating 8 million refugees from the  former Soviet republics. These millions of refugees will pose a  far greater threat to Scandinavia than asylum-seekers from  Africa or Southeast Asia who try to get into Denmark via Moscow  and the Baltic states.    Moscow -- The Scandinavian countries and Germany should make  every effort to set up a cooperation with Russia to enable the  world's second-largest nuclear power to accommodate the 6-8  million refugees from the former Soviet republics who will  inundate the country during the next couple of years, according  to Russian authorities.    In the long run this task will be far more important for the  security of the Scandinavian countries than the problems posed  by the thousands of asylum-seekers from Southeast Asia, Africa,  and the Middle East who are currently using Moscow as a way  station en route to Denmark and other countries.    We were told this by a spokesman for the Russian refugee aid  system.    "Since the breakup of the Soviet Union accelerated and the  republics were hit by internal ethnic conflicts and economic  problems, 2.5 million refugees have come to Russia from the  former Soviet republics. All forecasts indicate that another 6-8  million will come here from the former republics within the next  three years," said Guran Sanikidze of the international division  of the Russian refugee authority.  <H5>  Room for 150,000 </H5>   Sanikidze added that Russia will probably have room for the  maximum of 150,000 potential refugees from Africa, the Middle  East, and Southeast Asia who come to Russia as long as the  country manages to deal with the reception of 6-8 million  refugees from the former Soviet republics.    "The 6-8 million represent a far greater threat to the  Scandinavian countries and Germany than the thousands who come  from countries outside the former Soviet Union. One can only  guess at the social explosions this will lead to unless the  economic and political situation becomes more stable and it will  be much simpler for these millions of people to go to  Scandinavia than it is for refugees from Africa or Southeast  Asia," Sanikidze continued.    Sanikidze said the Scandinavian countries could learn  something from the agreement that Germany has reached with  Poland and the Czech Republic on returning asylum-seekers to  those nations. "One of the reasons why Poland and the Czech  Republic signed the agreement was that Germany reciprocated by  supplying technical equipment for the border police in the two  countries. Russia is experiencing enormous problems with  building up its borders and making them secure. It is not at the  top of the economic agenda," Sanikidze stated.  <H5>  Russians Show Great Willingness </H5>   Russia signed the UN refugee convention a year ago. This  means that Russia has agreed to participate in solving the  world's refugee problems. Among other things refugees will be  able to seek asylum in Russia and obtain residence permits there.    At present, however, the Russians have been unable to  establish a procedure and infrastructure that would enable  Moscow to process asylum applications and accommodate refugees.  This may be the main reason why Moscow has become a way station  for asylum-seekers from Sri Lanka, for example.    "We see great willingness on the part of the Russians to  live  up to their commitments as signers of the UN refugee convention.  However, the lack of a social system and other institutions  makes it difficult," said embassy secretary Kathrine Walentin  Jensen of the Danish Embassy in Moscow.    She added, however, that Denmark does not yet regard Russia  as a safe asylum country and this means that we do not  automatically return asylum-seekers who come to Denmark from  Russia.  <H5>  Same Rights </H5>   If Russian refugee authorities approve the applications of  the asylum-seekers from such areas as Africa, the Middle East,  and Southeast Asia who are currently registered with the UN  Office of High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) here in Moscow,  the 10,000 families will theoretically obtain the same rights as  Russia's other inhabitants.    "We hope that a procedure can be established for processing  the 10,000 cases we have registered within a month's time," said  Lawrence Jolles of UNHCR in Moscow.    The Danish Embassy in Moscow revealed that it has not  received any asylum requests from Tamil refugees. The embassy  receives an average of two requests for asylum and five requests  from those wishing to be reunited with their families a month.  Most of the requests come from Iraqis and Somalis respectively.    The number of Russians seeking Danish visas rose by 25  percent in 1993. At present the figure is stable at around  1,500-1,600 a month.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- The effort to combat the  inflation remains one of the chief tasks of the government in  the current year. Only the stabilisation in finance will make  it possible to intensify investment processes in the economy  which are to become the basis for overcoming the economic  crisis. Andrey Shapovalyants, the first deputy Russian  economics minister, said this on Thursday, addressing the  international conference on oil and gas.    A number of measures that the government plans to take in  the  financial area this year should arrest the growth of the pace of  inflation, he noted. A rigid crediting policy and the course at  limiting the expenditure of budget funds will stay. The issuing  of credits should not increase beyond seven per cent.    The first three months of the current year showed the  possibility of limiting the inflation growth to ten per cent a  month, he said. There is every reason to believe that this index  will remain valid till the end of the first six months. If  considerable seasonal expenditure from the budget is avoided,  the growth of inflation in 1994 may be cut by half as compared  to 1993.    The government intends to preserve state regulation of  prices  of products of natural monopolies. This means a strict direct  control over the level of prices and their change. The  stabilisation of the financial situation will also be promoted  by the introduction of control over the pay in the budget area,  by the regulation of domestic and world prices through  export-import tariffs and direct pricing of products of state  enterprises that manufacture them on commission from the state.</p>

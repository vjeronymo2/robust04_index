			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The third party is not always held responsible even though a prima facie case is established. The burden of proof will be on the third party to show that loss or damage was caused by one of the excepted conditions that relieves it of liability. The following exceptions emphasize or add to conditions stated in the various third party rate tenders: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Inherent vice of the article. To be used as an exclusion of liability, the third party must establish not just the general tendency of an item to be damaged in transit, but that the damage was due solely to that propensity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Infestations by mollusks, arachnids, crustaceans, parasites, or other types of pests, fumigation, or decontamination when not the fault of the third party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Preexisting damage indicated on the inventory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Mechanical failure of an appliance unless there is evidence of external damage or unless it can be clearly shown that the mechanical failure was caused by the third party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Loss or damage that occurs while the shipment was in the custody and/or control of the Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Any item for which timely notice has not been provided to the third party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Any loss or damage not presented to the third party within the 6 year statute of limitations for filing claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.187  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Limits of liability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Carriers. (1) Liability of Through Government Bill of Lading (TGBL) or International Through Government Bill of Lading (ITGBL) carriers for household goods shipments is as stated on the GBL. The TGBL carrier may be liable for the full depreciated value of the claim or the current replacement cost of items, without application of depreciation, if the owner purchased replacement cost protection (RCP), also known as ``full replacement protection''. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;51.) For the purpose of computing weight, each piece or package shipped constitutes one article. Any article taken apart or ``knocked down'' for handling constitutes one article. Individual article weights are listed in the Joint Military-Industry Table of Weights in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, Table G&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Liability of ITGBL carriers for hold baggage shipments (Codes 7, 8, and J) is normally 60 cents per pound times the gross weight per container (or current contract liability). Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;11.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Liability of domestic freight carriers of household goods shipments is generally stated to be 10 cents per pound per article on the GBL. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments. For the purpose of computing weight under this type of shipment, each packed item (such as a dish) constitutes one item or article. (Also see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;15.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Liability of commercial airlines is stated on the GBL. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;17.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Nontemporary storage (NTS) contractors. The contract for storage of household goods is the Basic Ordering Agreement, which is governed by DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, chapter 2&hyph;1. Under this agreement (DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, appendix H), an NTS contractor is liable for a maximum of $50.00 per inventory line item. (As an exception to this rule, regardless of the way a schrank is listed on the inventory, only one charge of $50.00 can be applied when liability is calculated.) The contractor may be liable to the full extent of the declared value if the owner purchased an insurance policy from the warehouse firm. No liability can be pursued against the NTS contractor when goods are given out to a carrier unless an exception sheet was prepared by the carrier showing any differences as to shortages or overages or the condition of items. The exception sheet must be signed and dated by a representative of the warehouse to be valid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Packing and containerization contractors. A local contractor is liable for loss or damage in the amount of 60 cents per pound (or current contract liability) times the weight per article as stated in the liability clause of the contract. Each shipping piece or package constitutes one article. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Mobile home carriers. Liability is governed by the applicable rate tariff, rate tender, declared valuation, or personal property government bill of lading (PPGBL) as stated in DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, appendix E, and generally is the full cost of repairs for damage incurred during transit. In addition to the exclusions listed in paragraph 11&hyph;26, a mobile home carrier is excused from liability when the carrier has introduced substantial proof that a latent structural defect (one not detectable during the carrier's preliminary inspection) caused the loss or damage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Liability limit. Except for claims involving mobile home carriers, excess valuation or RCP, the liability of any third party is limited to the lease amount of the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Weight liability or NTS inventory line item maximum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Amount paid by DA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Depreciated value of an item (if the third party bases an offer of settlement on the Joint Military/Industry Depreciation Guide in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix G, Table G&hyph;2.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.188  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Settlement procedures in recovery actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Offers of settlement. An offer of settlement or tender of payment from a third party should be carefully examined giving due regard to all factors involved. When such consideration shows the offer or tender to be appropriate, it may be accepted. When the offer or tender does not appear appropriate, further correspondence should be initiated with the third party to clarify the issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Prior acceptance of settlement by owner. DA is not bound by the owner's acceptance of a settlement from a third party where the acceptance was procured through fraud, duress, collusion, mistake of fact, or misrepresentation. In such circumstances, when a claim is filed, all correspondence with the third party must be included in the file and further recovery action should be taken where the prior settlement is inadequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Establishment of timely notice. (1) Handled by one third party only. Where one third party had responsibility for the shipment from pickup to delivery, written exceptions on DD Form 1840 (Notice of Loss or Damage) is evidence that items in the shipment were lost or damaged when delivered. However, a clear delivery receipt (DD Form 1840) is only prima facie evidence of good delivery and may be rebutted by submission of DD Form 1840R, listing all later discovered loss or damage. The DD Form 1840R must be dispatched with 75 days of delivery; the date of dispatch is the controlling date. However, the normal 75-day limit for reporting additional damage on DD Form 1840R may be extended by the claimant's hospitalization or officially recognized absence under the Joint Military-Industry Agreement on Loss and Damage Rules (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix E, sec. II). Implementation dates for the use of this form and details regarding its use are found in DNA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;4. On claims for household goods delivered prior to these implementation dates, timely notice is established by exceptions noted at delivery on D Form 619&hyph;1 (Statement of Accessorial Services Performed), or on the inventory if dated and signed by a representative of the third party. Timely notice also includes DD Form 1840, or a letter or other document noting loss or damage dispatched to the third party within 45 days of delivery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Jamaica re-elects Patterson JAMAICA'S People's National party has been returned to power in a landslide election victory which will also see Mr P J Patterson resume the premiership he took over from Mr Michael Manley last year. Mr Patterson, a 58-year-old lawyer, said the government would continue with economic reforms which include the floating of the island's currency and the sale of state enterprises. Provisional results yesterday from Tuesday's poll gave the PNP 50 of the 60 seats contested, with five going to the opposition Jamaica Labour party led by Mr Edward Seaga, a former prime minister. Five seats were still to be declared. The PNP's margin of victory was larger than expected and surprised even party officials. A split in the JLP leadership is being partly blamed for the party's poor showing and there were indications yesterday that Mr Seaga might stand down.</p>

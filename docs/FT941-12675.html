			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Codelco's Dollars 100m futures fiasco A simple mistake may have triggered a desperate spiral of futures trading on the London Metal Exchange which, when fully unwound, is likely to result in losses of around Dollars 100m for Codelco, Chile's state copper company. The explanation beginning to emerge yesterday was that Mr Juan Pablo Davila, Codelco's chief futures market operator, incorrectly input transactions into his computer last September, confusing sales for buys and vice versa. According to Mr Davila's account, he then traded against these erroneous positions, compounding losses. Mr Davila is said to have realised his mistake only a month later by which time losses had mounted to millions of dollars. Mr Alejandro Noemi, Codelco president, said that instead of informing his superiors, as required for any loss of over Dollars 1m, Mr Davila 'saw himself in the middle of a cyclone and made bigger and bigger operations in order to retrieve the situation.' This 'resulted in a multiplication of the original errors.' It is unclear how Mr Davila, who could now face prosecution, was able to keep matters secret for so long, avoiding safety controls that should have included regular reporting of transactions. This month, Mr Davila is believed to have attempted to salvage the situation when he concluded further deals by telephone during his holidays. When those deals backfired, Mr Davila broke down and last Friday confessed the whole story to his immediate boss, Mr Owen Guerrini, head of sales. Mr Patrick Cussen, managing director of Brandeis Chile, which represents the LME trader in Santiago, said Mr Davila's account was plausible. 'I think it's terrible, but credible,' he said. Mr Cussen, a former Codelco employee, said that Mr Davila would mainly have been dealing in paper transactions, with little commitment to physical delivery of copper. He discounted speculation that Codelco would now have to unload a lot of stock. 'As far as I understand, that's not true. These were paper transactions and there will be no physical delivery,' Mr Cussen said. Codelco began to use the futures market in the early 1980s for hedging purposes. As long ago as 1989, the company made 29 futures transactions which resulted in losses of Dollars 20m, according to Mr Alejandro Hales, mining minister. Mr Cussen said that he did not believe Codelco's international reputation would be damaged. Reuter reports from Santiago: Chile's President Patricio Aylwin last night asked the Supreme Court to appoint a judge to investigate the irregularities. 'There is damage and this damage impairs the country as a whole,' Mr Aylwin said after he requested the appointment.</p>

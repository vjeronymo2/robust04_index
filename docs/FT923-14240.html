			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / French riot police bring an end to truck strike THE French government yesterday broke the back of the 10-day truck strike, as riot police escorted most of the protesting drivers away from motorways and continued to make arrests. Traffic started to flow again on most main inter-city routes by mid afternoon, but motorway organisations warned that it will be several days before roads are back to normal. The end of the blockade comes as 5m French and foreign tourists are expected to drive across France in the next few days. The strike, over tough new driving regulations, has cost the tourism industry, France's biggest foreign exchange earner, FFr1bn (Pounds 100m), estimated Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister. He was considering aid for farmers' wasted produce, and for small businesses, which had suffered more than big companies. The government persuaded drivers to lift the blockades with a mixture of threatened and real force, plus negotiations to ease the impact of the new rules, under which drivers risk being banned after getting six penalty points. Truckers argue that many risk losing their jobs because the long distances they drive mean they cannot avoid losing points. Riot police started removing road blocks peacefully on Monday, but started to use force as they stepped up their campaign on Tuesday. By early yesterday morning truckers started to drive off of their own accord, having had a day to digest the contents of a pay and working conditions accord between the government, unions and truckers' organisations. As a mark of the international impact of the strike, the Belgian government announced it would review the application of its own proposed points system, contained in a 1990 law which has yet to be put into effect. The Spanish government, estimating losses in agriculture and tourism at around Pta3bn (Pounds 16.4m), sent France a formal note of complaint on Tuesday and said it would seek compensation. Spain's National Farmers' Union estimated farmers had lost Pta6.2bn in exports. Industries hit by supply shortages began to recover as deliveries started again yesterday. Renault resumed production at its Douai car plant in the north, though a plant at Vilvoorde near Brussels was brought to a halt by parts shortages. The Peugeot car plants at Poissy outside Paris also resumed working.</p>

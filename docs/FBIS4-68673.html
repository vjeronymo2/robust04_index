			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Lukashov under the rubric "Terrorism": </F> "One of the Murderers of the Deputy Chairman of Bashkiria's  Supreme Soviet Detained: He Is a Republic Parliament Deputy"]    [Text] Kazan--At a session of the Bashkiria Supreme Soviet  that took place on 26 April in Ufa, deputies stripped their  colleague--Valerik Talipov--from immunity from prosecution.    The Bashkiria Procuracy suspects him of murdering Ravil  Musin, head of the city of Dyurtyul and Dyurtyulinskiy rayon  administrations, who also served as a volunteer deputy chairman  of the republic parliament; he died some time ago from the  explosion of a grenade attached to a wicket at his home.    After Musin's death, Talipov assumed the former's duties.  Some time later he was dismissed for "shortcomings in his work"  and went on to become the director of Dyurtyulinskiy meat  combine, where he worked until lately.    According to a version of the investigation, Talipov  participated in a criminal conspiracy to kill Musin by hiring a  contract killer. The suspect is under arrest. Investigation  continues.</p>

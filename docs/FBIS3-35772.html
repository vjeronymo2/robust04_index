Far from abandoning the chosen course, we  shall seek to step up the pace of reforms," Russian Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin said in an interview with the CNN TV company  in Davos (Switzerland) on Monday [31 January].    The Russian premier attends the World Economic Forum there.  He said that Russia is now facing "difficult problems in the  economy". "We know these problems and know what we should do to  tackle them," Chernomyrdin stressed.    "The main thing now is to focus on these problems and to  remove them professionally," he added.    "No matter what rumours are now spread in and outside Russia  about the policy pursued by the government, I'd like to say that  we shall not go astray from the course of reforms," Chernomyrdin  stressed. "The advance towards democracy and market relations in  our country is irreversible."    Speaking of the recent resignation by Vice-Premier Yegor  Gaydar and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, Chernomyrdin noted  that "the departure of some members from the cabinet will not  affect the strategic line pursued by the Russian leadership".    "Chernomyrdin was and remains the cabinet head," he said.  "There are no grounds for panic now. I'm developing an  impression that some politicians alleging a departure from  economic reforms, would like this to happen in real fact.    "They evidently want the government to change its course to  turn the clock back. I'd like to say that this will not happen.  The appearance of new people in the cabinet will not lead to  abandoning the plotted course.    "We are heavily panned now for committed mistakes. We chose  the democratic way of development and are now following it.  This is the main thing. Sure, it is difficult for us, and we  make mistakes. We are pursuing a new policy in a new country."    Chernomyrdin said during the interview that he fully trusts  Central Bank Governor Viktor Gerashchenko. "Gerashchenko is a  career banker with good reputation, name and style of work," the  cabinet head noted. "I cannot say that he does not support the  policy of the leadership and interferes with reforms.  Gerashchenko knows well the country's problems and what to do  to resolve them.    "I have no doubts about his high qualifications and know  that  he supports reforms. If Gerashchenko starts to interfere with  our work, I'll be the first to insist on his resignation. I  believe that this will not be the case."    "The Central Bank is now doing precisely what the government  and the president recommend it to do," the premier continued.  "If new bills are being printed, the decision is taken by the  government and not by the bank.    "In this connection, I'd like to note that all the decisions  on monetary and finance matters taken by the government in 1993  were agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The task  facing us in 1994 is as follows: to maintain the level of  inflation in the country at the level of under 20 per cent per  month.    "Russia has huge debts to pay to major industrial  enterprises. However, we do not plan to pay them fully. We are  unable to do this now. Many in Russia want the Chernomyrdin  government to print more banknotes and issue credits. We shall  not do this under any circumstances."    "All of us should now do our utmost to start working in good  earnest and produce goods in Russia," stated the cabinet head.  "We can start the process of economic renovation only in this  way. We are now facing spectacular tasks, the implementation of  which will naturally provoke a negative response from some  segments of population.    "It is important for us at this critical moment to prevent  the rise of nationalist leaders of the Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  type. We have no right to permit this happen."</p>

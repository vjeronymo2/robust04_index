			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / RUC steps up war on terror rackets THE ROYAL Ulster Con-stabulary is to plough more resources into investigating the financing of terrorism in Northern Ireland. In his annual report, Sir Hugh Annesley, the chief constable, said that, while significant progress had been made, he intended to assign additional manpower to the force's Anti-Racketeering Unit. Republican and loyalist paramilitary rackets raise millions of pounds each year. The RUC has already closed dozens of Ulster drinking clubs, regarded as fronts for paramilitary organisations. In the past five years, more than 200 people under the age of 17 had appeared in court.</p>

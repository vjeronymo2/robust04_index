			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jana Morhacova: "Certificates Have Become the </F> Objects of Fright for Slovak Importers"]    [Text] The requirement by customs officials that products  be "certified" has become the object of fear for many an  importer. The Slovak Agricultural and Foodstuffs Inspection  Service in Bratislava is testing to see whether a product meets  our standards and issues appropriate certificates. Every day,  businessmen come to Bratislava to find out if everything is all  right or whether some additional certificate or certification is  required. These are not easy to obtain. A Slovak businessman  must obtain a certificate from the country from which he is  importing to indicate that the manufacturer is well known to  state offices there.    "To travel to Turkey or Malaysia to chase down a  manufacturer  and to convince him that in Slovakia the authorities want to see  his documentation that indicates that he is authorized to  produce the product is expensive. If the manufacturer does not  have such a document, do I have to look for an independent state  organ in the country in question and ask, say, a Spanish office  to issue a document for a Spanish manufacturer? And, in the  final analysis, I will have to find and pay for a translator.  And what if six of us import items from a single firm to  Slovakia?" is a question by one of the worried businessmen  standing in the passageway, who chose, rather, not to order a  product for four weeks now.    "I import material from a distributor who has the exclusive  rights for all of East Europe. I cannot imagine how I can  explain to him that he must find some kind of certificate for  me," says an importer of chocolate products angrily.    The quest for documents and certificates does not end when  the application and all certificates are submitted. Even the  customs officials have no idea what to check on. If a  businessman wants to bring a sample across the border for  testing purposes, he requires a certificate indicating that it  is a test sample. In importing agricultural raw materials for  subsequent processing, a document indicating that the product in  question is an "uncertified" product is required.    "We shall have to include the costs of all of the  `expediting' moves requiring visits to manufacturers and  official authorities in Italy, Austria, Turkey, or Spain, as  well as the costs of translations in our prices. Added to these  will be the cost of traveling from our firm to Bratislava  several times each week," say several of the businessmen.    "And, after all of our peculiarities, I believe that Slovak  products will be competitive," added a beer importer.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Lessor with the biggest reach may have its wings clipped AS GPA enters a critical week, it can be no comfort that the vultures are already picking over its back yard. Aer Lingus, Ireland's national carrier and the airline that helped Tony Ryan launch GPA 18 years ago, has just taken delivery of its latest Boeing 737-500 - leased long term from GPA's biggest competitor, California-based International Lease Finance Corp. While GPA has been fighting to prevent the collapse of its finances, ILFC, which is backed by the American International Group, has been going from strength to strength. GPA has also been growing the number of leases, although the creditworthiness of some of its operators has deteriorated. Last year it leased 203 aircraft worth more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) and has taken a dominant position in rapidly expanding markets such as China. It would be a strange financial restructuring that did not, however, clip GPA's wings and its ability to fund the business. So what would the airline industry miss if GPA was forced to shrink and who would fill the gap? GPA is probably the largest distributor of aircraft after Boeing. It prides itself on marrying financiers and manufacturers with airline operators. The company has not always leased to the strongest customers and last year, in particular, it faced a debilitating level of early-terminating leases after the Gulf war. But GPA still has the greatest reach among airline leasing companies. In spite of the rise of ILFC, GPA still leases twice as many aircraft around the world as its rival. GPA's size has also provided manufacturers and airline operators with a flexibility they have cherished since the mid 1980s. Lessors have offered aircraft manufacturers more secure order books by enabling the airlines to keep the aircraft off the balance sheet. Airlines have also been able to take aircraft for considerably shorter periods than the lifetime of the aircraft. This flexibility is likely to be even more valuable in the next 20 years. With the latest generation of aircraft designed to last for 30 years, leasing is forecast to be an increasingly popular form of aircraft finance. Unfortunately, in providing this flexibility, GPA has taken much of the operational risk on to its own shoulders which, lacking financial muscle, have proved inadequate for the task. If GPA were to go into examination, the Irish equivalent of Chapter 11, there would be a rush of perhaps better financed pretenders to fill the hole. 'There is still very attractive core financing to be done on aircraft,' says Sir Michael Bishop, head of British Midland Airlines. 'Residual values of the leases should increase in the next few years as supply becomes tighter.' There is also one other consideration. As an intermediary - or marriage broker - GPA's main assets are its experienced staff. Without implying any disrespect to Mr Ryan's West of Ireland base, if the GPA team is prepared to work out of Shannon it could work out anywhere - and for anyone.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KOMMERSANT-DAILY commentator S. Tsekhmistrenko, </F> under rubric "Problem of Arms Export":"Monopolist Paves the Road  to the Market With Good Intentions"]    [Text] When, for the purpose of increasing the  effectiveness of weapons export, the single Rosvooruzheniye  State Company (general director Vladimir Samoylov) was created  late last year, it was assumed that the company's chief task  would be not only the restoration of state monitoring of that  specific type of foreign-economic activity, but also making it  easier for direct producers to gain access to foreign markets.  It was repeatedly proclaimed that, in exchange for acting as a  middleman, Rosvooruzheniye would receive the commission that is  customary in that sphere (3-5 percent of the total value sold).  However, from the very beginning one could easily discern the  new company's striving to achieve a monopoly, in which the  producers see a threat to their independence not only in the  foreign markets, but even in arms production itself. That  tendency may become intensified: as has become known to  KOMMERSANT-DAILY, at the present time the Russian government is  considering a plan to provide Rosvooruzheniye with interest-free  credit for a total of one trillion rubles for a three-year  period in order to use weapons shipments to pay off the Russian  state debt to a number of Asian states. In the opinion of  KOMMERSANT-DAILY commentator Sergey Tsekhmistrenko, in the event  of a positive resolution of this question, the producers,  practically speaking, will be deprived of the opportunity to  exert any kind of influence on weapons export.    Production Is Nothing, Acting as a Middleman Is  Everything!    The creation of Rosvooruzheniye was influenced primarily by  the fact that the abolition in 1990 of the state monopoly on  military-technical cooperation (VTS) had a rather large number  of negative consequences. Several of the factually independent  foreign-trade associations that appeared in the foreign markets  (although, organizationally, most of them were part of the MVES  [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations]) began aggressively to  lure clients from one another, and that inevitably led to  dumping, and, not infrequently, also, in general, to a loss of  customers, together with whom entire sectors of the market were  also lost. Something that became a classic example was the sale  of MiG-29's to Malaysia, when Oboroneksport and  Spetsvneshtekhnika fought for the right to become the supplier.  There were also rather frequent instances of unsanctioned  export, and the sensationalistic story with the appearance of  the latest T-80U tank in Great Britain is only the tip of an  iceberg, the bulk of which is concealed from the public. Under  these conditions one could welcome the restoration of the state  monopoly of VTS. if it were not for one circumstance: monopolism  in Russia most frequently took on the form of ugly mutations, a  form that was far from what was expected,   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-034-76A>      Correlation of Russian (USSR) and U.S. Arms Export in 1988-1992 (in billions of dollars </FIG>     If one analyzes the experience of trade in weapons abroad,  one can see that, practically everywhere, the producer stands in  first place, while the middlemen (who, most frequently, are paid  from the budget) who are working on commission only help to  obtain the necessary state licenses and authorizations, and also  to find foreign agents. Something similar (and good) was also in  people's minds during the creation of Rosvooruzheniye, with the  producers harboring the hope that they themselves would  determine the export price of their output and would  independently make settlements with the budget after the payment  of the commission to that company. Actually, however, for the  time being things seem to be turning out just the other way  around, and in this regard one can assume that if the rumors  about the credit are not devoid of foundation, then the  situation will develop as follows.    After receiving credit, Rosvooruzheniye will actually be  able  to use it to pay for the production of the arms that are  necessary to pay off the debt to the militant Asians. But even  in this instance the company is also already acquiring the  features of the actual owner of what was produced, while the  producer-executors are taking the risk of remaining in "happy"  ignorance relative to the sale price. But the remaining part of  the credit, according to the practice that has developed and has  become widespread in Russia (it is only a lazy recipient of  preferential credit who does not do this) will most likely be  deposited in a commercial bank. The money that has been built up  there simply at the expense of the runaway interest will return  to the state accounts in the original amount, but not until  three years later. The credit recipients, obviously, will  attempt to take the path of such well-known firms as LLD and  Erlan (one might recall the television commercial, "Today you  make a purchase at LLD, and a year from now all your money will  be returned to you"), which, incidentally, are playing with  inflation for only one inning (that is, one year).  Rosvooruzheniye's authorized banks, however, are Menatel,  Most-bank, Intermed, and the Moscow National Bank. As a result,  the real profit received by Rosvooruzheniye will greatly surpass  the modest commission that is generally accepted throughout the  world, which commission was previously mentioned.    I'll Give You a Trillion, but I Don't Answer for the  Consequences    In the story with credit there is yet another curious  detail.  All things considered, Rosvooruzheniye intends to become the  authorized agent of the Russian government in paying off the  foreign indebtedness. Although the company has absolutely no  right to do this, since it is stated in its charter that, with  regard to the state's obligations, it is not responsible  (incidentally, as strange as it seems, the government also is  not responsible for Rosvooruzheniye's obligations. In this  entire scheme, which at first glance seems to be hypothetical,  it is not clear as to whether the Asians themselves are  interested in the wave of shipments of Russian weapons that are  ready to come crashing down on them at any moment. MVES experts  who wanted to preserve their anonymity stated to a  KOMMERSANT-DAILY commentator that, in their opinion, the rumors  that have been intensively spread in the SMI [mass media], to  the effect that the Chinese are sleeping and see themselves  behind the controls of dozens of imported SU-27 and SU-30  fighter aircraft, have been greatly exaggerated. Those experts  feel that Beijing is counting on either purchasing production  licenses from Russia, or (by inviting individually Russian  specialists in the VPK [military-industrial complex] simply  stealing the know-how "part by part." Another potential buyer of  military technology -- Iran -- has already assimilated the  production of T-72S tanks and BMP [armored personnel carriers],  and the sheiks and emirs on the shores of the Persian Gulf who  have recently become promising have preferred the French Leclerc  tanks to Russian ones.    Something else that attracts attention is the fact that a  possible argument that can given by those requesting credit  (another one is simply not discernable) -- the necessity of the  partial prepayment of production of arms for export -- to put it  mildly is not completely correct. Because during previous years  more than a sufficient quantity of arms for export was already  produced. Thus, according to data provided by the Ilyushenko  Commission, which last year verified the activities of the MVES  in arms exporting, the amount of weapons produced in 1992  specially for export came to a total of $3.1 billion, but arms  with a total of only $1.1 billion were delivered to foreign  customers. The rest of the weapons continue to gather dust in  depots (some of those arms have already been paid for  --approximately $1 billion worth).    In the opinion of the MVES experts who were mentioned, by  pursuing the good goals of helping the enterprises in the  military-industrial complex and compensating their production  expenditures, Rosvooruzheniye is choosing not the most effective  means. Incidentally, another alternative is not precluded: the  mentioned MVES experts, by representing the interests of  Rosvooruzheniye, are attempting to lobby in their favor at the  very moment when, in the apparatus of First Vice-Premier Oleg  Soskovets, the government's opinion concerning the future of the  exporter monopolist is being worked out.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Basic Weapons Exporters  |                         |                         |  |in 1992 (see Note) Accor-|                         |                         |  |ding to SIPRI [Stockholm |                         |                         |  |International Peace Rese-|                         |                         |  |arch Institute] Data (in |                         |                         |  |billions of dollars)     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Country                  |Percent                  |billion dollars          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

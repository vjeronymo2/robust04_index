			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 9 June TASS -- The division of the Black Sea  Fleet must bring tranquility to people and confidence of the  morrow. It is important to ensure that there should be no  conflicts nor incidents in this process so that the personnel  should calmly conduct their service and that there should be no  animosity and misunderstanding between the two fraternal  peoples, Yuriy Dubinin, ambassador at large of the Russian  Foreign Ministry, who heads the Russian delegation at the talks  in Kiev, said in an exclusive interview to ITAR-TASS on Thursday.    Dubinin believes the negotiating on Wednesday was "extremely  useful and constructive." So far there have been disputes on  general principles, without addressing the essence of the  matter. Now the sides have been able to pass on from generalised  declarations to specific debating on the specific list of naval  ships and other vehicles, as well as places of basing of the  Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy, Dubinin said. The main  parameters of the division of ships have been in general  defined, the head of the Russian delegation said. Economists  and financial experts work alongside military experts to assess  the cost of ships and infrastructure of the Navy. They will  make their conclusions known to the delegations.    Dubinin believes that all the matters involved in the  division of the Black Sea Fleet should be formulated in one  document, an agreement, that would set out provisions for the  settlement of every stage of the division.    "We want the Ukrainian naval forces to rally as soon as  possible and Russia's Black Sea Fleet to embark on a new stage  of its development without losing its characteristic combat  properties," Dubinin said.    The negotiations go on. Unless this work is concluded in  Kiev, the next round will be held in Moscow.</p>

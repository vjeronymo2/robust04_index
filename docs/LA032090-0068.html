			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD WEIGHS EXPANDED WATER STORAGE EFFORT  </P> <P> Faced with possible cutbacks by the city's major water supplier, Oxnard  officials today are scheduled to consider expansion of an experimental  water-saving project.  </P> <P> Begun last year, the project allows the city to buy excess water at a bargain  rate from the Metropolitan Water District during winter months when demand is  low. The water is pumped into the ground, then taken out during the summer as  the city needs it.  </P> <P> "We don't have the same problem everybody else does," Oxnard Public Works  Director Jim Frandsen said. "We've got three sources of water and now this  storage program."  </P> <P> The city draws one-third of its water from city wells and the United Water  Conservation District.  </P> <P> But two-thirds of its water comes from the Metropolitan Water District, which  passed a resolution last week calling for cutbacks to the cities and water  agencies it serves.  </P> <P> The state drought, now entering its fourth year, has depleted the Colorado  River and the Northern California rivers that supply the MWD with water.  </P> <P> In Ventura County, the MWD's largest customer is the Calleguas Water District,  which supplies cities such as Oxnard in the eastern county.  </P> <P> Because of the storage program, though, Oxnard may be able to make it through  the summer without any water-use restrictions regardless of any MWD reductions,  Frandsen said. However, the city still will work on developing an emergency  water conservation ordinance, as MWD officials requested of customers.  </P> <P> The city, which began the program in October, has 1,700 acre feet of water  stored, or 544 million gallons. It should be able to recover 90% of the water,  which will retain the same quality, when it is pumped out of the ground,  officials said.  </P> <P> The lower cost of the water has allowed the city to save about $37,380. Oxnard  pumps water into the ground from October through April, then removes it from  May through September.  </P> <P> Today, the city is expected to decide whether to expand the program from two  wells to four. The project would cost $240,000, although the council is  expected only to approve funding the first well today.  </P> <P> Once both wells are operational, the city could store 5,950 acre feet of water  and reap an estimated annual savings of $305,830 because of the lower winter  prices.  </P> <P> To speed up the expansion process, Frandsen has recommended that the council  waive the competitive bidding process and select Midway Drilling and Pump  Company to install the first shallow well at a cost of about $120,000.  </P> <P> This well would be operational in September, 1990, and the fourth one a year  later. Once all four are in use, the city would be able to store 3 1/2 times  the water it now stores with two wells.  </P></p>

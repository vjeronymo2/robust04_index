			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, on Friday  [4 March] described as hollow a call by Palestinian leader Yasir  'Arafat to join hands in his campaign to negotiate the status of  Jewish settlements in the occupied territories with Israel and  ensure the protection of the Palestinians living there.    "'Arafat's call is simple theatrics with no substance," said  Ibrahim Ghawshah, the Amman-based spokesman for Hamas. "He is  trying to cicumvent Hamas' demand for shelving the so-called  peace talks with Israel," Mr. Ghawshah told the JORDAN TIMES.    Mr. Ghawshah was referring to a Feb. 28 letter from Mr.  'Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation  (PLO), to Musa Abu Marzuk, head of the political department of  Hamas.    The PLO leader's letter, which came in response to a Hamas  message calling on him to abandon the peace talks in the wake of  the Feb. 25 Massacre of Muslim worshippers by one or more Jewish  settlers at a Hebron mosque, "did not touch the essence of  Hamas' position," Mr. Ghawshah said.    Furthermore, by sending an envoy to Washington in response  to  a call by U.S. President Bill Clinton on Arabs and Israelis to  resume the peace talks, Mr. 'Arafat "has reaffirmed that he has  no intention of moving from the course of surrender he has  adopted," Mr. Ghawshah said.    In a Feb. 28 open appeal to the rank of file of Fatah, the  mainstream PLO group founded by Mr. 'Arafat, Hamas said: "We  appeal to our brothers in Fatah to join hands and escalate the  Intifadah and holy war against the enemy."    "The (Hebron massacre) in which hundreds of our people died  confirms the righteousness of resistance and armed struggle, and  exposes the Zionists' claims that they wish to coexist in peace  with our people," it said.    In his message to Hamas, Mr. 'Arafat said: "It is the hour  of unity and solidarity and uniting ranks and not differences  and divisions."    "This unity is most needed when we are fighting one of our  fiercest battles to find a radical and comprehensive solution to  the settlements and the disarming of settlers and securing  international protection for our people," he wrote.    According to Mr. Ghawshah, "this is not a language of  reconciliation as we had proposed. We wanted 'Arafat to abandon  the negotiations with Israel and return to armed struggle to  liberate our lands."    Mr. Ghawshah said Mr. 'Arafat "is ignoring the streets of  Amman, Damascus, Cairo and the occupied territories which have  erupted in protest against negotiations with Israel."    "Arafat no longer represents the Palestinian people," he  added.    Hamas, which is locked in a running battle with Mr.  'Arafat's  Fatah for leadership of the Palestinians living in the occupied  territories, rules out any dealings with Israel and propagates  jihad (holy war) as the means to achieve liberation.    The group has vowed to step up armed attacks atgainst  Israelis and, in a Feb. 25 statement, singled out settlers as  potential targets for revenge attacks following the Hebron  massacre.    "We will not let up our resistance against Israel until the  lands are totally liberated," Mr. Ghawshah vowed Friday.    He said a group of 10 Palestinian groups in an alliance  based  in Damascus would meet after 'id al-Fitr "to concentrate on our  further course of action" to undermine the peace process.    The coalition, known as the Alliance of Palestinian Forces,  "was preoccupied with internal affairs so far," Mr. Ghawshah  said. "Now we can turn our full attention to activities in the  occupied territories."    He was referring to the formation of a leadership council  for  the allaince. After several months of deliberations, the  council was formed in January, with each of the 10 factions  nominating two members each to the body. All secretary generals  of the groups plus members are now members of the council. The  only exception is the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine (PFLP), whose secretary-general, George Habash, did  not join the council because of ill-health and nominated his  deputy.    For the first time after the Sept. 13 Israeli-PLO accord was  signed, Hamas has threatened Palestinians from the occupied  territories who are members of the delegation negotiating peace  with Israel.    "We demand that the Oslo team announce their immediate  withdrawal from the negotiations with Israel," the group said in  an open letter addressed to the Palestinians living in the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The reference to Oslo was to  the site where Isaeli and PLO negotitors worked out in secret  the autonomy accord which was formally signed in Washington in  September.    "We will not allow a handful of us (Palestinians) to  continue  negotiations with those murderers at the expenses of the  Palestinian people."</p>

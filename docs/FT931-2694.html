			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Bildt wins economy confidence vote SWEDEN'S minority coalition government yesterday won a parliamentary vote of confidence in its economic policies, averting the immediate threat of an early general election. The 23 members of the populist opposition New Democracy party, which last week triggered the country's political crisis, abstained in the vote, which the government won by 172 votes to 154. The government's reprieve, however, may only be temporary, as the tensions between it and New Democracy are not fully resolved. The New Democrats have sought to be consulted more closely on economic issues. The crisis broke out last week when New Democracy refused to support Sweden's budget proposals, joining the opposition Social Democrats in voting to return it to committee for review. This led Prime Minister Carl Bildt to threaten a summer general election if his four-party centre-right coalition did not win yesterday's vote. The crisis unsettled financial markets over the last week and led to a sharp weakening of the krona. Money market interest rates fell and the krona strengthened in early trading yesterday in anticipation that the government would survive the vote. The trend was later reversed.</p>

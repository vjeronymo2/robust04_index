			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Toys R Us restricted by overseas markets Toys R Us, the US toy store chain, reported a modest 6 per cent rise in profits in the first quarter to April. The group said it had been held back by poor demand in overseas markets and the cost of international expansion. Group sales increased by 14 per cent to Dollars 1.46bn, helped by the company's rapid expansion in the US and overseas. However, with costs sharply higher because of the expenditure of opening stores, net income rose by just Dollars 2.1m to Dollars 37.6. Earnings per share, helped by the Dollars 1bn share repurchase programme announced in January, rose to 13 cents from 12 cents. Toys R Us said its international operations had lost money in the first quarter, but it expected them to produce operating income of Dollars 150m for the full year, compared with Dollars 103m last year. One factor hitting overseas sales was continuing weakness in the European and Japanese economies. The company also suffered from poor demand for video games. It said this was because there were no 'hot' titles around and because many people were waiting for the next generation of 32-bit machines to appear. Overall, international stores that had been open a year or more suffered a downturn in sales. However, comparable store sales in the US rose by 6.6 per cent, with some strong increases in sales of basic toy merchandise.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said on Tuesday North Korea's withdrawal from the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was not anything surprising but was  anticipated when the IAEA adopted sanctions against them  recently.    "The withdrawal appears to be the initiative taken to avoid  the disgrace of their being kicked out of the atomic energy  agency," the president said.    While meeting with a group of 15 Mindan (pro-Seoul Korean  Residents Association in Japan) leaders at Chongwadae  [presidential offices], President Kim said that thus far there  had been no signs of unusual military movement in North Korea.    He said Pyongyang's withdrawal from the IAEA seems directed  against South Korea and the United States -- the United States  in particular.    The president noted that the withdrawal was announced at 11  p.m. Korea time Monday, which was a morning hour in the east of  the United States.    Later in the day, President Kim met leading American  businessmen who were in Seoul attending the seventh Korea-U.S.  business conference.    Kim called on the visitors to invest more in Korea, saying  there would be no problem in investment in Korea thanks to  durable peace brought about by a firm cooperative system between  South Korea and the United States.    The government would ease investment conditions and  deregulate control so that foreign businesses would find it  easier to do business in Korea, the president was quoted as  saying by Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik.</p>

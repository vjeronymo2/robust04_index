			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UB pays Pounds 21m for Dutch snacks business United Biscuits said yesterday it will become the savoury snack market leader in Benelux countries with its purchase of Dalgety's Dutch snacks business for Pounds 21m. The purchase will give UB about 33 per cent of the market and push Snack Ventures Europe, a joint venture between PepsiCo and General Mills of the US, down to a close number two. Dalgety said it was selling the business because it was the only savoury snacks company it had in continental Europe. It would focus on the UK where it had strong brands including Golden Wonder crisps. In continental Europe, Dalgety will concentrate on food ingredients and pet foods. In the Netherlands, Dalgety has about 14 per cent of the extruded snacks market and nine per cent of crisps through its NIBB-IT brand and private label products. The business, which reported profits of Pounds 1.5m on turnover of Pounds 25.8m in the year ended June, will expand UB's Benelux snack sales by about 25 per cent. 'We've been relatively weak in the Netherlands and Belgium in savoury snack but not crisps,' said Mr John Warren, UB's finance director. Currently, UB is supplying the Netherlands from a plant in Belgium which is operating near capacity. The Dutch operation, which exports about 45 per cent of its output, will also give UB another route into Germany, the main European market in which it is under-represented. UB has one plant in southern Germany but most of its output goes to Italy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Agenda" program--live] </F>   [Text] [Announcer Tim Modise] We are still checking a very  fluid situation in Mmabatho, and right now we connect to Nan  Roux, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] TV News  journalist, who has been covering events from there. Nan,  welcome again. What's the latest?    [Roux] Well, the latest is that the situation in Mmabatho,  in  Megacity, is definitely still very volatile. I can hear the  shooting now as I sit here in my hotel room. We heard an  interesting report that a prison, Mogwase Prison near Sun City,  apparently all the prisoners were let free earlier this evening,  and there was a lot of shooting between prison warders and the  security forces. What you are seeing there now is the road  going into Mmabatho, that was still earlier this afternoon.  That is from our reporter Estelle Pienaar, who followed the  people. And this is when the situation started getting really  bad, when the shooting started in Megacity. People are very  confused. The police are shooting at random, there does not  seem to be any control over what is going on. There is a lot of  looting going on, aparently that is still the case in Megacity.    There were reportrs that bodies have been seen lying next to  the road; one of the SABC reporters saw bodies lying there. He  could not confirm whethter they were dead or alive. But he has  seen bodies. We have had no official report of casualties or  any deaths. Ambulances were also seen going into the area. As  you can see, people are running for cover. The shooting is just  at random. Looting, people are stealing. The police were seen  trying to stop the people, apparently it was a very half-hearted  attempt to stop them earlier this evening. After a while the  police apparently just gave up and stood watching the people.  They tried to get some of the stuff back, but it's very  chaotic, very disorganized.    [Modise] Nan, has there been any activity coming from South  Africa into Mmabatho at this stage? I mean, security forces or  anything of that sort?    [Roux] Well, going out of Mmabatho into South Africa, we  went  this afternoon, there are Defense Force vehicles there. Danie  Hefers, our other reporter, saw them yesterday as well, but we  haven't seen anything in Mmabatho. Reports of that cannot be  confirmed.    [Modise] The South African Embassy? Is there any word from  them as to....    [Roux] Danie Hefers apparently tried to speak to the  ambassador this afternoon, but did not manage to get hold of  him. The police apparently did go to the embassy this  afternoon, and handed over a memorandum demanding incorporation  into South Africa and the resignation of the Commisioner of  Police. But word from the ambassador, we have not heard  anything.    [Modise] And the military barracks, in Mmabatho -- have you  seen any activity from that side, the army or the Bophuthatswana  Defense Force?    [Roux] It's been mostly security forces, very little defense  force. We have seen helicopters. There seems to be a lot of  shooting and awful scenes. This is in Megacity, where most of  the shooting took place this afternoon. Estelle Pienaar was in  Megacity this evening, and she said it was absolutely chaotic.  As you can see, people are just running, people are looting,  huge crowds are coming into the area.    [Modise] Who is shooting who?    [Roux] The security police are doing the shooting. They are  shooting live ammunition, they are shooting with rubber bullets  and with tear gas.    [Modise] Is there any truth in other reports that indicate  that there could be AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] members  who have come into Mmabatho?    [Roux] Well, there were reports this afternoon. I met up  with  policemen at Rooigrond, 15 km outside Mmabatho, this afternoon.  They were apparently waiting for the AWB who were massing, but  we haven't seen any reports of them. As you see, people here  are also stealing clothing. Estelle Pienaar made reference to  that. Alcohol is being stolen, jewelry is being stolen, and the  police are just standing by helplessly watching. They are not  doing much to interfere. But AWB, no, I haven't seen any.    [Modise] And government members, the cabinet members, it is  not known there they are at this moment?    [Roux] No. We have had reports that Lucas Mangope, President  Mangope, fled the country this afternoon, people saw him, but we  haven't heard from any other cabinet ministers, no.    [Modise] And so far the situation is, as you say, very  chaotic?    [Roux] What you are seeing at the moment is what's going on  at the moment as well. It is a bit late and I can hear sirens,  I can hear gunshots. It's chaos, it is too dangerous for us to  go in there at the moment, so we haven't got the latest, because  we cannot go in there, but it is very, very, very chaotic.    [Modise] Nan, okay, we stil have you on the line. You say  you  haven't been able to hear any word from the South African  Government as to what action they are going to take?    [Roux] No. We haven't heard any word from them. One  reporter did see white people in camouflage uniforms at  Megacity. They are not sure from which defense force they are,  whether they are Bophuthatswana Defense Force or South African  Defense Force. So any South African interference, we haven't  heard any word from that. The visuals you are seeing now is  Estelle Pienaar, who went in earlier this evening, and she just  reports that it is crazy. They really risked their lives to go  in there to get these visuals, because most of the press have  pulled out.    [Modise] We see this happening at the shopping center, but  the government offices, are they still intact, nothing has  happened with them, within the buildings?    [Roux] No, nothing. We have no knowledge or rumors of  anything having happened there. The university, there have been  problems there, the soldiers went there earlier this  afternoon....    [Modise] Okay, well, we're losing Nan there, and we're  losing  the pictures, but Nan, thanks again for coming through with that  report, and good night to you, and we hope that you'll still be  giving us more reports.</p>

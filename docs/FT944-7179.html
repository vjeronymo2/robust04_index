			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Restructure of Cadillac Fairview proposed A group of creditors led by New York investment bank Goldman Sachs has proposed a financial restructuring of Cadillac Fairview, the troubled Canadian property group owning significant downtown office buildings and shopping centres and assets of about CDollars 4.5bn (USDollars 3.3bn), writes Robert Gibbens. Cadillac said it welcomed the proposal but would not reveal details. It will be considered along with bids from other groups including Rouse of the US and the Reichmann family of Toronto. Together the creditors hold about CDollars 345m of Cadillac long-term debt, including CDollars 220m acquired this summer by Goldman Sachs. Cadillac posted a 1993 loss of CDollars 2.7bn, including heavy write-downs, and has been trying to restructure about CDollars 3bn of debt, raise new equity and sell assets. Cadillac was acquired from the Montreal Bronfman family in 1987 by a group of US pension funds.</p>

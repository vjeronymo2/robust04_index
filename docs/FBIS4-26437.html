			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Du Yinghua (2629 5391 5478) and Wang Chunhai (3769 2504 </F> 3189): "The Hebei Provincial CPC Committee and Government  Cosponsor the Provincial Meeting on Industrial Economic Reform  and Development"]    [Text] The provincial meeting on industrial economic reform  and development was held in Shijiazhuang on 11 June. The main  tasks of the meeting are to study and arrange the work of  deepening the enterprise reform, readjusting the product mix,  promoting technological progress, strengthening the setup of the  entrepreneur contingent, and ensuring the realization of the  targets of "registering increases in three aspects and a  decrease in one aspect and making improvement in one aspect"; to  study and resolve the deep-layered contradictions and problems  of fundamental and far-reaching nature in the industrial  economic operation; and to discuss and revise several important  documents on accelerating the province's industrial economic  reform and development. This was an important meeting  cosponsored by the provincial party committee and the provincial  government.    The meeting was chaired by Chen Liyou, executive vice  governor of the provincial government. Cheng Weigao, secretary  of the provincial party committee and governor of the provincial  government, made speeches at the meeting. Guo Shichang, vice  governor of the provincial government, made arrangements for the  acceleration of the province's industrial economic reform and  development and for the current industrial production.  Provincial leaders Chen Yujie, Zhang Zhenhuai, Yu Zhenzhong,  and Song Shuhua were present at the meeting. Present at the  meeting were mayors, prefectural commissioners, vice mayors and  deputy commissioners in charge of industrial work, city and  prefectural organizational department directors, city and  prefectural planning committee chairmen, city and prefectural  economic and trade committee chairmen, and city and prefectural  restructural commission chairmen, responsible comrades of the  provincial-level departments concerned, and plant directors and  managers of 50 key enterprises.    Since the beginning of this year, our province has  maintained  an appropriate industrial economic growth trend based on the  rapid development in 1993. The general situation has been good  but, affected by the malpractice of the planned economic system  accumulated for several years, many new situations in industrial  economic reform and development have emerged in the province.  Simultaneously, some prominent contradictions and problems still  exist in the industrial economic operation. The industrial  production growth rate has slowed down. The industrial  enterprises' economic results are not ideal enough, and their  products do not have a ready market. The amounts of products  kept in stock have increased. The capital utilization rate is  low. Due to the insufficient input of floating funds,  enterprises are extremely short of capital so that the  production development has been affected. Enterprises'  production cost and deficits have increased. In particular,  money-losing state-owned enterprises account for a large  proportion. The investment in fixed assets has dropped by a big  margin. Particularly, the localities seriously lag behind in  terms of technological transformation.    After analyzing the industrial economic situation in the  first five months of the year, Cheng Weigao said: The slow pace  of structural readjustment, the stagnation in mechanism reforms,  and enterprise managers' shortage of motivation and pressure are  the essential reasons for the province's slow industrial growth  rate and low industrial quality. Fundamentally speaking, such a  situation resulted from the facts that the leaders at various  levels have paid more attention to the input to fixed assets and  the increase in new production capacity but failed to shift the  focus of the work on deepening reform, changing mechanisms,  readjusting structures, and improving efficiency. The leaders  at various levels should conscientiously think a lot about this  and further straighten out their work ideologies. We must no  longer pay attention to capital construction to the neglect of  technological transformation, to the increase in input to the  neglect of sciences and technologies, and to short-term  interests to the neglect of long-term ones alone. We should be  determined and adopt powerful measures to accelerate the reform  of the enterprise managerial mechanisms, accelerate the pace of  structural readjustment, promote enterprises' technological  progress, promote the contacts between domestic and foreign  markets, and ensure a ceaseless increase in enterprises'  economic results.    How can we promote industrial production? Cheng Weigao said:  The key to promoting industrial production hinges on grasping  good products, setting up good mechanisms, and selecting good  plant directors. Good products are the essential conditions for  enterprises' existence, good mechanisms are the sources of  enterprises' vitality, and good plant directors are the soul of  enterprises. Grasping good products means grasping projects  with powerful competition, producing famous brands, creating  products with competitiveness, and striving to produce  first-class products. By so doing Hebei will be able to have a  large number of famous-brand products occupy domestic and  foreign markets. By improving mechanism, we mean making  enterprises have full authority for management, assume full  responsibility for their own profits and losses, and develop and  regulate themselves. By successfully choosing plant directors,  we mean boldly reforming the existing personnel system of  enterprises to train and bring up a large number of modern  entrepreneurs in line with the principle of making the party  manage cadres and with the demand of the market economic system.    On training and bringing up a mighty contingent of  entrepreneurs, Cheng Weigao said that entrepreneurs constitute a  decisive factor for the existence and development of enterprises  amid market competition and are the representatives of advanced  productive forces. The prosperity or decline of enterprises  depends to a large extent on entrepreneurs. Thus, training and  bringing up a mighty contingent of entrepreneurs constitutes an  urgent task for accelerating the province's industrial and  economic development and for improving the province's industrial  and economic quality.    What are entrepreneurs? Socialist modern professional  entrepreneurs working for state-owned enterprises should at  least have the following qualifications: First, they should  have the virtue entitled to socialist entrepreneurs. That is,  they should firmly follow the path of building the socialism  with Chinese characteristics, persist in the purpose of  depending on workers, staff, and the masses to run enterprises,  be honest and impartial in performing official duties, abide by  discipline and laws, pay attention to reputation, and refuse to  pursue money worship and infringe upon the interests of  customers. Second, they should have the courage, that is  entitled to entrepreneurs, of being brave in competing with  others, making innovations, running risks, and pioneering the  road of advance. Third, they should have the knowledge entitled  to entrepreneurs. That is, they should be familiar with the  market situation, understand the persons of the same trades,  understand the law of the economy and the practice of the  international trade, and understand how to operate and manage  enterprises. Fourth, they should have the ability entitled to  entrepreneurs. That is, they should be able to make scientific  policy decisions and to meet an emergency, be good at  management, know their subordinates well enough to assign them  jobs commensurate with their abilities, and be able to lead  their enterprises develop continuously. Fifth, they should  shoulder the duties, that are entitled to entrepreneurs, of  ensuring the constant increase in the value of state-owned  assets, the constant improvement in economic efficiency and  labor productivity, and the continuous increase in income of  enterprise workers and staff. All localities should rapidly  establish the mechanisms of giving incentive and restriction to  plant directors and managers and resolve the problem of there  being no differences between good and bad performers. In line  with the characteristics of market economy, all localities  should make bold explorations for reforming the system on  management of enterprise cadres. Various units at various  levels should support enterprise leaders to exercise powers,  shoulder duties, and run risks. Press and propaganda  departments should give a wide publicity to the advanced and  exemplary deeds of enterprise managers and dealers and should  use correct public opinions to guide and help the people  understand the position and role played by entrepreneurs in  carrying out the modernization drive and overcome all kinds of  prejudice against enterprise managers with a view to forming a  fine practice of respecting, supporting, and cherishing  entrepreneurs.    Ye Liansong dwelt on some important opinions on the  province's industrial reform and development. He said: To  fulfill the goal of building Hebei into an economically strong  province, we must pay attention to the following several tasks,  viewing from the long-term interest and from the endeavor of  resolving immediate difficulties:    We should further deepen enterprise reform with focus on  transforming mechanisms and establishing new systems. The focus  of enterprise reform must be shifted from reducing taxes for and  conceding profits to enterprises and readjusting policies in the  past several years to transforming mechanisms and establishing  new systems. With the clarifying of the relations of property  rights, the strengthening of the incentive mechanism, and the  perfecting of the restriction mechanism as the key contents, all  localities and all departments should make overall planning and  arrangements by proceeding from realities, should give different  guidances based on different situations, and should formulate  specific programs for transforming mechanisms and establishing  systems for respective enterprises in line with their respective  conditions. Through the ways of establishing modern enterprise  system, reforming the corporate system, accelerating  technological progress, and developing enterprise groups, we  should help the large and medium-sized key enterprises with good  economic efficiency, great competitiveness, and great potential  of development to enhance their scale, grades, efficiency, and  competitiveness. The small-sized enterprises with small  amounts of profits or with deficits should closely combine the  enlivening of themselves with the enlivening of their assets.  By adopting the forms of contract, leasing, state ownership and  civilian management, management on a commissioned basis,  shareholding cooperation, property right reorganization, and  estate transfer, the small-sized enterprises should promote the  vitality of the whole and the part and make appropriate use of  their existing assets.    We should accelerate the pace of structural readjustment and  promote the updating and upgrading of products. Markets should  be taken as an orientation for readjusting the product mix.  This is conducive to giving full scope to the strong points,  avoiding weaknesses, and bringing their functions into full  play. According to the basic ideology of "high-efficient heavy  industry and intensive and precision light industry" and the  "high, quality, large-scale, and export-oriented" orientation,  we should unswervingly grasp structural readjustment. We should  comprehensively implement the "dragon and tiger" plan and the  plan for development by six groups to readjust the product mix  of large and medium-sized key enterprises. We should vigorously  cultivate and develop new high-tech industrial development zones  and new high-tech industrial park zones to promote the rapid  development of new industries. According to the spirit of  "emulating rich and famous families, grasping projects with  strong points, creating famous brands, and striving to be the  first class," we should grasp the production of famous-brand  products of strategic nature and with vast prospects. In the  forms of amalgamation, bankruptcy, capital cooperation,  stripping, and reorganization, the enterprises whose products  are not readily marketable, that suffer serious losses, and that  are hopeless in halting deficits should transfer their existing  assets to the industries and enterprises with high efficiency.  According to the industrial policies, we should accelerate the  formulation of the provincial program for readjusting the  industrial product mix and effectively guide enterprises to  accelerate the updating and upgrading of products according to  the macroeconomic goal.    State-owned industrial enterprises, particularly large and  medium-sized enterprises, should exert efforts to grasp the  input in technological transformation. First, state-owned  industrial enterprises, particularly large and medium-sized  enterprises, should concentrate the input on technological  transformation. Second, enterprises should emphatically grasp  the development of new products, and the setup of advanced and  high-efficient enterprises should be grasped. The governments  at various levels and all financial departments should pay firm  attention to collecting funds to ensure the supply of funds for  promoting technological progress and to increase the returns on  use of capital. To promote the development of new products,  scientific research units, universities, and colleges are  allowed to convert the products that they have manufactured into  stocks, sell them to enterprises in the name of units or  individuals, and then draw extra dividends according to the  number of stocks. All large and medium-sized enterprises should  set up technological development organizations. Simultaneously,  the existing technological development organizations under  enterprises should bring their functions into better play.    Alleviating enterprises' strain on working funds should be  regarded as a task of the most urgent importance and be firmly  attended to. We should make good and full use of loans and  strive to expand the scale of loans. We should fully support  the enterprises whose products are readily marketable and of  good efficiency, that are able to create foreign exchange  through exports, and whose loans can be withdrawn; and grant  loans to them for use as working funds. Loans should also be  granted to the enterprises that suffer losses but are hopeful to  halt losses and whose products are readily marketable and of  good efficiency. We should organize forces to clear up the debt  chains between enterprises, intensify sales, reduce the amounts  of products kept in stock, enliven the existing capital, and  upgrade the returns on use of capital. All banks should  cooperate with economic and trade committees, try every possible  means to enliven the existing loans, and tap the potential for  use of existing capital.    We should realistically grasp the current industrial  production. First, we should expand the production of readily  marketable products. Second, we should exert efforts to pioneer  markets and intensify sales. Third, we should realistically  grasp production management and strive to alleviate the  restrictions by bottlenecks. Fourth, we should continue to  launch the "grasping, helping, and halting" campaign.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Nissan cuts Primera output as sales fall NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is being forced to cut output of one of the two car ranges it produces at its plant at Sunderland in north-east England in response to falling sales across Europe. It has also stopped overtime work at the plant. The line speed of the assembly track for the Nissan Primera large family car will be slowed next Monday to reduce 1993 output by 15.4 per cent to 110,000 from the 130,000 previously planned. Primera output totalled 141,800 last year, and under Nissan's revised plan production of this range will drop this year by more than a fifth. The reduction will be Nissan's first production cut in the UK since it began manufacturing cars at Sunderland in 1986. Output of the Primera began there in May 1990. Nissan was the first of the Japanese carmakers to establish a car assembly base in Europe, and it is the first to be ensnared in the recession that has hit all the established car producers in Europe. New car sales in west Europe in the first four months of this year have fallen by about 17.6 per cent to 4.15m, according to industry estimates, although Nissan has outperformed the market. Its sales in west Europe in the first four months are estimated to have fallen 12 per cent to 145,000, which has allowed it to raise its market share to 3.5 per cent from 3.3 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago. Nissan said it would seek to make up for the lower Primera output by raising production at Sunderland of its Micra small car, which was launched late last year and is in short supply in some markets. The Japanese carmaker had planned to produce 140,000 Micras this year, its first full year of production, but has raised the Micra target to 160,000. It produced 37,200 Micras in the last five months of 1992 from its launch in August. About 100 workers have been transferred from the Primera assembly to the Micra line, and Nissan said that it was seeking to increase productivity in Micra production by 10 per cent this year. Nissan said that it was maintaining its plan to increase overall UK production this year by 51 per cent to 270,000 from 179,000 last year, but warned that the plan may have to be revised if new car demand across Europe continues to fall as sharply as in the first four months. It is facing intensified competition in the large family car segment of the European market, in particular after the recent launch of the Ford Mondeo to replace the Sierra.

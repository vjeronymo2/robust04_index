			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Wiser to be bold: Philip Coggan with a cautionary tale of how small investors fared in 1993 This is the story of two small UK investors. Mr Bold started 1993 by moving his funds into a mixture of equities and gilts; he earned a return of about 22-28 per cent. Mr Cautious kept his money where it had always been - in the building society. He earned about 5.5-6 per cent gross. So it would be a mistake to think that all British investors will look back at 1993 with satisfaction. Attitudes will depend on the risks they were prepared to take, and the advice they received at the start of the year. The past three years have proved a shock for British savers. In 1990, interest rates were 15 per cent and it was both easy and profitable to leave money on deposit. In retrospect, the best time to move out of cash and into shares, or government bonds (gilts), was after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 when the stock market dropped sharply. But few had the nerve, or the incentive, to do so. Interest rates fell steadily over the next two years, but the most dramatic falls followed sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System in September 1992. Since then, rates have almost halved, and now languish at 5.5 per cent. People living off their savings may thus have seen their income fall by more than 60 per cent in the past three years. Economists may argue that 'real' interest rates (rates minus the increase in the retail price index) are still positive. But this cuts little ice with savers: their nominal income has been falling, while prices have continued to rise. It takes time, however, for most savers to react to falling interest rates. In part, this is because few are aware of the rates they receive on their accounts; surveys show that many overestimate returns. Only when the annual interest payment is added to their account does the message sink in. Not until the start of last year did savers begin to take action to counteract the decline in interest rates. The trend is clear from sales of unit trusts (collective funds which offer investors a spread of equities, or bonds). In December 1992, the unit trust industry made net repurchases from investors of Pounds 21.2m. But in January 1993, the trend switched, with net sales of Pounds 509m. In the 11 months to the end of last November, net sales were Pounds 8.2bn, making 1993 the industry's best. The key to the success of unit trusts has been the Personal Equity Plan. Income and capital gains made from a Pep are free of tax. But for investors holding shares directly, additional charges imposed by a Pep manager can often wipe out the tax benefits completely, especially after the change in the March Budget change, which reduced the tax credit on dividends from 25 to 20 per cent. The vast majority of unit trusts impose no additional Pep charge. Thus, if savers buy a unit trust, they might as well do so in a tax-free Pep. Unit trusts now dominate Pep sales. The surge in unit trust sales is linked to low interest rates. The after-tax return of a cash account to a basic rate taxpayer is currently 4.125 per cent. This is not too far ahead of the dividend yield on the FT-A All-Share Index of 3.4 per cent, which the investor can receive tax-free in a Pep. Investors will therefore lose little income by buying a Pep and and have the hope of capital gains. Further, the unit trust industry has done its best to offer yields well above even the best returns from building society accounts. Probably the most successful product this year has been the Hypo F&amp;C Higher Income Plan, which pays a tax-free income of 10 per cent a year when held in Pep form. The structure of the plan has led some critics to question whether an investor's capital could be eroded in the long run. But enough savers were persuaded of its merits for Hypo F&amp;C to attract Pounds 450m last year. A host of other high-income plans were launched in 1993, some where the level of income was guaranteed but the return of capital was not. City regulators were sufficiently concerned to issue a series of guidance notes last month, warning members to ensure that investors were aware of the risks involved in high-income plans. Unit trusts have not been the only beneficiaries of the search by savers for non-cash returns. Investment trusts which, like unit trusts, are collective funds but which are quoted on the stock market, had their best year for new issues. If the new Lloyd's trusts are included, the sector raised more than Pounds 2.1bn. Sales of insurance-linked investment bonds have also increased sharply; Standard Life recently reported that new investment in such bonds had doubled between 1992 and 1993. Investors have also been buying equities direct. According to ProShare, an organisation set up to encourage wider share ownership, there have been recent increases in the number of individuals owning shares, the overall value of their holdings and the percentage of the stock market owned by private investors. However, private investors tend to buy shares at the top of the market. The last peak for private investor interest in equities was in 1987, just before the global euqities crash. In part, this is inevitable. The sudden arrival of new money is the very thing that creates a bull market. But the industry hopes that this market will be different. Mrs Mary Blair, product development director of Fidelity, a leading unit trust group, says that in 1993 the company's best-seller was its High Income fund, which has a conservative mixture of bonds and shares. In 1987, she recalls, it was the aggressive equity funds, often concentrated on the Far East, which attracted most private investor interest. Mrs Blair also cites developments in the US, where interest rates have been low for the past three years, and money has continued to flow into mutual funds, the US equivalent of unit trusts, at the rate of Dollars 1bn a day. This 'weight of money' has supported share prices, despite high valuations in historical terms. The same process could occur in the UK, which has much lower levels of ownership of unit trusts and shares than the US. Mrs Blair hopes the next few years could see a breakthrough into US-style ownership. Meanwhile, Mr Bold is congratulating himself on his foresight in 1993 and is rather attracted by emerging markets (and in particular, China) this year. Mr Cautious feels the bull market has already run too far, and it is too late to invest in shares. But perhaps the government's Granny Bond, due out this month, might not be too risky.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNIT TRUST NET INVESTMENTS (Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1987                                 6,330.8 1988                                 1,795.3 1989                                 3,866.3 1991                                   391.6 1992                                 2,769.0 1993                                   648.9 1993                                 8,160.0*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *To end November.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Ishchenko: "Crimea's Secession From </F> Ukraine Is Impossible"]    [Text] The conflict between the Ukrainian and Crimean  governments is currently being manifested by the "shootout" with  legislative acts that rescind or ignore decisions by other side.  We asked Ukrainian Justice Minister Vasyl Onopenko to make a  legal judgment about the quite complex relations between the  leadership of Ukraine and the Crimea.    In particular, he said: "The current situation in the Crimea  shows that the leadership of that autonomous republic intends to  secede from Ukraine. The revision of the Crimean Constitution  and a number of edicts by Meshkov countradict Ukraine's  legislation and Constitution. The Justice Ministry has  repeatedly discussed decisions made by the Crimean government  and pointed out their illegal nature. I have frequently stated  this on radio and television.    The Crimean parliament has ignored appeals by Ukrainian  President L. Kravchuk to reject their poorly considered actions,  which are pregnant with dire consequences. The Crimean side has  chosen the very dangerous path of confrontation.    In this situation, it is possible to put the issue of making  the the Crimean Republic an autonomous oblast on the agenda of  the Ukrainian Supreme Council. This would invalidate arguments  by the Crimean leadership that such a move would violate the law  granting autonomy to the Crimea as well as the law "On Division  of Powers..." previously adopted by the Ukrainian parliament.  It was the Crimean Supreme Soviet that first rejected the  Ukrainian parliament's decisions by voting to revise the Crimean  Constitution.    As for the reorganization of the Crimean Justice and  Internal  Affairs Ministries and the Security Service (that has received  so much attention from the Russian mass media -- Natalya  Ishchenko), let me say that similar changes are under way  throughout Ukraine."    The justice minister particularly emphasized that "in this  situation, decisions should be made through negotiations and  with due regard to the interests of the entire Ukrainian people,  including the Crimea. We need to preserve social stability and  reject confrontation. Other solutions to the Crimean problem  are impossible -- as is the Crimea's secession from Ukraine."</p>

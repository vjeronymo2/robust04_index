			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEMICAL ARMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> Your informative and humane editorial on chemical weapons ("To the Brink: What  an Ugly War," Aug. 9) contained a serious omission. During our mistaken  involvement in Vietnam, we used huge amounts of napalm and Agent Orange, both  of which figure clearly as chemical weapons.  </P> <P> Remembering this distressing page from our recent past puts a peculiarly ironic  and significant twist on your entirely appropriate conclusion that "History's  pigeons have a way of coming home to roost."  </P> <P> We are known to have been manufacturing chemical and biological weapons since  our withdrawal from Southeast Asia. Clean hands are a condition of our  credibility if, as most Americans hope, we provide leadership in the world for  outlawing the use of these cruel and savage instruments of destruction.  </P> <P> EDWARD JOSEPH SHOBEN, JR.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Kleinwort to set up investment banking operation in Brazil Kleinwort Benson, the London-based merchant bank, is to set up an investment banking operation in Brazil, attracted by increasing confidence about the country's economy and privatisation prospects. Mr Winston Fritsch, Brazil's secretary of economic policy and one of the main economists behind a new inflation taming currency, the Real, will leave the government at the end of the year to head the Kleinwort operation. The bank plans to open two offices, in Rio de Janiero and in the main commercial centre, Sao Paulo. Mr Fritsch said the new venture would look for merger and acquisition work stemming from big changes in the economy. Lower inflation since the Real's launch in July, and reduced tariff barriers to foreign competition, are forcing companies to restructure and merge. The Mercosul customs union of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay which comes into force on January 1 is also leading to increased cross-border acquisitions. Mr Fritsch expects an increase in privatisation work. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who takes over as president on January 1, is 'fully committed' to privatisation of some public services, according to Mr Fritsch. 'He will also be pressed into privatising other companies which can give him a return for cash,' he said. Private sector analysts agree the scope for Brazilian privatisation is enormous. Telebras, the state controlled telephone monopoly, would be worth about Dollars 35bn if valued on the same basis as Telmex of Mexico. However, Brazil's slow legislative process suggests it will take time for big privatisations to be approved. Kleinwort is the latest in a series of foreign financial services companies to target Brazil. Robert Fleming of London is due to open a new office next year, and France's Paribas last week announced a co-operation agreement with local bank BBA Creditanstalt. Mr Fritsch is the first high level departure for more than a year from the team which implemented the Real currency. The other members of the team are expected to remain in place when Mr Cardoso takes over. Mr Fritsch's replacement is expected to be announced next week.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Organic growth lifts Tibbett &amp; Britten TIBBETT &amp; BRITTEN, the warehousing,transportation and distribution services group, reported a 6 per cent increase, from Pounds 6.34m to Pounds 6.72m, in interim pre-tax profits. Mr John Harvey, chairman, described the result as 'a stout performance despite the recession' reflecting organic growth across all group divisions. Turnover in the six months to June 27 expanded by 21 per cent to Pounds 101.6m (Pounds 84.3m). Virtually all the increase came from existing businesses with the retail consolidation business, which handles electrical and non-food goods, performing particularly well. Operating profits, however, increased by only 4.3 per cent to Pounds 6.41m (Pounds 6.15m), reflecting reduced margins. Mr Harvey said several factors contributed to the decline in margins. Although distribution for individual clients performed well, Fashion Logistics, the shared-network distribution business which accounts for 7 per cent of turnover, was operating in 'an extremely depressed clothing sector' and remained unprofitable despite 'considerable rationalisation,' as volume and prices fell. Margins were also reduced by changes in the overall mix of activity and revenues, start-up costs overseas, especially in Canada, Portugal and South Africa, and further costs incurred in strengthening group infrastructure. Organic growth continued with the purchase of a 30 acre site and 580,000 sq ft warehouse at Preston Brook for the further development and consolidation of the group's contract with the B&amp;Q retail DIY chain, and the building of a cold store at the Northfleet depot for distribution of J Sainsbury's refrigerated food from September. Capital expenditure, for development, in the first half was particularly high at Pounds 13.5m. However, net interest received still rose to Pounds 308,000 (Pounds 194,000), and gearing was 14 per cent of net assets of Pounds 51m at the period-end. After a higher tax charge of Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 2.11m), earnings per share increased by 4 per cent to 12.8p (12.3p). The interim dividend is raised to 3.8p (3.4p).</p>

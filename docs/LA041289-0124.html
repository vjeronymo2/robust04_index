			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE BASEBALL;  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN VALLEY WINS, 2-0, IN BATTLE FOR FIRST  </P> <P> Fountain Valley High School, turning the Sunset League title chase into an arms  race, continued to get impressive pitching Tuesday in a 2-0 victory over Ocean  View at Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Senior right-hander Steve Montgomery allowed only two hits and struck out five  as Fountain Valley (10-4, 5-1) gained sole possession of first place in the  six-team league. Montgomery (4-1) gave up a bloop single in the first inning  and a single that glanced off his glove in the seventh in completing his first  game of the season.  </P> <P> It was Fountain Valley's third shutout in its past six games and marked the  third time an opponent has failed to advance a runner to third base against the  Barons. What's more, Fountain Valley has allowed only four earned runs in its  past six games.  </P> <P> "I've been around baseball a long time, and I've never seen pitching like  this," said Ron LaRuffa, Fountain Valley's coach. "I knew pitching would be one  of our strengths, but I never expected anything like this.  </P> <P> "They hit a couple of fisted balls or Montgomery could have had a no-hitter.  Steve's fastball had good pop, and he was jamming people all day."  </P> <P> Montgomery retired 14 consecutive batters after giving up a scratch single to  Dan Hernandez in the first inning. Gary Christopherson collected Ocean View's  other hit, a hard-hit grounder that glanced off Montgomery's glove.  </P> <P> "Our bats are laying in the rack right now, we're not getting any production  from the top of our lineup," said Steve Barrett, Ocean View coach. "We didn't  hit the ball hard all day. Montgomery ate up some pretty good hitters today."  </P> <P> Ocean View (12-5, 4-2) has found it difficult scoring runs on the road. Last  week, the Seahawks lost to Edison, 1-0, on a disputed home run. But the team's  best pitcher, Randy Karliner, is expected to return Saturday after a groin  injury.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley scored the only runs of the game in the second inning when  LaRuffa sent Steve Lancaster home from first base on a double by Mike Walcott.  Ocean View shortstop Dan Hernandez appeared to have Lancaster out at the plate,  but Hernandez's throw glanced off Lancaster's helmet and sailed to the backstop  as Lancaster scored.  </P> <P> Walcott moved to third on Hernandez's throwing error and scored on an infield  out by Garren Ito that moved Fountain Valley ahead, 2-0. Later, LaRuffa  admitted that sending Lancaster home was a big gamble.  </P> <P> "If they make the play, he's out by a mile," LaRuffa said. "My philosophy has  always been to force an opponent to make the plays. We put the pressure on  them, and we were fortunate to get two runs."  </P> <P> Westminster 8, Marina 3 -- Chris Larson and Ryan Klefko each had three hits,  including a double, scored two runs, knocked in two runs and stole a base for  host Westminster (10-6-1, 2-4). Pitcher Mark Murphy got the victory and Brett  Grebe the save. Marina is 9-8, 2-4.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach 3, Edison 2 (8 innings) -- Brian Wright, who had three hits,  scored the winning run on a passed ball. Pitcher Josh Faur came on in the sixth  inning to get the victory for visiting Huntington Beach (6-10, 2-4). Edison's  only score came on J.J. Thobe's two-run homer in the first inning.  </P></p>

Our correspondent in Washington Arye Golan reports that  the delegation heads will meet again in approximately two weeks.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher will then leave for a tour  of the Middle East.    In the talks between the Palestinian and Israeli  delegations,  it was agreed that the parties would discuss the establishment  of the Palestinian council, decide on the modalities of the  elections in the territories, and modify laws in the territories  prior to the inception of Palestinian self-government. However,  any practical discussion of these issues would only start after  an agreement on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First  proposal has been signed. U.S. sources assessed that due to the  delay in the negotiations on the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles, the elections for the autonomy  council would be postponed and would not be held this summer.    Some progress on environmental issues was reported in the  talks between the Jordanian and Israeli delegations.</p>

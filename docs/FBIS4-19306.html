			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ingrid Hedstrom report: "Social Democratic Program for </F> More Jobs in Europe"]    [Text] Brussels -- With completely new figures on the  European economy in his pocket, former Swedish Finance Minister  Allan Larsson yesterday made public the four-point program for  increased employment which will form the cornerstone of the  European social democrats in the elections to the European  Parliament.    "Our program is based on the simple realization that work  makes more of a contribution to economic and social progress  than does unemployment," Allan Larsson said at a conference in  Brussels.    Before the parliamentary elections in June a final version  of  the social democratic jobs manifesto will be put before Europe's  voters. But, before then, the European socialists want to  broaden the discussion surrounding the program. That is why  heavyweight representatives of both the trade unions and  employers were taking part in yesterday's conference.    At the conference Allan Larsson made public new figures  which  "for probably the first time" view West Europe's economy as a  whole.    And the figures which have been produced by two Danish trade  union economists show that West Europe's economic crisis is  homemade. Trade with countries outside Europe made a positive  contribution to West Europe's growth in 1993. It was reduced  consumption, a growth in stockpiles of goods, and a decrease in  investments which produced economic recession.    Also, West Europe's profits from trade with the rest of the  world are limited; only 7 percent of consumption and investment  is created by business with countries outside Europe.    "We cannot blame our growth problems on countries where  wages  are low, whether these be countries in East Europe or developing  countries. Trade is not the problem. Protectionism is not the  solution. The causes are to be found within Europe," Allan  Larsson said.    "The fact is that Europe has slowed down its economy by  restricting demand."    Once again the former finance minister pointed to the  "investment gap," the gulf between investments and savings:    "This gap is 6 percent of West Europe's GNP and corresponds  to 8 to 9 million jobs. The most important explanation for this  is monetary policy in Europe which strangles investment and  hampers growth and employment," said Allan Larsson who thinks  that the EU's [European Union] finance ministers must take the  lead to bring down interest rates.    Allan Larsson pointed to "four cornerstones" in a program  for  increased employment:     -  Education and training to produce  better qualified labor.    -  "Put money to work" by creating  investment opportunities and a better investment climate.    -  An  active labor market policy which can match new jobs to the right  labor.    -  A new understanding between governments and the two sides  of industry in Europe.    And both Emilio Gabaglio, the secretary general of the  European Trade Union Association, and Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, the  secretary general of the European Employers' Association, Unice,  spoke appreciatively of the European social democrats'jobs  manifesto:    "It is very interesting, very rich, and shows that the  antagonisms are not as great as they are sometimes portrayed,"  said Tyszkiewicz, who did, however, call for greater emphasis on  the task of creating a climate more favorable to enterprise and  investment. Emilio Gabaglio said that European employers must  demonstrate a greater understanding of the fact that a "social  Europe" is needed before it will be possible to create a new  consensus:    "Employers' organizations must realize that the social  dimension is indispensable. But we have not gotten there yet.  On the contrary, they view us as a nuisance. They think that  unemployment is our fault because workers are still stomping  about demanding rights," the secretary general of the European  trade unions association said.</p>

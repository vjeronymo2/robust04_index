			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 Apr (MENA)--The official Interior  Ministry spokesman has stated that all the terrorist elements  inside or outside the country are under security control.    Commenting on the killing of terrorist leader Tal'at Yasin  Hammam, the official spokesman this evening said that the  successive blows by security are now being directed at the heads  and leaders of the terrorist groups in Egypt and are no longer  confined to pursuing those who carry out these operations.    He affirmed that the State Security Investigations Apparatus  has drawn up a detailed and precise map of all the organizations  engaged in terrorism, explaining that this map contains the  names of all those involved in these operations and their roles,  in terms of financing, monitoring, preparation, and execution.    The official spokesman added that this map is constantly  being updated, removing the names of terrorists who are captured  or killed during confrontations with the security forces.    The spokesman emphasized that the main lines of finance from  abroad are being monitored and efforts are under way to pursue  and arrest all those involved.    He explained that the security forces were able to frustrate  most terrorist operations before they were carried out and were  able to capture all those involved and seize all materials used  in these operations. He noted the huge quantity of materials  that have been seized recently. He said that the perpetrators  of every single recent operation have been identified, and a  large number of perpetrators of these operations have been  captured. The security forces are currently pursuing the  fugitives to bring them to justice.    The official Interior Ministry spokesman affirmed that the  Egyptian security service is monitoring all the elements abroad  that instigate these operations and their movements in various  countries of the world. He explained that the security service  with its various branches is currently preparing the necessary  plans to deal with these elements decisively and effectively.</p>

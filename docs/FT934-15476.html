			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Wider EC data controls opposed BRITAIN will continue to oppose attempts by the European Commission to extend data-protection legislation to handwritten as well as computerised files, Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister, told the House of Lords yesterday. He warned that draft proposals, which also include special provisions for dealing with sensitive information, would add substantial costs to private and public-sector bodies. Lord Ferrers said the UK banking sector had estimated that the initial cost of implementing the commission's proposals would be between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m, with annual running costs of Pounds 60m to Pounds 100m. Government consultations showed that business interests were most concerned about the proposals concerning handwritten records. If the directive applied to these, many bureaucratic procedures would have to be introduced 'at very great cost and for no significant purpose'. Lord Ferrers suggested that harmonisation of data protection throughout the European Community could be achieved without the introduction of a new directive. Lord Reay, Conservative, speaking for the first time since he took up a consultancy brief from the Confederation of British Industry, said extending data protection to handwritten files would impose a 'preposterous burden' on some industries. Lord McIntosh of Haringey, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, argued that the extension of data protection to handwritten files would be 'the right step to take'. The great virtue of the Domesday Book, for example, was that its availability to the public enabled the accuracy of its contents to be checked.</p>

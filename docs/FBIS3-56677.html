			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Robert Minasov, Yevgeniy Skukin, and ITAR-TASS </F> under the general heading "Speakers Elected": "In the State  Duma"]    [Text] By way of an introduction to the report on the 14  January morning session of the State Duma, we would like to  return to the events of the previous day.    At his press conference Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the  Communists, stated that the "Russia's Choice" faction has in  effect already disintegrated, and hence no longer represents any  serious counterweight to the recently formed bloc of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Agrarian Party,  and the Democratic Party of Russia, which numbers 115 deputies.    Deputy Mikhail Poltaranin did not agree with Communist  leader  Gennadiy Zyuganov's assertion of a split in "Russia's Choice":    "All that happened is that two candidates for the post of  Duma chairman were discussed inside the faction. As a result  Sergey Kovalev was nominated."    "But in that case, Mikhail Nikiforovich, what in your  opinion  is the reason for the democratic blocs' failure in the  preliminary ballot?"    The correlation of forces in parliament is very complex. And  it is not constituted in our favor. But it is the cross section  of society which we have and which we received in our  parliament. In addition, just like before the elections, the  democrats are uncoordinated. We reach agreements with other  groups, but when we look at the breakdown of the vote, in  general one-half of the votes go astray, as the saying goes.  When there is no overall majority, we cannot afford to blow hot  and cold in this way: Every man counts. Especially since there  are less of us than the "Zhirinovskiyites," Communists, and  agrarians.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's "coronation" speech 13 January  roused  the indignation of the majority of deputies. Let us cite  excerpts from this offensive speech by the leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia, which reached hysterical  proportions. Addressing deputies he uttered the following:  "You are not yet mature enough for a normal parliament.... I  agree to undergo psychiatric examination.... My two-day visit  to Europe made everyone sit up.... I am not suitable for the  role of parliament's traffic controller (in other words chairman  of the State Duma). My health will be spoilt by Chubays,  Kozyrev, Fedorov.... But my health is necessary for the entire  Russian people. Mr. Chubays (addressing Chubays), don't look at  the clock, you will have time to look at it in your cell in  Lefortovo.... Quiet! (taps with his heel on the rostrum). Get  out of the hall, out, all of you! I am waiting for the  presidential elections. Then I will show you!"    The mood of the majority of those present was expressed by  Sergey Shakhray, who spoke directly after Zhirinovskiy: "Our  parliament could be economically self-sufficient if we start  selling tickets for Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's performances."    Everyone was pretty much bored stiff by the wait for the  results of the election of the State Duma chairman. But it  became known in the lobbies before it was announced officially  that 47-year-old engineer Ivan Rybkin had been elected State  Duma chairman.    From our files: Ivan Petrovich Rybkin was born in 1946; he  is Russian, has higher education, and is a member of the Russian  Agrarian Party and deputy chief of the Russian Federation  Ministry of Agriculture Main Administration of Water Supplies.</p>

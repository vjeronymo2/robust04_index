			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Minister opens review of safety for drinkers A review of the government's guidelines on the consumption of alcohol was launched yesterday. Mr John Bowis, junior health minister, said in May that he would be reviewing the limits below which the consumption of alcohol was considered unlikely to damage health - 21 units a week for men and 14 units for women. The move followed research showing that moderate drinkers lived longer than those who did not drink. Announcing the inquiry's terms of reference yesterday, Mr Bowis said the departments of health and transport, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Home, Scottish and Welsh offices would be represented in a working party. This would review scientific and medical evidence on the long-term effects of drinking alcohol before deciding whether the guidelines should be modified or qualified. The guidelines were set by the Royal College of General Practitioners, Psychiatrists and Physicians in 1987. Recent studies - particularly US research published in the New England Journal of Medicine last December  - have suggested moderate drinking can reduce the risk of heart attacks. The New England study found that people who consumed between one and three drinks daily were half as likely to be at risk of heart attacks as those who never drank. Alcohol Concern, the charity, welcomed the review, which it said would help end confusion about how much it was safe to drink. It said 'It is important that the government give their own review a high level of priority because there are currently some 8m drinking above the existing recommended levels.'</p>

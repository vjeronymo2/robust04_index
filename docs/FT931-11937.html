			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: News in Brief STANDARD LIFE, the UK's biggest supplier of endowments, has announced cuts in the bonuses it pays on with-profits contracts. The changes mean that Standard loses its position at the top of the 25-year pay-out league tables to GA Life, but it remains near the top of the table. Both reversionary bonuses, which are awarded each year and once announced cannot be taken away, and terminal bonuses, awarded only when the contract matures, have been cut. Reversionary bonuses have been reduced to reflect the company's prediction of lower investment returns in future, while the cut in terminal bonus follows a below-average return in 1992. Using the standard industry assumptions that policies were started by a 29 years-old man paying Pounds 30 per month in premiums, 10-year pay-outs have been reduced 10.8 per cent from Pounds 7,672 to Pounds 6,839. This is one of the steepest cuts announced so far, while the highest pay-outs came from two much smaller offices - Pounds 7,705 from Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses and Pounds 7,291 from Tunbridge Wells Equitable. The 25-year pay-out drops by four per cent to Pounds 63,394 from Pounds 66,087. The top pay-out so far is GA Life's Pounds 65,464. ***** New unit trust launches continue, in spite of the widespread opinion that there are already too many trusts available. NM Financial Management is launching four new 'funds of funds' next week. They are meant as the centrepiece of the company's revamped unit trust 'managed portfolio service'. NM is making the move to lessen capital gains tax problems for its clients - CGT is not payable within a unit trust, including a fund of funds, so investors are only liable for CGT on the unit trust as a whole. Portfolios for growth and for growth and income are on offer, in both cases with a choice between a fund investing only in NM unit trusts and a fund investing in trusts from other management groups. For the NM-only funds, initial charges are 5.75 per cent, with an annual management fee of 0.75 per cent and a Pounds 10,000 minimum investment. For the open funds, the management charge is increased to 1.25 per cent, and minimum investment is Pounds 20,000. NM is offering flexible regular withdrawals and regular investment updates in a file provided by the company to encourage private clients. It is hoping to use the funds to encourage savers away from falling returns in building society accounts. ***** Save &amp; Prosper has launched a second issue of its guaranteed stockmarket bond. This offers 98 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over the next five years (99 per cent for those who invest before March 5), or your money back. As a measure against a last-minute fall in the index, the final payout will be based on the average level of the Footsie in the six months before encashment. There is an extra facility which allows you to lock in every 10 per cent rise in the FT-SE; the cost is that you only receive 90 per cent of the index's rise (so if the market goes up 10 per cent, you get nine per cent). Like many others of these bonds, it does not take account of the dividend yield in the index; there is no guarantee if you withdraw within five years; and, while returns are net of basic rate tax, higher-rate taxpayers will probably face an extra charge. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,500. Meanwhile, Bristol &amp; West has launched an international guaranteed equity bond. This offers the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over five years, or your money back. It also offers to lock in the gain if Footsie rises by either 25 or 50 per cent. Returns are paid gross but are taxable; so basic-rate payers will only be receiving 75 per cent of Footsie's rise, and top-rate payers 60 per cent. Thus the product is best suited to non-taxpayers. Funds cannot be withdrawn (except on death) during the five-year period and receive no benefit from the Footsie's yield. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. The FT-SE 100 index rose 66.2 per cent over the five years to January</p>

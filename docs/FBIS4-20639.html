			<p>CSO     [Text] The third and fourth solid propellant storage  facilities store the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) for H-II  launch vehicles. They are located 2km northeast of Yoshinobu  Launch Site and are surrounded by embankments and fences.  <H5>  Major Structure and Functions of Third and Fourth Solid </H5> Propellant Storage Facilities  <H5>  (1)Building </H5>   The third and fourth solid propellant storage facilities are  reinforced concrete buildings, each with 478 square meters of  floor space. The ceilings of the facilities have a  blast-releasing structure to release inside pressures above the  specified pressure. Each facility consists of a storage facility  and an air-conditioning machine room where an air-conditioner  and other equipment, such as signal transmission unit and  temperature and humidity monitoring unit, are installed.  <H5>  (2)Electric, Air-Conditioning, and Other Equipment </H5>   1) Electric equipment has an explosion-proof structure.    2) Debonding and cracking, which might cause abnormal  combustion or explosions, may occur between the rocket chamber  and the propellant due to temperature and humidity changes  during their storage. Therefore, the temperature and humidity  are controlled by employing a circulating air-conditioning  system. The warm or cool air is injected from the upper part of  the wall, and the air is sucked from the lower part of the wall  passing through the air-conditioning machine through the  concrete ducts. Twenty percent of the circulated air is replaced  with fresh air. Temperature and humidity sensors are installed  in the facilities and their data can be monitored and recorded  at the Operation Monitoring Building (adjacent to Osaki Power  Supply Facility).    3) Two 15-ton explosion-proof hoists are installed on the  girder for transferring SRBs in and out and moving them in the  facility.    4) Intruders are monitored at the Integrated Disaster  Prevention Monitoring Station through vibration sensors  installed on the doors and ceilings, a warning system with door  switches on the doors, and ITV cameras installed on the  embankments.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-27A>      FIGURE </FIG>     The electric, air-conditioning, and other equipment consists  of the items below:    1. Lighting equipment; 2. Electric power equipment; 3.  Incoming transfer equipment; 4. Telephone equipment; 5. Signal  equipment; 6. Lightening protection equipment; 7. Disaster  prevention warning equipment; 8. Sanitary equipment; 9. Fire  fighting equipment; 10. Air-conditioning equipment; and 11.  Control equipment.</p>

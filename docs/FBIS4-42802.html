			<p>BFN     [Text] The KKE [Greek Communist Party] will not vote in  the Chamber of Deputies for [Prime Minister] Andreas Papandreou  as president, but will discuss the issue if another candidate is  presented.    Responding to a question on the election of a new president,  KKE Honorary Chairman Kharilaos Florakis said yesterday in  Larissa: "Is it in the country's best interest to have  elections? If a political party believes that it is, it will  move toward elections regardless of the nominee. However, if a  political party believes that there is no need for elections  now, it is the candidate's name that will determine the party's  stance. If you ask whether we will vote for Papandreou, I  answer: We will not vote for him. Don't you see his policy?  How is it different from the policy of New Democracy? The  basic goals of their policy are the same. Their difference is  that one was in love with the Germans, and the other in love  with the Americans."</p>

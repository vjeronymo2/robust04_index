			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Australia puts faith in new PNG prime minister: Sir Julius Chan faces a growing economic challenge as disillusionment grips resource-rich nation Sir Julius Chan was sworn in as prime minister of Papua New Guinea, the resource-rich nation adjoining Indonesia's Irian Jaya, after Mr Paias Wingti, the previous incumbent, decided not to stand for re-election. Sir Julius, 55, made his challenge for the country's top job on Monday, saying a change of government was needed to ensure political security and sound economic management. Sir Julius, who heads the People's Progressive party, was the country's first finance minister when it achieved independence in 1975, and was prime minister between 1980 and 1982. Although often at odds with Mr Wingti, he had been Papua New Guinea's deputy prime minister before yesterday's events. He first indicated that his PPP was breaking ranks with Mr Wingti's governing coalition, and was teaming up with the opposition instead, on Monday night. Yesterday, he won the parliamentary vote by 69 votes to 32, with former speaker Mr Bill Skate, standing as the alternative candidate. The Papua New Guinea Supreme Court ordered the leadership ballot last week after declaring Mr Wingti's election in 1993 invalid. Mr Wingti had quietly resigned and then been re-elected as prime minister the following morning. His aim was to get 18 months' immunity from a vote of confidence, since the PNG constitution allows new prime ministers this 'grace period' before confidence motions can be tabled. Sir Julius' election was greeted warmly in Australia, which has a significant trading relationship with the country and provides about ADollars 300m (Pounds 144m) in aid a year. Relations with Mr Wingti were often strained, partly because Australia was seeking to change the aid relationship, and fund specific projects rather than provide 'untied' donations, and partly because of Mr Wingti's 'Look North' policy, which emphasised Papua New Guinea's Asian links. However, Sir Julius takes over at a time when the country's economic problems are mounting; he has warned that the country, with a population of about 4m, could face bankruptcy if remedial steps are not taken. Chronic overspending by government departments is threatening the country's economic viability. The nation's budget deficit reached Kina 270m (Pounds 186m) in 1993, or 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product, from Kina 35.2m, or 1.2 per cent of GDP, in 1989. 'The long trail of mismanagement and scandal has led us to the events of today,' Sir Julius said yesterday. Since independence, three prime ministers have been toppled by no-confidence motions. Only four prime ministers have come to power through general elections. 'There is disenchantment, not just with politicians, but possibly with the whole system of government,' he said. Immediately after being sworn in, Sir Julius said he would seek an end to the secessionist struggle on Bougainville Island, which has been going on since 1989. His election could ensure political stability until the next poll, due in 1997. Resource analysts say he is likely to implement the long-delayed Lihir gold project in his electorate of New Ireland. The project is seen as the country's potential economic saviour.</p>

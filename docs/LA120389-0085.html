			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANGES IN EASTERN BLOC  </P> <P> The crumbling of the Berlin Wall seems to have spawned the occasional  suggestion that the Cold War's apparent end is due to Ronald Reagan. Might I  interject that the myriad changes in Eastern Europe are not due to Reagan, but  rather in spite of him.  </P> <P> The credit clearly goes to Mikhail Gorbachev. For with the incremental changes  brought about by perestroika and his subsequent removal of the Soviet right  wing, the snowball of freedom began its slow but (so far) unstoppable descent.  </P> <P> Yes, the changes technically began to occur on Reagan's watch, but God knows he  wasn't winding it.  </P> <P> WILLIAM P.

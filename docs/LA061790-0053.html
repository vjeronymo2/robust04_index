			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVIEW;  </P> <P> SCULPTURE AT ITS PRIME IN 'PRIMAL SPIRIT';  </P> <P> AN EXHIBITION OF 10 JAPANESE SCULPTORS AT THE COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART IS AN  ORIGINAL PIECE OF WORK  </P> <P> When asked why he didn't paint from nature, Jackson Pollock replied, "I am  nature." Any of the 10 contemporary Japanese sculptors in "A Primal Spirit"  could say the same even though it's hard to imagine them echoing Pollock's  arrogance.  </P> <P> The exhibition is quietly spectacular and a triumph for its curator, Howard  Fox, with its citadels of logs, dancing tree-trunks and serene stone circles.  In organizational terms it is a highly original piece of business, ranking  close to the museum's "German Expressionist Sculpture" in its revelation of art  we didn't even know was there.  </P> <P> Which is not to claim absolute originality for the work itself. Anyone who has  ever seen a Zen and garden, bonsai tree, Raku pot or tea house will find  something familiar here. So will anyone who has ever seen an Abstract  Expressionist painting or attended one of those European summer extravaganzas  of contemporary art with their huge site-specific installations. There are  apparent Western precedents for this work in everybody from Carl Andre to Alice  Aycock.  </P> <P> How could it be otherwise? The modern West has admiringly soaked up Oriental  art ever since the Impressionists fell in love with prints from the floating  world. Franz Kline's paintings used to be compared with Far Eastern  calligraphy. California artists such as Robert Irwin and Ed Moses would be in  big trouble without Zen.  </P> <P> In a world of easy travel and instantaneous communication, how could these  Japanese artists not know and absorb such aspects of Western art as seem  pertinent to their own?  </P> <P> Kazuo Kenmochi's installation includes a mound-shaped 40-foot wall of  wooden-crate detritus randomly painted in dark pitch. Its structure suggests  armor plate, its shape the aftermath of destruction. Its backdrop is a  checkered wall of painted-over landscape photographs in deep brown and fire  orange that strongly echo the work of West Germany's Anselm Kiefer. An  inescapable connection is drawn between the havoc Germany brought down on  itself in World War II and the nuclear holocaust at Hiroshima.  </P> <P> Kenmochi's work resembles the rest in its evocation of large, sometimes  devastating forces but is singular in its allusion to a contemporary event and  nearly unique in its incorporation of painting.  </P> <P> At first glance Isamu Wakabayashi appears as a painter. His "Sulfuret Garden --  A Distant Imagery" is made up of a series of hanging copper panels, some blank,  some bearing a rough dark rectangle that looks painted. It's not. Shapes are  formed from pitting and darkening caused by a chemical reaction between the  metal and applied sulfur. In the center of the room stand two masses shaped  like cotton bales stained with sulfur yellow. There is a hint that the flat  copper shapes come from contact with the bales, creating a byplay of substance  and shadow.  </P> <P> Wakabayashi brings us closer to the essence of "A Primal Spirit" in his  involvement with the elemental forces of nature -- the Earth, Air, Fire and  Water of the I-Ching and astrology. The general genius of these artists comes  from maintaining the ancient Oriental belief that humankind is a part of  nature, neither its master or its steward but simply a link in the cosmic  chain.  </P> <P> Universalism has traditionally led Japanese artists to seek expression through  a kind of anti-originality. It's well-known that the Japanese aesthetic makes  no particular distinction between art, craft, and decoration or, for that  matter, between the aesthetic worth of something man-made and that of a  particularly fetching rock or tree.  </P> <P> Far from resulting in a debased visual culture, the attitude has produced one  of the rare civilizations where so-called craft objects possess such  extraordinary quality they are self-evidently works of art. Much here requires  a double-take before we're sure it wasn't phenomenally formed by quirky  collaboration between humans, time and the weather.  </P> <P> Shigeo Toya's remarkable "Woods" shows serried ranks of 28 whitened man-tall  wooden uprights that seem to have gotten their shapes from centuries of  erosion, dry rot, termites, lightning bolts and hungry worms. Some unmistakable  presence haunts each post, as alive and awesome as an ancestral spook. Talk  about animism.  </P> <P> Looking at Chuichi Fuji's tormented tree trunks lies somewhere between watching  a gardener artfully wire a Japanese black pine and witnessing the antics of the  Pilobolus dancers. Massive hairy bark trunks do deep abdominal bends over one  another. Amusing, ominous and philosophical, they are at one moment like  something out of "Fantasia" and the next a deep rumination on the nature of  paradox. How Fuji manages to make pretzel bends in great cypress and cedar is a  mystery that doesn't bother much. He's so artful it looks like it just  happened.  </P> <P> Few of these artists have big reputations even at home. Toshikatsu Endo has  cracked the ranks of the international mainstream and maybe that's not so good.  He's about the only artist in the show whose work betrays Western-style  self-consciousness. His untitled ring of stone is distinctive enough to stand  apart from similar work by Richard Long. But Endo forces the issue by having  three of the stones cast in bronze. Instead of triggering the insight of a  haiku verse, the move feels tinny.  </P> <P> Even so, Endo joins the others in the attitude of submissive detachment that  lends the work its amazing clout. Because it appears to have somehow happened  spontaneously we have no sense of some massive human ego trying to force its  vision of things on us. Nothing gets between us and the aesthetic experience.  We have the refreshing sense that we have discovered and somehow created it  ourself.  </P> <P> Artists here who don't play at being nature undertake the role of the humble  craftsman. Emiko Tokushige is the only woman on board and she assumes the role  of a basket-maker fashioning objects from palm fiber, rope, cotton, old  stockings and whatnot. At a glance her big pieces could be basketry beanbags  and the little stuff tiny containers. It only takes a second to see the  beanbags as creatures from the atavistic ooze. Purely abstract as they are,  they could be shiny little rhinos basking malevolently among the dinosaurs.  Grouped small pieces have the aura of demons with the crackling hair of madmen.  Tokushige stands among the strongest talents here.  </P> <P> Kimio Tsuchiya plays the eccentric carpenter in a 19-foot-wide fan of lumber  scraps he calls "Silence." It's impressive when artists get the title right.  His "Landscape" looks like a bunch of broken log slices stacked so carelessly  against the wall that some have fallen down. But it's sculpture without doubt.  The effect is like those stone groupings in sand gardens that appear both  accidental and inevitable. These guys have a knack for inevitability.  </P> <P> Three remaining artists produce a kind of sculpture-as-architecture. Tadashi  Kawamata's raw plank piece crawls across the bridge of the museum's central  court looking for links to the real world and its inner rhythms. Takamasa  Kuniyasu's piece of criss-crossed logs towers in a tall gallery like the  battlements of an ancient castle in a samurai film. Rather threatening. It  takes on another twist because of myriad small bricks inserted between logs. It  makes one aware of ones microscopic inner workings in its own metaphor of  cellular growth,  </P> <P> Koichi Ebizuka fools us again by coming on like a builder of traditional  Japanese architecture with its low porches, simple uprights and virgin wood  circles filled with pebbles. In the end it is sculpture about a journey through  changing experiences of vertical, horizontal, straight and crooked, mass and  plane. There's a charming sense of romance about it.  </P> <P> And about the rest. What these artists have really achieved here is a new  International Japanese style. Its distinction doesn't come from formal  invention. It rather re-invests the egotistical, chilly international  mainstream with passion, poetry and romance.  </P> <P> * A TALK WITH TWO ARTISTS: Please turn the page.  </P></p>

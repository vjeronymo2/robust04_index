Outside the municipal assembly  building he was welcomed by Radovan Karadzic, president of the  Srpska republic, and by Prime Minister Vladimir Lukic.    Greetings were exchanged during a cordial meeting and on  this  occasion Zhirinovskiy told Karadzic that wherever he goes he  finds "proofs and monuments indicating that the Serb nation is a  historic nation."    The host and his guest then went to the municipal assembly  building where talks are to be held. More than 10,000 people  have been waiting at the city square in Bijeljina since early  this morning to hear Zhirinovskiy and Karadzic speak.</p>

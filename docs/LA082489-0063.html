			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: HOME BUYERS CAN GUARD AGAINST LOSS OF DEPOSITS  </P> <P> Buying or selling a home is a tense, emotionally draining experience, even if  things go well. But if the deal falls apart, the experience can be  excruciatingly painful and very expensive.  </P> <P> Buyers and sellers both wind up angry, and often the anger is directed at the  escrow company, the third party that acts as the neutral intermediary between  the two. That's because the escrow company has control of the funds deposited  by the buyer, and both buyer and seller may think the money is rightfully  theirs, especially if each thinks the other is to blame for the wrangle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Certain Contingencies  </P> <P> A home purchase may fall apart for any number of common reasons. Usually, the  sale is conditioned upon certain contingencies that just don't occur. The buyer  may not be able to obtain financing. The home may be infested with termites. A  geological or structural inspection may find hidden defects. The seller may  just get cold feet and change his mind.  </P> <P> Whatever the reason, for the buyer to get the deposit back, the escrow company  will usually require written instructions signed by both buyer and seller  canceling the escrow and stating how the deposit will be refunded. Even if it  is very obvious to you, whether you're a buyer or seller, that the other person  is completely at fault, the escrow company will not refund the money unless  both parties agree in writing.  </P> <P> The escrow company is a neutral stake holder. "They are not supposed to  interpret, extrapolate . . . or prophesize," observes Doug Ring, a Century City  real estate lawyer. "If they return money without having properly documented  the (approvals from both sides), the escrow company can be held liable by the  party who did not give them the instructions."  </P> <P> When both sides can't agree to written cancellation instructions, the money  will be held by the escrow company until a court determines who should  rightfully receive it, or the parties settle the dispute. The escrow company  can file something called an interpleader action, in which it goes to court and  says essentially, "Hey, I have this money, please tell me who I should give it  to."  </P> <P> The escrow agreement usually provides that the escrow company will be  reimbursed for its legal fees, which means that the deposit will be used to pay  the escrow company's attorneys. Even without such an agreement, the judge has  discretion to award attorney's fees and usually does, according to real estate  lawyer Barry Mitidiere. Because the deposit is commonly under $10,000, there  may be little or nothing left once the fees are paid. Instead of losing the  deposit to the seller, it goes to the lawyers representing the escrow company.  In any event, the buyer isn't happy.  </P> <P> Knowing that this is how such disputes often end, it is wise to forget about  the legal solution and try to work out a settlement with the parties, with the  help of the real estate agents, especially if the deposit is not large.  </P> <P> There is a better way to help prevent your money from being frozen in an escrow  account -- a properly drafted purchase and sale agreement. The contract should  contain what Ring calls a "self-destruct" provision, which states that "if the  contingencies have not been met by a specific date, then the escrow holder is  hereby instructed to terminate the escrow and return the deposit less actual  escrow fees and costs." Then, in effect, the cancellation instructions have  been signed in advance and become effective if the specified date arrives and  the escrow hasn't closed.  </P> <P> According to Ring, such a provision is not commonly found in the preprinted  form residential purchase agreements usually provided by the real estate  brokerage company or the escrow company. (Of course, it is not in a real estate  agent's best interest to make it too easy for the parties to get out of the  deal. On the other hand, a good real estate agent can often save a sale that is  about to fall apart.) It may be worthwhile to discuss with your real estate  agent or lawyer whether one should be added to the form you use when you buy or  sell a house.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discuss With Agent  </P> <P> However, even such a provision does not guarantee protection, because the  escrow company will freeze the deposit and won't distribute the funds if one  party advises in writing that a dispute exists, Ring adds.  </P> <P> Incidently, if you are depositing a large sum of money for a long time, you  should consider requesting that the escrow company deposit the funds in an  interest-bearing account for your benefit.  </P> <P> If you want to know more about the escrow process or selling a home, here are  two good resource books: "For Sale by Owner" by George Devine and "All About  Escrow" by Sandy Gadow.  </P></p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Bush to confront realities of Rio AS HE packed his bags before flying to Rio de Janeiro today US President George Bush might have been forgiven a moment of doubt over whether he made the right choice in finally deciding to attend the Earth Summit. By threatening to stay away, Mr Bush was able to force concessions from other nations on the climate change convention, which is due to be signed at the meeting. In the last few days, however, the US has appeared more isolated than ever, facing mounting criticism not only from the developing world but from its industrialised allies for emasculating the climate convention and for refusing to sign a biodiversity convention to which even the UK, Washington's staunchest friend on these issues, had swallowed its objections. Even a short stopover in Panama has gone awry, after a US soldier was shot and killed during a student demonstration on the eve of Mr Bush's visit. The killing appears likely to upstage any attempt to remind US voters that it was Mr Bush who freed Panama from General Manuel Noriega, its former military dictator. US officials tried to take the offensive this week to pave the way for Mr Bush's arrival in Rio. They claimed the US record on the environment was far better than those of many of its critics, and attacked Japan and Germany for bowing to a 'guilty developed world logic'. One senior US negotiator assailed both developing and developed countries for cynically putting rhetoric ahead of action, and claimed one European diplomat had told him his country would sign the Rio conventions because it did not take them seriously. 'These countries need a shot across the bow. They are taking a holier-than-thou attitude when they have records nowhere near as good as ours,' he said. There is an element of truth to this claim. The US spends nearly Dollars 130bn (Pounds 71.4bn) a year on pollution control, or about 2 per cent of gross domestic product - substantially more than most other developed countries. The US has also achieved considerable reductions in pollutant emissions. Lead emissions, for example, have been curbed from 163,600 tons in 1970 to just 2,200 tons in 1990, while carbon monoxide emissions have been nearly halved over the same period. But the US, with its high living standards and profligate energy consumption, still contributes more to global pollution, both per capita and in absolute terms, than other countries. Details of environmental policy have been largely eclipsed domestically by a black and white perception of the conflict between the environment and employment - a perception heightened both by the persistent sluggishness of the US economy and the imminent US election. Mr William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the US's chief delegate to the Rio conference, has often been a lonely advocate within the Bush administration of environmental protection. In recent months, however, his position has come under sustained attack, especially from the Council on Competitiveness, a pro-business committee chaired by Vice-President Dan Quayle that works behind the scenes to influence administration policies and regulations. This battle came to a head last week with the leaking of a memorandum in which Mr Reilly sought backing for a final attempt to change the biodiversity treaty in such a way that the US could sign it.</p>

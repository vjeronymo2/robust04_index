			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that the consideration of information relevant to the previous five years of funding prior to the fiscal year under funding consideration provided an insufficient time frame to determine the relative success of projects in encouraging students to enter doctoral study. The commenter suggested that seven to ten years was a more accurate indicator of success in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees that seven to ten years may provide a more comprehensive picture of the success of a project's endeavors to assure that students enter or complete a program of study leading to a doctoral degree. However, for the purposes of prior experience, the most recent years' experience of the project is considered adequate, and thus the rationale for the five-year cap, since that is the maximum grant award period allowed under current legislation. To ensure the consistent application of this policy, &sect;647.22(a) has been revised to clearly state that the period to be considered is the performance period under an expiring McNair grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 647.22(a) has been modified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> What are Allowable Costs? (Section 647.30)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters objected to the provision that restricted the $2,400 stipend to the ``summer'' research internships. They felt that this provision was overly restrictive and did not allow the applicants flexibility in designing programs that most appropriately meet the unique needs of the students to be served.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary has reconsidered the provision that ties the payment of the $2,400 stipend to summer research internships. The Secretary will allow the payment of stipends for research internships that take place other than in the summer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 647.30(b) has been modified. Also, language has been added to &sect;647.30(c) to clarify that tuition, room and board, and transportation costs are allowable only for summer internships involving research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> What are Unallowable Costs? (Section 647.31)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested that allowable costs should include student fees for test preparation workshops, colloquia or other courses that directly increase the likelihood of a student entering a doctoral program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary disagrees with the commenters because this payment would constitute a form of direct student aid that is not allowed under this program except as provided for in &sect;647.30. The provision of the workshops, colloquia or courses under the project for all interested participants is, however, allowable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> What Other Requirements Must A Grantee Meet?

As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review.

The Department needs and uses the information to make grants. Annual public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 20 hours per response for 68 respondents, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirement should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 10235, New Executive Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20503; Attention: Daniel J.

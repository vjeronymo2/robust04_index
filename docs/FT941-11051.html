			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Compromise near on Tokyo tax cut plan Japan's seven-party coalition yesterday appeared near to a compromise on a long-delayed economic package of tax cuts and government spending. Party leaders agreed that the package, originally planned to be worth Y5,100bn (Pounds 30.5bn), must be adopted as government policy before Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, meets US President Bill Clinton in Washington on Friday. The government is eager to present Mr Clinton with evidence that it is doing its best to stimulate domestic demand, in order to deflect US demands for numerical targets for a decline in the current account surplus and for increases in the market shares of imported goods. Official figures today are expected to show that the current account surplus rose to around Dollars 140bn (Pounds 93bn) last year from Dollars 117.55bn in 1992. Japan wants to show it means to sweep away economically stifling regulations and barriers to foreign competition, but cannot accept numerical targets, officials say. Mr Hosokawa would lose as much support for agreeing to US targets as he would by failing to produce an economic package, they argue. Coalition members have been trying to hammer out a compromise on the economic package since early Thursday morning when Mr Hosokawa dropped a political bombshell by proposing a Y6,000bn-a-year tax cut, to be funded by a 7 per cent 'welfare tax' on goods and services to be introduced in three years. The Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, elected on a promise not to increase the current 3 per cent sales tax, complained that Mr Hosokawa had failed to consult the party - a clash with the Japanese political tradition of consensus on difficult decisions. The final shape of the compromise was unclear yesterday, but Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Socialist leader, said his party had suggested the government should wait two years before considering raising sales tax. 'We will discuss the overall revenue situation and a basic welfare programme during that period. This will help the prime minister achieve national consensus,' said Mr Murayama. That idea is likely to please the US, since it removes a damper on consumer spending. But the powerful Finance Ministry and the Japan Renewal party - the main influence on government economic policy - believe that a drop in income tax must not be allowed to add to government borrowings.</p>

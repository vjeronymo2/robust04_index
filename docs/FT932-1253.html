			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Quality Care jumps by 78% to Pounds 1.5m QUALITY CARE Homes lifted pre-tax profits by 78 per cent, from Pounds 835,000 to Pounds 1.49m in the half year ended April 30, as the north-east based nursing home operator continued its rapid expansion. Mr Duncan Bannatyne, managing director, said that the early evidence of the working of the new community care funding rules suggested there would be no downward pressure on prices. But admissions were taking longer, meaning occupancy rates could fall slightly. At the end of the half year 96.2 per cent of beds were occupied. Turnover rose 49 per cent, to Pounds 4.1m, with the full benefit of homes opened last year and another 61 beds opened sincetaking the total to 601. Another four homes are due to open in the second half, with bed numbers rising to 799 by the year end. Another three homes are already under construction. The rate of expansion had been faster than expected and opening costs would mean it would be difficult to repeat the first half performance in the second half. Operating profits rose 37 per cent to Pounds 1.54m. Net interest payable was lower at Pounds 54,000 (Pounds 287,000) thanks to the Pounds 4.1m flotation proceeds. Gearing, 15 per cent at the last year end, was 19 per cent at April 30. The shares, which have doubled since the placing at 136p in July, were down 2p to 278p yesterday. Earnings per share were 7.67p (6p) and the interim dividend is 1.5p (0.15p).</p>

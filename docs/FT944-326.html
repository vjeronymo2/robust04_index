			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'China must calm fears of mining investors' China's mining and metals sector requires Dollars 44bn of capital in the years to 2000, according to the Chinese authorities, but other countries in Asia, in Latin America and the Commonwealth of Independent States are also competing hard for funds. So China's chances of obtaining the necessary money 'will depend as much on its ability to calm lender and investor worries as on the viability of any particular project', suggests the MetalsFinance newsletter. Foreign investors will be particularly concerned about details of the regulatory climate in China, the rate of return allowed on investments and stability in economic and industrial policy, it points out. The Chinese authorities say that Dollars 30bn is required for 'capital construction' in the mining and metals sector and another Dollars 14bn is needed for 'technical improvements'. MetalsFinance suggests China will increasingly seek innovative funding sources, particularly structured financing packages, which, at their simplest, involve the forward sale of future metal production to a finance house in return for pre-production funds. Foreign investment in China is expected by the newsletter to maintain its concentration in the base metals sector, with copper and aluminium given top priority, 'although the list of prospective investors in the gold mining sector is growing. The influence of Asian investors in the country's metals and steel sector is also expected to grow over time, leading to greater regional integration,' the newsletter adds.

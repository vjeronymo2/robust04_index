			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Private investors urged to buy gilts - Bank of England spreads the message as latest Pounds 3bn auction approaches THE BANK of England is making special efforts to encourage private investors to take part in its latest auction of Pounds 3bn worth of gilts. The stock on offer pays a coupon (interest rate) of 7.25 per cent and will be redeemed in five years. The Bank has been encouraged by the response to its recent booklet* on the gilt market for which it received 60,000 written or telephoned requests. Private investors are turning to gilts because many issues can offer returns higher than those available from building societies. A special shortened prospectus for the issue will appear in national newspapers, designed for the use of private investors. The auction is divided into two: competitive bids (for the institutions) and non-competitive (for private investors). In the first, institutions will bid for the stock at a price of their choosing. The Bank will then accept the highest bids and allocate the stock accordingly. Obviously, it would be difficult for private investors to go through this process. Instead, they are allocated stock at the weighted average of the prices achieved in the competitive tender. Although this saves them from some tricky guesswork, it does mean they have to apply for stock without knowing the price they will pay. And the process is all the more complicated because the stock is issued in partly-paid form  -two chunks worth Pounds 50 apiece. The minimum non-competitive application allowed is for Pounds 1,000 nominal of stock (the maximum is Pounds 500,000). But because of the partly-paid aspect, investors must send a cheque to the value of Pounds 53 for every Pounds 100 nominal - so the smallest cheque you can send is Pounds 530. If the price achieved in the auction is Pounds 51 per Pounds 100, investors will be entitled to a refund. But they will then face a bill for the second payment - a further Pounds 50 for every Pounds 100 nominal - by May 20. In other words, you send the Bank some money, it sends you some back - and then you send it some more. If the government really wants to encourage private investors to buy gilts, they could tidy up this ridiculously convoluted process. Those who want to apply (the easiest way is to use one of the forms in the newspapers) will need to hurry. Applications must be sent to the Bank of England, New Issues, PO Box 444, Gloucester GL1 1NP, to arrive no later than 10 am on Wednesday April 28. Cheques must be made out to the Bank of England and crossed 'New issues.' The advantage of investing in a new issue is that you avoid paying commission. You can also buy stock reasonably near to face value (many gilts are trading well above it) so that, if you hold the stock until maturity, you will incur only a minimal capital loss. Investors can have the stock placed on the National Savings register so that income can be paid gross. A more fundamental question is whether it makes sense to buy the issue. Although the coupon is 7.25 per cent, the chances are that investors will have to pay a fraction above face value - bringing the redemption yield down to 7 per cent. For basic-rate taxpayers, the running yield will be around 5.37 per cent - that compares with the 6.95 per cent net yield on Pounds 50,000 quoted by Moneyfacts for the best guaranteed income bond over the same period. Obviously, a GIB is higher risk (although the Policyholders Protection Act safeguards 90 per cent of the investment) and is not a liquid security. Much also depends on whether you believe interest rates will remain at low levels for five years. if they do not, you could be locked into a low-yielding investment. Even if you sell the gilt in the interim, you might not get what you paid for it. *Investing in Gilts: a Guide for the Small Investor.

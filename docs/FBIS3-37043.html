"I see no  changes in the sphere of dialogue with people, listening to  them, decrease in the number of officials, struggle with  corruption," Yavlinskiy said in the Moscow House of Scientists  on Friday evening.    "Gorbachev carried out political reforms ignoring the  economic ones. Yeltsin has acted vice versa since 1991,"  Yavlinskiy pointed out. In his opinion, the way to abolishment  of the USSR chosen in 1991 could resist no critic from the point  of view of logic, market economy and democracy. "We have to pay  for this, especially in the sphere of the economy," he said.    Yavlinskiy also believes that the executive power was to  blame for the October events in Moscow to a bigger extent. All  this must be taken into consideration when assessing Yeltsin,  Yavlinskiy emphasized.    On the economic situation, he pointed out that he would  focus  on fighting inflation if he were given an opportunity to form  the government. "It is very important to keep inflation this  autumn from reaching 40-50%," Yavlinskiy believes.    However, Yavlinskiy repeated that he had been critical of  Gaydar's policy, saying that "constant endless struggle with  inflation was unreasonable." "Inflation is only a symptom of the  affected economy. De-monopolization of the economy,  establishment of a strong and large private sector and real  competitiveness are needed," he pointed out.    Yavlinskiy said that we could hope for Russian money  returning to Russia from abroad. Its amount is put from $25 Bn  to $50 Bn, according to different estimates. "We need a system  under which it will be beneficial for the owners to bring money  back to Russia," Yavlinskiy emphasized.</p>

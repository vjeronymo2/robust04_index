			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact working group to be formed The International Natural Rubber Organisation council has agreed to form a working group to pave the way for early talks on a new price stabilisation pact, officials said yesterday, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur. A decision on whether to renegotiate the current International Natural Rubber Agreement would be made by end-March 1993, they said after a three-day council meeting. 'This is significant progress,' said Mr Ahmad Farouk SM Ishak, of Malaysia, spokesman for producer members. 'The consumers appreciated the seriousness of our position.' The present five-year pact, which operates through a buffer stock system, can be extended by a further two years beyond its scheduled expiry in December 1993.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Kemper succumbs to Conseco Kemper, the US insurance and mutual funds group, has accepted a Dollars 67-a-share bid from smaller rival Conseco, in one of the biggest leveraged acquisitions of a US financial company. Kemper's decision had been expected after GE Capital last week dropped its Dollars 60-a-share bid. The Conseco offer values Kemper at Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.77bn) on a fully diluted basis, or Dollars 3.25bn including Kemper's preference stock. The bid from Conseco, a fast-growing insurance holding company, based in Carmel, Indiana, marks a return to financing techniques rarely seen since the late 1980s. The offer, Dollars 2.2bn of which is in cash, is backed by junk bond financing, Dollars 1.2bn of bank debt and a private buy-out fund run by Conseco. Morgan Stanley, Conseco's adviser, has issued a letter stating it is 'highly confident' it can raise Dollars 750m of bond finance. Such letters were the hallmark of Mr Michael Milken, who pioneered the use of sub-investment grade paper. All the main rating agencies are reviewing Conseco's debt with a view to downgrading it, a a move likely to put it in the non-investment grade category. Mr Jim Parrish, in charge of sub-investment grade ratings at Moody's, said the Conseco deal marked a return of junk bonds to back acquisitions. Until now, their re-emergence had been based on refinancings of 1980s deals or to raise money for companies which previously would have turned to banks. The Dollars 1.2bn commitment of finance from Citibank is the latest large-scale bank deal for an acquisition. In another echo of the 1980s, the bid for Kemper turns on a buy-out fund run by Conseco. Conseco Capital Partners II, with equity capital of Dollars 624m, will take over Kemper's insurance and property activities, leaving Conseco with the less capital-intensive, fee-generating parts. US buy-out funds were largely left on the sidelines last year as high stock market prices enabled quoted companies to use their paper to make acquisitions. Now they are returning. Forstmann Little, a buy-out specialist that has not mounted a deal since 1992, is involved in a battle for control of Western Union, a money transfer business. Its Dollars 650m offer would be backed entirely by the funds it runs, signalling the large resources available to the US buy-out industry.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this determination, Tribe is defined to mean any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community which is recognized by the Secretary of the Interior or Congress and which exercises substantial governmental duties and powers over any area. While the definition of Tribes in today's determination does not explicitly include Alaska Native Villages, EPA has not determined that such entities are ineligible to apply for permit program approval. Alaska Native entities (e.g., villages) may apply for permit program approval. Alaska Native Villages that demonstrate that their permit programs meet the requirements of today's proposal will be deemed adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF Criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe must also provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is further requesting Tribes to provide a statement of legal authority from the Tribal Attorney General or its equivalent demonstrating that the Tribe has adequate jurisdiction to regulate the MSWLFs on the reservation. In addition, EPA is requesting Tribes seeking program approval to demonstrate that it:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Is Federally recognized;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Has a government exercising substantial duties and powers; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Is capable of administering a permit program. If the Tribe has already demonstrated to EPA that it meets the first two of these Criteria in the context of the approval to operate another EPA program, it need not do so again. EPA is also requesting Tribes to provide an explanation of the jurisdiction and responsibilities of all Tribal program implementing agencies (including any State agency acting pursuant to an agreement with the Tribe) and designation of a lead agency to facilitate communications between EPA and the Tribe. If a Tribe has already provided information and/or a legal statement on the Tribe's jurisdiction and capability to operate another EPA program, EPA requests the Tribe to provide only those additional materials necessary to support its application for MSWLF permit program approval. These requests incorporate the Criteria used in other environmental statutes to assess whether Tribes may apply for program approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Regions will determine whether a Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 25 (AFP) -- Outgoing European  Commission president Jacques Delors on Saturday [25 June] ruled  out another term as the European Union's top civil servant.    Delors, whose third term ends on January 5, had been asked  by  Greece to stay on if the 12-nation European Union failed to  agree on a successor at their summit meeting here.    "I would have preferred for the four new members not to have  to witness the sorry sight of my successor's designation," said  Delors.    He said Europe was in a "serious" crisis.    Delors has headed the European Union's Executive Commission  since 1984.</p>

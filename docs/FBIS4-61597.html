			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy commander of Nagorno Karabakh's Defense Army  General Khristofor Ivanyan declared in his interview with  INTERFAX that "having refused to sign the cease-fire agreement  in Bishkek, which contains a mechanism preventing resumption of  hostilities, Azerbaijan has once more demonstrated its  unwillingness to solve the Karabakh conflict at the negotiation  table."    In his words, while supporting cease-fire in words, the  Azerbaijani side opposes introduction of disengagement forces  into the conflict zone "which are the real guarantor of  cease-fire observance."    Ivanyan pointed out that all previous agreements were  disrupted due to the fact that there was an opportunity to  violate the reached agreements and then to accuse the  confronting party of this.    Ivanyan also declared that the Azerbaijani party had used  the  previous truce periods only to win the time, to collect new  forces, and to try another offensive on the front. "Now, having  experienced a number of serious defeats and great losses in  personnel and military equipment, the Azerbaijani command is  looking for an opportunity for a respite in order to bring in  order their demoralized forces, which are tired of endless  attacks."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Lester Bird at the Organization </F> of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) meeting in St. Lucia on 26  May -- recorded]    [Text] Chief Minister of Montserrat, Prime Minister Compton  of St. Lucia, fellow ministers, members of our diplomatic corps,  distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: I wish to thank the  chief minister of Montserrat and the prime minister of St. Lucia  for the warm words expressed by both of you on my election to  the prime ministership of Antigua and Barbuda.    As many of you are aware, I have been attending conferences  of heads of government of the OECS [Organization of Eastern  Caribbean States] from its inception. Indeed, you accorded me  the distinct honor of allowing me to be its first chairman even  though I was not a prime minister. In that sense, I spent the  last 14 years in this council impersonating a head of  government. And many of you spent the last 14 years in  complicity. I am pleased that by electing to government the  party which I have the honor to lead, the people of Antigua and  Barbuda have chosen to relieve not only me of the role of  impersonator but you of the burden of collusion.    On a serious note, I place on record my profound thanks to  OECS heads of government past and present, who over the last 14  years, have treated me with such great consideration. Mr.  Chairman, it is fitting for me that the first OECS heads of  government conference I should attend as prime minister is held  in St. Lucia. For on this island and under your wise and mature  guidance, Mr. Chairman, our countries have together made many  practical decisions which have advanced the economic and  political interests of our subregion. Therefore, while coming to  St. Lucia for the first time as prime minister is for me a  beginning, it is also a continuum for the beginning benefits  from a solid foundation of experience gained in the council.    Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, more than anyone else I  am conscious that in recent years Antigua and Barbuda appears to  have stepped back from the regional movement. We appear to be  standing apart, indifferent of the faith and fortunes of our  regional kith and kin. This is not so. In this case,  appearance belies reality. The vast majority of the people of  Antigua and Barbuda continue to regard the Commonwealth  Caribbean and the OECS, especially, as an extension of  themselves. They are keenly aware that ultimately their  authenticity as a culture group, their survival as an economic  entity, and their political legitimacy in a world which  increasingly marginalizes small and powerless states lies in  concerted economic and political action with the Caribbean  family and more particularly their West Indian brothers and  sisters.    Over the last few years, Antigua and Barbuda has been  preoccupied with its internal political affairs. Our  preoccupation flowed from the fact that after more than 50 years  in which he dominated political life in our country, Vere  Cornwall Bird, Sr. was departing the national stage.    As you are aware, any change creates insecurity and  uncertainty. When the change in power replaces a leader who over  five decades symbolized dependability and safety to the nation,  even greater apprehension arises. In such a milieu, as people  search for something to fill the void, opportunities are created  for the untried and the untested in whose hands neither Antigua  and Barbuda's affairs nor the influence of such affairs upon  neighboring territories could be certain.    Mr. Chairman, it is as well that in Antigua and Barbuda we  took the time to settle our internal affairs for we have emerged  from it a stronger and more stable democracy. While the  campaigning was intense, our elections were conducted without  violence or loss of life. The decision of the people was  accepted peacefully by our two political parties, both of which  are represented in parliament. We have now set to the task of  governance through established democratic institutions,  including a virulent if sometimes unnecessarily vicious,  unfettered opposition press, enhancing, as it does, the space  for free political expression and action. Such a democracy is  good for the maintenance of stability in Antigua and Barbuda.  It can only be beneficial to the security of the region as a  whole and, particularly, to the member-states of this  organization.    Mr. Chairman, our preoccupation with our internal political  affairs led only to a lowering of regional concern on our  national agenda, not to its removal. That decisive period in  our nation's history is now behind us and we can again lift our  eyes above the plane of national full contributions to the  strengthening of our institutions. [sentence as heard]    We will play our part on the international stage to augment  the bargaining strength of the OECS against third countries and  groups of countries.    As we survey the global landscape, it appears beset with  difficulties for our small island-states. An objective analysis  paints a worryisome picture. The Caricom [Caribbean Common  Market] area faces higher prices for goods and services imported  from North America and Europe. Dwindling aid, increasing  international rivalry for private capital, both loans and  investments, is reducing shares of our two principal markets in  Europe and North America and intensifying competition for  tourism. It is becoming increasingly clear that the  preferential market which our countries and others in the  Caribbean community have enjoyed in the EC will, in fact,  disappear. Already, trade preferences have increased, the share  of Central American exports to the EC to approximately the same  level as Caribbean exports. And recent developments arising  from the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade signal that bananas and sugar from the so-called (?dollar)  countries, particularly Central America and Spanish-speaking  Caribbean states, will enjoy an even bigger share of the EC  market. Banana growers in our part of the Caribbean will not be  competing on a level playing field. The absence of strict labor  laws and, therefore, poor wages paid to Central American  workers, combined with the resources of the U.S. companies which  own many plantations and market the bananas, place eastern  Caribbean countries at a severe disadvantage.    I need hardly tell this audience that any significant loss  of  the banana market in the EC by the Windward Islands will have a  most distressing effect on the foreign exchange earnings of the  eastern Caribbean dollar (?area) and on our (?reserves). In  turn, this will adversely affect our ability to pay for the  import of goods and services. The combined effect of less  foreign exchange and a contraction of the import sector would  lead to a consequential reduction in public sector programs and  to unemployment. In short, economic decline could stare us in  the face.    NAFTA offers no more promising an outlook for trade.  Mexico's involvement in the free trade area with the United  States and Canada threatens to adversely effect Caribbean  exports to the U.S. and Canada, especially the assembly  industry, textiles, and the apparel industry. The limited  access provided to the U.S. market by the Caribbean Basin  Initiative [CBI] and to Canada by the Caricom agreement pales  into insignificance when compared with the access Mexico will  enjoy on the NAFTA. When Mexico's comparatively lower labor  costs and its proximity to the U.S. market is factored into the  equation, the Caribbean will obviously lose market share. By  the same token, hurrying into NAFTA as it stands is not  desirable in our opinion. Free trade groups from NAFTA would  cripple, if not kill, many of our industrial enterprises, whose  production could not match their cheaper prices.    In this connection, we must renew our efforts to seek parity  with Mexico for Caribbean goods that now enter the U.S. market  under the CBI while we negotiate ways to enter NAFTA with agreed  mechanisms to relieve the effects of reciprocal free trade with  three giants such as the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.    Mr. Chairman, we, together with other Caribbean Basin  countries, are not without some collective bargaining strength  in relation to NAFTA. CBI beneficiary countries have increased  their spending in the United States. Purchases of U.S. goods  and services grew from $340 million in 1986 to $11 billion in  1992, providing for 200,000 direct jobs and 1 million indirect  jobs in the United States. And with many of our countries, the  U.S. enjoys a balance of trade surplus. But we, in the OECS and  the wider Caricom, have to forge strategic coalitions or  alliances with other countries or groups of countries to promote  our interests. In this context, an alliance with other  Caribbean Basin countries is imperative. For without such an  alliance, large groupings such as NAFTA and the EC, faced with  contending interests from Central American countries, on the one  hand, and Caricom countries, on the other, may find it very  difficult to be evenhanded in their treatment. We may well be  the losers.    Further, to the extent that Caricom countries could agree a  joint position with Central American countries and the Dominican  Republic for negotiations with NAFTA and the EC, to that extent  we can expect no collective bargaining position. The decision  by Caricom heads of government to adopt the recommendation of  the West Indian commission and create an association of  Caribbean states is extremely important. However, we should  guard against the possibility of such an association  unintentionally becoming the servant of its most powerful  masters and accidentally neglecting the interests of its smaller  and weaker members, which is what Caricom states would be. It  is essential that the association reflects the consensus and  interests of its membership and that it be dominated by no one  country or group of countries, that it mediate contending views  between different groups, and that it construct a relationship  among its members that serves the community of interests.    In this regard, Mr. Chairman, I repeat a position which I  (?enunciated) last month in Basse-Terre, when in the presence of  our colleague, the prime of St. Kitts, I spoke at the 12th  annual banquet of the St. Kitts and Nevis private sector. I  said then...[pauses] And I strongly favor the location of the  headquarters of the association of Caribbean states in Jamaica,  which sits almost geographically between the English- and  Spanish-speaking Caribbean Basin countries. After all, it was to  Jamaica that the great father of Latin American liberation,  Simon Bolivar, retreated after his earlier failure to liberate  Venezuela from Spanish domination. It was from there that he  issued his famous Jamaica Letter, which set a successful plan  for the independence of so many Latin American states, including  Bolivia, named after him.    Both historically and geographically, Jamaica lends itself  as  a hospitable location for the headquarters of the association.  I hope that in this meeting, we, in the OECS, would endorse  this suggestion, that Jamaica should be the location of the  headquarters and that we could jointly advance the idea in the  councils of Caricom and the wider Caribbean Basin area.    Another element in our approach to the issue of NAFTA should  be the special relationship that Caricom countries have always  enjoyed with Canada. As the West Indian commission pointed out  in its report, and I quote, together, we are the Commonwealth  countries of the hemisphere; that shared history has forged  strong ties over the years and provides a natural bond; there is  every reason why we should seek to engage the Canadian  Government at the highest level in working out our arrangements.    To me, to Antigua and Barbuda, it is a significant  indication  of Canada's continuing goodwill to the Caribbean that last month  the Canadian International Development Agency agreed to finance  a Caricom study on the likely effects of NAFTA and the strategy  options for the community. A Canada-Caricom-heads-of-government  conference would be beneficial to this process at this time.  Perhaps we in the OECS can take the initiative in trying to  structure such a meeting at the earliest opportunity.    What about the United States, itself? We have to be  cognizant of how Washington works. It is a city of lobbying,  whether we like it or not. We will get little movement beyond  what the U.S. Government thinks it can sell to Congress unless  we help to accelerate that movement ourselves. And to do so, we  have to mount a lobby in Washington that includes but does not  rely solely on our embassies there. Contact has to be made with  every congressman and senator. That could make a difference to  how we are treated in NAFTA. We have to inform them, educate  them, and win them over, if not all, the majority. Jamaica has  had lobbyists in Washington for some time. The Cheddi Jagan  government, in Guyana, has had lobbyists since it won the  election in 1992. And, significantly, Trinidad and Tobago has  announced that it too has employed a firm of lobbyists. We, in  the OECS countries, should do no less if we expect to be heard  by the ears of Washington.    With regard to the EC, Mr. Chairman, in the past, we tended  to focus our efforts in Britain, neglecting the reality that  many powers over trade and policy have passed to the EC and its  executive agency, the European Commission, in Brussels. Lastly,  there has been an attempt to strengthen our presence in  Brussels, but it needs to be more permanent and in greater  numbers. Our collective voting and lobbying strength is  important. But to be able to utilize such voting and lobbying  strength in Brussels, we require a prominent presence, working  in a coordinated way.    I know that we have all agreed to have Mr. (Larocque)  represent us. I would like, however, in the course of this  meeting to suggest that we have to deal with the question of our  voting rights, as to whether or not we will vote as one or we  will vote with the full impact of our several votes.  Increasingly, too, lobbying efforts have become as important in  Brussels as the European Commission evolves into a labyrinth of  discreet decisionmaking departments. It may serve the OECS well  to consider retaining well-placed lobbying experts and, on a  joint basis, to supplement the work of closely coordinated  missions.    Mr. Chairman, as we survey our regional scene, it is  striking  that Haiti stands out as the country in dire need of attention.  Its attempt to establish a democratic system of government  after two centuries was aborted by a military coup, supported by  a financial elite opposed to economic and political reform. As  countries committed to democracy, free and fair elections, and  the unfettered expression of the will of the people, it is  axiomatic that we find government and military force  reprehensible. The weekly slaughter of hundreds of Haitians by  agents of the military regime and the suffering of the vast  majority of the dispossessed in this society are matters which  cause us, as Caribbean people, even greater concern. That there  is need for action to remedy the Haitian situation is beyond  question. However, as small Caribbean states, we should view  with some apprehension any suggestion of military intervention  unless such intervention were under the auspices of the United  Nations and with the authority of the Security Council. As it  stands, I would advised the established principle justifying  (?new) intervention under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter a threat  to peace does not appear at this moment to apply in the case,  which creates a difficulty for us. [sentence as heard]    Mr. Chairman, the weekly reports of (?massive) rapes and  mutilations and the continuous reports now that the current  voluntary embargo is causing the suffering only for the poor,  while the Army and its rich financial backers continue to enjoy  a good life. Good conscience demands that to use our concerted  efforts to call for a realistic remedy to this situation by the  United Nations.    I hope at this meeting we can agree to make such a call and  advance it in Caricom, the OAS, and the United Nations for the  benefit of the Haitian people. It only remains for me to say,  Mr. Chairman, on behalf of those of us who are privileged to be  guests in St. Lucia, what a great pleasure it is to be here.  St. Lucians are reputed to be generous by nature and charming  by inclination. I have no doubt that before this visit has  ended, many here will have found reason to support my testimony.  In advance and in anticipation, Mr. Chairman, I thank you, the  Government and the people of St. Lucia, for the hospitable  environment which we all know we will enjoy. Thank you, very  much for being patient with me. [applause]</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A UK lead in Europe LESS THAN 18 months ago Britain was the perennial spoiler of plans hatched in Brussels and processed through the institutions of the European Community. Now it is well placed to be among the first to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Its economic policy is being shaped to ensure that in the medium term it meets the convergence criteria set forth in that document. The government remains determined to bring about the completion of the single market. It looks forward with enthusiasm to the enlargement of the EC. It wants to introduce budgetary discipline into community affairs and will try again to make sense of the agricultural policy. In sum, the United Kingdom seeks to be more than a good European; its aim is to be a leader of Europe. This is a reversal of postwar history, during which Britain has held back from, or opposed, every development proposed by France and Germany, starting with the coal and steel community. Now it is well placed to be the proposer itself, either with the two leading mainland powers, or in concert with other members. A British government has at last accepted that it is part of the European entity. This is the most striking inference to be drawn from the Queen's address to parliament yesterday. Mr John Major became prime minister in November 1990 as a result of the downfall of Mrs Margaret Thatcher; her political demise was brought about in large part by divisions among Conservatives over European policy. Those divisions persist, but Mr Major has done much to blunt the force of both the irreconcilable anti-Europeans (now reduced to a rump) and the romantic Eurofederalists. He has united most of his party around a centrist position defended with skill at Maastricht. Fundamental decisions The result was an agreement that recognises that the EC is a congeries of states, whose fundamental decisions are made in a continuing series of negotiations between its member governments. This concept has been eroded with the extension of majority voting, but the essence remains. Defence and security are not even within the EC structure. Britain stands alone in its refusal to sign the social chapter and its insistence on an opt-out clause on the single currency, but the community is learning to live with some of the idiosyncrasies of its most powerful offshore member. This general position will inform Mr Major's conduct of his government's presidency of the EC, which begins in July. To judge by his style in exploiting similar opportunities in the G7 and the security council last year, the prime minister will make the most of it. He will be helped by both pomp and circumstance. The Queen will visit the Council of Europe and address the parliament in Strasbourg next week - the first such royal visit. She will also make a state visit to France in June, and Germany in October; the European Council will meet at her palace in Edinburgh in December. Domestic discomfiture As to circumstance, the domestic discomfiture of the French president and the German chancellor, not to mention the disarray of the Italian government, weakens if only temporarily the influence of those countries. Britain is for the moment the only large European power with a stable government and sufficient energy to shape the next phase of the EC's development. The moment may, however, be short-lived. There is an apparent contradiction between the government's enthusiasm for enlargement of the community and its distaste, expressed by the foreign secretary in a speech last week, for any further structural negotiations before the agreed date of 1996. There may be only three new members by then, but that would make an already complicated structure even more unwieldy. The president of the commission, Mr Jacques Delors, will shortly circulate proposals designed to streamline the decision-making machinery before new members join the existing 12. These are likely to strengthen the commission and the parliament, probably at the expense of the intergovernmental committees that at present hold most of the reins of power. If Mr Major wants to lead opinion, and to retain the spirit of a Europe des patries, he had better come up with some proposals of his own.</p>

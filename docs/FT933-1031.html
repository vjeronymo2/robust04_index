			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Markets: Traders enjoy a storm in a tea cup - Wall Street WHEN the White House is surrounded by angry crowds denouncing the country's political leadership and urging military intervention to oust the President, and the vice-President has rushed to claim supreme state authority, it is not surprising that Wall Street panics. Sounds like the plot for Tom Clancy's latest book? Not so fast. This actually happened this week. On Tuesday, share prices plunged as the first reports came in of the turmoil engulfing the White House. At one point mid-afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down almost 70 points, and the 'circuit breakers' on the New York Stock Exchange were triggered in an attempt to halt the slide. Although prices eventually recovered to end the day down only 38 points, the stock markets had received a nasty jolt. The jolt would have been much nastier, of course, if the White House at the centre of the political crisis had been the one at the end of Pennsylvania Avenue, and the president facing hostile crowds and a possible coup had been a former governor of Arkansas with a weakness for Big Macs. No, But this was the other White House, the one 4,683 miles away, also known as the Russian parliament in Moscow. And it was the other president, the one with a weakness for dissolving parliaments and fighting political crises. Wednesday's front page news told the full story: of how Boris Yeltsin shut down parliament and called new elections for December; of how opponents denounced his actions as a state-sanctioned coup d'etat, and claimed political power for themselves; and of how stock market investors in the US, fearing a civil war, or the very least an end to liberalisation in Russia, started selling shares in a frenzied hurry. There was nothing unusual in that. There is a long history of stock market panics prompted by dramatic news events from abroad: the Saudi Arabian oil embargo of October 1973; the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990; the coup attempt against former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991. Yet, explaining why investors rush for the exits at the first word of turmoil overseas is not always easy. The Saudi oil embargo and the Kuwait invasion shocked the markets for a good reason - they feared (as it turned out, correctly in 1973) that the events would trigger a sharp rise in oil prices and a worldwide economic recession. The attempted coup against Gorbachev was also an earth-shaker - the return of hardline communists and a revival in the cold war was a distinct possibility if the military had taken power that summer. This week's reaction from Wall Street, however, is harder to fathom. It is not as if the events in Russia on Tuesday plunged the country from order into chaos. Russian political life has been pretty chaotic for some time, and it could be argued that Yetsin's bold move in calling for elections to a new assembly will, if it works (a big if), help restore order in Russia. Anyone selling stocks on Tuesday, however, obviously felt that Yeltsin's gamble was not going to pay off. Yet even if Yeltsin was ousted, it is not likely that the events that followed have had much of an impact outside of Russia. The UK broking house James Capel probably got it right this week when it rushed out a quick analysis of the crisis entitled: 'The Russian Situation - A Storm in a Tea Cup?' Capel argued that the problems in Russia were internal to that country, and that the fallout for the rest of the world would probably be limited. Assuming civil war was not going to break out as a result of Yeltsin's actions, even the bleakest scenario - the old communists take control of government via parliament and slow future economic and political reforms - should not have unduly worried US investors, said Capel. The pace and extent of Russian political and economic reform for years has been patchy at best, and markets have long since discounted this fact. So why did the markets panic on Tuesday afternoon? The answer is quite simple. The turmoil in Russia was an excuse, not a reason, for traders and investors to sell stocks. Under cover of a 'grave' world crisis, they were able to take a few of the profits they earned during this summer's strong rally. If the Russian-inspired sell-off is added to the losses of the days before the crisis and after it, the Dow has fallen almost exactly 100 points, or 2.7 per cent, over the past week. By allowing investors to let off steam from an overheated market, Yeltsin may have done Wall Street a favour.  -------------------------------------------- Monday         3575.80     -      37.45 Tuesday        3537.24     -      38.56 Wednesday      3547.02     +       9.78 Thursday       3539.75     -       7.27 Friday         3543.11     +       3.36  --------------------------------------------</p>

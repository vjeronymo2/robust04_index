			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Rantong [3769 3544 1749], NEIMENGGU RIBAO reporter, </F> and Niu Yaming [3662 0068 5407], Inner Mongolia People's  Broadcasting Station reporter: "Keep the Whole Situation in  Mind, Deepen the Reform, Promote Development, and Ensure  Stability"]    [Text] Wang Qun, leader of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous  Regional delegation to the Second Session of the Eighth National  People's Congress, secretary of the autonomous regional party  committee, and chairman of the autonomous regional people's  congress standing committee, voiced his opinions at the group  discussion on the "government work report" given by Premier Li  Peng on the afternoon of 11 March, in which he stressed that in  achieving development we should have new ideas. Various work  undertaken by the autonomous region should be carried out in  line with the principle of abiding by or serving the whole  situation in the work of the entire party and of the country as  a whole. Efforts should be made to deal earnestly and  successfully with the relationship among reform, development,  and stability; to maintain mutual harmony and promotion among  reform, development, and stability; and to strive to win a new  victory in socialist modernizations.    Wang Qun said: The "government work report" given by Premier  Li Peng has summarized in line with the principle of seeking  truth from facts the important and major achievements scored by  China over the past year in conducting reform, opening up, and  modernizations and clearly defined the major tasks for  conducting reform and construction this year. In view of the  party's line, principles, policies, and measures, the government  work report has fully reflected the spirit of the 14th CPC  Congress and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee and totally conformed with China's reality  in socialist modernizations. I very much agree with the report.  It is a good report of enhancing the national vigor and  heartening the public feeling because it has revealed the heroic  spirit of Chinese Nation in being not afraid of power.    Wang Qun said: In his "government work report," Premier Li  Peng said: "Tasks stressed by the CPC Central Committee with  regard to seizing the opportunity, deepening the reform,  broadening the opening up, promoting the development, and  maintaining the stability represent the whole situation  prevailing in the work of the entire party and the country as a  whole." In achieving development and making progress, Inner  Mongolia Autonomous Region should have the whole situation in  mind; closely follow the situation; and abide by and serve the  situation. The region's work in various fields, as well as  cadres and people of various nationalities, should also abide by  and serve the whole situation and so should various localities  and departments throughout the region, which should turn the  practice of abiding by and serving the whole situation into the  conscious action of the broad masses of cadres and people.    Wang Qun pointed out: To achieve development in the region  in line with the whole situation, it is imperative to follow the  content stressed by Premier Li Peng in his "government work  report" with regard to dealing successfully and earnestly with  the relationship among reform, development, and stability.  Economic construction represents a center of work in various  fields, as well as reform and opening up represent the  motivating force of development. Development and reform  represent a basis for maintaining social stability and having  China enjoy long-term order and peace. Maintaining social  stability represents an inevitable condition for developing the  economy and smoothly conducting reform. If we fail to  concentrate on further deepening the reform and broadening the  opening up, the region's program of accelerating development  will become empty talk. Without social stability there will be  no development. Units from top to bottom across the region, as  well as various industries and trades, should realistically and  fruitfully do a good job in further conducting reform and  broadening the opening up to enable the region's undertakings of  four modernizations to achieve faster development and to promote  the country's to become more prosperous. They must maintain the  mutual harmony and promotion among reform, development, and  stability and continuously score new achievements in socialist  modernizations.    Comrade Wang Qun stressed: In achieving development in the  region, we should have new ideas. The paragraph of General  Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech quoted by Premier Li Peng in his  "government work report" has an important and guiding  significance on the region's work. New ideas for the region to  achieve development are as follows: It is imperative to truly  orient the region's work onto a track with a center of  increasing economic results and not to follow the old way of  blindly seeking output value and growth and broadening the scale  of investments. It is necessary to proceed from the region's  reality in doing everything and to truly orient the economic  development onto a track of depending on scientific and  technological progress and upgrading the quality of labor  forces, particularly onto a track of readjusting the production  structure and products' mix, improving products' quality, and  increasing economic results. What is important is to seek  progress in upgrading the managerial and technical standards and  improving the quality. Only such progress can be essential.    Wang Qun pointed out: We should further understand the  region's strong and weak points under the conditions of the  socialist market economy. Accelerating the establishment of  socialist market economic systems will bring about an important  opportunity for the region to accelerate its development. The  region is endowed with vast territory and abundant resources and  its population is small. In particular, the region's potential  in agriculture, animal husbandry, township enterprises, and the  industrial development of energy resources and raw materials, is  very large and its prospect is vast. The state has put the  supporting and promoting of economic development to minority  regions into the program of macroeconomic readjustment and  control and will give more supports in investment and policies  to these regions. All of these are superior and favorable  conditions for the region to develop its economy. Only by  seizing opportunity, deepening the reform, broadening the  opening up, and bringing the region's superiority into full  play, are we able to achieve faster development.    Wang Qun pointed out: In view of the autonomous region in  developing the economy, it is particularly necessary to break  away the out-dated concepts and fetters accumulated under the  systems of planned economy and to foster the new concept and  ideas of socialist market economy. Efforts should be made to  foster the sense of information, markets, opening up, economic  results, competition, and legal systems, which are suitable to  the market economy. It is also necessary to conduct work in a  creative way in understanding and grasping the objective laws of  market economy, which include the law of value, supply and  demand, and competition.    Comrade Wang Qun said: In his "government work report",  Premier Li Peng expounded in an overall way the great  achievements scored by the country over the past year and  accurately analyzed the country's contradictions, difficulties,  and problems cropping up in the economic operation. However,  these problems are predicted to crop up along the advancing  road. In reading the government work report, we have felt that  the determination of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council to deepen the reform and to push forward the  establishment of socialist market economic systems is  unswerving. They have clearly pointed out difficulties and  problems that will crop up along the advancing road and urged  the entire party to pay great attention to them, to earnestly do  a good job in dealing with various contradictions and problems  in a timely manner, and to maintain the unity and stability to  ensure the smooth progress in conducting reform and building  socialism.    Wang Qun stressed: In his "government work report" Premier  Li Peng stressed that we should take a two-handed approach and  be tough with both hands and uphold the principle of building  the two civilizations simultaneously. Meanwhile, we should  upgrade to an important position the work of enhancing the  nationalities' unity and accelerating the development of  minority regions. All of these have given great support to the  border minority regions and fully indicated that the party and  state are showing concern and supporting the development and  mutual prosperity of border minority regions. Under the correct  leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin  at the core, we should further make efforts to wage struggle;  safeguard the unification of the motherland and the great unity  fostered by various nationalities; and build Inner Mongolia into  a prosperous, civilized, rich, strong, and socialist border  region.</p>

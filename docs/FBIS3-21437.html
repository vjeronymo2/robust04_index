An agreement was signed on the occasion between the three  joint venture partners promoting the park: Ratan N. Tata,  chairman, Tata Industries Ltd; Albert Hong, chairman,  Information Technology Park Investment Pvt Ltd (ITPI),  Singapore; and M.C. Satyawadi, chairman, Karnataka Industrial  Areas Development Board (KIADB). The investment of the three  partners will be in the ratio of 40, 40 and 20 per cent  respectively.    Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister Goh felt Bangalore  would soon attract a large number of persons from the region,  with an increasing number coming from Singapore itself.    However, the resulting boom would cause congestion and  Bangalore would soon find itself tackling a problem similar to  the one Singapore has been grappling with for a long time--that  of balancing growth in a limited area with environmental  protection. Though Bangalore's leaders had shown vision in  demarcating a green belt, the problem of restructuring to meet  the influx could be tackled with expertise from Singapore, Goh  said.    Karnataka Chief Minister M. Veerappa Moily noted that the  park will represent Singapore's single largest investment in  India to date.    He said the park had been conceived and set in motion in the  quickest possible time, and this will be the state government's  attitude to future projects proposed by industrialists.    Singapore's Economic Development Board Chairman Philip Yeo  agreed. "The launch is testimony to the initiative taken by the  Government of Karnataka," he said.    Ratan Tata said the park would hopefully attract companies  to  India for high-tech activities by providing an environment equal  to or better than the best abroad. Others who spoke on the  occasion included Karnataka Governor Khurshed Alam Khan and  Union Railway Minister C.K. Jaffer Sharief.</p>

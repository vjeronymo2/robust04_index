			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nursultan Nazarbayev Suggests </F> Creating Eurasian Union Out of CIS States"]    [Text] Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev has put  forward a proposal to create a completely new association out of  the CIS countries and call it the Eurasian Union. If this idea  does not meet with extensive support within the CIS, Russia and  Kazakhstan could form this union, he said during a meeting with  Moscow State University teaching staff and students during his  official visit to Russia.    The Eurasian Union must be based, according to Nursultan  Nazarbayev, on totally different principles from the CIS. They  must be founded on the formation of national bodies with a view  to coordinating economic, defense, and foreign policy. A  Council of Eurasian Union Heads of State and Government must be  set up to discuss strategic issues. The next step would be  direct elections to a common parliament to coordinate the  legislative activity of countries within the Eurasian Union.  The creation of a real military complex necessitates the  founding of a council of defense ministers, while the  coordination of actions in the world arena necessitates the  formation of a council of foreign ministers. A standing  interstate executive secretariat must also be created for the  Eurasian Union, whose membership would be appointed by the heads  of state, comprising representatives of all the union's  countries. This executive committee should have observer status  at the United Nations and the CSCE.    According to Nursultan Nazarbayev, the creation of a  Eurasian  Union entails the introduction of a common identity card or  citizenship for all countries in the union, mandatory  formulation of coordinated economic reform programs, and the  adoption of a supranational currency.    The Kazakhstani president went on to develop his idea by  drawing attention to the need for a single information office  for the executive secretariat. "Information must not be  unfriendly; an agreement must be signed within the Eurasian  Union to this effect," he stressed. A council for education,  culture, and science must also be set up in order to shape a  coordinated educational policy and defend and implement the  rights of national minorities.    Membership of the Eurasian Union, Nursultan Nazarbayev  continued, should not hamper bilateral relations with third  countries. The union's basic principle is "equality, respect  for the sovereignty and independence of states, the rights of  the individual, and the individuality of every state." Everyone  who shares these principles can be members of the Eurasian  Union, the Kazakhstani leader said.    Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized that there is no question in  this case of reviving the old Soviet Union and forming an  empire. There is no need to be afraid of the word "union," he  said; there is after all the European Union, for instance. "We  are all equal and my current visit to Russia marks recognition  of that equality," the president indicated.    Today the Kazakhstani president laid a wreath at the Tomb of  the Unknown Soldier at the Kremlin Wall.</p>

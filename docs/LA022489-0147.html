			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 3-A GIRLS;  </P> <P> ATASCADERO TOPS LA QUINTA AFTER JALEWALIA FOULS OUT  </P> <P> La Quinta High School's Amy Jalewalia fouled out of the game with 2 minutes  remaining, and Atascadero pulled away for a 70-60 victory in a Southern Section  3-A girls' basketball game Thursday at La Quinta.  </P> <P> "When she went out it was ours," Atascadero Coach Jim Stecher said.  </P> <P> Atascadero will play Palm Desert on Saturday.  </P> <P> "It should have been ours earlier, but we didn't take advantage of it," Stecher  said. "When she sat down with four (fouls with 3:34 left in the third quarter),  we should have made a run. We should have been up by eight."  </P> <P> Instead, La Quinta (23-4) pressed to force turnovers and was only down by three  at the end of the third quarter.  </P> <P> But Atascadero (19-5) scored four consecutive points to open the final quarter  and had difficulty even getting a good shot, which prompted La Quinta Coach  Kevin Kiernan to put in Jalewalia with 7 minutes remaining.  </P> <P> Jalewalia, who was called for three fouls in a 50-second span early in the  third quarter, played tentatively in her first few minutes upon returning to  avoid getting a fifth foul.  </P> <P> But she led a run with her rebounding and defense that brought La Quinta to a  59-56 margin with 3 minutes left.  </P> <P> Jalewalia was called for her fifth foul a minute later with Atascadero leading,  62-58. She had 21 points. Atascadero pulled away with strong guard play.  </P> <P> "Our weakness was guards, we knew that all year," Kiernan said. "We don't have  any seniors or a true point guard, what we have is a point-center (in  Jalewalia)."  </P> <P> La Quinta was also without All-Garden Grove League guard Tanya Krill, who  missed the game with the chicken pox.  </P> <P> Jalewalia's 21 points led La Quinta, with Heather Brennan scoring 19.  </P></p>

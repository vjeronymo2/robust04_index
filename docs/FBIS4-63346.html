			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 21 May. (ITAR-TASS) -- The Press and  Information Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry today  distributed the following report:    "On 20 May Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko sent  the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev a letter informing  him of the decision adopted by Crimea's Supreme Soviet to  restore the constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May  1992, which he believes could pose a threat to Ukraine's  internal political stability and cause tension in relations  between Russia and Ukraine.    "The letter underlines that, in the event of a further  escalation of the situation, Ukraine retains the right to take  all necessary measures to safeguard unconditionally the state's  territorial integrity, in accordance with its Constitution and  law and in observance of the norms of international law.    "In a reply message, Kozyrev says that the possibility of  tension arising in Russian-Ukrainian relations because of Crimea  cannot but cause concern and he agrees that international legal  principles should be observed everywhere. But no less important  is respect for the sovereign will of the peoples, restraint, and  the need to exclude the use of force. All the problems arising  between Ukraine and the sovereign republic of Crimea -- as part  of Ukraine -- should be settled exclusively by political means.    "The situation in Crimea confirms once again the need for  settling as soon as possible the questions of the Black Sea  Fleet, proceeding from the accords between the presidents of  both countries. Russia is ready for this, the letter from  A.V.Kozyrev says in conclusion."</p>

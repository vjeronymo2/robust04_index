			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte in the </F> Cape Town studio by SABC announcer John Bishop in the  Johannesburg studio on the "Agenda" program--live]    [Text] [Bishop] We are going across to talk to Mr. Danie  Schutte about the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] agreeing to  register provisionally. Good evening, Mr. Schutte. Thanks for  coming on. It's been quite a business this evening, in this  program.    [Schutte] Good evening, Mr. Bishop.    [Bishop] First of all, what can you tell us -- what can you  add, indeed, to what our political correspondent has said and  what's been carried in the news?    [Schutte] Well, I think the first thing that I would like to  say is that I am cautious. There are a number of conditions  that have been set. Of course if something happens, if it  really is true, then it is very good news because the fact will  be that then we will be able to say that the leaders  representing 90 percent of our population will in fact have  indicated participation in this election and then one can say  that this is an inclusive election -- that what we've aspired to  in the last few years, that would be very good news but I think  -- of course, I think the other thing that one must say is that  it is a good indication that the IFP is at least considering  participation.    [Bishop] Would you say though that two leading figures like  Mr. Mandela and Dr. Buthelezi would come together, look so much  at ease and yet it not really being on -- that there's still a  chance everything might be off?    [Schutte] Well the news is very fresh to me, and I can only  look at the spoken word. And if one looks at the spoken word,  there is still a lot of conditions put to it, but what I can say  is that there has been a lot of work put into trying and finding  an accommodation in the last few days and hours and there is an  indication that that will not be in vain.    [Bishop] What price the Freedom Alliance? How are you  reading that?    [Schutte] Well that is not indicated. Also, the other aspect  of the international mediation. The fact is that the election  must go forward. The election must go forward on 27 April and  to make that possible there are a number of restrictive dates,  the one is 4 March. Parties who want to participate will have  to register by 4 March and to enable them to finally be part of  the election process they will have to submit their candidates'  list by 9 March. That is the final date.    [Bishop] Mediation -- what's the relevance there? Mention of  an overseas mediator, indeed.    [Schutte] Well, that is not clear to me at this stage  because  if that is to be...if that is to happen before any of the  parties -- well before the IFP decides to really get involved,  that will have to occur very, very soon.    [Bishop] Mr. Schutte how close were the Nationalist Party to  the ANC [African National Congress] on this approach to Dr.  Buthelezi?    [Schutte] We took it on ourselves to make a number of  approaches, to make a number of proposals to him with a view to  getting his participation. The moment that we could get that I  am sure that we could have also persuaded the ANC to accept many  of the proposals. That was our game plan.    [Bishop] Can you tell us if certain offers were made to  persuade Dr. Buthelezi and the IFP to agree to provisionally  come on board?    [Schutte] Well, of course we indicated also that a great  many  of their preconditions have been met, and are now being met in  parliament, so I believe that that was also...that also played a  major role.    [Bishop] Nothing further and more tempting perhaps?    [Schutte] I don't want to take the matter any further at  this  stage. I think it's far too late. The fact is that tomorrow is  the last day of parliament and we would have to have some  more...some clear indication at this stage to take the matter  any further. I just cannot see at this stage, at this very late  stage, that amendments can be made.    [Bishop] Well, thank you so much for coming on and helping  us  with this, the big breaking news story of the evening.    [Schutte] Thank you.</p>

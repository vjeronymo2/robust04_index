			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY FAVORITE PRODUCTS VANISH FROM STORE SHELVES;  </P> <P> MARKETING: THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY PRODUCTS DISAPPEAR -- RANGING FROM LOW  SHOPPER ACCEPTANCE TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, FROM NEW TECHNOLOGY TO  CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS.  </P> <P> Abracadabra, poof! Now you see it, now you don't.  </P> <P> Almost as fast as magic, products come and go at the supermarket. It seems like  a simple fact of shopping: Grow attached to a product and before long, it will  vanish from the shelves.  </P> <P> Take the case of Marjorie Levine. The Laurel, Md., special-education teacher  discovered Ocean Spray's new carbonated fruit drink, "Splash," last March and  instantly became one of its loyal buyers.  </P> <P> Two months later she noticed it was on sale -- a clearance sale, she ultimately  learned. In June, she no longer could find it on her supermarket's shelves.  </P> <P> "I was annoyed. I kept going to various grocery stores to see if they carried  it. I couldn't believe such a great product had disappeared," she says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Reasons  </P> <P> There are a host of reasons why products become extinct -- ranging from low  shopper acceptance to changing consumer tastes to new technology. Even the  recent rash of corporate acquisitions has led to the demise of many popular  products.  </P> <P> And frequently, as was the case with Splash, the product is merely a test to  see how consumers respond. Introduced and tested, the product may never see  daylight again.  </P> <P> Splash was introduced in the spring of 1988 in five cities around the country,  only to be pulled a year later "to rework the flavors," says John Lawlor, Ocean  Spray Cranberries Inc.'s manager of public relations.  </P> <P> "The concept was well accepted, but consumers said the flavor combinations --  particularly the 'Peach 'N Passion' -- were not what they associated with Ocean  Spray." The company is planning to reintroduce a new version of Splash early  next year -- with more cranberry blends, of course.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In Record Numbers  </P> <P> Whatever the cause, marketing experts say items both old and new are being  pulled off the shelves in record numbers.  </P> <P> "Products are coming and going from the supermarket much more rapidly than they  did five years ago," says Marlene Johnson, manager of product communication for  Pillsbury Co.  </P> <P> The reason lies largely in the number of new products -- more than 10,000 --  that are introduced annually. "In this day and age, with the physical  constraints of shelf space, one item goes out for every item that goes in,"  says supermarket consultant Willard Bishop.  </P> <P> "Generally, if it doesn't sell," it goes, says David Hackney, public relations  manager for Campbell Soup Co.  </P> <P> Campbell recently dropped its gazpacho condensed soup because of low sales.  Campbell thought the soup, which was introduced five years ago, would "lend  itself well to the growing interest in Mexican and Spanish food," Hackney  explains. "But not enough people were buying it; people had a perception  problem" with eating gazpacho that came in a can.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Distribution Problems Too  </P> <P> It was a distribution problem, however, that led to Campbell's decision two  years ago to halt production of its Fresh Chef line of refrigerated sauces,  salads and soups.  </P> <P> Campbell shipped Fresh Chef the same way it sent its canned soups to the  grocery stores. First, the product was sent to a supermarket warehouse; then it  was trucked by the chain to a store's back room, where Fresh Chef sat until it  could be stocked in the refrigerated case. This process "could take as long as  30 days," Hackney recalls. "And for a product that has only 40 days of shelf  life, by the time it hit the shelf, it was so close to the expiration date  consumers wouldn't buy it."  </P> <P> Although Campbell lost more than $20 million on Fresh Chef, the company today  is again testing the fresh, refrigerated concept -- complete with a new  distribution system -- on a more limited scale under the name Fresh Kitchens.  </P> <P> Competition also has led to the demise of many a popular product. Remember  Chipwich, the upscale ice-cream sandwich wrapped between two chocolate-chip  cookies? Introduced in 1981, it was an immediate hit -- so much so that many  other companies rushed to create rival adult-novelty ice-cream products,  recalls Chipwich president Sam Metzger.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Metzger adds, most of these companies were giant food  manufacturers that not only could afford the large advertising campaigns, but  could also offer large discounts to encourage supermarkets to carry their  products. "We couldn't afford it," Metzger says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gradual Reappearance  </P> <P> So in 1984, Chipwich was dropped from the supermarkets, with the company's  targeting sales instead to restaurants, ballparks and small mom-and-pop stores.  Only recently, under new agreements with supermarkets, has Chipwich begun  gradually reappearing in grocery stores.  </P> <P> Ice-cream products in particular seem to come and go in rapid fashion, thanks  to the rapidly changing tastes of the American consumer. "We are a fickle  nation, and with our affluence we can afford to be," says Ronald C. Curhan,  professor of marketing at Boston University's School of Management.  </P> <P> Last year's explosion of frozen-fruit bars is a good example. It has all but  fizzled as "consumers saturated themselves with the product, and their interest  in the whole variety waned," says Debby Schapiro, marketing manager of the  International Ice Cream Assn. Now the freezer case is being inundated with  "light" ice creams and frozen-yogurt products.  </P> <P> "Manufacturers of food products have a unique problem in terms of being able to  predict a product's success," says Robert Kopp, assistant professor of  marketing at Babson College.  </P> <P> "Consumers may try a product and repurchase it several times and then they  become satiated with the product. The novelty wears off after several repeat  purchases. In my own experience, I remember when I became very attached to  Klondikes and Dove Bars. I made several repeat purchases. Finally I got  satiated with that product class, and I haven't bought them in months."  </P> <P> Perhaps one reason why ice-cream products are so vulnerable is that they are a  novelty, says Robert Wunderle, economist and vice president of Supermarkets  General Corp. "One of the most common reasons why a product fails is that it's  a passing fashion or short-term novelty. If it becomes part of an integral part  of the diet -- like spaghetti, yogurt or chicken -- its popularity won't  change."  </P> <P> Just as too much competition can hurt business, so can too little competition.  At least, that is what a trade source who didn't want to be identified says  caused the demise of Dannon Co.'s flavored yogurt drink, Dannup.  </P> <P> Launched in 1987 with big hopes that it would meet as much success in the  United States as yogurt drinks have in Europe, Dannup was pulled off the market  earlier this summer.  </P> <P> "Overall interest was not enough to sustain the brand," explains company  spokeswoman Barbara Beck. The chief problem, says Beck, was "getting customers  to try it. Once they tried it, there was great interest."  </P> <P> But it costs a great deal of money to get people to try a product -- more than  Dannon could afford, the trade source says. If only another one or two  companies had made a competing product, the combined promotions may have gained  wider consumer attention, prompting more people to try the drink.  </P> <P> Corporate acquisitions also have contributed to the disappearance of many  products. One marketing expert fondly remembers Guido's Italian Ice. "It was a  very, very popular item in Chicago," the expert recalls.  </P> <P> But the company that made Guido's, Nutrafoods International, was acquired by  the Coca-Cola Co. in 1985. Coke "did a little bit of tinkering" with Guido's,  which was a type of push-up Popsicle, a Coke spokesman said. It was ultimately  reintroduced as "Minute-Maid Fruit Juicee."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Went National  </P> <P> "We felt if we were going to go national with the product, we would do better  with the name Minute Maid," the Coke spokesman said. But the marketing expert  recalls, "It wasn't as good."  </P> <P> Similarly, when Boboli Inc. was acquired by General Foods Corp. a little more  than two years ago, the Boboli -- a pre-baked pizza dough shell that could be  embellished with toppings of the consumer's choice -- began to disappear from  frozen-food cases around the country.  </P> <P> The reason, explains Boboli sales manager Hank Bradanini, was that General  Foods wanted to "concentrate all our efforts" on delivering the product fresh,  instead of frozen. "And obviously with one facility in California, we can't  ship fresh throughout the United States."  </P> <P> For now, Boboli is selling its pizza crusts, which can be topped with fresh  fruit as well as tomato sauce, in Northern California, Nevada and Arizona.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changes in Technology  </P> <P> New technology also has played a hand in driving some products off the shelves.  The advent of self-locking plastic bags, for example, "has made freezer paper  hard to find," says Anne Cockrell, consumer-affairs manager of Safeway Stores  Inc.'s Washington division. Similarly, she adds, the large cans of fruit juices  are being replaced by glass or refrigerated cartons.  </P> <P> On top of that, even best-selling products may disappear for reasons totally  beyond anyone's control.  </P> <P> Take Perdue Farms Inc.'s popular Perdue Done It! roasted chicken and chicken  parts. A major fire at Perdue's Bridgewater, Va., processing facility last  September has kept that item off the market for nearly a year now.  </P> <P> Given all that can go wrong, it is mind-boggling to think how many age-old  products remain on the shelves, notes Boston University's Curhan:  </P> <P> "It's amazing to me as I go into a store to still find a number of items that I  can recall knowing growing up. You can still find Corn Flakes. You can still  find Rice Krispies. You can still find Quaker Oats oatmeal. No matter how many  new products come along, the successful products are still holding their own."  </P></p>

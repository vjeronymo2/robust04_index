			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Gloomy outlook at Hickson after 17% midway decline HICKSON International, the speciality chemicals and timber treatment company, yesterday disappointed with a 17 per cent fall in profits and a downbeat assessment of second half prospects. The company also announced a reduction in its capital expenditure programme to prevent gearing from rising further to levels it would consider unacceptable. The pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 12m for the six months to June 30 was partly due to a Pounds 2.4m increase in the interest bill as deposit earnings fell but the group continued to pay fixed rate debt. The fine chemicals division, the group's least mature business area, suffered a 39 per cent fall in operating profit to Pounds 3.9m. The division suffered demand and margin pressure in the continental European agrochemicals and detergent brightener markets. The result also reflected operating difficulties that were larger than expected following September's explosion at Castleford and included provision for a Pounds 250,000 fine related to the accident in which five people died. 'Our management team were too confident and too optimistic about how quickly we could get growth back into this division,' said Mr Dennis Kerrison, chief executive. Group turnover amounted to Pounds 198.5m (Pounds 173.7m). The interim dividend is maintained at 2.85p, payable from earnings of 4.8p (6.2p). COMMENT Since the August 7 explosion at its Irish plant - the group's second within a year - the shares have shed over 15 per cent of their value in a rising market. Judging by the downbeat statement about second half prospects and the serious deterioration in the fine chemicals division, it is hard to see why the slide should not continue. Even given an element of yield support the shares remain on a demanding prospective multiple of 20 for this year on profits forecast now at about Pounds 21m, almost a third down on predictions 12 months ago. Hickson's problems stem from the lack of predictability in its earnings. It would not take many more fines for environmental misdemeanors or extra capital costs to update plant to meet more exacting regulatory standards before the balance sheet started to look stretched or the latest profits forecasts looked suspect.</p>

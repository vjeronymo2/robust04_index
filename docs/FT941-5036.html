			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (8): Competition for connections gets fiercer - Andrew Adonis discusses the intense rivalry between the long-distance carriers The break-up of the old AT&amp;T company in 1984 was largely intended to stimulate competition in the US long-distance telecommunications market. That now appears a conservative goal. In the US - as in the UK, which licensed its first long-distance competitor to its former monopoly in the same year as divestiture - the policy emphasis is now on creating the conditions for competition in the local network, which was almost universally regarded as a natural monopoly in the mid-1980s. At that time, however, even the idea of a battle in the long-distance market was near revolutionary, with loud cries of 'waste' and 'needless duplication'. Few raise them today. Spending by the long-distance carriers on advertising is colossal: AT&amp;T alone spends about 10 times as much as BT on advertising, as a proportion of turnover. There is also public scepticism about the savings to be gained from switching operators for short-term savings; so much so that the theme of much AT&amp;T advertising is the futility of switching from one carrier to another carrier to save a pittance. But the effect of competition in increasing the range and quality of services is undeniable. So is its impact on prices, however little they may vary between operators at any one time. The beneficiaries have not just been customers using the public networks, but also businesses using leased lines. According to a report by the UK trade and industry department last month, the price of long-distance leased lines is barely a fraction of that charged by European operators. Three companies operate national long-distance networks - AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint. There is also a host of re-sellers. At one stage New York boasted around 100 long-distance operators, including re-sellers. The ranks of re-sellers have thinned as margins in the long-distance business have fallen, but they can be expected to spring to life again as high-margin international traffic is fully opened to the re-sale market. AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint divide the market roughly 70:20:10 between them. Since a rapid loss of market share in the late-1980s, AT&amp;T has been holding its own. 'The market structure is remarkably similar to other businesses with a former dominant supplier,' says Mr Alex Mandl, chief executive of AT&amp;T's communications systems division. 'As soon as you have competition of any seriousness, a fifth of the market will go in its direction'. MCI and Sprint are highly serious competitors. Says Mr Gerald Taylor, MCI vice-president responsible for marketing: 'The industry has moved from a commodity business to a branded products and services business. Ten years ago we had just three products, now we have 300 - it's just like packaging and selling soap powder, only our ingredients happen to be technology.' The key is to get to the market first. MCI's triumph in the late-1980s was its 'Friends and Family' calling plan, giving residential customers reduced rates for frequently-dialled numbers. It was similarly adroit with its '1800 Collect' service. 'We got there 12 weeks before AT&amp;T, and that 12 weeks was utterly critical,' says Mr Taylor. Mr Mandl does not dissent, claiming that 'competition is at least as important as technology in getting services to consumers'. The opportunity to re-sell capacity is not enough. 'There have to be rival networks if the operators are going to be able to craft their own services and break the monopoly mentality'. Aside from the battle for existing long-distance business, two trends are evident. First, like the soap powder manufacturers, the long-distance carriers believe their products and branding are for export. AT&amp;T is the most ambitious, with its 'world partners' venture aiming to provide global services to multinationals through an upgraded 'backbone' network and special relationships with carriers worldwide. Although its rhetoric is of competition with existing monopolists in Europe and elsewhere, probe gently and there is a readiness to work with almost anyone prepared to market AT&amp;T services. 'In some countries we will partner with existing state monopolies,' Mr Mandl concedes. 'On balance we would prefer to work with them if we can provide an attractive offering.' MCI hopes to accomplish the same object in partnership with British Telecommunications, the UK operator with whom it signed a Dollars 5.3bn alliance last year. Under the arrangement, MCI is to take the lead in America, and BT beyond. But BT is learning marketing at MCI's feet: it has recently introduced a version of 'Friends and Family' in the UK, and that is expected to be only the first of the exports. The second trend is the entry of the long-distance carriers into the US local market. Arguably AT&amp;T is already there, through its purchase last year of McCaw Cellular Communications, among the largest US cellular operators. Both AT&amp;T and MCI have declared their intention to take part in the bidding for PCS licences due to be auctioned later this year. 'The objective is a national seamless service, as a replacement for the 'plain old telephone service' of today,' says Mr Laurence Harris, head of MCI's wireless communications group. 'There are plenty of partners coming to us seeking the MCI brand name, and we are as far ahead as anyone in the industry in terms of capacity.' If regulatory reform allows them into the fixed-wire local market, the long-distance carriers can be expected to exploit opportunities rapidly. They are particularly interested in the business customers so successfully exploited by competitive access providers (Caps) in recent years. 'We need a direct relationship with the end user,' says Mr Mandl. He talks equally enthusiastically of AT&amp;T's future involvement in multi-media. 'We are not in the 'content' business,' he is careful to stipulate, 'but we will have the 'broadband' networks, plus storage and distribution facilities, essential to anyone who wants to reach the mass market.' However, in all fields, beating the opposition is only one task. Growing the market is at least as important. 'Since 1984 our revenues have risen every year, because we are after growth above all,' says Mr Mandl. As Mr Taylor of MCI notes, in the past decade average prices have fallen by 50 per cent but the average telecoms bill has risen from Dollars 22 to Dollars 26.50 in real terms. 'Above all, competition has been about changing peoples' attitude to the telephone and the cost of using it. Every advert ramming home the point that it's cheap to call helps to do it, whoever is paying for the ad.'</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GOINGS ON SANTA BARBARA;  </P> <P> SOLSTICE SOLACE;  </P> <P> THE YEAR'S LONGEST NIGHT WILL BE CELEBRATED WITH MYSTERY, MAGIC AND PORTRAYALS  OF WINTER SPIRITS.  </P> <P> December is filled with the sounds of Christmas carols, bells and chimes, the  bellowing laughs of jolly men in bright red suits. But one December night  brings the mysterious rhythms of drums and rattles played by winter night  spirits dressed in black and white.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara residents have gathered to celebrate the summer solstice, the  longest day of the year, for the past 14 years. But 6 to 8 p.m. Friday marks  only the second annual winter solstice festival, celebrating the longest night  of the year.  </P> <P> And although both summer and winter solstice dates are important spiritual  markers for many cultures, present and past, "the spirits which inspire winter  solstice are quite different from the spirits which inspire summer solstice,"  said Michelle Bernes, coordinator of the celebration.  </P> <P> So although the highlight of summer solstice is a lighthearted, colorful  parade, winter solstice offers a mysterious, magical processional. This year's  theme is magic of the night, and a masked sorceress and sorcerer will conjure  magical feats, Bernes said.  </P> <P> Revelers are asked to dress in black and white, as they believe a "winter night  spirit" looks. They should also bring drums and rattles and meet at the gardens  of the Santa Barbara Courthouse at 6 p.m. Musician Jim De Fazio will lead the  group in a musical candlelight procession to De La Guerra Plaza, followed by  celebratory dancing.  </P> <P> Like its summer counterpart, winter solstice is a non-commercial event and  participants' costumes cannot display any slogans, words or recognizable  symbols. No animals or motorized vehicles are allowed. Call 964-3727.  </P> <P> What could be a better Christmas gift than a van Gogh? Two van Goghs. Starting  Christmas day, the Victoria Street Theatre will begin its run of Robert  Altman's critically acclaimed film "Vincent &amp; Theo," a portrait of the van  Gogh brothers. Tickets are $6.  </P> <P> Victoria Street Theatre is presenting "The Year's Best Fest," featuring the  best foreign films the theater showed in 1990. "Jesus of Montreal," by  writer-director Denys Arcand, will conclude its run tonight.  </P> <P> "Henry V" will be shown Friday through Sunday. Written and directed by actor  Kenneth Branagh, who portrays Henry V, the film was nominated for two Academy  Awards -- best director and best actor.  </P> <P> Tickets for festival movies are specially priced at $4. Call 965-1886.  </P> <P> Israel Horovitz's adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic holiday tale "A  Christmas Carol: Scrooge and Marley" will end its run Sunday at the Center  Stage Theatre in the Paseo Nuevo shopping center. Show times are 8 p.m. today,  Friday and Saturday and 7 p.m. Sunday. Weekend matinees at 2 p.m. Tickets are  $14.50, $9.50 students and seniors.

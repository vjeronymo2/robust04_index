			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: The UK upturn is genuine, but . . . I pity anyone trying to make up his mind about the trend of the British or any other economy on the basis of the spot indicators which appear every few days. The industrial production index published on Monday looked like 'boom, boom Britain'. Then the December retail sales published yesterday were judged to be 'disappointing'. This last instant judgment restarted misguided speculation on base-rate cuts, which served the government's purpose as they took a little bit of the froth out of the upward movement in sterling. Some readers may remember my 'Teenagers' Guides' to key indicators. Their main purpose was to provide a do-it-yourself guide to interested readers. The first clue is the familiar Whitehall warning not to take a single month's figures on their own - which does not mean ignoring them, but seeing what effect they have on previous trends. Another clue is to take together indicators on related subjects. Most important, one has to be wise to the snags in particular series. An example is North Sea oil. This is a genuine part of UK output and not the mirage that the more puritanical commentators suppose. But it just so happens that oil output moves in a jerky manner as rigs are taken in and out of action. This bug affects both the production index and gross domestic product. I am not normally accused of partiality towards manufacturing; but for this reason the index of manufacturing output, which excludes energy, is a much better guide than the total index of production. For instance, the production index increased at an annualised rate of almost 5 per cent in the three months to November. Manufacturing alone increased at an annualised rate of 3.2 per cent, and 1.8 per cent over the same period a year before. The best guess lies somewhere in the 2-3 per cent range. This caution will be especially necessary when the Central Statistical Office's flash estimate of fourth quarter GDP is published tomorrow. Search for the estimate excluding the North Sea sector, and show the door to any adviser or analyst who overlooks the distinction. The broad picture is already clear. It is of an economic recovery which Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, says is no longer even patchy. Inflation remains subdued; the core rate, excluding excise duties as as well as mortgage in-terest payments, has almost certainly fallen further. The big question is how far the delayed tax increases imposed in the two 1993 Budgets are going to depress consumer spending. The Treasury Committee rightly criticised the fiscal presentation of the last Budget as being peculiarly difficult to fathom. The adjoining table is an attempt to fill the gap by one of the committee's advisers, Bill Martin. He argues that the spending cuts, up to and including 1995, are due to lower unemployment and inflation than previously projected rather than real reductions. But, even taking spending cuts at their face value, tax increases are overwhelmingly more important in the government's deficit reduction plan. The committee's report emphasises the severity of the tax increases by saying they were equivalent to a 7 per cent increase in the basic rate. Martin, on the other hand, maintains that they are less than the increases in Geoffrey Howe's controversial 1981 Budget imposed at the trough of the earlier recession. The moral he draws is that the short-run impact of even large budgetary shocks can easily be outweighed by other business cycle forces. This time Martin believes that the delayed impact of the post-exchange rate mechanism interest rate cuts will more than offset the fiscal contraction. I make no apology for having opposed a large fiscal contraction when the recovery seemed modest and uncertain. But having decreed such contraction, it would be absurd for the authorities to counteract it now by further interest rate reductions, until the effects of the main direct tax increases can be seen in the coming financial year. A much more controversial assertion of Martin is that there is little, if any, excess capacity so that the scope for high growth rates is small. He also believes that despite the 1993 Budgets there is still a large structural deficit and a potentially catastrophic balance of payments. He advocates further large-scale tax increases or public spending cuts combined with currency depreciation at favourable opportunities. These matters are not merely uncertain, as he admits, but inherently unknowable. So let me concentrate on the capacity point and the relevance to it of the declining unemployment trend. This is shown both by the Department of Employment's employer-based series and the new Labour Force Survey (LFS). The unemployment rise registered in it in the middle of last year was almost certainly a blip in the downward trend. Because employment estimates lag well behind the unemployment claimants' count, it is impossible to be sure what produced the fall in the latter. Evidence in 1993 up to last summer suggests that there was a net increase in jobs and not just a movement out of the labour force registered as available for work. Economic observers without political points to make have a special concern. For it is unusual to have either a drop in unemployment or a rise in employment so early in what is billed as a moderate upturn. David Walton of Goldman Sachs suggests that half of the difference compared with the 1980s represents a slower demographic growth of the labour force, leaving the other half still to explain. The most favourable interpretation is that the upturn is more vigorous than the official figures so far suggest. In that case, and if it continued, the economy could stand some of Martin's further fiscal tightening. The most unfavourable interpretation is that productivity growth is already slowing down strongly. The truth may be somewhere in between. The recovery is probably sharper than realised. On the other hand, earlier productivity estimates were probably inflated by an underestimate of the labour force, which has been picked up by the LFS. The rise in employment up to last summer is more than accounted for by the increase in part-time jobs, most of which went to women. These jobs should not be scoffed at as second-rate or ungenuine. Only 13 per cent of respondents told the LFS that they took these jobs for lack of a full-time one. But their spread does suggest that inflationary pressures in the labour market are much less than the headline unemployment figures suggest. Bottlenecks in the present upturn are indeed more likely to arise from the capacity than the labour side. Unfortunately most studies of capacity relate to manufacturing, which is less than a quarter of the total economy. Capacity in the rest of the economy is much more elusive, as exchanges between officials and the Treasury Committee bring out, and no one has even really tried to measure it. Taking both the exchange rate factors which I analysed last week and the domestic ones, there is no case for either a loosening or tightening of policy now. But both the stance and the mix could need to be changed as the year goes on. Acting in time should not be confused with the sin of fine-tuning.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------             DIRECT EFFECT OF BUDGET MEASURES (% OF GDP)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FY                    1993      1994      1995      1996  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Lamont                 0.1       1.0       1.4       1.6 Clarke*                  -       0.8       0.9       1.2 Total                  0.1       1.8       2.3       2.8 of which: Tax increase           0.1       1.3       2.1       2.4 Expenditure cut          -       0.5       0.2       0.4  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * Excluding debt interest saving to ensure comparability with March Budget figures.

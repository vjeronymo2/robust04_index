			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Rising yen may not cut Japan's surplus THE yen's rapid rise against the US dollar could damage the Japanese economy without helping to reduce its trade surplus with the US, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's governor, warned yesterday after the central bank had intervened for the second successive day to slow the yen's rise. The yen ended the Tokyo trading day at a post-war high of Y110.25 against the dollar, in spite of the BoJ's inter-vention. The currency's rise in the past two days, in the wake of weekend comments by US President Bill Clinton that a stronger yen was one factor which would help to reduce the Japanese trade surplus, has spread consternation through the ranks of Japan's policymakers and politicians. Not only does the yen's rise threaten to choke off export growth, prolonging the deepening downturn in the Japanese economy, it is seen by many officials as the first tangible sign of greater friction in Tokyo's relations with a more assertive administration in Washington. Mr Clinton, speaking after meeting Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister, said a stronger yen was one among several factors which would help to correct the trade imbalance between the two countries. The US pressure on Japan to reduce the trade surplus will set off a fierce political battle in Tokyo over Japan's response. Mr Mieno yesterday gave notice that he would oppose any policy to make Japan the locomotive of international growth. The US is expected to push for such a global growth strategy at the forthcoming summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations in Tokyo in July. Mr Mieno said international policy co-ordination was not meant to give any one country the role as a locomotive of growth but that each country should pursue non-inflationary, stable growth within the context of the health of their respective economies. The governor attempted to play down the significance of Mr Clinton's remarks. He said they did not indicate the US wanted a higher yen. However, many senior Japanese officials believe the US has embarked on a deliberate policy of talking up the Japanese currency. Mr Mieno said the Japanese economy had yet to hit the bottom of its long decline over the past two years. However, he predicted that growth would pick up at a moderate rate during the second half of the financial year which began this month. Mr Mieno said the Japanese financial system and its industrial companies had only just begun the drawn-out task of restructuring, with banks dealing with their bad debts and industrial companies cutting their fixed costs. He also warned against a re-regulation of the Japanese economy, through government measures to support the financial system for instance, which would delay restructuring through competitive, market forces.</p>

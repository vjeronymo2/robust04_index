			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Private broadcaster bids for Chiltern CLT, one of Europe'a largest private broadcasters, yesterday made its first big push into the UK market with a recommended offer for Chiltern, the commercial radio company, in a deal that values the company at Pounds 16.9m. Chiltern's shares closed 33p higher at 238p yesterday. Since the closure of Radio Luxembourg CLT has had little official presence in the UK although it owns 80 per cent of Atlantic 252 which transmits from Ireland to more than 66 per cent of the UK population. Luxembourg-based CLT, which manages 13 radio stations and eight television stations in continental Europe has been trying to get into the UK for some time. In the year ending September 30 Chiltern, which broadcasts in the northern Home Counties showed losses of Pounds 246,000 on a turnover of Pounds 5.8m, and yesterday announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10,000 on a turnover of Pounds 2.7m for the six months to the end of March. CLT is offering 242p in cash, representing a premium of 18.3 per cent over the Chiltern price at the close of business on June 7. Holders of 15.35 per cent have agreed to accept the offer. The Daily Mail and General Trust which last week bought a package of radio stocks, including an 18.5 per cent stake in Chiltern, was last night reviewing its position. Apart from its local licences Chiltern has a 25 per cent stake in Network News (Radio) which provides a 24-hour radio news service to both local stations and Virgin Radio. It also won the Severn Estuary licence, one of five new regional commercial stations which launch in September. For CLT the Chiltern purchase,if it goes ahead, would fill in large stretches of the UK not reached by Atlantic 252.</p>

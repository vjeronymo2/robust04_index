			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> CITY MAY SEEK HELP WITH SHELTER SEARCH  </P> <P> Oxnard housing officials have recommended that the City Council pay a  consultant $10,000 to identify nine potential locations for a homeless shelter  within the city.  </P> <P> The recommendation will be considered by the council Tuesday.  </P> <P> The locations identified by the consultant are to be considered as future sites  for the Zoe Christian Center, the county's only year-round homeless shelter.  </P> <P> City officials have said the center cannot remain at its South Rose Avenue site  because of its proximity to a fertilizer plant where toxic chemicals are  stored.  </P> <P> In a memo to the council, Housing Director Sal Gonzalez said the consultant  will be chosen through a bid proposal process and will be paid with federal  grant money.  </P> <P> The task will be coordinated with the city of Ventura, which will also identify  potential sites within that city, the memo said.  </P> <P> The cooperative effort has been endorsed by the Assn. of Ventura County Cities,  which has agreed to support development of a shelter operated under a joint  powers agreement among all the cities, according to the memo.  </P> <P> Once all the sites have been identified, they will be reviewed by city  officials in Oxnard and Ventura for final approval, Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> The new shelter should be about 10,550 square feet and should serve 180 to 200  people, according to a city report.

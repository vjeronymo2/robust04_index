			<p>BFN     [Text] The closure on the territories has been eased.  Some 1,000 Gaza residents were today allowed to enter the Green  Line boundaries through the Erez roadblock. Our correspondent  Shlomi Eldar reports that entry permits were granted not only to  laborers but also to family members of Palestinians who are  detained in Qezi'ot, as per an agreement reached in negotiations  between Fatah and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The IDF  commander in the Gaza Strip also permitted PLO people to enter  Israel. They had been allowed free passage in the past, but  their exit from the Strip was restricted after the imposition of  the closure.</p>

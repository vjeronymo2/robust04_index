			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Argentina clinches debt deal with banks ARGENTINA and its international bank creditors yesterday secured an important outline accord aimed at reducing the government's foreign debt burden. The agreement was achieved in all-night talks which finished at 5am yesterday in Santo Domingo, where the Inter-American Development Bank is holding its annual meeting. Mr Domingo Cavallo, the Argentine finance minister, who led the negotiating team, said he was sure the accord would represent 'a turning point in the Argentine economy'. It was described by Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs as 'one of the most important agreements achieved in recent years'. He praised Mr Cavallo for 'vision and courage' and the banks for a 'constructive and statesmanlike attitude' to the negotiations. The outline accord took two months to reach, the fastest negotiation yet of a debt reduction accord, said Mr William Rhodes, the Citicorp vice-chairman, who headed the 13-bank negotiating team. The Citicorp chief said it would allow Argentina greater access to the international capital markets. The agreement covered Dollars 23bn in medium-term debt owed to banks and Dollars 8bn in arrears on interest. Banks holding the medium-term debt may exchange it for: 30-year bonds at a discount to face value of 35 per cent, with interest at London interbank offered rates plus  13/16 per cent, and carrying collateral to guarantee 12 months of interest payments. 30-year bonds with the same face value as the debt, with interest rates rising in steps from 4 per cent in year one to 6 per cent in years seven to 30. They have a 12-month interest guarantee.</p>

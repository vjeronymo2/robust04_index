			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Finally a stamp of approval for Elvis? Fans of the King can take heart that the  battle for an Elvis Presley stamp may soon be over. Rep. Don Sundquist  (R-Tenn.) recently criticized Postmaster General Anthony Frank after Frank made  critical remarks about Presley's drug habit. Sundquist, who has been a  proponent of an Elvis stamp, said that Frank then wrote him a letter, conceding  that Presley rates a stamp on the merits of his music and popularity. Frank  reiterated his concern about Presley's drug use but nonetheless told Sundquist:  "My guess is that we will commence a series of stamps on popular American music  and that Mr. Presley will be represented in this series." Presley's estate has  exclusive rights to the use of his name and likeness but it has agreed to let  the Postal Service use Presley's image without paying royalties. An estate  spokeswoman has said that the Presley depicted on the stamp will be the slim  Presley of the 1950s and 1960s, not the heftier Elvis of the 1970s. Claudia  Puig  </P></p>

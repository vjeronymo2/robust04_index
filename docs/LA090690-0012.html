			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: FUTURES EXCHANGE HEAD NOT SURE IF HE'LL STAY ON  </P> <P> After only a month as chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, William F.  O'Connor is not sure whether he wants to remain at the helm of the world's  largest futures exchange.  </P> <P> O'Connor, 55, said he hasn't decided whether he wants to serve beyond January,  when his term expires.  </P> <P> O'Connor was appointed chairman July 31 when Karsten (Cash) Mahlmann resigned  amid financial woes at Stotler Group Inc., a futures brokerage firm of which he  was also chairman.  </P> <P> "I ran for election for vice chairman, and I became chairman by a means which I  didn't want to become chairman," O'Connor said. "I still don't know if I want  to be chairman."  </P></p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Observer: Pawn cocktails Labour's heroic struggle to win friends and influence people in the business community moved last night to the Pavilion restaurant in Soho, where a modest dinner - Pounds 20 a head - was hosted by Robin Cook, the party's irrepressible trade and industry spokesman. Cook has agreed to become president of a new group, the Forum For Business and Industry. The forum says it will recruit some industrial big guns and act as a sounding board for Labour's nascent industrial plans. More practically, it will also help foot the bill for the painstaking process of constructing policy. Forum members will be expected to cough up Pounds 500 a year to help fund activities. So far 25 recruits have signed up; who they are is currently being kept under wraps. But perhaps a policy costing only Pounds 12,500 to develop is not much to shout about.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAWAII HOTEL STRIKE: SURF'S UP, MAKE YOUR BED  </P> <P> Hotel managers, claiming that disruptions by striking workers have escalated  out of control, asked a federal judge Friday to limit picketing to avert "blood  in the streets." The judge said no.  </P> <P> As Hawaii's first statewide hotel strike marked its seventh day, tempers were  wearing thin for everyone involved, especially the tourists unwittingly caught  up in the dispute.  </P> <P> Although the struck hotels have continued operating since 7,500 workers walked  out last Saturday, it's not quite the Hawaiian vacation that many visitors  envisioned.  </P> <P> Honeymooners can't have breakfast in bed because room service has been  suspended. Guests can't even sleep in late, thanks to loud chanting from the  picket lines.  </P> <P> Nor are the soothing sand and waves of Waikiki sacrosanct. Strikers have taken  to marching up and down the beach with bullhorns bellowing. Even those tourists  who leave the tourist strip of Waikiki, where the picketing is concentrated,  return to find beds in their hotel rooms unmade and linen unchanged.  </P> <P> "It kind of puts you in a bad frame of mind," said Rodney Wilkins, a guest at  the Hilton Hawaiian Village, the state's largest hotel. "Here we are, paying  for services that are not being delivered."  </P> <P> On Friday, while management headed for court, the union turned its attention to  a new target. About 300 retired hotel workers picketed the Japanese Consulate  for more than an hour, chanting, "Fair is fair, we want our share," and, "Hey,  hey, ho, ho, the Japanese have got to go."  </P> <P> Most of the 11 hotels that are struck are Japanese-owned, although negotiations  are being handled by the Council of Hawaii Hotels, which represents U.S. hotel  operators, including Hilton, Hyatt and Sheraton.  </P> <P> The council sought help in U.S. District Court, claiming that hundreds of  pickets had overwhelmed security guards and swarmed onto the grounds of the  Kahala Hilton on Thursday.  </P> <P> Management contends that pickets have also disrupted entry to some hotels,  damaged vehicles and disturbed guests with their chanting. "I do not think this  court needs to wait until there is blood in the streets to protect the public,"  argued Robert Katz, attorney for the Council of Hawaii Hotels.  </P> <P> But U.S. District Judge Harold Fong disagreed. He denied the motion for a  temporary restraining order to bar pickets from hotel entrances. "From what  I've seen, the situation has not turned ugly," he said. "One incident does not  a riot make." So far, there has been just one arrest on the picket line, he  noted.  </P> <P> Tony Rutledge, leader of the Hotel Employees, Restaurant Employees Union, Local  5, said any violence was the result of security guards overreacting.  </P> <P> The strike affects 9,300 hotel rooms, 16% of the state's total.  </P> <P> The hotels involved in the strike are the Hilton Hawaiian Village, the Hyatt  Regency Waikiki, the Ilikai, the Kahala Hilton, the Sheraton Waikiki, the  Sheraton Moana Surfrider, the Princess Kaiulani and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.  On neighboring islands, the Sheraton Kauai, Sheraton Maui and Kona Hilton also  are struck.  </P> <P> As the week has worn on, striking workers have become more unruly, jostling  cars that cross the lines and yelling insults at strike breakers, according to  management. Management also contends that the hotel workers' slow shuffle is  tying up traffic and blocking business.  </P> <P> Despite the spirited rhetoric in the courtroom, negotiations between union and  management resumed on Friday afternoon. William Crawford, executive director of  the hotel council, said the two sides have made progress.  </P> <P> Union leader Rutledge agreed that "we're not that far apart." "If they spend  their energies at the bargaining table, rather than in court, we could get this  thing settled in a day or two," he added.  </P> <P> Talks broke down last Saturday and pickets hit the streets but the two sides  returned to the bargaining table Tuesday at the behest of Gov. John Waihee, who  fears the strike's impact on Hawaii's economy. Tourism is the state's backbone.  Officials are concerned that news reports will scare off visitors during the  peak winter season.  </P> <P> There are signs that the strike has not hurt business that much. At United  Airlines, the carrier that flies the most passengers to Hawaii, "we have not  seen any impact from the hotel strike," spokesman Joseph Hopkins said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, in an effort to counteract the impression that the strike has  "shut down Hawaii," the Hawaii Visitors Bureau is launching a $300,000  "emergency advertising campaign" in mainland newspapers Sunday.  </P> <P> Katz alluded to those concerns in seeking court intervention. "Not only is  there going to be blood in the streets, but the state economy is going to come  to a grinding halt because this is going to scare the living daylights out of  anyone who wants to come to Hawaii," he said.  </P> <P> The strike is the talk of local radio stations and coffee shops. Although the  hotel workers have substantial public sympathy in this strongly Democratic  state, some residents are upset at union tactics that aggravate tourists, who  are Hawaii's bread and butter. One caller to a local radio station stopped his  car in morning traffic to use a pay phone to register his disapproval.  </P> <P> For some visitors, the strike is a dream turned sour.  </P> <P> "I wish there was some other method of resolving this dispute," said Len  Hazzard, a visitor from Vancouver.  </P> <P> "We're innocent. We only get a couple of weeks holiday here a year."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Alisa Samuels contributed to this report.  </P></p>

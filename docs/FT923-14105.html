			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Court call for delay on payments to creditors FORMAL approval of the proposed once-and-for-all payments to creditors of BCCI should be delayed until the creditors have been consulted, Luxembourg's state prosecutor said yesterday. The Luxembourg court must approve the provisional agreement - worked out by the bank's liquidators and its majority shareholder, the Abu Dhabi government - before it can be implemented. If the formal decision is delayed, it could prolong the often acrimonious dispute between disgruntled independent creditors and the Abu Dhabi authorities over the terms of the deal. The judge, Mrs Maryse Welter, will deliver her ruling on July 20. The provisional settlement would involve a payment of between Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 620m) and Dollars 1.7bn to creditors and has been approved by courts in Britain and the Cayman Islands. But Luxembourg, where BCCI had its brass-plate headquarters, has the final word. BCCI's liquidators disclosed during yesterday's hearing that Abu Dhabi was limiting their access to more than 60,000 documents relating to the bank. The emirate's lawyers argued the government had done its best to make all the necessary documents available to the liquidators. But the judge indicated they had not done enough. 'It sounds as though some of those dossiers - on loans, for example - would be useful, perhaps indispensable (to the liquidators' investigations),' she said. Lawyers for independent BCCI creditors in the UK and Luxembourg have been fighting to prevent implementation of the settlement, which they believe is not generous enough. Lawyers for the Abu Dhabi government again warned creditors of the 'serious risks' involved in turning down the offer. 'Unless the majority shareholders choose to make a voluntary payment the creditors may get nothing,' Mr Louis Schiltz, counsel to the Abu Dhabi authorities, told the court yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "The RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles rejected  accusations by some U.S. sectors linking Panama to international  money laundering. According to Carles, Panamanians cannot  accept everything that comes from the United States. A report  issued by the U.S. assistant of state for inter-American affairs  states that Panama is one of the countries that offers the least  cooperation in controlling drug trafficking and money  laundering. Panamanian authorities have staunchly rejected this  position.    Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles, who describes  himself as a friend of the United States, also rejected the  allegations.    [Begin Carles recording] I agree with the position taken by  Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Raul Mulino. Panama is  cooperating in the counternarcotics effort. The enormous  quantities of drugs seized is one indication that things are  like they used to be, when trafficking was openly protected by  Panamanian authorities. [end recording]    According to Carles, there are some isolated cases, but they  are not enough to warrant the accusations being made against  Panama.    [Begin Carles recording] We can not accept everything the  Americans ask or demand of us. There are interests here in  Panama that must also be defended, like the banking center. Of  course money laundering is a crime, but it originates in the  United States, so let us both struggle against it. They signed  the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which Panama has already  ratified but the United States has not. [end recording]</p>

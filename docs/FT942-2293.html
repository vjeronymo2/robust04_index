			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Cott warns of attack from other cola makers Cott Corporation, the fast-growing Canadian maker of private-label soft drinks, has cautioned that an intensifying counter-attack from Coca-Cola and PepsiCo may dampen its earnings growth this year. Cott said in its annual report that price competition from national brand soft drinks abated during much of its fiscal year to January 1994. But Coke and Pepsi have hit back hard in recent months by cutting prices, widening retailers' margins and reducing the cost of cola concentrate to bottlers. Cott said it expected the strong response to continue throughout the coming year in the UK and Canada, and 'sporadically' in the US and other countries. Rising sales volumes, productivity improvements and cost controls would only partially offset downward pressure on North American prices, Cott said. Cott's net income almost trebled last year to CDollars 35.4m (Pounds 17.1m) and its sales doubled to CDollars 665.4m. The strong growth rate continued in the three months to April 30. But Cott's shares lost almost a quarter of their value on the Toronto stock exchange last week, tumbling from CDollars 26 to CDollars 19.75. Cott's critics also question its accounting practices.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARTIAL SINGHER; BARITONE, FAMED VOICE TEACHER  </P> <P> Martial Singher, the scholarly, lyrical French baritone who devoted his life to  the subtleties of composers and librettists, personifying style both on the  opera stages of the world and in the classrooms of the nation, is dead.  </P> <P> The former head of the vocal department at the Music Academy of the West in  Santa Barbara -- a position he assumed when the legendary Lotte Lehmann retired  -- was 85 when he died Friday.  </P> <P> Alexander Saunderson, a longtime friend, said from Santa Barbara that the  fabled voice teacher had died of a longstanding heart condition at his home  there.  </P> <P> Compared to many of his contemporaries, Singher was not of heroic stature nor  of large voice, but for 30 years he was, said Times music critic Martin  Bernheimer, "an artist of refinement . . ." who "the connoisseurs adored. . .  ."  </P> <P> When Willliam H. Seltsam compiled "Metropolitan Opera Annals" in 1947 he  dedicated the work to only two singers: Geraldine Farrar, the great American  diva, and Singher.  </P> <P> "Singher," wrote Seltsam, "has proved that the standards of the great singing  actors of the past survive in our own day."  </P> <P> The elegant, stylish musicologist was highly regarded in this country from his  first Metropolitan performance in 1943 in "The Tales of Hoffman." Virgil  Thomson, the composer and critic, wrote in the Herald Tribune that Singher  "gave a stage performance of incomparable elegance and did a piece of singing  that for perfection of vocal style has not been equaled since Kirsten Flagstad  went away."  </P> <P> His roles ranged from Pelleas in Debussy's "Pelleas et Mellisande" to Escamillo  in "Carmen" to Wolfram in "Tannhauser" to Lescaut in "Manon."  </P> <P> He stayed with the Met through 200 performances but in 1959 a heart disorder  ended his career as a performer but proved a blessing to what would be hundreds  of students.  </P> <P> He taught at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, at Peabody and at UCLA, in  Aspen and at the Marlboro Festival before settling in Santa Barbara where he  would remain until his retirement in 1981.  </P> <P> There he took over from Miss Lehmann, teaching voice and the literature of song  while managing the opera department and its annual productions.  </P> <P> His students there included Rodney Gilfry, James King, John Reardon, Judith  Blegen, Jeanine Altmeyer, and many more who have gone on to their own  illustrious careers.  </P> <P> He taught unknowns in relatively modest surroundings because he said he "lacked  the strength and perhaps the authority to work with stars." He had considered  for a time becoming a vocal coach and teacher for the nobility of the opera  world but "I soon found out they wouldn't do what I said. Can you imagine what  I would have had to go through getting Mario del Monaco (the Italian tenor) to  sing Don Jose in a semblance of French. . . .  </P> <P> "No! (besides) I love to work with young people. Working with fresh talent  permits me to be faithful to the original (score). . . ."  </P> <P> Born in Oloron-Saint-Marie in Basses-Pyrenees, Singher at first wanted to teach  school but a gift for song sent him to the Paris Conservatory for study.  </P> <P> He first performed professionally in Amsterdam and then in Paris both with the  Paris Opera and the Opera Comique before coming to the United States in 1941.  </P> <P> After retiring in 1981, he wrote "An Interpretive Guide to Operatic Arias."  </P> <P> Asked on the eve of his farewell Santa Barbara production in August, 1981, how  he had managed to get such quality work from such embryonic voices, he replied:  </P> <P> "You can get anything you want from anyone. . . . All you have to do is kill  yourself."  </P> <P> Survivors include his wife, Margareta, the daughter of conductor Fritz Busch;  three sons and a grandson. Services are pending.  </P></p>

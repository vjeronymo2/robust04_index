			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Doina Saiciuc dispatch from Paris] </F>   [Text] About one and a half hours ago at the UNESCO  headquarters in Paris, Romanian Foreign Affairs Minister Teodor  Melescanu presented, with the precision and elegance of reason,  Romania's position regarding the European stability pact.    Talking in the plenum of the inaugural conference in Paris,  the Romanian foreign affairs minister remarked that the  conference has the historic task of preparing the future by  erecting the democratic stability of the continent.    Bucharest is convinced that this first foreign policy and  collective security exercise performed by the European Union  will contribute to the accomplishment of further prerequisites  to perpetuate European integration by deepening and expanding  it. The example set by those who laid the foundation of the  European Community by reaching reconciliation encourages and  stimulates the political will of the Central European countries  in the sense of turning their good neighborliness into an  irreversible framework of their mutual relations.    Ethnic diversity, the head of Romanian diplomacy also said,  is a natural circumstance of our continent. Romania shares the  idea that ethnic minorities are part of the assets of the  countries. The protection of ethnic minorities can be ensured  in a better way if the persons belonging to those minorities  offer their loyalty to the states. Referring to certain remarks  made yesterday in the hall of the Paris conference, Mr.  Melescanu added that the loyalty of persons belonging to ethnic  minorities to the states they are citizens of is, per se, an  ample source of stability.    Romania also shares the almost unanimously accepted view of  the participants in the conference in consecrating the  intergovernmental character of this preventive diplomacy  exercise, thus guaranteeing its viability and the success of the  joint efforts.    Consultations at national level with the legitimate  representatives of ethnic minorities cannot be anything but  beneficial for each of the governments and each of the ethnic  minorities. Otherwise, putting such dialogues beyond the  boundaries of law would not only violate international rights,  but would also act as an obstacle hindering good neighborliness.  Luckily, the Romanian foreign affairs minister emphasized, the  unanimous decision of the states attending the conference to  place the pact on the basis of the principles and norms  consecrated by the pertinent documents of the United Nations,  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the  Council of Europe, is able to prevent such strange and singular  pretenses [sentence as heard].    Mr. Melescanu reasserted the firm will of the Romanian  Government to contribute to the success of this initiative by  continuing and finalizing the negotiations intended to conclude  bilateral treaties with all neighboring countries, including  Hungary. Romania also expresses its readiness to include in the  stability pact the treaties already concluded by Romania with  other states associated to the European Union as our country's  specific contribution to the pact. Bucharest also offers to  host a regional roundtable conference dedicated to ethnic  minority issues, as well as a regional roundtable conference  dedicated to issues related to the amelioration of the  infrastructures in transportation and communications.    After noting that the document of the current conference is  the result of long and laborious negotiations, the Romanian  minister of foreign affairs stated that the delegation of our  country is ready to accept its text.    The success of the initiative directly depends on the  wisdom,  moderation, and the respect of each country for the constructive  spirit of the project that will begin today after the conclusion  of the conference. The Romanians, stated Mr. Melescanu, believe  that the time has come when the prejudices, cliches, and  exaggeratedly emotional perceptions in the relations between  neighboring countries that are united by a joint fate should be  done away with.</p>

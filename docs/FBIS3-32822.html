			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Industry, Commerce, Integration, </F> and Fisheries Jose Maldonado Davila; place and date not given]    [Text] Quito--Jose Maldonado Davila, the new minister of  industry, commerce, integration, and fisheries, has announced  that the body he heads is working closely with the nation's  business sector to strengthen the productive apparatus, to  develop foreign trade, and to strengthen social action in  response to the challenges posed by the globalization of the  economy.    Emphasizing that the development of the nation's foreign  trade will be the first priority during his administration, he  also emphasized the need to simplify the procedures in that  sector and to intensify the processes of integration and  establishment of bilateral commercial agreements.    [EL UNIVERSO] What level of concern do foreign trade and the  processes of integration merit?    [Maldonado] During my administration, foreign trade will be  the number one priority. It is essential that we speed up the  processes of integration; strengthen the Andean Pact agreements  and the relationships we must maintain with other countries as a  community, as the Andean Pact; reinforce the bilateral relations  our country has with other nations; strengthen the policy of  fostering open trade with the world; and integrate our country  in the world process and in technological and economic  globalization. Blocs are being formed on every continent, and it  is therefore necessary to strengthen our economic bloc in the  Andean area, comprising Chile, Mexico, the MERCOSUR [Common  Market of the South], and the rest of the Latin American  countries. There is not the slightest doubt that, for Ecuador's  nontraditional products in particular, the Latin American market  is very important, very promising.    [EL UNIVERSO] Is Ecuador experiencing difficulties with  Colombia with regard to the sale of alcoholic beverages and iron  to Venezuela? How will this situation be handled?    [Maldonado] We must demand that all countries adhere to  those  mechanisms that the agreements in the Andean area already  provide. This will perhaps be the focus of the first efforts  made by the ministry. I will be meeting with representatives of  the domestic liquor industry and the domestic iron and steel  industry for the purpose of developing a strategy. This strategy  must be one that is best suited to the standardization and  regularization of the situation involving dumping and the  marketing of liquors by the Accord Commission. All of the Andean  countries must adhere to the mechanisms in effect.    [EL UNIVERSO] What will the policy pursued with regard to  medicines be?    [Maldonado] Each industrial sector has its own special  characteristics and its own production, market, sales, and price  problems. I will have to meet with representatives of all the  sectors, so that within the framework of an overall policy for  the development of industry and trade, we can proceed to resolve  each of the problems they encounter.    [EL UNIVERSO] Do you advocate the liberalization of medicine  prices?    [Maldonado] That is a problem we will have to study at the  ministry. I do not have a precise definition to give you on this  matter.    [EL UNIVERSO] Although the norms for holding back coffee are  in effect, has it not been announced that Ecuador will not  comply with these regulations?    [Maldonado] I will be happy to respond to questions on these  current issues after I have held meetings with the sectorial  representatives and those who have studied this policy. What I  should indeed mention is that the government will support all of  the efforts made by the private sector to ensure growth and  development, to create jobs, and to advance the social  development of the country.    [EL UNIVERSO] If you foresee an open door for the productive  sectors, how will this be achieved?    [Maldonado] It will be achieved based on mutual cooperation  through permanent dialogue and the harmonizing of the policies  pursued and the efforts made, and with a view to facing up  successfully to the challenge of competition on our own market  and foreign markets. We must modernize industry in terms of  quality, obtain better yields and better prices, and provide the  appropriate legal-reference framework that industry needs in  order to develop. In the final analysis, the productive sector  is demanding clear rules of the game and the simplification of  the state. I have been in the forefront of the battle for  modernization, and I am confident that I will be able to sign  the draft decree that has been submitted to the president of the  Republic before this week is over. This decree will abrogate a  series of accords, regulations, and decrees that are definitely  making the task of the state and the productive sector more  difficult.    We are going to put a very special effort into this process  of simplifying the state, and to this end we will work together  with the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and all of the  sectors that deal with the nation's productive process on a  daily basis.    An effort is being made to simplify about 3,000 agreements,  regulations, and normative Ecuadoran legislative texts that  pertain not only to the norming of the productive sector, but to  the state as a whole and to the procedures involved in importing  raw materials and exporting. This means price setting and the  elimination of a series of administrative hindrances.    [EL UNIVERSO] Will the single form for exports be eliminated  in this simplification process, as the business sector is  demanding?    [Maldonado] I cannot give you any details as yet, but as  soon  as I have the information, I will reveal everything involving  this ministry.    [EL UNIVERSO] It is said that with you in office, concrete  agreements within the Andean Group are guaranteed.    [Maldonado] I believe that considerable progress has been  made. What we need to do is to speed up the process. A series of  negotiations with other countries is being pursued by the Andean  Pact, as a community, and very important bilateral agreements  are also under way.    The task of this ministry is not Andean integration alone,  but foreign trade in general. It is obvious that we must  therefore combine our efforts with those being made by the  Ministries of Agriculture and Foreign Relations.</p>

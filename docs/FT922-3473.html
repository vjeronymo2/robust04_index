			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ex-Soviet Union's aluminium exports soar EXPORTS OF aluminium from the former Soviet Union to the West soared to 1m tonnes last year, the European Aluminium Association estimates, This compares with exports during the 1980s of between 250,000 and 300,000 tonnes a year. The huge increase in supply - and not weak demand - was the main reason for the European industry's problems over the past 18 months, Mr Dag Flaa, president of the EAA, said yesterday. He said: 'It is obvious that such a dramatic and sudden change in the metal flow to the West was bound to give digestion problems in the industry. 'Without this disturbing influence, the market balance for aluminium would have been fairly satisfactory.' The increase in imports has led to cuts in European production. Last year output fell 3.5 per cent to 3.48m tonnes. This year the EAA estimates European output will fall further to 3.28m tonnes, following cuts in both production and capacity. Total world output in 1991 was up 3.5 per cent to 14.81m tonnes. The rise followed new smelter capacity in Canada, Latin America and Asia. An additional 640,000 tonnes of capacity is expected to come on stream this year. European consumption continued to increase in 1991 but by only 1.7 per cent, to 4.7m tonnes. The EAA last year forecast an increase of 4.5 per cent, expecting much greater offtake in eastern Germany, which did not materialise. It now expects a further 2.5 per cent rise this year, reflecting increased demand from both the packaging and construction sectors. While the EAA remains optimistic on world consumption prospects, forecasting an annual growth rate of about 3 per cent, it remains concerned about the low level of world prices. Dr Hans Georg Seebauer, secretary general of the EAA, pointed out that 'LME quotations of less than Dollars 1,350 a tonne are certainly not sufficient to cover the costs of most Western World producers'. Mr Flaa believes there are grounds for optimism as the supply-demand balance becomes more healthy. But he admits that, while the association hopes to see a reduction in exports from the former Soviet Union, 'we have to assume that the level will still be high by historical standards'. He believes, however, that the underlying market balance is fundamentally different from the early 1980s, when only 80 per cent of the Western aluminium industry was working. Today the rate is 96 per cent. Stocks of aluminium at Western smelters totalled 3.278m tonnes at the end of April, compared with 3.291m in March and 3.363m in April 1991, provisional International Primary Aluminium Institute figures show.</p>

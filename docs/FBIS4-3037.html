			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan said  Friday [15 April] that the government will take necessary steps  to minimize the possible impact on farmers brought about by  Taiwan's admission into the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT). Lien made the remarks while receiving the chairmen  of farmers' associations from around Taiwan.    Around 3,000 farm association representatives and farmers  rallied in Taipei today, demanding that the government look out  for their interests.    In meeting Premier Lien, Chien Chin-ching, chairman of the  Taiwan Provincial Farmers' Association, submitted a statement  calling on the government to maintain the ban on rice imports  and to raise NT$100 billion to compensate farmers hurt by the  opening of Taiwan's produce market.    The farmers also asked the government to implement a pension  scheme for farmers, to lift restrictions on real-estate  transactions involving farm land, to form a supraministerial  organization to help farmers cope with the impact likely to be  brought about by Taiwan's admission into GATT, and to increase  the budget for agricultural development.    Lien promised that a governmental task force would be  established to study ways to help farmers, who he said have long  been the "weak group" in Taiwan.</p>

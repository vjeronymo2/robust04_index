			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Estonian Ministry of Foreign </F> Affairs in Tallinn on 21 June -- received via Internet E-LIST]    [Text] The Foreign Ministry of Estonia received with deep  concern the announcement about the June 21, 1994 Russian  Federation presidential decree, "Demarcation of the Border  Between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Estonia"  which arrived via mass media. The Russian Federation did not  find it necessary to inform Estonia about this step through  diplomatic channels.    The Estonian Foreign Ministry notes that Russia's unilateral  decision was made at a time when, pursuant to the decision made  at the May meeting between the President of the Republic of  Estonia Lennart Meri, Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik and  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, a new impetus has been  given to the finding of solutions to on-going problems in  bi-lateral relations.    In the framework of the Estonian-Russian negotiations,  within  the working group on border issues, Estonia has steadfastly  sought solutions, including the creation of a legal basis for  the operations of the border guards. In the international  arena, Estonia has repeatedly presented initiatives to deal with  border- related differences of opinion with the Russian  Federation: last February Estonia proposed the naming of a  special representative of the Chairman of the CSCE, Estonia has  repeatedly offered to take the matter to the International Court  in the Hague, likewise, Estonia has proposed discussing the  border problem with Russia in the framework of the European  Stability Pact.    The only treaty in force which sets the border between the  Republic of Estonia and the Russian Federation is the 1920 Peace  Treaty of Tartu which the "National Border Book Between the  Estonian Democratic Republic and the Russian Socialist Federal  Soviet Republic records. The 1940 Soviet occupation of Estonia  did not affect the validity of this treaty. The August 24, 1991  Russian presidential decree in principle recognizes the legal  continuity of Estonia.    Russia's decision to unilaterally demarcate the border "in  the political and economic interests of the Russian Federation"  clearly violates the charter of the UN as well as CSCE  principles to resolve matters of dispute through negotiations,  without unilateral actions and without the use or the threat of  force.    The carrying out of the the Russian presidential decree  under  the current conditions would mean that, without the consent of  the other nation, one nation selects and proclaims an arbitrary  line to be the border between two nations. A line whose  delineation is not mutually agreed upon cannot be made a  national border.    In the complicated situation which has developed, the  Republic of Estonia reaffirms its willingness to solve the  question of the national border with Russia at the negotiating  table and calls upon Russia to forego all kinds of unilateral  actions in these questions.    The June 21, 1994 Russian presidential decree on unilateral  actions regarding the national border with Estonia leaves the  impression that the Russian Federation is not interested in the  normalization of relations with Estonia.</p>

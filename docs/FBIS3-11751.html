Many Latin American countries promoted its creation, and, at  last, during the International Conference on Human Rights held  in Vienna the necessary conditions were present. However, the  creation of the position of human rights high commissioner was  delayed a few more months. The Vienna Declaration entrusted  this task to the General Assembly. Some countries had  misgivings, but then something crucial happened. A work group  was created to dispel these misgivings, and its presidency was  bestowed on Ecuadoran Ambassador Jose Ayala Lasso. Thanks to  the diplomatic endeavors of the Ecuadoran representative an  agreement was quickly reached by all governments. On 20 December  1993 the General Assembly created the position of high  commissioner for human rights. On 14 February 1994 Ambassador  Ayala Lasso's efforts were rewarded with his appointment to the  position. [passage omitted]    Ayala is described by Emilio Cardenas, Argentine ambassador  to the United Nations, who has no doubts that the Ecuadoran  diplomat is the ideal person for the position.    [Begin Cardenas recording] There are issues that develop on  the international scene that are complex. At the same time their  histories are not always well known or taken into account. In  my opinion, these attributes of Ayala Lasso represent to all of  us not only a source of pride, but also the hope that a person  with his qualities will be the man who, for the first time, will  adequately perform in the position of human rights high  commissioner. [end recording]    The human rights high commissioner must be well versed on  the  topic and must have an impeccable reputation and a deep  understanding of different cultures in order to perform his  duties impartially, objectively, and efficiently. The  resolution creating the high commissioner's position establishes  that the high commissioner must have knowledge of all human  rights issues in the civilian, political, cultural, and economic  spheres. He also must respect each states' sovereignty, keeping  cultural differences in mind, and must abide by the principle  that human rights are universal and that all governments must  help guarantee them.    [Begin Ayala recording] This is a very important decision  taken by the United Nations, and it fulfills almost 50 years of  aspirations. In my opinion, it fundamentally consists of  creating a kind of spokesman for humanity's conscience, whose  objective will be to contribute, through dialogue and concerted  action, to the progress of human rights worldwide. [end  recording] [passage omitted]    Ambassador Ayala Lasso has been Ecuador's UN representative  since 1989. Formerly, he was ambassador to Peru, Belgium,  Luxembourg, and the EEC, as well as the Ecuadoran foreign  minister in 1977. He was also an international law professor at  the Central University of Ecuador and has published articles on  international issues in various newspapers. Ayala Lasso is a  lawyer and economist and has several university degrees.  [passage omitted]</p>

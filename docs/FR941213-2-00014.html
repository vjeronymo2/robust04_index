The regulations implementing Title III [''the Regulations''] are found at 15 CFR part 325. Pursuant to this authority, a certificate of review was issued on September 8, 1992 to International EXIM Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A certificate holder is required by law (Section 308 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 4018) to submit to the Department of Commerce annual reports that update financial and other information relating to business activities covered by its certificate. The annual report is due within 45 days after the anniversary date of the issuance of the certificate of review [Sections 325.14(a) and (b) of the Regulations]. Failure to submit a complete annual report may be the basis for revocation [Sections 325.10(a) and 325.14(c) of the Regulations].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Commerce sent to International EXIM Corporation on August 29, 1994, a letter containing annual report questions with a reminder that its annual report was due on October 23, 1994. Additional reminders were sent on October 24, 1994, and on November 16, 1994. The Department has received no written response to any of these letters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 7, 1994, and in accordance with &sect;325.10(c)[2] of the Regulations, a letter was sent by certified mail to notify International EXIM Corporation that the Department was formally initiating the process to revoke its certificate. The letter stated that this action is being taken for the certificate holder's failure to file an annual report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with &sect;325.10(c)(2) of the Regulations, each certificate holder has thirty days from the day after its receipt of the notification letter in which to respond. The certificate holder is deemed to have received this letter as of the date on which this notice is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . For good cause shown, the Department of Commerce can, at its discretion, grant a thirty-day extension for a response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the certificate holder decides to respond, it must specifically address the Department's statement in the notification letter that it has failed to file an annual report. It should state in detail why the facts, conduct, or circumstances described in the notification letter are not true, or if they are, why they do not warrant revoking the certificate. If the certificate holder does not respond within the specified period, it will be considered an admission of the statements contained in the notification letter (Section 325.10(c)[2] of the Regulations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the answer demonstrates that material facts are in dispute, the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice shall, upon request, meet informally with the certificate holder. Either Department may require the certificate holder to provide the documents or information that are necessary to support its contentions (Section 325.10(c)[3] of the Regulations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department shall publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the revocation or modification or a decision not to revoke or modify (Section 325.10(c)[4] of the Regulations). If there is a determination to revoke a certificate, any person aggrieved by such final decision may appeal to an appropriate U.S. district court within 30 days from the date on which the Department's final determination is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Sections 325.10(c)(4) and 325.11 of the Regulations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> W.

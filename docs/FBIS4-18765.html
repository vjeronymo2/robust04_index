			<p>BFN     [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- The party office of the  right-wing extremist German League in Cologne was completely  destroyed Friday night [8 April] in an arson attack. All files  and documents were also destroyed in the fire, which took  several hours to put out. Markus Beisicht, party chairman and  Cologne city council representative, estimated that material  damage amounts to well over 50,000 German marks.    By midday, no letter admitting responsibility had been  received. However, it is assumed that the perpetrators came from  left-wing anarchists, because of several calls in Cologne by an  "Antifascist Alliance" for the "destruction of the temporary  offices." In Beisicht's view, the attack means the work of the  party will be completely paralyzed for the next few weeks. The  German League, nonetheless, will take part in the Cologne local  government elections as planned.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Letter: Fallacy and geography in banking competition (1) Sir, There is a fallacy that more banks mean more competition. Anyone with experience of the banking system in the US or, for that matter, of certain countries within the EC would testify to this. The biggest threat to competition within the banking system comes not from whether there is one more or one less bank in the market but from over-regulation. While a degree of regulation is clearly necessary for the protection of depositors and for the overall health of the financial system, there is plenty of circumstantial evidence to suggest that protecting the existing status quo of the four clearing banks in the UK would mean less efficiency and less competition. An efficient banking market means keeping the market open to change and new entrants. There are a number of well qualified institutions which could compete in the product areas mentioned in Professor Bain's letter (April 21) and, by adopting an open market policy within a supervised environment, the regulatory authorities could ensure benefits to all interested parties - depositors, borrowers, shareholders and the public.

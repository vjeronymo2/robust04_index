			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Finnish group reaches Japanese phone accord NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, is taking a further step into Japan's multi-billion dollar cellular phone market after reaching a co-operation agreement with Kansai Digital Phone (KDP). Under the accord, the two companies will design a digital handheld phone for introduction onto the Japanese market in 1994 when KDP opens a 1.5 GHz cellular network in the Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe areas. KDP is one of the leading players in the mobile phone sector and is expected to capture as much as 20 per cent of the domestic market in 1995. The agreement represents a further important breakthrough for Nokia, as Japan, with 1.5m users, accounts for around 10 per cent of the worldwide mobile phone market. The group already has a collaboration accord in place with Nippon Idou Tsushin and is one of only two foreign suppliers, alongside Motorola, to have established a foothold in the Japanese market. The Japanese market is expected to expand rapidly when the digital networks are introduced in late 1993 or early 1994.</p>

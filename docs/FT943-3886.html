			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Observer: Hard pawn Pawnbroking thrives in the Niggardly Nineties, it would seem. So officials from the world's largest chain of pawnbrokers Cash America Investments, which is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (code PWN), swung in to Sweden recently to exploit the devastation caused by the country's banking crisis two years ago. The financiers, who hail from Fort Worth, Texas, and who in 1992 scooped up Britain's Harvey &amp; Thompson, found a whole new class of Swedes deeply distrustful of the banks after recent calamities. Before you could sing Pop goes the Weasel, they were offering Dollars 21m for Svensk Pantbelaning, the country's premier chain of 10 shops. The purchase takes the global empire to 326 outlets. Olle Fjordgren, chief executive of the 109-year-old Swedish business, reckons pawnshops now command 2 per cent of total lending to private individuals in his country. He claims to have squeezed a 55 per cent share of a market worth SKr550m and growing at 12 per cent per annum. To prove that those in hock no longer feel the need to frequent dingy back-street premises, Fjordgren's outfit, which draws the line at pawning fine art, now has a shop on Birger Jarlsgatan, one of Stockholm's snazziest streets in the heart of the financial district.</p>

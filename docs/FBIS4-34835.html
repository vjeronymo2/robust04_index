			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria O'Donnell from Ottawa] </F>   [Text] After signing an agreement on nuclear cooperation  with Canada, President Carlos Menem announced here that next  week he will send a bill to Congress asking for approval for  Argentina to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. "This is  the only step that is lacking so the country can receive credit  as a trustworthy country in the world," a diplomatic source  said, and he explained that the president's promptness is due to  the fact that the treaty is about to be revised and therefore it  is the appropriate time for Argentina to sign the document,  having refused to sign it in the 1970's.    The president's promptness also is due to the fact that, as  a  UN Security Council member, the Argentine Government told the  United States that it is willing to support that organization if  economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea for having  violated the treaty. If Jimmy Carter's mediation with North  Korea to get the latter to accept routine inspections of its  nuclear plants fails, then Argentina would find itself in the  position of sanctioning the Koreans without having signed the  treaty.    In the 1970's the following countries, in addition to  Argentina, did not sign the treaty: India, Pakistan, Israel,  Cuba, and Brazil, although Brazil, like Argentina, signed the  Tlatelolco Treaty, but it was not willing to sign the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty.    "The countries that do not sign the treaties are saying that  they reserve the right to develop nuclear technology for  non-peaceful means. But we already have changed our position,  and now we do not want to be left out of the meeting that will  be held in April to decide whether the treaty, which is for 30  years, should be extended," the diplomat said.    The most important local newspaper, the GLOBE AND MAIL, on  21  June on page 2 published an article lauding Menem for signing  the agreement with Canada and the announcement regarding the  treaty. Greenpeace [preceding word in English] had another  interpretation: It organized a small demonstration to protest  the agreement because the organization says the main objective  is to pave the way for the sale of the Canadian reactor Candu-3  to Argentina. "Argentina does not need it because it already  has one, but construction was postponed due to the lack of  funds," according to Greenpeace [preceding word in English].  "It is evident that Canada is interested in selling the Candu  to Argentina," admitted Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet.</p>

Thus, he called on  them to thoroughly implement our party's economic strategy.    We should thoroughly carry to accomplishment the  agriculture-  first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy in socialist  economic construction during the upcoming three years, which  were designated as an adjustment period at the 21st plenary  session of the Sixth Party Central Committee.    At the same time, we should give precedence to the coal  industry, electric power industry, and railway transport -- the  priority sector in the national economy -- and should  continuously develop the metal industry.    Our party's economic strategy is a just policy put forward  based on a deep analysis of changed circumstances and practical  demand of socialist construction in our country, and is a  revolutionary line for effecting a new upsurge in socialist  construction.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: During the  adjustment period of socialist economic construction, we should  thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic  strategy. Thus, we will firmly consolidate the foundation of the  nation's self-supporting economy and will more satisfactorily  ensure the people's living according to the demand of socialism.  We will hold a new position of attack to attain the higher goal  of socialism.    Our party's economic strategy will, above all, enable us to  consolidate rock-firm the foundation of the nation's  self-supporting economy.    We registered a great advance in the development of the  national economy during the Third Seven-Year Plan period. We  further consolidated our nation's economy to be a socialist  self-supporting national economy in which all domains, including  industry and rural economy, were armed with modern equipment and  which have sufficient segmental structure [pumun kujo].    The party's revolutionary economic strategy has elucidated  ways for strengthening self-reliance and the might of our  economy in every way while consolidating our achievements.    During the adjustment period of socialist economic  construction, we will further perfect segmental structure so  that the self- reliance of the nation's economy will be  strengthened.    In particular, we will continuously direct efforts to the  coal industry, electricity, and railway transport -- the  priority fields in the national economy -- and will more  satisfactorily resolve the problems of fuel, energy, and  transport. By implementing the revolutionary economic strategy,  we will be able to epochally develop our economy by depending on  the unbounded potential of our self-supporting economy and on  abundant natural resources. We will more vigorously accelerate  economic construction without wavering in the face of an  economic blockade by the imperialists and the worldwide economic  crisis.    Another economic strategy of our party is to more smoothly  guarantee the people's living standard in accordance with the  socialist demand. Endlessly enhancing the people's living  standard is the supreme principle of our party's activities.  During the recent years, our party took great interest in  enhancing the people's living standard even under the difficult  condition of carrying out the acute political and military  confrontation with the imperialists.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is anticipating  that the state investment will be increased in the agricultural,  light industrial, and foreign trade sectors, which are directly  related to the people's living, and that development in these  sectors will be vigorously accelerated. Therefore, if this  strategic policy is embodied, our people's century-old desire of  everyone eating rice and meat soup, wearing silk clothes, and  living in tile-roofed houses will be brilliantly realized, and  our people's material and cultural life will be all the more  abundant in accordance with the intrinsic demand of socialism.    As such, our party's revolutionary economic strategy makes  it  possible to more vigorously accelerate socialist construction by  consolidating, like bedrock, the country's self-supporting  economic basis and more smoothly guaranteeing the people's  living standard in accordance with the socialist demand.    The superiority of socialism of our own style will be more  vigorously displayed when thoroughly implementing our party's  revolutionary economic strategy, and we will also occupy a new  offensive camp to possess a higher ground of socialism.    Today we are faced with the task of highly upholding the  military task presented by the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song's New Year address and of thoroughly implementing our  party's revolutionary economic strategy.    This year is a significant year marking the passing of 30  years since the socialist rural theses was announced. We must  first of all vigorously carry out the struggle to complete the  historical task of the agricultural theses so that a new turning  point can be achieved in the development of the rural economy.  To achieve this, irrigation and electrification work must be  consolidated in the farms, mechanization and chemicalization  must be realized at a high level, and the chuche farming method  must be thoroughly implemented so that all sectors of  agricultural production, including food grain crop can be  further developed.    Next, the light industry revolution must be vigorously  accelerated so that a great innovation can be achieved in the  production of mass consumption goods. To achieve this, the  light industry plants must be put in good order, reinforced,  modernized, and active measures must be established to  strengthen the production of raw materials of the light  industry, including synthetic fiber and synthetic resins so that  all the light industry plants will operate at full capacity and  normalize production at a high level. Along with this, various  mass consumption goods must be produced at a large scale in all  sectors and units, the variety of consumer goods must be  increased, and their quality must be decisively enhanced.    Also, foreign trade must be developed to thoroughly  implement  our party's revolutionary economic strategy. To develop foreign  trade in accordance with the changed environment, foreign  markets must be actively sought and thoroughly maintain good  credit.    The production bases of export products must be firmly  consolidated in various sectors of the people's economy, the  production of export products must be increased, and their  quality must be enhanced. Along with this, the source of  exports must be actively investigated and mobilized in all  sectors and regions so exports can be increased and processing  trade can be developed.    Efforts must be put into the coal industry, electric  industry, and the metal industry to develop agriculture and the  light industry and vigorously accelerate the country's overall  economic construction. Also, rail transportation must be  carried out more smoothly.    All the functionaries, party members, and workers must  highly  uphold the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address  and thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic  strategy so that socialist construction can be more vigorously  accelerated.</p>

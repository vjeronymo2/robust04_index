			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned from authoritative sources that the  two main opposition leaders in Senegal -- Abdoulaye Wade and  Landing Savane -- were today charged with "threatening state  security," following investigations into riots in Dakar that  left eight persons dead, including six policemen. Wade and  Savane, secretary general of the Senegalese Democratic Party,  PDS, and the African Party for Democracy and Socialism, PADS,  respectively, were arrested on 18 February, 48 hours after the  riots, and were remanded in custody.    Wade's lawyer and an official of PADS have both confirmed  the  charges. The two opposition leaders' period in custody had been  extended twice, on 20 and 22 February.    Sixty-five other people were brought before the  investigating  judge, to prefer charges against them all, judicial sources said.</p>

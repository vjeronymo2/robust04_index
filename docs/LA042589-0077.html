			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Fireman's Fund Corp. : The Novato, Calif., insurance firm reported  first-quarter net income of $36.5 million, down 43% from a year ago. Revenue  slipped 15.7% to $830.7 million. The company attributed the revenue drop to its  attempts to hold the line on prices while commercial insurance rates weaken  throughout the industry. But despite the attempts, the company's underwriting  ratio, which measures the cost of insurance compared to revenue from premiums,  rose to 113.6% from 107.5% in the year-earlier quarter.  </P></p>

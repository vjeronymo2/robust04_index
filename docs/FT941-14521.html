			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Budget pushes up inflation The jump in the annual rate of headline inflation to 1.9 per cent in December - from 1.4 per cent in November - was largely due to Budget excise duty changes and the effect of mortgage rate cuts in December 1992 falling out of the index. Underlying inflationary pressures still appear relatively subdued. December's retail price index was 141.9 (1987=100), 0.2 per cent higher than November's 141.6. The annual increase was slightly lower than expected and meant that the headline rate stayed below 2 per cent for a full calendar year for the first time since 1946. The underlying annual rate of inflation excluding mortgage interest payments was 2.7 per cent, up from 2.5 per cent in November. But the Budget increases in excise duties, notably on petrol and tobacco, added about 0.3 per cent to the index, indicating that prices might otherwise have fallen during the month. The Central Statistical Office calculates that about three-quarters of the effect of increased excise duties came through in December. The main exception was tobacco, where wholesalers stocked up heavily before the Budget. Tobacco prices rose 2 per cent between November and December, but this change represents only about 40 per cent of the expected Budget increase. Motoring costs rose 1 per cent from November to December, for an annual increase of 5 per cent. Petrol prices increased by about 10p per gallon  - rather than 13.6p per gallon if the Budget increase had been passed on in full. Increased petrol costs were offset by price reductions in the second-hand car market. Food prices rose 0.2 per cent between November and December, for an annual rise of 0.8 per cent, but non-seasonal foods declined in price, particularly beef, soft drinks and dairy products. The annual increase in non-seasonal food prices, at 1.1 per cent, was the lowest since 1967. Household goods prices, up 0.7 per cent, also recorded the lowest annual increase since 1967, although they rose by 0.5 per cent between November and December. Alcohol prices fell 0.3 per cent on the month due to retailers offering reductions in the approach to Christmas. The main inflation measures are expected to rise further this month, as the 0.9 per cent fall in the RPI of January last year, caused by sharp discounting in the new year sales, falls out of the calculations. Mr Ian Shepherdson of Greenwell Montagu expects the January headline rate to be 2.5 per cent and the underlying rate to be about 3 per cent. He expects the rates to subside in subsequent months, however, and pointed to the Bank of England's preferred inflationary measure RPI Y, which excludes mortgages, indirect taxes and local authority taxes. Greenwell Montagu estimates that this measure fell to 2.3 per cent in December, from 2.6 per cent in November. The Retail Price Index is complied by the Central Statistics Office using a selection of more than 600 goods and services and based on 150,000 separate price quotations each month.  --------------------------------------------         UK INFLATION RATE: +1.9 PERCENT  -------------------------------------------- Food (seasonal) (21)            -0.8 percent Food (non-seasonal) (123)       +1.1 percent Catering (45)                   +5.0 percent Alcoholic drink (78)            +3.7 percent Tobacco (35)                    +9.0 percent Housing (164)                   -2.8 percent Fuel &amp; Light (46)               -1.4 percent Household goods (79)            +0.7 percent Household services (47)         +3.5 percent Clothing &amp; footwear (58)        +1.7 percent Personal goods, serv.

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Observer: Mini-barred Whose were the long faces outside the manager's office of the Sheraton Hotel in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, yesterday? Following an order from high up the military regime, the hotel's management confronted 90 of the VIPs residing at the hotel courtesy of the government's coffers, double-locked their rooms and asked them to pay cash in advance or leave. They left. The government is both the hotel's leading shareholder and by far its worst debtor. This year the state has run up a bill at the Sheraton of 240m naira (Dollars 11m at the official exchange rate), by retaining for its use 95 rooms and suites at an average cost of Dollars 50,000 a day. 'The government departments footing the bill claim that most of these people were supposed to have left the hotel months ago,' explains a civil servant. Anyway, who's counting, when the national debt runs to a tidy Dollars 30bn? Meanwhile, the departing guests should have seen it coming; in a broadcast last month, on the anniversary of his coming to power, General Sani Abacha warned that all Nigerians must make sacrifices because the economy was in such poor shape. Salt was rubbed into the wounds of the poor souls forced out: a few close presidential advisers are being allowed to remain and enjoy their customary state-funded plushness. At least everyone now knows who is in and who is out - literally.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Correspondent Lu Zhiyong (6629 2535 0516)] </F>   [Text] On 7 March, Li Zemin, secretary of the Zhejiang  Provincial CPC Committee, attended the opening ceremony of the  first term of the 1994 training class for provincial management  cadres sponsored by the party school under the provincial party  congress. He also exchanged views with those cadres on studying  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.  Liang Pingbo, member of the provincial CPC committee and head  of the provincial CPC committee's propaganda department,  presided over the opening ceremony. Li Zemin stressed the need  for all levels of leading cadres to conscientiously study Volume  3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the  "Decisions" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee; to grasp well work of overall importance; to  correctly understand and handle well the dialectical  relationship between reform, development, and stability; and to  ensure that the basic principle of the party work for this year  will be implemented in our province.    Li Zemin said "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up  wider, promote development, and maintain stability" are the  party's overriding task for this year. Reform is the motive,  development is the target, and stability is the guarantee and  prerequisite for China. The three conditions taken together are  an integrated whole. A correct understanding of the guiding  principle for this year's work will help continue and develop  the excellent situation in our province. The key for handling  well the relationship between the three conditions lies in  comprehensively and scientifically understanding Comrade Deng  Xiaoping thought on development, reform, and stability. He said  the issue of development is a very important idea in Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Under the conditions of developing a socialist  market economy and of reforming the financial, monetary, and  investment structures and when seeking development, we should  stop adopting the old, lax, and inefficient management style  which was characterized by superficial expansion, unplanned  investment, and single-minded pursuit of high output value;  instead, we should seek development through deepening the  reform, readjusting and optimizing the economic structure,  improving the quality of the entire economy, and raising  economic efficiency. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on reform  and opening up is one of the important parts of the theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and of the  party's basic line. Now the ideological and theoretical basis  for reform are in place. We should rely on reform measures to  solve the deep-seated contradictions and problems in economic  life. Reform entails risks. But we must not stop embarking on  our reform goals just because there are risks ahead. We need to  develop unified thinking and to make meticulous arrangements, in  order to reduce risks and to implement various reform measures  in a positive and steady manner. Li Zemin added that the most  important element in implementing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's call  for "stability as the overriding task" is to maintain economic,  social and political stability, and properly handle various  interests and relationships. At present, particular attention  should be given to upholding the authority of the CPC Central  Committee, to maintaining the unity and enforcement of the  government laws and orders, and to ensuring that reform, opening  up, society, and the economy develop in an orderly and healthy  manner.    Li Zemin said all levels of leading comrades should take the  lead in conscientiously studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and raising  their capability to solve complex contradictions and to cope  with various situations. The provincial CPC committee has  decided that cadres involved in management enroll in study  classes in six batches at the party school. They will  concentrate on studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping and the "Decisions" of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Sponsoring the  training classes for provincial management cadres is one of the  important measures adopted by the provincial CPC committee to  enhance leading cadres' ideological and theoretical levels. The  purpose is to make them well-prepared for the introduction of  new reform measures this year. As the provincial CPC committee  attaches great importance to the training classes, it will  assign a leading comrade to attend each of the training class so  that the leading comrade will join discussions and exchange  views with cadres attending the training class. He expressed  the hope that cadres attending the training class would  integrate the actual situation in our province's reform and  opening up with their own ideas; know well the emancipation of  mind and of seeking truth from facts which are the essence of  Marxism; raise the problem-analysis and problem-solving  capability by applying Marxist positions, viewpoints, and  methods; and improve administrative and leadership levels in a  down-to-earth manner.    Also attending the training-class opening ceremony were Yu  Wenhua, deputy secretary general and director of the general  office of the provincial CPC committee; Chen Sining, deputy head  of the organization department under the provincial CPC  committee; and Liu Guangyi and Tang Rongsheng, vice presidents  of the party school under the provincial CPC committee.</p>

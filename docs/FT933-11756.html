			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Survey of Resource Management - Buying-in Services (1): Contractors cash in on battle to keep down costs - Organisations in the public and private sectors are increasingly buying-in specialist services - or 'outsourcing' - allowing them to cut costs and concentrate on their core business activities BUYING-IN services as a better way of managing resources is a management idea whose time has come. It comes in many forms: outsourcing, contracting-out, facilities management, market-testing, compulsory competitive tendering, interim management. But whatever the label, it is steadily spreading throughout business and industry, and into the public sector. And a host of new and established companies see interesting opportunities for growth in selling services to private and public sector organisations. In its various guises, the underlying idea behind buying-in services is the same. Organisations should concentrate on their core activities and buy in other services they need from specialists. Good resource management means that they should 'stick to their knitting,' as the business schools would put it. In one sense, there is nothing new in the idea. Since the dawn of capitalism, business has functioned through the division of labour. Factories buy raw materials from mining companies, components from specialist manufacturers, and distribute their products using transport contractors. Initially this division of labour was between different steps in the chain of production. But increasingly, there has been a division of labour within each step in the chain. A car-maker, for example, will contract out support services necessary for the smooth running of the factory such as catering, cleaning and security. Making sandwiches and employing part-time cleaners require different skills to car-making, and specialist companies have sprung up to supply them. What is new is that this process has recently gone much further, as companies increasingly buy in services which are close to the core of their business. It is no longer low value-added services which are contracted out: highly skilled functions central to business success are now increasingly supplied by specialist contractors. For example, information technology has become increasingly the preserve of the specialist, with many non-IT companies finding it is no longer sensible to try and provide all their needs in-house. They may find it more convenient to have their IT function staffed by an outside facilities management contractor. Or they can go for outsourcing, buying in all their IT needs from a company which can offer leading edge technology and flexible capacity. Now outsourcing is going beyond IT, reaching right into the heart of businesses by providing personnel, training, accountancy, office services - even frontline staff for service organisations. Facilities management can involve contracting out the running of an entire plant or office facility to a specialist who may in turn sub-contract much of the work. Interim management can supply top managers to fill temporary vacancies or drive through special projects A good example of the extent to which core business functions can be contracted out is provided by IBM's UK national call management centre at Havant. The centre's 100 operators handle 27,000 calls a week from IBM customers requesting computer maintenance. Providing a responsive, high-quality service is central to the company's image. Yet the centre is staffed almost entirely by personnel supplied by Manpower, the recruitment specialists. Manpower recruits the staff, trains them and remains their employer. Indeed, Manpower managers fill five of the nine places on the centre's management committee. According to Mr Mike Coleman, the centre's manager, the arrangement gives him flexibility and keeps costs to a minimum. And although the key frontline staff are not his employees, the partnership with Manpower allows him to offer the quality of service he regards as essential if the centre is to win new call-handling business. Now well-entrenched in the private sector, buying-in services is spreading throughout the UK public sector. Once again, the process started in support services, with compulsory competitive tendering in the health service, local government and the civil service. During the 1980s, cleaning, laundry, catering, security, buildings maintenance, waste removal, reprographics and many other mainly blue-collar functions were contracted out. In some cases, contracts have been won by the existing staff, bidding as an in-house team. However, the in-house teams have had to form themselves into direct labour organisations, re-organised to become competitive in the market-place. In local government, they are set targets for rates of return on capital, so that they do not take undue advantage of their control of the existing assets. Thus, even when the in-house team wins, the pressures of competitive tendering make them perform as independent contractors, with the same incentives to cut costs and raise efficiency. From buying-in support services, contracting-out in the public sector is moving into white-collar areas of work, just as it did in business: In local government, compulsory competitive tendering is to be extended to white-collar services such as IT, housing management and corporate services from 1995. Many local authorities have already begun outsourcing some of these functions because they see it as a better way of providing non-core services. In central government, the market-testing programme will this year put 8 per cent of civil work out to tender, with similar amounts in each of the next three years. Core administrative tasks are being market-tested, reaching deep into the heart of Whitehall. Throughout the public sec-tor, the newly independent colleges, schools and hospitals are increasingly outsourcing and contracting-out to cut costs and improve effectiveness. Some of the biggest contracts in the public sector will be in information technology, with up to Pounds 750m of work potentially available in civil service departments alone. The market for bought-in IT services is now mature, with revenues of Pounds 4bn last year earned by the 200-plus members of the Computing Services Association. Other markets are equally substantial: contracted catering services are now worth over Pounds 800m a year, for example. The local government and health service market is estimated to be worth more than Pounds 2bn a year, while this year's civil service market-testing programme is worth Pounds 1.4bn. The value of local authority housing management contracts, due to go out to tender from 1996, is put at Pounds 1.25bn. The growth in buying-in of services has generated new business opportunities across a wide swathe of service industries. Traditional contractors now face competition from companies established to bid for public sector contracts. But it also requires new ways of working, for both the organisations which buy in services and the businesses which supply them. The key to outsourcing functions that are central to the success of the organisation is a close relationship between the customer and the contractor, according to Mr John Staples of EDS-Scicon, the largest services company in the world. He says that a common mistake is to treat buying in of services in the same way as purchasing hardware - looking for the cheapest price. 'It's more important to leverage in the right skills,' he says. Among customers, the benefits of buying-in services appear to be well appreciated. A survey of the UK market for facilities management by Computer Management Group found that FM had brought cost-savings and strategic advances for the majority of businesses in the survey. Three-quarters said that FM allowed management to concentrate on core business. Cost-savings were reported by 56 per cent of the companies, with only 15 per cent reporting cost increases. The main problem for the contractors appears to be assuaging the fears of companies which have not yet bought in services. Over 50 per cent of the non-FM users in the CMG survey, for example, worried that facilities management would lead to a loss of control over their organisations. Only 14 per cent of users said that this was a concern. However, the number of non-users appears to be rapidly shrinking: 35 per cent of the companies in the CMG survey were using FM, up from 25 per cent the year before. With 70 per cent forecasting an increase in facilities management in IT, the market for buying-in services looks set to both widen and deepen significantly over the next few years.</p>

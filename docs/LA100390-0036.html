			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Terms of Extermination: The Orkin Exterminating Co. is bugged over the product  placement deal it made with the nation's No. 1 box-office movie this week:  "Pacific Heights."  </P> <P> In a breach of contract suit filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles, Orkin said  that it had agreed to pay $20,000 in a deal to portray the company in a  favorable light. But "Pacific Heights" represented Orkin as "unwilling or  unable to perform competent extermination services," the suit said. The  contract specified that the company would be shown in a "non-disparaging"  manner. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

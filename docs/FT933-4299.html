			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Charles Baynes advances to Pounds 3.27m CHARLES Baynes, which yesterday announced a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 3.27m for the first half of 1993, is to expand its distribution side with the acquisition of Buck &amp; Hickman from P&amp;O for a maximum of Pounds 32.48m cash. 'We love distribution businesses,' said Mr John Perkins, finance director, adding that any company would like to acquire well and independently run, cash-generative businesses from larger groups returning to their cores. B&amp;H, a distributor of engineers' tools, consumables and equipment in the UK, will keep its present management and will operate on a stand-alone basis within Baynes. The purchase will be funded by the issue of some 34.5m 5.8p (net) mandatorily convertible preference shares at 100p each to raise about Pounds 33.3m net. They are convertible at 69p per share and will be available in an open offer to ordinary shareholders on a 1-for-4 basis. SG Warburg will subscribe for any shares not taken up in the offer. Mr Perkins said that with an acquisition of this size, Baynes wanted the net profits of B&amp;H to service the preference shares. In 1992, it made operating profits of Pounds 3.5m on turnover of Pounds 48.2m. At the end of 1992, its tangible assets were Pounds 20.3m; after deducting dividends to P&amp;O and before an intra-group loan note of about Pounds 11m that Baynes is also acquiring, assets will fall to Pounds 15.5m at October 2. Mr Perkins said that Baynes' balance sheet would remain strong: after the buy shareholders' funds will stand at about Pounds 40m after some Pounds 17m goodwill write-off from B&amp;H. Group operating profits in the half grew to Pounds 3.09m (Pounds 1.62m) on turnover up at Pounds 39.3m (Pounds 37.2m). Acquisitions in the period contributed Pounds 735,000 and Pounds 7.52m respectively. On an annualised basis continuing businesses made profits of Pounds 2.36m (Pounds 1.52m) on turnover flat at Pounds 31.8m. Margins were improved through job losses and Baynes capital expenditure programmes. The interim dividend is lifted to 0.575p (0.525p), payable from adjusted earnings of 1.65p (1.05p) per share.</p>

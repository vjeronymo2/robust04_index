			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Campaign clamps down on speeding Mr Robert Key, roads and traffic minister, said the government would give a high priority to its anti-speeding campaign being launched this week. He compared speeding motorists to drunken drivers and told the 59th National Road Safety Congress in York: 'A decade of campaigning has changed public attitudes to drinking and driving. Now we must do the same for speed.' About Pounds 600,000 would be devoted to the anti-speeding campaign.</p>

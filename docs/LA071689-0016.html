			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOSE OLD ROCKERS  </P> <P> Regarding "Never Too Old to Rock" by Robert Hilburn, June 25, and the letters  that followed on July 9:  </P> <P> I think the media makes too big an issue over whether musicians such as the Who  are "too old to rock," and spends an inordinate amount of time mulling over the  merits of new music vs. old music, pop music vs. rock music, and so on.  </P> <P> Music is music! It's meant to be enjoyed, not analyzed, scrutinized and  categorized to death.  </P> <P> And if it's truly good music, it doesn't matter if the artists are 21 or 91.  </P> <P> PAM MARSH  </P> <P> Walnut  </P></p>

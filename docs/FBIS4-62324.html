			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Geneva, 13 May -- "Our task has been to encourage  all the parties in the Bosnian conflict toward reasonable  decisions," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said when  speaking on the results of the meeting held here today by the  foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and five  member-countries of the European Union. Speaking at a news  conference, he noted that "the process of working out political  decisions has been started through joint efforts." Those  attending the talks had striven "to encourage the sides in the  search for peaceful decisions, to prevent military actions and  to assist in a settlement."    The meeting adopted a joint communique which defines the  priority moves. "The foundation has been laid for a new stage,  when the main political forces of the world act on an agreed  basis," the Russian minister said. He particularly noted the  call on the conflicting parties to stop hostilities and to start  talks in the next two weeks. The general position on the  territorial issue is also of great importance whereby a  Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia could have 51 percent of  the territory and Bosnian Serbs 49 percent.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher explained at the  news conference that it is essentially a question in this case  of the parameters which were specified earlier which are now  being proposed as "a basis for further progress."    According to French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe the  participants of the present Geneva meeting are prepared, if need  be, to meet again next week.</p>

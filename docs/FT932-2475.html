			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / EBRD under fire for lack of impact on eastern Europe THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development's investments have made an inadequate impact on eastern Europe's economies, according to a confidential report commissioned by Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president. The report - by Mr Martin Paijmans and Mr Stanley Katz, consultants who have worked for the EBRD - says the 'bank's impact comes up short as compared to the use of its resources'. In the two years since the bank was created, private-sector financing 'has been concentrated in fewer than a half-dozen recipient countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Russia)'. It accuses the EBRD of failing to make a 'coherent . . . contribution to the (east European) economic transition process'. It adds that when the bank has funded public-sector projects only a few countries have benefited and investments have been confined to a few sectors: notably communications, construction and energy. Of the 25 countries the EBRD can assist, 'some nine or 10 . . . have received little or no financial assistance'. In his preface to the report, given to the bank's 23 directors, Mr Attali says it is 'one element' in his decision to propose a radical reorganisation of the bank's management. The board has also received a report by Mr Attali recommending the creation of three senior management positions, all reporting to him. He urges, as do Mr Katz and Mr Paijmans, that the bank's development banking and merchant banking operations should be merged and divided into three 'operations departments', each covering a group of countries. At the moment, merchant banking provides private-sector investments, while development banking concentrates on financing infrastructure projects. However, Mr Katz and Mr Paijmans say there is increasing duplication of staffing and organisations in the two departments, which confuses potential clients. They say the bank's basic flaw is that its investments have been based on the merits of individual projects, rather than the needs of a particular economy, curbing the bank's influence on the development of the private sectors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [David Sharrock report: "Loyalists Hint at Ceasefire"] </F>   [Text] Belfast -- Loyalist sources indicated last night  that they are seriously considering a call from the Ulster  Unionist leader, James Molyneaux, for an immediate halt to their  campaign of violence.    The hint came as pressure intensified on Sinn Fein to issue  a  definitive response to the Downing Street Declaration.    The leading republican Martin McGuinness yesterday welcomed  the Government's response to Sinn Fein's 20 questions. He  called it "a small step in the slowly evolving peace process,"  and said Sinn Fein's reply would come within "a few short  weeks." But while Mr McGuinness said he did not know whether an  IRA ceasefire would result, the Irish prime minister, Albert  Reynolds, called for an immediate cessation of violence by  republicans and loyalists.    In a significant statement aimed primarily at loyalist  paramilitaries, Mr Molyneaux said the declaration made no  distinction between various terrorist groups, which would become  eligible -- three months after a permanent renunciation of  violence -- to enter exploratory talks on participation in the  democratic process.    Amid reports that senior Unionists have been involved in  secret talks with loyalist paramilitaries, Mr Molyneaux denied  knowledge of "high-level" contacts, but admitted that party  representatives had met "people close to the paramilitaries."    The Belfast Telegraph reported that Unionist politicians  hoped the Combined Loyalist Military Command, an umbrella body  of the illegal Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer  Force, would consider entering talks.    Mr Molyneaux said it would be a small step for the loyalist  paramilitaries to enter the democratic process. "There is no  bar now to any paramilitary body terminating violence after a  period of three months entering into exploratory discussions."    Sources close to the loyalist leaderships said that Mr  Molyneaux's request would be given serious consideration and  hinted at a "gesture."    But they also said they were studying the Government's  response to Sinn Fein's questions and expressed reservations  about Dublin's involvement.</p>

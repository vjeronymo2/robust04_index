			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Books: Empire on fast-forward THE RISE AND FALL OF THE BRITISHEMPIRE by Lawrence James Little, Brown Pounds 25, 704 pages According to the ABC For Baby Patriots of 1899, 'C is for Colonies/ Rightly we boast,/ That of all the great nations/ Great Britain has the most'; the infant who absorbed this in his nursery would soon graduate to the toy lead soldiers which became a craze after 1890. But Lawrence James understands that there was another point to colonialism beyond and behind military conquest: in Charles Dickens' words, 'The earth was made for Dombey and Son to trade in . . .' The British Empire was one of the fundamentals of the modern age and we, in our post-imperial decline, may still not be in the mood to acknowledge or understand its significance to our own society, let alone to the wider world. James here tackles a colossal - impossible - task with an ambition betrayed in his Gibbon-esque title, The Rise and Fall of the British Empire. He has bitten off more than he (or you and I) can chew. We are conducted, briskly, from the Elizabethan sea-dogs to Rhodesia's UDI and our imminent evacuation of Hong Kong. Out of these 400 years, it is true that the latter half of the book is given to this present century, but again and again the reader implores James - who has the style of the fluent and excellent history master which I suspect he used to be - to slow down, take his time and develop just a few of his points. Or perhaps to ditch early Virginia, the Caribbean acquisitions and India and a host of other, no doubt fascinating topics, and focus on the decline of the Empire, which is the more interesting bit. Or, best of all, to write two - three? - books. Everything is here, and that is the problem - the imperial drive of the Cromwellian years; the gunboat diplomacy of Palmerston's 'unofficial empire'; the New Imperialism of the European powers just a century ago; Gladstone's campaign against 'Beaconsfieldism'; the 1890s scramble for China; the constant and supreme importance of India, both economically and militarily; the Empire's vital contribution to the first world war; the stagnation, snobbery and racism of the years between the wars; the emergence of America to take over the defence of the British Empire; the optimism of the handover to Commonwealth. It must be evident that the canvas is impossibly wide. Too often James makes a stimulating point (for instance, that by 1942 the US had become Europe's banker and armourer just like Britain in the Napoleonic wars; that victory in the pre-1914 naval race between England and Germany would go to the economically-stronger, as in the recent US-Soviet Star Wars) and cannot allow himself to develop it. Sometimes he misfires: the Cold War is not helpfully compared with the Great Game over India, for example; and Mountbatten's promotion was not the result of Churchill's search for another TE Lawrence. The more important criticism is that Britain's imperial decline demands a more sustained analysis than the fleeting references we get here to the difficulties of becoming a 'second fiddle'. The Rise and Fall of the British Empire justifies a (thick) space on your shelves not for any revelatory brilliance or literary elegance so much as for its value as a quick aide memoire: if you have temporarily forgotten the essence of the Corn Laws debate, or the occasion for the Crimean War, or the role of aerial bombing of the Sudan in the 1920s, then here is a valuable reference point. Beyond that, the reasonably well-informed reader will feel rather as you do after dipping into an American news magazine: it is all perfectly convincing until you come to a subject which you know about - and then it, and therefore the rest, really will not do.</p>

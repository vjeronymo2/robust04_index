			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Greens withdraw from talks on nuclear energy A YEAR-LONG attempt to reach an all-party consensus on the future of Germany's nuclear energy has failed following the decision by the Green party to withdraw from the talks. The Greens, who want all nuclear plants in Germany closed down, said the talks were meaningless because the government coalition parties were unwilling to compromise on their pro-nuclear position. However, the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who have called for phasing out nuclear energy, said they would continue talks with the government and the nuclear industry. In lower Saxony, which has a SPD/Greens coalition government, Mr Gerhard Schroder, the premier, and a key player in the negotiations, said his party would spend the summer trying to define the areas in which a compromise could be reached. The talks aimed to clarify the long-term prospects for Germany's nuclear industry. Issues include deciding on how many years existing plants can continue to operate, whether they will be replaced at the end of their lifetime and how to dispose of nuclear waste. Atomforum, the nuclear industry's main lobby, welcomed the fact that negotiations between the SPD and the government parties would continue. It said the departure of the Greens would facilitate a compromise. But the break-down of the consensus talks will make it more difficult to reach a solution on the disposal of nuclear waste. The Greens are members of the SPD coalition government in two states where nuclear waste disposal plans have been mooted. Seven leading European electricity companies yesterday repeated opposition to proposals for a European Community energy tax, intended to help combat global warming, adds Bronwen Maddox, Environment Correspondent. The joint statement, first made a year ago, was reissued yesterday in London at a conference because the companies believe there is growing pressure for the tax in Brussels. The signatories are: Powergen and Scottish Power (UK), Electrabel (Belgium), Union Fenosa and Endesa (Spain), RWE and VEAG (Germany).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Eduardo Alves: "PSDB Opinion: Ciro Gomes </F> Is Organizing His Candidacy"]    [Text] Fortaleza--The talks regarding an alliance between  the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] led to an exchange of  accusations yesterday between Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio  Fleury Filho (PMDB) and Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes (PSDB). The  day before yesterday, Ciro criticized an alliance with the PMDB.  Fleury said yesterday that "instead of speaking cholerically,  the governor ought to taking care of the cholera in his  state"--a reference to the fact that Ceara leads the nation in  cholera cases.    "All indications are that he (Ciro) wants to become a  candidate thanks to Fernando Henrique's failure," Fleury said.  Fleury also said that it was the president of the PSDB, Tasso  Jereissati, who had asked him to initiate talks. He said  sarcastically: "Since they are both from the same state, they  should have discussed the matter."    Ciro Gomes reacted with sarcasm to the statement that he was  unable to control cholera in Ceara and that that was why he was  making choleric statements. "I think that shot was fired from  Carandiru," he said, referring to the massacre of 111 prisoners  at Carandiru in 1992.    "The shot was fired from Carandiru because, first of all,  cholera is an epidemic all over Latin America, and governments  have little control over it in the present circumstances.  Second, because treating its effects requires good health care.  And since health care is a municipal responsibility, it is the  responsibility of the local government, which here in Fortaleza  has been under the control of Fleury's PMDB for many years,"  Gomes said.    The governor also said that he "would rather leave politics"  than appear on the same platform as the former governor of Sao  Paulo, Orestes Quercia, in the presidential race. "The PSDB came  into existence as a rejection of Quercia politics, which  constitutes the worst element of Brazilian politics, and for  that reason an electoral alliance will not have my support,"  Ciro said.    The PSDB leadership believes that Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes  has decided to enter the race for president of the republic.  Ciro's statements bombarding the already difficult alliance with  the PMDB, his attacks on Lula, and his constant attempts to  obtain space in the media are leading PSDB leaders--mainly those  in Sao Paulo--to bet that Ciro's short-term goal is Planalto  Palace.    Ciro's sudden appearance in the presidential scenario has  intensified the quarrel between the Ceara and Sao Paulo groups  of the PSDB. Although it is not admitted publicly, there are  disagreements between the two wings. The view of the group  closest to Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is that although  it may not have been intentional, Ciro has done a great  disservice to Fernando Henrique's plan and indirectly to the  minister's candidacy by provoking a verbal duel with the PMDB.    If Fernando Henrique is unable to make his candidacy work,  the Ceara governor will have room to become a presidential  candidate himself, say PSDB members close to the minister. But  even while criticizing Ciro's attack on the PMDB, top PSDB  leaders admit that an electoral alliance between the two parties  was already practically impossible anyway.    In the PSDB, there is talk of the "Garrincha effect" in the  group put together by Senator Pedro Simon (PMDB, Rio Grande do  Sul) to unite the two parties for the October elections. The  reference is to the soccer player who, following a complicated  explanation by his coach on how to reach the opposing goal,  asked: "Did you make a deal with the opponent?" In this case,  the opponents are former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia and  the quarrels between the PMDB and PSDB at the state level.    Relations between the two parties are very complicated in  such states as Sao Paulo, Ceara, Bahia, Minas Gerais, Parana,  and others. Members of the PSDB, especially Senator Mario Covas  (Sao Paulo), have been saying over and over that in combined  elections like those to be held in October, it will be very  difficult to explain to the voters why state alliances are  different from the national alliance.    In talks with PSDB leaders, Simon has been insisting that a  strong movement for union between the two parties might corral  Quercia and make him refrain from running for president. But  neither Simon nor Deputy Luiz Henrique, the PMDB's national  president, who also wants a coalition, can give a conclusive  answer when the PSDB asks them for guarantees that the agreement  will not be shot down by Quercia.    The PSDB comes away from its talks with the PMDB with the  impression that former Minister Antonio Britto is beginning to  enjoy the talk about a possible presidential candidacy. But  Britto also fears Quercia's influence in a possible boycott of  his candidacy.  <H5>  Ciro Meets With Maluf, Gives Speech </H5>   Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes (PSDB) will begin his schedule  today by having breakfast with Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf (PPR  [Progressive Renewal Party]), after which he will address 27  foreign press correspondents stationed in Brazil.    The subject of Ciro's speech will be "Post-Collor Brazil and  Economic Prospects for 1994." The journalists are in Fortaleza  to attend the seminar on "Foreign Correspondents and National  Reality" that is being sponsored jointly by the Ceara  Secretariat of Culture and the National Federation of  Journalists.    According to Ciro, the meeting with Maluf "is a gesture" of  courtesy, and the meeting with journalists has no connection  with the presidential race. "Actually, I am an anticandidate. If  I wanted to be a candidate, I would be traveling around the  Amazon Region or involved in administrative matters rather than  making statements that only make enemies for me," he said.</p>

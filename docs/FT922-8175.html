			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Elections bring changes in fortune - But the Easter holidays kept turnover low in April Election fever coursed through Europe last month but the results had contrasting repercussions in the Italian and the UK stock markets. In general, volume was subdued, with Easter and May Day creating a holiday mood which extended for nearly two weeks. The return of the Conservative party to government in the UK was doubly welcomed by the market, which had been battening down the hatches, either for the uncertainty of a coalition or the unknown of a Labour administration. Utilities, which had been depressed by fears of renationalisation, attracted very heavy buying. Following an initial boost immediately after the general election result, investors settled down to wait for some real corporate stimulus. This was not long in coming as Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation launched a Pounds 3.3bn bid for Midland Bank, soon followed by a counter-offer from Lloyds Bank. Signs that an end to the recession might be in sight also lifted sentiment. Lacking a government of any sort, Italy free-wheeled and the manifest rise in April was due to an exceptionally weak March, when volume had been depressed by uncertainty about the outcome of the elections. According to Mr James Cornish of County NatWest, which supplies the data, April volume was nearly 9 per cent down on the average of the previous three months, while trading on Seaq International in London Spain continued to underperform the rest of Europe, with daily average turnover a very modest Pta7bn, although activity was restrained by the Semana Santa holiday preceding Easter. According to James Capel, activity was depressed by high interest rates, a lack of foreign interest, and the continued growth of mutual funds which took money out of equities. There is little prospect of an upturn, it says, until interest rates are reduced. General expectations are that today's Spanish April inflation data will reveal only a small increase over March, giving further encouragement for the cut in interest rates which could get the equity market going again. However, Mr Stephen Hughes of Nikko Europe in London believes Spain is unlikely to follow the UK and France in easing monetary policy in the short term. He expects the annual inflation rate to exceed the government's target and is currently forecasting a 6.6 per cent rate. The prospect of strikes in the public service sector in Germany, which began at the end of the month, was taken calmly by the market. Car manufacturers provided one of the sectors which performed well during the month, following the announcement by Daimler that it would increase its 1992 dividend by DM1 to DM13 and positive forecasts for increased sales of new vehicles.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER               Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse                Jan       Feb       Mar       Apr       US                      1992      1992      1992      1992    dollarsbn Belgium             55.85     46.72     48.28     51.36         1.51 France             141.18    116.18    108.97    112.17        20.10 Germany            134.30    126.20    126.68    107.90        65.28 Italy            9,665.20  8,948.80  5,944.80  7,457.20         6.00 Netherlands         16.10     14.10     11.60     12.20         6.55 Spain              637.26    667.83    607.28    461.52         4.44 Switzerland         13.20     10.90     11.88     12.48         8.22 UK                  36.40     29.61     32.59     41.17        73.04  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

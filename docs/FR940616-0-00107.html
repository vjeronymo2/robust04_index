The Secretary reviewed the definition of community rehabilitation program in preparing regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992. There is not an exact match between the expanded definition of community rehabilitation program in Title I of the Act and the legislative definition of related agency in Title III. Therefore, ``community rehabilitation program'' was not used in the definition of related agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Including Specific References to Culturally Diverse Populations in Appropriate Sections of the Regulations (&sect;&sect;386.1, 386.20, 386.33, and 386.40) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters felt that, although individuals who are unserved or underserved by programs under the Act are specifically referenced in the description of the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program, policies and procedures to include culturally diverse recruitment and retention efforts should be implemented for all 30 categories of rehabilitation training. Selection criteria should be modified to give credit for program development related to culturally diverse populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees that it is essential that all requirements in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, are implemented to ensure equal access and outreach for traditionally underserved populations, including minorities. At present, the primary method for directing rehabilitation training program grantees to meet those requirements is through the assurances mandated for each applicant. The Department is currently working to implement section 21 of the Act, including outreach services and other related activities, to enhance the capacity of minority institutions to compete for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements. In the future, the Department may propose specific priorities or selection criteria that address needs of traditionally underserved populations across the range of rehabilitation discretionary programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Minimum 10 Percent Matching Requirement (&sect;386.30) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many comments were received objecting to the requirement that the Federal share of an award may not be more than 90 percent of the total cost of a project under this program. A number of commenters pointed out that the eight percent indirect costs currently allowed by the Department on training awards do not cover current administrative costs. Concern was expressed that many universities would not provide a 10 percent match. Some commenters observed that the present negotiated system offers flexibility. Many commenters pointed out that post-employment training programs for community rehabilitation personnel would have difficulty with the 10 percent required match. Some university commenters indicated that their institutions face substantial resource problems. Other commenters asked if the match could be in-kind. One commenter wrote that the limitation of 90 percent Federal support for proposed projects is fair and reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, requires a matching component for rehabilitation training grants. The Secretary believes that, if the Department states the minimum matching amount in advance of negotiations, the award process is more understandable and efficient. Most current academic grantees under the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program have negotiated awards with a match in excess of 10 percent. The Secretary is aware that a number of non-academic, post-employment training grantees under this program have experienced difficulty meeting even a 10 percent matching requirement. This problem will be solved, in part, by funding some future awards with a post-employment focus under the Rehabilitation Continuing Education program in which the current matching requirement as presented in recent closing date announcements is four percent. In all instances, the applicant share may be in-kind. As a result of a recent program audit that identified problems in the use of faculty time for in-kind matching, the Secretary prefers that the applicant share in the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program by directly funding student scholarship assistance as the designated match.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The 10 percent matching requirement remains, but a new provision has been added indicating that the Secretary may waive part of the non-Federal share of the cost of the project if the applicant demonstrates during the negotiations process that it does not have sufficient resources to contribute the entire match.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Requirements for Directing Grant Funds: Adverse Impact of the Requirement That a Grantee Must Use at Least 75 Percent of Total Award for Scholarships as Defined in &sect;386.4 (&sect;386.31) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous commenters, primarily from community rehabilitation programs and related personnel training programs, expressed concern that the proposed 75 percent scholarship requirement would limit access of community rehabilitation program personnel to needed continuing education programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees that personnel employed in community rehabilitation programs should continue to receive short-term, continuing rehabilitation training. This will be accomplished by offering that training under other, more appropriate Rehabilitation Training program categories, including 34 CFR part 389 (Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs) and 34 CFR part 390 (Rehabilitation Short-Term Training). The Secretary believes that the availability of needed post-employment training for community rehabilitation personnel will be provided through regional continuing education programs. However, the Secretary wants to ensure that all currently funded multi-year long-term training projects continue for the remainder of their project period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

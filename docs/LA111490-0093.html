			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BODY FOUND DUMPED OFF SIDE OF ROAD  </P> <P> Los Angeles police were investigating the death of a man whose bludgeoned body  was found Tuesday dumped off the side of a road in the hills above Studio City.  </P> <P> The unidentified body, believed to have been that of a man between 30 and 35  years old, was found about 2 p.m. in a brushy area below the road in the 7800  block of Mulholland Drive, Lt. Ron LaRue said.  </P> <P> The man was 6 feet tall with short brown hair and mustache, and wore a red,  short-sleeved shirt with stripes, gray shorts and white tennis shoes, Detective  Mike Coffey said.  </P> <P> The cause of death was unknown but the case was being handled as a homicide.  Coffey said the victim appeared to have been hit several times in the upper  torso, and possibly the head, with a blunt instrument.  </P> <P> "It appears that he was dragged to the edge and then pushed over the side,"  LaRue said.  </P> <P> The body was 70 feet below the road on a steep hillside, wrapped in a blanket  or sleeping bag. At least one person saw it as early as 7 a.m., Coffey said,  "but they didn't know it was a person."  </P> <P> A woman who lives in the area "got a closer look around 1 p.m." as she walked  along the road, "thought it might be a body" and called police, he said.  </P></p>

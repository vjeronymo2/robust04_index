			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / BP's 40% rise beats expectations British Petroleum yesterday exceeded analysts' expectations with second-quarter profits of Pounds 335m, more than 40 per cent up on the same period last year in spite of lower oil prices. The company's first-half profits - on a relacement cost basis - rose from Pounds 471m to Pounds 640m. Its shares closed 7p higher at 418 1/2 p. The strong second quarter performance was attributed to increased productivity, lower costs and volume growth. It was achieved against a background of oil prices Dollars 3 a barrel lower than the same period last year and intense competition in downstream markets, according to Mr David Simon, chief executive. He said BP was achieving its goals set two years ago. These were to: reduce debt by Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) a year; increase replacement cost profits to Dollars 2bn a year; and keep annual capital spending below Dollars 5bn. Mr Steve Ahearne, finance director, said disposals were on course to raise Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn this year. Positive underlying cashflow allowed BP to repay Dollars 336m in debt in the second quarter and total debt had fallen to Dollars 11.4bn from a peak in 1992 of more than Dollars 16bn. Gearing was 70 per cent. Executives were optimistic that all BP's market segments would enjoy some improvement in the second half. Exploration and production profits rose 27 per cent from the previous quarter to Pounds 479m, boosted by increased oil and gas output, stronger oil prices and cost savings. Refining and marketing margins suffered, however, as crude prices rose. Profits of Pounds 133m were well down on Pounds 228m in the first quarter and Pounds 197m last year. Economic recovery in the US and Europe helped to lift chemicals earnings to Pounds 45m, from a Pounds 23m loss. Although executives described the cyclical upturn in chemicals as 'hesitant', Mr Simon said: 'We are more sanguine about the spreading economic recovery.' Analysts said the results also suggested that BP's medium-term position was improving. Mr Simon said the company would continue to focus on efficiency and cost-cutting measures. Other factors, such as higher crude prices, rising volumes from new big fields and increased demand were likely to play a greater part in underpinning profits. The company reported a structural change in its tax position which should result in its effective tax rate falling by as much as 10 percentage points to the mid-to-high 30 per cent band. Earnings per share rose to 6.1p, from 5.6p in the first quarter and 4.4p a year ago. A dividend of 2.5p was announced, the same as the first quarter but up from 2.1p a year ago. Lex, Page 16</p>

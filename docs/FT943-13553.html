			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Construction industry reform 'could reduce costs by 30%' Radical proposals to reduce contract abuses and improve services could cut construction costs in Britain by 30 per cent by the end of the century, according to a wide-ranging review of the industry published yesterday. The independent review sponsored by the industry and government called for new legislation to improve payment and disputes procedures. A Construction Contracts bill would require independent adjudicators to be appointed to resolve conflicts, reducing the need for costly litigation. Trust funds would hold contract cash to protect companies should customers or contractors fail. The bill would also allow sub-contractors to charge punitive interest for late payments. The measures would be expected to become standard features of all construction contracts. The report was welcomed by the industry and its customers. Mr Stuart Humby, National Westminster procurement director, said: 'The experience of companies in the US and Japan has shown us that a modern partnership approach can reduce conflict and dramatically drive down construction costs.' Sir Brian Hill, president of the Construction Industry Employers Council, described the proposals as 'bold and perceptive'. The Department of Environment, which is thought to strongly support the recommendations, is due to publish its response next week. The review, led by Sir Michael Latham, a former Conservative MP and ex-director of the Housebuilders Federation, was the biggest inquiry into the industry since the Branwell report in 1964. It calls for the formation of a powerful new industry steering group - led by the environment secretary - which would assist in the development of new contract forms and management practices. A new code of practice to be sponsored by the DoE would establish a well defined framework of management and contractual responsibilities for a wide range of jobs. The bill would also include legislation on building defects, including a mandatory requirement to insure developments for up to 10 years after construction. A levy on premiums would be used to fund construction research. The review also calls for a customers' forum, representing the industry's leading private sector clients. Registers of approved consultants and contractors for all public sector work would be operated by the DoE to reduce tendering costs. Review builds hopes, Page 9</p>

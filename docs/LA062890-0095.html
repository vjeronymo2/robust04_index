			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVATIVE PARTIES IN FRANCE UNITE IN FRONT TO CURB EXTREMISTS  </P> <P> France's two leading opposition parties have formed a united front to stop  voters drifting toward the extreme right-wing National Front of Jean-Marie Le  Pen.  </P> <P> Paris Mayor and former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and former President  Valery Giscard d'Estaing announced late Tuesday night they had struck a deal to  unite their Rally for the Republic Party (RPR) and Union for French Democracy  (UDF) parties under a new label, "Union for France."  </P> <P> Under the accord, the Union is to present a single candidate in the 1995  presidential race who will be elected in a U.S.-style primary election of  right-wing voters and local council members.  </P> <P> In other ballots, notably the 1993 general elections, the new movement, to be  headed by a 30-person executive, will designate a joint candidate for each  constituency.  </P> <P> Giving a clear signal that it aims to avoid local electoral deals with Le Pen's  National Front, a 10-point charter signed by the two leaders said backing will  be restricted to candidates "who defend its political and moral values."  </P> <P> The National Front has outdistanced the conservative right in several recent  by-elections and according to opinion polls could muster around 17% of the vote  if an election were held now.  </P> <P> "After 10 years of talk about union, the emergency caused by the growth of the  National Front has finally spawned a new political tool," the left-leaning  daily Liberation said. "But will it bring back the voters lost to the extreme  right?"  </P> <P> Both Chirac's neo-Gaullist RPR and the group of parties under Giscard  d'Estaing's leadership in the umbrella UDF are suffering from internal strife  and loss of morale after a string of electoral losses against the Socialists  since 1988.  </P></p>

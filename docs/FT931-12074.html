			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Private View: A German doctor at Britain's bedside ROBERT Bischof is a German manager who has spent half his life destroying Britain's manufacturing industry. Now he wants to rebuild it. He has taken his ideas to John Smith, leader of the Labour Party. Why Labour? 'In the UK, it's a social stigma for businessmen to vote Labour - but that's Labour's fault. In my country, it's quite different. I don't support them out of political allegiance but because of economic necessity. I feel they are close to changing the British system to something that can work.' The Conservative government could not do it, Bischof said, even if John Major wanted to, because it had got itself stuck in an ideological cul-de-sac. 'For example, 'trickle-down' has turned out to be absolute rubbish. Aspirations for getting richer are so limitless that if the rich can keep it to themselves they will never let anything trickle down.' So Bischof has decided that industry's last hope lies with Labour: provided, that is, the Labour party can be persuaded to give up class war, throw away its cloth cap, look attractive to the middle classes, embrace regulated capitalism and strive for a social market consensus along German lines that will put an end to the stop-go, politicised management of the economy for ever. His proposal is revolutionary but not new: it was much canvassed in the 1970s. What is new, says Bischof, is the urgency. Like the car on the roller-coaster, the British economy emerges weaker and slower from each recessionary plunge. And with President Clinton in the White House and Labour chewing over its fourth general election defeat in a row, he thinks the time for the Big Idea has arrived. Bischof has two excuses for his alien presumption. The first is that he has lived and worked in England for 25 years, regards it as home and wants to go on liking his adoptive country. The second is that he knows only too well how easy it is for a foreign company entering the boom-and-bust British market to cut the native opposition to shreds. He has done it himself. In 1967, he was sent by Jungheinrich, a Hamburg manufacturer of fork-lift trucks, to start up an import and service network in the UK. In those days, 90 per cent of trucks sold in Britain were made in Britain. Today, 90 per cent are imported, or made in the UK by foreign-owned companies. 'Why does it happen?' Bischof said. 'We (he means 'we British') are very innovative. When my kids were playing with computers, my brother's kids in Germany could still not even spell the word.' His Manchester company became the biggest of Jungheinrich's European offshoots. 'It's not because our managers are cleverer than those in British companies,' he said. 'The difference is they take a long-term view and their system is transportable. 'British managers have got one arm tied behind their back, one leg in plaster and a blindfold on. They have been given a tough time, which is why I say it was a relative walkover to destroy their manufacturing base. We've got to get a better system.' Bischof agrees with Germany's president, Richard von Weizsacker, that it is not people but the system that determines the success or failure of an economy. 'Under communism, for example, you could work yourself to death and get nowhere. That is very true for Britain, too. 'You don't have to be a socialist to want what I am proposing: you just have to be intelligent. As Sir Ralf Dahrendorf (warden of St Antony's College, Oxford) says: these days you can't be anything but a social democrat. These ups and downs are destroying the social fabric - resources, capital, everything.' Bischof has other credentials to buttress his opinions: he is one of the 100 managers chosen by the German chancellor to sort out the state conglomerates of former East Germany. Working from what used to be Goering's air ministry in Berlin, Bischof has for the last two years been finding western buyers for the viable bits of a big engineering combine. Four thousand workers have been kept; the other 14,000 are being re-trained. Bischof is no demagogue. He speaks quietly, even inaudibly, interposing an interrogative Ja? every couple of sentences. Occasionally, he lets loose. For example, he says Anthony Barber and Nigel Lawson, the Tory chancellors responsible for the two big artificial booms of the post-war period, should be awarded the Iron Cross for services to German exports. He has the modest Majoresque appearance you might expect from his background: economics at Hamburg University under Prof Karl Schiller, later West Germany's economics and finance minister, an apprenticeship in banking (apprenticeships are still normal in Germany), and a first job as assistant to the managing director of Jungheinrich. His father, a master baker, spent time in Doncaster and Northern Ireland as a prisoner of war. The two sons were born in their grandfather's house on the Baltic island of Rugen in former East Germany where the family had retreated from the British bombing raids over Hamburg. It is Germany's post-war example that Bischof would like Britain now belatedly to follow. During the post-war liberal-capitalist era of which Ludwig Erhard was the chief architect, the leftwing Social Democratic Party (SPD) lost election after election. In 1959 it moved to the centre, changed its constitution, became a people's party instead of a working-class party and was rewarded with office when Erhard's boiler ran out of steam. The British Labour party must break its historical ties with the unions, Bischof said, and political parties must be publicly funded. It must tear up its class roots and reform the welfare state along economic, not ideological, lines. 'Sometimes ideas are good for the heart but also make economic sense. We are not just do-gooders.' Governments should protect and regulate both sides of the market equally. 'For me, Mickey Mouse in Fleet Street being paid, although he never turned up, is as vulgar and horrible as a 35 per cent APR (annual percentage rate) on hire purchase. Both are totally ludicrous, and would be impossible in a well-structured system.' What would a well-structured system look like? Bischof said Britain should stop trying to compete with low-wage, developing countries. Labour should be more expensive, not less, to encourage investment and quality output. It should be harder, not easier, to fire workers, and mass redundancy should cease to be the cheapest option. Unemployment benefit should be seen as an insurance award and raised, not cut, so that demand did not collapse during recessions. Top executives, the new Brahmin caste, should be statutorily accountable to supervisory boards which would recognise that employees, as well as shareholders, have rights. Directors would have to negotiate their pay and justify their plans. 'Takeovers are far too easy in Britain. I would force companies to make a five-year business plan, with investment, research and development, product development, export quotas, and not just let them get away with milking and destroying assets.' As a further discouragement to short-termism, the pension funds and life companies might, as in Germany, have their equity portfolios restricted and be barred from buying the shares of highly-geared companies. Government reliance on the interest rate - a tax on industry and the less well-off - was 'a big mistake' and should be abandoned as a means of controlling demand. I asked Bischof whether people would listen to a German telling them what to do. 'I think it's half and half. It's not possible to go through the official channels of the Confederation of British Industry and so forth. (He called the CBI 'intellectual dwarfs'.) On the other hand, people listen because I have done it, in a way. I have been successful in Britain. I helped to destroy part of this industry that I worked in. I've done all the damage to the British balance of payments. 'But I want to live here. I like living in Britain. My kids want to make their lives here, and I am very worried. This is a super country which is slowly and surely going down the chute. 'Sometimes people say to me: 'If you're not satisfied, why don't you push off and live somewhere else?' But I live here because I like it. I sometimes think I'm the only one who does.' Why do you prefer it to Germany? 'I think it's the degree of personal freedom one has in the UK. I like the people, maybe particularly here in the north. 'And the whole social environment - though I do realise one lives in a slightly false world if one lives in a well-off suburb such as mine.' But isn't it precisely what you like about England which is at the root of the problem? Doesn't this easy-going nature, this dislike of order and regulation, make the kind of reform you're proposing impossible? 'That's a very good point. But I don't think you have to give up personal freedom to have a certain amount of order in public life. Built into capitalism, into democracy and the free market concept is a very self-destructive element. We must make sure our values don't get destroyed by excessive freedom.' Britons, said Bischof, are innovative, lateral-thinking and creative. They have to be. That can also make them chaotic. Germans, on the other hand, are too programmed, too bureaucratic, and have a propensity to run round like headless chickens when things begin to go wrong - as they are now beginning to do. 'Of course Germany has made mistakes - the system is too complicated, and excessively social (he means welfare-minded). We (the British, that is) must keep our strengths and at the same time find a good framework. I did that in my own company. 'It's typically German to do things 150 per cent - history has shown us that not a few times. But I don't think we're in danger of getting anywhere near 150 per cent here. If we could just get to 75 or 80 per cent, that would be marvellous.'</p>

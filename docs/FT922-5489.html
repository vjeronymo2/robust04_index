			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family (Investing in . . . Australia): Tarnished image gets a polish - Prospects down under AUSTRALIA has earned itself a bad reputation as a staunchly protectionist economy. With the irritating exception of the Ashes, it seems to have imported hardly anything in recent years. It is the kind of economy which allowed a few entrepreneurs to get very rich very quickly but the strong, consistent growth favoured by more cautious investors has eluded it. And sentiment there has not been helped by a series of spectacular crashes among the high-profile entrepreneurs; Alan Bond, the British-born businessman behind the country's America's Cup triumph who was sentenced to prison this week, was only the latest addition to this list. Australia's market is dominated by companies from two sectors, industrials and resources, and shares are traded tightly. None of this seems conducive to steady profits for UK investors and, indeed, fund managers have not rushed to offer Australian exposure to clients. Only two new Australian unit trusts have been launched in the past 10 years and there are only eight funds in the entire Australasian sector. Reluctance to rush into Australia is supported by the performance of these funds. They have miserably underperformed their rivals; over five years, only three have increased in value at all. The average performance for the sector over this time period is a drop of 9.4 per cent, according to Finstat. Performance by 'Far East excluding Japan' funds, many of which include Australasia, has been somewhat more impressive - but most of their growth has come from the South-East Asian newly-industrialised countries (or Nics) such as Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. At first sight, then, there is little reason to expect a permanent change for the better in Australia. Following the ousting of prime minister Bob Hawke by Paul Keating in December, its politics now resemble one of the television soap operas it exports with such success. Keating's behaviour since, including his familiarity with the Queen during her visit, has done nothing to foster a feeling of stability. Because of its geographical position, Australia is also influenced heavily by market movements in Japan. The Nikkei Dow's precipitate fall in the first three months of this year seems, therefore, to give further good reasons for avoiding the land down under. But there is optimism in the air, thanks to Australia's plans to end its economic isolationism. Since its commodity exports can no longer be relied upon to finance support for other industries, the nation is opening up. Some commentators believe it has little choice. The economy underwent a round of deregulation under the Hawke government while economic links with South-East Asia have been fostered through organisations such as the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group. While treasurer, Keating subjected the economy to the kind of fiscal rigour familiar to Britons who have lived under Margaret Thatcher. The banks' prime lending rate hit 20.5 per cent at the end of 1989 and the beginning of 1990, and has since been pruned in stages to 10.75 per cent. Possibly pushed by declining interest rates, the Australian stock market had a good year in 1991 and the All-Ordinary index rose 23 per cent. Growth has been more muted this year but some fund managers feel very optimistic. These are led by NM, which manages the most successful unit trust in the area. NM Australian has grown 97.6 per cent over the past five years, according to Finstat, and by 383 per cent over 10. Its nearest rival, Schroder Australian, has managed growth of 156.8 per cent in the decade. In many ways, NM's success is attributable to the position of its parent company, which is Australia's largest life group. But this does give the company's views some weight when it reveals grounds for cautious optimism. According to Victor De Lorenzo, NM Australian's fund manager, there are a number of positive factors in the investment outlook. These include Australia's inflation rate, which is now at its lowest level for 30 years and unlikely to rise sharply. Core inflation is running at approximately 3 per cent per annum, according to NM. Despite this, De Lorenzo says there is no significant evidence of a squeeze on margins and these are expected to stabilise once demand stops falling. Corporate earnings might be set for a strong rebound over the next two years. De Lorenzo sees potential from market valuations for a 10-15 per cent rise in industrial shares over the next six months, and evidence that Japanese prices have now hit the bottom also bolsters optimism. He admits, however, that definite signs of profit recovery have yet to emerge and that the strength of the economic recovery is uncertain. This is a view echoed by Fidelity; its house view is optimisitic, but cautiously so. According to Fidelity: 'It should become clearer over the next few months that the economy is well on the way to recovery. Higher earnings' estimates and continuing low inflation should help the market to return to the uptrend which began in 1991.' So, any move into Australia has to be very speculative. Investing there is not for widows and orphans. NM's portfolio is overweight in companies such as Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and TNT, which lack for UK investors the reassuringly stable image of ICI or BP. De Lorenzo admits that these are 'geared recovery plays.' It is overweight in industrials, while exposure to gold has been cut radically in line with predictions for world commodities markets. M&amp;G Australasian, second in the sector over the year to May 1 with growth of 0.8 per cent, according to Finstat, is adopting a similar approach. At the end of 1991, just over half of the fund's assets were invested in the general industrial sector, and there was a bias towards companies with strong international operations. Like NM, M&amp;G moved into News Corporation after its debt had finally been restructured, but admits that this also is geared to a western recovery - particularly through the BSkyB satellite television company. M&amp;G's exposure to the mining sector has been reduced following disappointing metal prices. None of this adds up to an obvious buying opportunity - the Australian sector still does not seem strong enough for that, and too many other factors come into play. But the pointers to some form of sustained recovery are there.  ----------------------------------------------------------                  FACTFILE: AUSTRALIA  ---------------------------------------------------------- Population:                                        17.4m Gross Domestic Product:                     Pounds 166bn Market Capitalisation:                     Pounds 77.4bn Inflation Rate:                             1.7 per cent Three-month Interbank Rate:                 6.5 per cent Currency &amp; Exchange Rate:     Pounds 1 = ADollars 2.3765  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

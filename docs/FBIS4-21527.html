			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "G-7: Environment Key to Economic </F> Recovery, Ministers Say"]    [Text] Florence, 13 Mar (ANSA) -- Environment ministers  from the Group of Seven major industrialised nations wound up a  meeting here Sunday, agreeing that the environment will play a  key role in economic recovery.    "The novelty in this first meeting of G-7 environment  ministers," said Italy's representative [Environment Minister]  Valdo Spini, "is that until now, when the environment was  mentioned it was only in the context of countries'  responsibility towards the health of the planet. Now we have  realised that the environment has a key role in economic  recovery and in increasing employment in industrialised  countries."    The ministers from Italy, France, Germany, Britain, Japan,  Canada and the United States focussed their attention on six  planned themes -- the global environment, employment, trade,  green accounting, democracy and financial mechanisms -- and  added a further topic, nuclear safety in eastern Europe, to the  agenda. Their findings will be discussed by Group of Seven  heads of state and government when they meet for their annual  summit in Naples in July. No formal final statement was issued  after today's meeting.    Talking to the press after the meeting wound up, Spini  recalled a statement issued by the G-7 leaders after their  summit in Tokyo last year, in which they said "despite economic  difficulties, environmental issues must be addressed." Now, he  said, that word "despite" must be replaced by "because of".    Amongst topics dealt with by G-7 environment ministers  during  their two-day session here was deforestation, with a pledge to  work towards a convention for rain forests, an issue which had  to be put aside after major differences of opinion emerged two  years ago in the world environment conference in Rio de Janeiro.  Malaysia and India have since softened their stance.    The effects on the labour market of greater environmental  awareness were stressed by the ministers, with Spini recalling a  report prepared for the European Union which showed that 2.1  million new jobs could open up in this area between now and the  year 2000. Cutting taxes on labour and taxing the environment  would lead to a "double dividend" of more manpower being used  while saving the environment, the ministers agreed.    Eco-taxes did not excite enthusiasm across the board in this  weekend's meeting, however: the four European members came down  in favour but Japan hedged and the United States and Canada were  not at all keen. "On this point," Spini said, "all of the Seven  agreed on the need to pay the costs of saving the environment  from within, but each country said it would find its own  solution."    The dangers of carbon dioxide, the gas held responsible for  the Greenhouse Effect, were admitted by all the ministers, but  the United States refused to be held to the 2000 deadline for  bringing emissions back to 1990 accepted by the other six G-7  members.</p>

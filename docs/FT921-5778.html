			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Saudi king to set up consultative council KING FAHD, Saudi Arabia's ruler, yesterday announced the formation of a 60-member consultative council and a new 'basic law' in the first moves towards broader political participation in the kingdom for 50 years. The king made the announcement, which has been expected for some months, in a television broadcast during which he said that 'momentous events in the recent past . . . have made it necessary to develop the country's administrative structure'. Members of the consultative council, or Majlis a Shura, will be named by the king within six months. The body will be able to question the government, which will still be firmly in the hands of the ruling al Saud family, and refer to the king any government actions which it fails to approve. King Fahd will remain prime minister and commander-in-chief of the armed forces and will retain the power to choose and dismiss ministers and council members. But creation of the new body will open Saudi Arabia's closed and family-oriented political structure to more open debate. Hitherto, political participation in the kingdom has been possible only by recourse to individual petition of members of the ruling family. Moreover, the new rules will extend to the sons and grandsons of the late King Abdul-Aziz, the present king's father, a role in determining the succession, thus establishing, in effect, an electoral college of 500 princes. The new law is to be based on Islamic Sharia law, which has provided the kingdom's effective constitution. However, the law will also contain fresh rules to protect personal freedoms and safeguard Saudis against arbitrary search and arrest. The latter, unprecedented reforms, are seen as a means of controlling the activity of Islamic fundamentalists. Organised groups of fundamentalists, known as mutawah, have been seeking to impose their own strict interpretation of Islam through street patrols. But King Fahd stressed that the political reforms were based on a 'study . . . and consideration of the kingdom's distinctive Islamic position and its traditions.' The king has been promising a consultative council since his accession over a decade ago. In 1980, he set up a special committee to draw up a system of rule based on Islamic principles.</p>

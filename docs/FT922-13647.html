			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Time to get on with the pan-Nordic strategy - Yesterday's deal frees Skandia to concentrate on consumer insurance MR Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive of Skandia, has long held an ambition to turn the Swedish insurance group into a pan-Nordic giant by forging close links with insurers in the region. Under his leadership, Skandia has built up its position in the Nordic markets through a series of strategic acquisitions in Denmark and Norway and share exchanges with Pohjola, Finland's leading insurer. However, much to Mr Wolrath's chagrin, over the last 18 months his well-laid plans have met obstacles in the shape of various unwanted Nordic suitors - in particular Hafnia, the Danish insurer, and Uni Storebrand, the Norwegian insurance group, who snapped up shares in Skandia last autumn. The conclusion yesterday of an agreement in principle with Hafnia and Uni Storebrand after months of negotiations means that Skandia can get on with pursuing its pan-Nordic strategy. In future, Mr Wolrath said, the group would concentrate on consumer life and non-life business. Skandia said that following the Hafnia acquisition it would have 20 per cent of the direct non-life insurance business in Denmark, 15 per cent in Norway, and 23 per cent in Sweden. It would also have 11 per cent of the life business in Denmark and 32 per cent of the life in Sweden. The deal also helps Skandia build up its position in the important UK market: Hafnia owns Prolific, a life company, and Economic, a general insurance company. Skandia plans to merge Economic with its own UK motor insurance operations - known as NIG Skandia - but said that Prolific would operate in parallel with Skandia Life, its own UK life business. Although Skandia was eager to highlight the advantages of acquiring Hafnia, privately, executives admit Hafnia was really Skandia's second choice of partner. Originally, it was intent on forging close links with another Danish insurer - Baltica - which it felt was better managed and more similar to Skandia. However, Skandia was forced to consider a tie-up with Hafnia after attempts by Sweden's leading commercial bank, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, to establish a closer relationship with Skandia fell through. SE-Banken bought an option on 28.2 per cent of the shares in Skandia in October 1990, hoping to persuade the insurance group to help create a large financial services concern. Skandia rejected SEB's overtures and the bank then sold its shareholding to Hafnia and Uni Storebrand last autumn, to the annoyance of Mr Wolrath. Under the terms of yesterday's deal, however, Skandia hopes Uni Storebrand will agree to reduce its shareholding in Skandia from 28 per cent to 4 per cent. According to the agreement in principle, Uni Storebrand's shares in Skandia will be offered to shareholders in Hafnia and, in exchange, Uni Storebrand will acquire Skandia's troubled reinsurance operations outside North America.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Condemned to defend the franc fort: The fall-out in Paris GERMANY'S decision not to cut its discount rate yesterday is likely to present the French franc with its most serious crisis within the European exchange rate mechanism, economists said yesterday. The decision could strain Franco-German relations. The Bundesbank's reluctance to cut rates to help its main European partner presents Paris with a difficult decision on whether to raise interest rates sharply to protect the currency at a time when France's recession is deepening. The French franc came under immediate assault after the Bundesbank announcement, losing almost 1.3 centimes against the D-Mark despite heavy intervention by the French and German central banks. The franc traded at slightly more than one centime above its ERM floor rate of FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark. The CAC-40 Paris stock market index rose by 2.34 per cent to close at 2,036 points, its highest level in more than a year. Its sharp rise reflected an expectation among investors of the franc being devalued within the ERM or that it might be floated, allowing French interest rates to fall. 'The Bundesbank decision is an indication to the markets to sell the franc,' said Mr Robin Hubbard, chief French economist at Paribas in London. 'The Bundesbank has effectively told the markets that it has done as much as it can to save the ERM, but that from now onwards it has to prioritise domestic considerations.' Economists in Paris argued that the result would be a renewed assault on the franc, raising the prospect of devaluation or a realignment of ERM parity rates. But they stressed that the fate of the franc was unlikely to be resolved quickly. In particular, they stressed the determination of the French government to protect the franc. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has said that an alternative to his franc fort policy would require a change in prime minister. 'They are condemned to follow this policy through,' said one Paris banker. Economists argued that the survival of the existing franc/D-Mark parity would partly depend on whether and for how long the French government could raise interest rates. Last week, the Bank of France raised overnight rates from 7.75 per cent to 10 per cent in an attempt to bolster the franc's defences. But with gross domestic product expected to contract by 0.7 per cent this year, and with unemployment forecast to reach 12.5 per cent by the end of December, a policy of sustained interest rate rises does not appear plausible, say economists. However, said Mr Hubbard: 'If the French can sweat it out for long enough the speculators might give up. The fundamentals of the French economy are also still good, which won't make much difference in the short term but might provide some help in the longer term.' One of the few sources of consolation yesterday for the Bank of France was the publication of its balance sheet which showed that its net reserves stood at FFr122.95bn (Dollars 21bn) at the end of last week, considerably higher than economists had expected. The French central bank was forced late last week to intervene in the franc's support, but managed to spend less than the market estimated.</p>

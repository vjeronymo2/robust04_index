			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Observer: Lordly airs The Broadcasting Complaints Commission today entertains two of its most distinguished ever complainants, two former chancellors of the exchequer, Lords Howe and Lawson. Their grievance concerns a Channel 4 programme, A Brief Economic History of Our Time. First broadcast in February, it robustly dealt with the Conservative government's monetary policies and Britain's 1980s boom and recession. The two peers of the realm, central players at the time, have decided to exercise their right of complaint because they believe the programme was almost entirely 'a critical and partisan polemic'. They also argue that if they had not been misled about the nature of the programme they would have declined to be interviewed for it. The third chancellor interviewed - Labour peer Lord Healey - appears not to have taken exception to the programme. Healey obviously felt that the programme fell short of 'being savaged by a dead sheep' - how he once described being attacked by the then Sir Geoffrey Howe. Channel 4 and Fulcrum, the independent producers who made the programme, are taking a strong line. Their intended defence is that the programme was not only true, but also fair and balanced. But if Fulcrum and its main investigative reporter Christopher Hird are found 'guilty' by the BCC, an apology will have to hit Channel 4's airwaves.</p>

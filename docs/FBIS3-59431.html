			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Milos Solaja] </F>   [Text] Banja Luka, January 10 (TANJUG) -- The conflicts  between Croats and Moslems in central Bosnia-Herzegovina and  threats by Croatian Defence Minister Gojko Susak, and later by  President Franjo Tudjman, that the Croatian Army will intervene  there, have cast a different light on the civil war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It has been generally known that regular Croatian troops  have  been fighting in former Bosnia-Herzegovina for two years  already. However, this fact seems to be receiving the due  attention of the international public only after the former  allies, Croats and Moslems, fiercely started fighting over  territories in central Bosnia, from where they previously  jointly banished all Serbs.    The truth about Croatia's engagement could not have remained  hidden in the western media any longer not only because of the  fierce clashes in Mostar, Vitez, Gornji Vakuf, and Bugojno, but  because the currently weak position of Bosnian Croats compelled  Tudjman to make threats of a direct military intervention.    Both the Moslem and Croat sides base the concept of the  further realization of their interests in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina on control of central Bosnia where the  military industry is based.    This area is home to a factory of explosives in Vitez, a  factory of weaponry in Nov Travnik, overhaul works and a factory  of military supplies in Travnik, and a factory of detonator  fuses and shells in Bugojno.    It is evident why Croatia is concerned, when Moslems already  have control over works for the production of weaponry and  ammunition in Zenica, shells in Tesanj, caps in Gorazde, and  12.7-mm ammunition in Konjic.    If the Moslem forces manage to banish Croats from central  Bosnia, they will have control over the entire special military  industry as the strongast basis for continuing the war.    In the geo-political sense, they would have a more compact  and integral territory, and in the strategically-operative  sense, they would reduce the frontline, which would enable  easier control and communications with [word indistinct] force.    In order to achieve this, Moslems must first take Vitez.  This is the key town in central Bosnia, where the British  batallion of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) is  deployed.    Gornji Vakuf is also very important to Bosnian Croats,  because its loss would mean that they are completely cut off  from central Bosnia communications-wise.    Bosnian Moslems have a larger force than the Croats and a  strong motive. Until recently technically inferior, Moslems  have lately acquired vast quantities of weaponry from abroad and  now have heavy artillery, tanks and helicopters.    It is estimated that Bosnian Croat units (HVO) in central  Bosnia have around 8,000 troops and that regular Croatian troops  number around 70,000, with the corresponding hardware.    The Croatian force in Bosnia includes units from Osijek,  Rijeka, almost the entire guards brigade from Split, and [word  indistinct]. Moslem radio recently said that new units from the  Croatian towns of Varazdin, Vinkovci, Sinj and Split arrived  last week via Prozor.    If Croats lose central Bosnia, they also stand to lose  western Herzegovina, since Moslems aspire to "their" Neum, the  Adriatic port which was within the administrative borders of  former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It will soon be clear if Croatia's open threats will be  realized, or if they are just preparations to admitting defeat.  Attempts by the West to reconcile the former allies and again  blame only Serbs for the war have not yielded any results yet,  and the importance of central Bosnia and the heaviness of the  present conflicts there indicate that things will not be any  easier in the future either.</p>

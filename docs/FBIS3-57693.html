The meeting, a constructive attempt to foster closer  co-operation, covered such issues as the continued presence and  activities of Russian troops in Latvia and Estonia, combating  crime and the operation and organisation of their respective  ministries.    Latvia and Estonia face similar problems in their attempts  to  curb crime, said Latvian Interior Ministry's State Secretary,  Andris Staris. The discussions underlined the need for  information exchange between the countries in the level of  ministers and department heads to be more effective in combating  the problems. The ministers also agreed to coordinate their  activities on the CIS Internal Affairs Ministers' conference at  which Estonian and Latvia maintain observer status.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from 1 March PASASON: "A New Milestone in </F> Lao-Malaysian Relations"]    [Text] At the invitation of His Excellency [H.E.] Saman  Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly [NA] of the Lao  People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], H.E. Tan Sri Datuk Mohamed  Zahir bin Haji Ismail, speaker of the House of Representatives  of Malaysia [HRM], led a high-level HRM delegation to pay an  official friendship visit to the LPDR from 27 to 31 March 1994.    During their visit to the LPDR, the speaker of the HRM and  the delegation paid courtesy calls on H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan and  H.E. Khamtai Siphandon, respectively president and prime  minister of the LPDR. The delegation laid a wreath at the  monument of unknown combatants and visited a number of economic  and cultural establishments in Vientiane Municipality and Xieng  Khouang Province.    An official meeting between the LPDR NA delegation and the  HRM delegation was held at the National Assembly Hall to  exchange views and discuss the situation with each other under  an atmosphere of profound friendship and mutual understanding.  At the meeting, the two sides informed each other of certain  prominent developments in their respective countries and  exchanged a common direction for strengthening the relations and  cooperation between the legislative organizations of Laos and  Malaysia for their common and unilateral interests in the  immediate and long-term future.    The two sides were proud of the development of the fine  relations and cooperation and multifaceted mutual assistance  between Laos and Malaysia and were unanimous to continue  multiplying and enhancing the said relations and cooperation on  the basis of the five-point principle of peaceful coexistence.  They regarded the agreement on economic, scientific, and  technical cooperation, the agreement on air transportation, and  the agreement on the promotion and protection of investment  signed between the Governments of Laos and Malaysia in early  December 1992 as a symbol of utmost significance in the  Lao-Malaysian cooperation in the new period. The two sides  unanimously agreed to exchange visits by delegations at various  levels to draw lessons from one another and to organize  technical training programs and study tours beneficial to both  sides. Regarding international relations, the two sides  unanimously agreed to further promote an atmosphere of peace,  friendship, and cooperation in Southeast Asia and the world.    The success of the visit to the LPDR by the speaker of the  HRM and the delegation constitutes a new glorious milestone in  the relations between the legislative institutions of Laos and  Malaysia and, at the same time, an important contribution to the  building of peace, stability as well as relations and  cooperation in Southeast Asia and the world. The multiethnic  Lao people wholeheartedly hail this event of great significance  to Lao-Malaysian relations and pledge to do to the best of our  abilities to contribute to making the exisiting relations of  friendship and good cooperation between the two countries and  peoples of Laos and Malaysia more fruitful so as to bring  benefits to our two peoples.</p>

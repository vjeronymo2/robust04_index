I believe we must first properly  define why the people are asking for this, so that everyone can  understand. Many people still do not understand the situation  with the wealthy.    [Rodriguez] I believe it is offensive that there are those  in  our society who live well above the means of the people, in what  amounts to sneering at the people, particularly humble workers.  They do this contemptuously. They live off crime, have made it  their lifestyle. They can therefore buy even the volition of  weak people who are willing to sell out for money.    [Roque] Following your thought, we can define two types of  wealthy people. There is a difference between the wealthy you  have just mentioned and the other kind, no less wealthy --  pardon the redundancy -- who have earned their money through  hard work.    [Rodriguez] Yes, I believe we must stress the difference. We  recently spoke about this matter on this program. We asked  ourselves if there were honest wealthy people, and became  entangled in irrelevant issues.    It is important to explain this. We use the term maceta to  define anyone who has a little money. We need to clarify that  not everyone who has money has attained it dishonestly or  illegally. There are people who may have inherited money from  relatives. Some, through work, have attained certain levels of  wealth, particularly as a result of certain policies -- some say  erroneous economic policies. I truly believe that some people  have taken advantage of specific situations. In this regard, I  wish to mention the highly deserved money of farmers. Not all  farmers engage in the black market. I believe this is quite  clear. I know of farmers who plant tobacco, particularly in  Pinar del Rio where the prices are much higher due to the  quality of the leaf, and farmers in Havana who plant crops such  as garlic. In both cases, I have seen that without needing to  engage in the black market, they make a good profit selling  their crops. This is deserved in view of their immense efforts.    [Roque] Now that we have clarified this, we are ready to  discuss the people's call for eradicating the wealthy. I would  like it to be clearly understood the type of wealth we are going  to speak about.    [Rodriguez] I believe we need to reflect the calls from  certain workers assemblies to confiscate the money of those who  have attained it illegally, specifically referring to those  people we mentioned. I believe that there are inequalities in  today's society that we need to accept even though they are  unfair. These inequalities are created by such factors as the  fact that there are people entitled to receive help from  relatives abroad. There are other inequalities created by the  fact that certain people have access to hard currency income,  such as tourism workers who receive tips in foreign currencies.  This currency helps them, to a certain degree, satisfy some  essential needs.    [Roque] There are other inequalities that have taken place  for years, such as the case of these wealthy people. I believe  this should be the focus of today's program.    [Rodriguez] At the beginning, I mentioned criminals  specifically. I believe that the word wealthy is not the  appropriate term. We are talking about criminals, those who have  illegally amassed money and who today anger our workers, those  of us who earn an honest living. There is a general call within  these assemblies. Everyone is wondering: How? How are we going  to confiscate the money of the wealthy?    [Roque] How do you determine who they are?    [Rodriguez] How are we going to determine whether someone's  money was amassed legally or illegally? I have been thinking  about these issues and have discussed them with numerous  comrades. In every neighborhood, we know who is who. I believe  the most trustworthy information on the activities of any  citizen comes from his neighbors. As a matter of fact, we have  the Unified Vigilance and Protection System [SUVP]. The  Committees for the Defense of the Revolution are one of the most  important components of the SUVP. They can contribute much of  this information. We also have the recourse of police  investigations. There is also the option of bringing that  citizen to court to prove that his wealth was amassed illegally.    I believe that these are the plausible means of not only  confiscating the money... [changes thought] We are also going to  discuss how these people live today. We could confiscate money  and goods, which would be the legal means of appropriating the  highly arrogant lifestyles of these people.    [Roque] Undoubtedly, the implementation of this measure is  extremely difficult. You just explained that it will not be easy  to establish this differentiation.    [Rodriguez] There is also a margin of error. Errors might be  made. There are people who might make it look like everything  was amassed legally. Only an in-depth investigation might  indicate otherwise. Inversely, there are those one might suspect  of being involved in criminal activities, but who can prove that  everything is legal.    [Roque] What we can be sure of is that the investigation  will  always be fair and that the margin of error will not produce  injustice. Errors might occur, but they will be in terms of the  impunity of some people.    [Rodriguez] Of course, at least for a while. I do not  believe  that impunity in this type of action can last long; at the  beginning perhaps, in a first offensive. But this type of  offensive needs to be permanent in nature. It cannot be like  those campaigns in the past, when a large number of people were  arrested, practically guilty, but since there was no evidence,  many were freed, or were able to demonstrate where their money  came from. I also think that... [changes thought]    Later on we will talk about goods. It is being said that  since there are already rumors, and that since the people are  demanding eradication of the wealthy, this social ballast is  infecting certain neighborhoods. They have, of course, reacted;  they know who they are. They know who the people are talking  about. They are trying to find a escape. I wish to use this  nationwide program to tell them that escape is going to be very  difficult once the people's watchful eyes enter the picture.    [Roque] Many believe that since we are talking so openly on  the radio, and the wealthy know that measures against them are  going to be taken, this gives them a chance to seek solutions to  their problem. However, you mentioned that the people are aware  of all of this. Since the people are the ones calling for the  eradication of the wealthy, are asking the authorities to please  eliminate this social scum, the people need to support the  authorities -- police and courts -- in order to eradicate them.  We must have witnesses. In order to sentence someone in court,  we need witnesses.    [Rodriguez] Undoubtedly, these people are preparing. The  people are surely aware of this, and need to be on alert so they  can provide the required information. It is obvious that these  people will try to get rid of their Cuban money, probably in  large amounts, by converting it into goods. It is known that  many of them have done this on other occasions when they felt  threatened by a change in the currency. Now, there is much talk  about a change of currency. I do not know if this will happen or  not. However, there is much talk about it. I am convinced that  they have tried to mend their finances -- to put it in  economists' technical terms. There are also those who have  changed their Cuban currency into foreign currencies to protect  themselves from a change.    [Roque] It is being said that foreign currency exchange  rates  have increased recently in the black market precisely because of  this.    [Rodriguez] That is not all. I remember that it used to be  said --- before the unions implemented the new system -- that in  order to get a table in a restaurant you need to generously  bribe the maitre'd. Who can afford a 200, 300, 400, 500-peso  bribe to get a table but those who have made that money easily?  No one who works for his money can afford to do this. These  people corrupt anyone they come in contact with. They corrupt  their families, and even their neighbors.    [Roque] We need to remain alert.    [Rodriguez] Yes. I believe we need to be very alert, need to  keep our eyes wide open. The Cuban people should be on the  lookout for this type of criminal who nowadays hurts us the  most. I believe that all criminals hurt us. However, the wealthy  do the most material and moral damage.</p>

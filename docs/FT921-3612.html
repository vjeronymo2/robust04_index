			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Talks on EC share trading rules delayed PLANS for top-level talks next week over the European Community's long-delayed Investment Services Directive have been called off, agencies report. Portugal, the current European Community president, said it was postponing the talks because: 'We are not in a position to form a compromise proposal that could be accepted by everybody.' Portugal's finance minister, Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, had hoped closed-door discussions earlier this week with Britain, France and Germany would break months of deadlock. But diplomats said there had been no shift in positions. As a result, ministerial debate on common EC share trading rules is likely to be delayed until after UK elections which may oust the ruling Conservative government, a protagonist in the feuding on the proposed rules.</p>

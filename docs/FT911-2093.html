			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Tenneco net tumbles to Dollars 1m TENNECO, the Houston-based conglomerate, yesterday turned in a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings, reflecting the impact of recession in many of its businesses. For the first three months of 1991, Tenneco had net income of Dollars 1m compared with Dollars 134m a year earlier. After deducting preferred stock dividends from net income, the company had a net loss of 3 cents a share compared with net income of Dollars 1.03 a year ago. Revenues slid to Dollars 3.3bn from Dollars 3.6bn in 1990. During the quarter, operating income before interest and taxes plunged to Dollars 113m from Dollars 315m. Mr James Ketelsen, chairman and chief executive, said the company's farm and construction equipment, container board products and chemicals operations were hit particularly hard by the recession in the first quarter. 'The performance of our automotive parts and minerals businesses, while essentially unchanged from 1990, was good, considering economic conditions.' Tenneco's pipeline and shipbuilding businesses have proved the most resistant to recession and both turned in improved first-quarter earnings. Operating income for Tenneco Gas was Dollars 113m in the quarter against Dollars 90m a year ago. Operating income from Tenneco's Newport News Shipbuilding was Dollars 49m against Dollars 45m in 1990. Tenneco's J. I. Case subsidiary, which makes farm and construction equipment, has cut its workforce and significantly reduced production to cope with the impact of recession and help reduce costs and inventories. As a result of job cuts in Europe, Case took a one-time charge of Dollars 32m in the latest quarter. The unit had a first quarter operating loss of Dollars 147m compared with operating income of Dollars 49m the previous year. Mr Ketelsen said the disappointing results from Case were in line with expectations. '1991 will be a difficult year for Case and the farm and construction equipment industry, but we will continue to make the disciplined management decisions necessary to adapt to changing business conditions. Enron, the natural gas company, reported higher first-quarter earnings and said it was 'very optimistic' about achieving higher earnings for the 1991 full year amid growth in its power, gas services and liquids units. It reported a net income of Dollars 108.8m, or Dollars 2.03 per primary share, compared with Dollars 101.0m, or Dollars 1.88 per share a year ago. Revenues advanced to Dollars 3.61bn from Dollars 3.07bn.</p>

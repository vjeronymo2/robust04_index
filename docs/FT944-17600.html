			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Management: Leaders should learn to bow out - The need for chief executives to develop a broader range of starring roles It has long been evident that leaders tend to outlive their usefulness as circumstances change. Sir Winston Churchill's expiry date was the end of the second world war. Margaret Thatcher's was the achievement of the main planks of her radical reform programme. Mikhail Gorbachev's was the unleashing of democracy. The nature of each leader's departure differed, but in every case it was caused by their inability to adapt to changed conditions. The same applies in the business world, but with a difference: that most chairmen and chief executives quit far too late, not only when their own performance has peaked, but when they have led their companies into dangerous waters. Witness the belated departures in recent years of the bosses of IBM, Kodak, Digital, Volvo and Scandinavian Airlines. Few business leaders have the sense or humility to recognise their limitations and leave when they have accomplished the tasks to which they are best suited. One such rare exception was Michael Edwardes, the former boss of British Leyland cars (now Rover), who was frank enough to admit when he left a decade ago that if he had stayed any longer than four years his value to the car company would have fallen by two-thirds. (His critics would say he went before the damage he caused could be uncovered). By contrast last week's forced resignation of David O'Brien, head of National &amp; Provincial, a leading UK building society, was a case of a permanent revolutionary failing to realise that although the upheaval he had wreaked - also for four years - had benefited the organisation's performance in the short term, it had begun to wear out its morale. Against this litany of leaders with limited staying power can be set only a tiny list of people who have learned to adapt their focus and style to changing times. The arch example in the US is Jack Welch, the charismatic chairman of General Electric since 1981. In the UK the much quieter Sir Christopher Hogg has accomplished a similar feat at the head of Courtaulds, leading it through four very different phases: a battle for survival in the early 1980s; revitalisation in international markets for the rest of the decade; revolution at the end of it with the splitting of the company in two through de-merger; and then a renewed battle against recession, although this time from a strong international base. The reasons why few leaders perform anything like as well - and for as long  -as Welch or Hogg were studied in the late 1980s by two Canadian academics, Henry Mintzberg and Francis Westley. They suggested that most leaders, whether in politics or business, find it hard to adjust more than once to what they called 'the cycle of revitalisation'. Once a new leader's first revolution - or set of reforms - achieves its objective, a state of order develops in which all sorts of routines are needed. Some leaders fail to adjust even to this first shift. But if they do, they lose the ability to launch a new revolution when the times demand it, retreating instead into lofty distance at the top of the newly stable system. By contrast, the one-track revolutionary who cannot adjust becomes a restless irritant, or worse. This analysis has now been built upon by one of Europe's leading experts on leadership, Manfred Kets de Vries of Insead. In an article called 'CEOs also have the Blues', published in the latest issue of European Management Journal*, de Vries argues that chief executives, like products, go through a life cycle. It has three phases: entry and experimentation; consolidation; and decline. He warns that the cycle is growing shorter, to eight years or fewer. The heady, first honeymoon phase is usually straightforward. In it, the chief executive's focus on just one or two themes - cost-cutting, quality, customer service, re-engineering, takeovers or whatever - is a strength. But in the second phase the chief executive loses the excitement of mastering something new and settles down into the proven success formula. In relatively stable environments this can be an advantage. But in the more dynamic, turbulent scenes in most industries today it creates ossification, and triggers the third phase, of decline. De Vries attributes the whole problem to what he calls the chief executive's 'inner theatre': the sub-conscious assumptions and preoccupations, or 'scripts', as he calls them, that people acquire over time, and which dictate their response to external stimuli. A more familiar term, used by US academics such as MIT's Peter Senge, is 'mental maps'. Unlike Senge and most other writers on the subject, de Vries does not advise chief executives to attempt the unsettling process of self-renewal, in order to become Welch-like learners. This is only feasible for some people, he argues. Others should look for new horizons while the going is good, or settle for the role of mentor to younger executives, he says. But that shift in behaviour itself involves a challenging degree of personal learning and renewal: the chief executive must foster a climate of trust and real dialogue, and allow all existing assumptions to be challenged. In practice, this degree of change is too great for many chief executives to stomach. But De Vries is right in arguing that, if they fail to regenerate themselves in this way, they risk becoming one of what he calls the 'walking dead', and leaving a graveyard behind them. To extend de Vries's theatrical metaphor, most chief executives face an uncomfortable choice. They must either recognise that they are one-act performers, and bow out in good time, or they must learn to become all-round artistes capable of playing the lead in an extended drama of several very different acts. * EMJ Sept 1994 Fax 0865-843010.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CELTICS ROOKIE RON GRANDISON HAS ALL THE TOOLS, BUT SO FAR HE'S KEPT THEM IN A  BOX NEXT TO THE BENCH;  </P> <P> EX-ST. BERNARD FLASH SITS AND WAITS  </P> <P> Despite the emergence of a younger, quicker Celtics team, unwritten rules of  the National Basketball Assn. are making Ron Grandison's rookie season a quiet  one.  </P> <P> The former St. Bernard High School standout, one of three first-year players to  earn a Celtics uniform this season, fits neatly into new Coach Jimmy Rodgers'  scheme -- he is big (6-8, 217), fast, loves to run the floor and leans on his  rebounding and defense. But he's had about as much chance to prove himself as  Gaston Green has with the Rams.  </P> <P> In the NBA a rookie's path to stardom, or simply seeing more than zeroes beside  his name in the box score, usually requires a thankless apprenticeship.  Veterans aren't about to yield minutes to unproven players, nor are first-year  coaches about to force proven players onto the bench.  </P> <P> So, though Rodgers often has called on former UC Santa Barbara guard Brian Shaw  and three other more experienced bench players to spell the lethargic starters  with trapping defense and jack-rabbit offense, Grandison is cheerleading more  often than not. Even foot surgery that will sideline Larry Bird until March  hasn't provided Grandison with decent playing time.  </P> <P> "There is nothing I can do about the situation," Grandison said recently after  practice at Hellenic College in Brookline, Mass. "I just have to keep myself  ready and, when the time comes, produce."  </P> <P> Grandison, who played on a St. Bernard team that featured Oregon State's Eric  Knox, Cal's Leonard Taylor and former USC forward Rod Keller, would have reason  to worry if this were last year. Former Celtics Coach K. C. Jones rarely used  his bench -- and it showed. When forwards Brad Lohaus and Reggie Lewis came off  the pine, Boston lost its edge. Neither the team nor the bench players  benefited.  </P> <P> Jones has been kicked upstairs and Rodgers is intent on getting significant  contributions from more than his starting five.  </P> <P> "Right now we are using 9 or 10 and that is a lot, but that doesn't mean Ronnie  won't enter into the picture," Rodgers said. "It is a long season and it's just  hard to predict how the minutes are gonna fall."  </P> <P> Some might say that merely becoming a Celtic is more than enough for Grandison  to ask, that he shouldn't expect to have a uniform and play in it too.  Shouldn't he just be thankful that he outplayed journeyman Ennis Whatley and  third-round draft choice Gerald Paddio in the preseason? Hardly, says  Grandison, who is logging more minutes on the bench than on Boston Garden's  parquet floor.  </P> <P> "I think the game is changing for the Celtics and for the whole league,"  Grandison said. "We played some games early in the season where we played  really slow basketball and we just got run off the floor. They are gonna need  young guys like me, Reggie (Lewis) and Brian (Shaw) who can keep up. The  opportunity is there and if I just wait and be patient, it'll come."  </P> <P> If Grandison, 24, could survive his rocky pre-NBA career, logic says he can  make a living in the NBA.  </P> <P> He spent four years at St. Bernard and won a CIF 3-A Division championship in  his senior year, when he averaged 14 points a game. But his basketball career  deteriorated a year later.  </P> <P> After averaging 6.1 points and 3.6 rebounds in 28 games in his freshman year at  UC Irvine, Grandison expected to be a pivotal Anteater the following year. He  felt more like an ant. He played in 29 games but never started and averaged  just 4.4 points and 3.1 rebounds.  </P> <P> "I started out doing well but all of a sudden (Coach Bill) Mulligan sat me on  the bench and kept me there, and I couldn't understand it," Grandison recalled.  </P> <P> Grandison said Mulligan told him that his attitude was suspect, that five guys  would play most that year and that Grandison was the sixth man. "I played 2-3  minutes of every game the whole year. I accepted that role but it was like  (Mulligan) still wanted to bring me down as a person, and I didn't accept  that," Grandison said.  </P> <P> Mulligan recently remembered Grandison as a "front-line sub, a guy who would  have started his last two years." The problem with Grandison, Mulligan said,  was his patience. He didn't have enough for an underclassman. "We beat USC one  night and that was a pretty big win around here, and the next day he came in  bitching about playing time. It just got down to that," Mulligan said.  </P> <P> At the end of the 1983-84 season, according to Mulligan, Grandison and his  mother Myra walked into Mulligan's office and told the coach that Ron was  contemplating a transfer. "The deal with his mother -- I had a problem with him  after that," Mulligan said, "but I think a guy like that can make it in the NBA  as an 11th or 12th man. I don't think he'll ever be a starter."  </P> <P> For the record, Myra Grandison believes her son has plenty of patience. Since  he was a child, Myra said, Ron started at the bottom and worked his way up.  Transferring out of UC Irvine, however, wasn't the quickest way to move up in  basketball. Especially when Grandison decided to transfer to Tulane. At the  time he was thinking more about academics than basketball: I didn't even look  into basketball and that was a big mistake."  </P> <P> The oversight proved painful. St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune helped Grandison  obtain a scholarship to Tulane and joining a program led by John (Hot Rod)  Williams seemed like a blessing. But within months, Grandison's new school was  embroiled in a point-shaving scandal. Grandison, though unable to play because  he had transferred and had to sit out a year, was still subpoenaed as a  character witness. He never took the stand but soon was searching for a new  school.  </P> <P> "It was a weird year," Grandison said. "At first I was afraid the school was  going on probation. I was really nervous. I had two years left and I wanted a  chance to go to the NCAA tournament. On probation you don't get that chance.  Then when they dropped the program, I was kind of relieved because it let the  rest of us go and be eligible to play somewhere else immediately."  </P> <P> He took recruiting visits to Washington, Arizona State, Memphis State and  Loyola Marymount. Finally, he settled on the University of New Orleans and the  Southern drawl of fatherly Coach Bennie Dees. Grandison had family in New  Orleans, and once Dees became involved the cross-city move to UNO was simple.  </P> <P> "Ronnie and I got so close," Dees, now Wyoming's coach, said by telephone.  Since that first season, Grandison has twice stayed with Dees while traveling.  "He is like one of my family," Dees said.  </P> <P> Dees insists now that the day Grandison told him he was coming to New Orleans  was the day New Orleans' basketball program turned around. After an 11-19  season in 1985, UNO finished 16-12 in Grandison's first year. Its newest  standout averaged 16.9 points and 9.7 rebounds. A year later, Grandison and  current Washington Bullets reserve Ledale Eccles guided the Privateers to a  26-4 finish and a berth in the NCAAs, where they lost to Alabama in the second  round.  </P> <P> "Ronnie is not a great talent," said Dees, "but he'll have a long career in the  NBA because of his attitude and the way he works. He is the hardest working  basketball player ever to be put on this earth."  </P> <P> Dees must have known something. Following an impressive end to his college  career, Grandison was drafted by the Denver Nuggets in the fifth round of the  1987 draft. European basketball -- and the promise of a comfortable salary --  beckoned. But Grandison decided to pursue a job in the NBA, and although he was  Denver's final cut that year, he didn't quit. He joined the Rochester, Minn.,  Flyers of the Continental Basketball Assn. Apparently the move paid off.  </P> <P> Last July, Denver invited Grandison to its 2-week mini-camp, as did the  Milwaukee Bucks. Neither offered a contract. Then the Celtics called.  </P> <P> "We didn't even realize the Celtics knew he existed," said Myra Grandison, who  reluctantly added that her longtime allegiance to the Lakers now rests with the  Celtics.  </P> <P> After impressing the Boston brain trust enough to win a job, Grandison  continued the trend early in the season, averaging about 10 minutes a game. The  Celtics, however, were losing. Rodgers tried to develop a consistent lineup and  Grandison's playing time diminished. With 19 games under his belt, he was  averaging just 2.2 points and 1.2 rebounds a game. But Rodgers is quick to  discount the numbers.  </P> <P> "A guy like Ronnie right now isn't playing as many minutes, but in my mind he  is just as important as any other player because each day he challenges our  people on the practice court," Rodgers said. "That means he is adding to and  helping this basketball team develop, and that's extremely important."  </P> <P> As it was earlier in Grandison's career, it's a question of patience.  </P> <P> "I feel good about the Celtics organization," Grandison said, "and I feel like  maybe not this year but next year or the year after I will be a major  contributor."  </P></p>

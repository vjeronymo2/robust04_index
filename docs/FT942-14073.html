			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Moment of truth approaches for PNG mining - Financing of the Lihir project will provide a test of bankers' faith Ian Holzberger, exploration manager for Highlands Gold, stands on a remote drill-site, high above the Frieda River in the north-western Papua New Guinea. 'If this was anywhere else in the world, we wouldn't be here,' he says. The phrasing may be curious, but the implication is clear: in any other country some form of commercial mining would be under way on the identified gold-copper deposit. As it is, despite the continuing drilling programme and some optimistic noises from Highlands, analysts remain to be convinced that the prospect is economically viable. It is easy to see why. For hundreds of kilometres, there is little besides rain-forest and clouds. The site is so remote that access to any mine development would have be up a couple of rivers, and then via some newly-constructed road link. A facility for copper production would have to be built into the steeply-sloping hillsides and power brought to the site. In the meantime, there would be the problem of establishing land rights and negotiating landowner compensation. Already, despite the apparent obscurity of the location, locals are paying attention. All of which explains why PNG represents the ultimate mining conundrum - extre-mely rich from a geological perspective, but devoid of basic infrastructure, subject to aggressive land claims and overshadowed by a volatile political climate. According to a recent survey of two dozen Australian mining and petroleum companies by Mining Monthly magazine, the country has the highest perceived international investment risk, easily surpassing the likes of Russia, China and Brazil. The extent of this 'PNG factor' has been brought home to the investment community on a number of occasions, causing sentiment towards the country to ebb and flow in recent years. The most dramatic loss of confidence came in 1989, when the Panguna copper mine on Bougainville closed after bitter clashes with local landowners and the island's secessionists. Not only did this shatter PNG's international reputation, but it also wrought major damage to the domestic economy. More recently, investment attitudes have been more equivocal. Sentiment took another knock in early-1993, when tensions developed between the PNG government and corporate investors over the rich Porgera gold mine. But with that matter resolved and financing for the next big project - the ADollars 1.5bn Lihir goldmine - getting under way, there are some tentative signs of a more positive mood. For the PNG pessimists, the Porgera affair was all too inevitable. The ADollars 1bn (USDollars 720m) project, located in the Enga province, began production in 1990 and was originally owned jointly by Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields, and Highlands Gold with 30 per cent apiece. The PNG government held the residual 10 per cent. But when 1992's production rolled in at a stunning 1.46m ounces, the PNG government claimed that it had been duped about the richness of the mine and demanded a larger stake in the project. After lengthy negotiations, it was agreed that the three corporate partners should each surrender a 5 per cent interest, reducing their stakes to 25 per cent apiece. The PNG government would pay K138.75m (USDollars 146m) to raise its holding to the same level. Despite the fact that the government's additional ownership interest was bought rather than confiscated, PNG-related stocks suffered badly. Highlands, in which Queensland's MIM has a majority stake, more than halved from about ADollars 1.60 in early-1992 to ADollars 0.75 a year later. Nuigini Mining, whose controlling shareholder is Canada's Battle Mountain, fell from ADollars 3.25 to under ADollars 2 over the same period. But almost 12 months later, there are indications that the dust is settling. Those same 'PNG' stocks, for example, have regained all or much of the lost ground - although, as one analyst puts it, 'things could hardly get worse'. Meanwhile, the BHP-controlled Ok Tedi copper mine, to the north of the country, revealed earlier this year that it had signed a three-year USDollars 140m revolving credit facility without the bankers demanding any political risk insurance. It was the first time that this precaution had been omitted for a PNG project. BHP Minerals attributes the show of confidence to two factors. First, it points out that Ok Tedi has become an established project, operating for over a decade. But secondly, it perceives some shift in the international bankers' attitudes towards PNG, suggesting that a familiarity with country is beginning to build up. Bank of America, one of the lead banks in the Ok Tedi transaction, concurs - although it admits that opinions in the financial community are still sharply divided. 'There's been a dramatic improvement from post-Bougainville,' says Mr Simon Dodd, in the Melbourne office. 'The banks in there (the Ok Tedi syndicate) are ones who've come to know the people, the companies, the real issues.' But, he admits: 'There was a second group of banks who veered away and wouldn't have anything to do with the loan'. The test of this new-found faith will come over the large Lihir project. The potential mine is located on one of the islands within the New Ireland province and is a joint venture between Britain's RTZ and Nuigini Mining, with the PNG government also involved. Financing for the development is due to be completed this year, and the original plan was to split this between a share issue, raising perhaps ADollars 400m, and a debt facility of about ADollars 300m. Unfortunately, in the way of PNG, politics have already caused the initial timetable to slip and the structure of the project has - in the words of one observer - 'headed into the twilight zone'. For what were viewed as domestic reasons, Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, announced a government reshuffle over Christmas. Mr Masket Iangalio, the former mining minister, moved to finance and Mr John Kaputin took over the resources portfolio. In the wake of these upheavals, the supposedly-imminent special mining lease for the Lihir development did not materialise. In part, the problem is thought to centre on whether PNG sticks to a provisional agreement to involve Malaysia's state-owned Malaysia Mining Corporation at an early stage, in return for assistance in funding of the government's interest, or whether it adheres to the stock market plan, which would see the partners' stakes diluted by the float and MMC entitled to pick up shares at this stage. This decision, in turn, has broader foreign policy implications, given Mr Wingti's 'Look North' policy, which is aimed at securing greater ties between PNG and Asia. Mr Kaputin is making a submission on the Lihir project to PNG's National Executive Council this week. Back in the banking parlours of Melbourne, the Lihir exercise, and the smoothness with which it is conducted, will be 'interesting to watch', says one, slightly sceptical, observer. But it is not just the international sentiment which will be tested by the Lihir financing; domestic aspirations are also involved. On the one hand, there is an acute need to bring on new resources projects to maintain the country's economic growth. A report published this week by the Asia-Pacific Economics Group suggested that GDP would be flat, or even decline in 1994, after the 14.4 per cent growth last year. 'Substantial growth' might then resume in 1995, provided construction on the Lihir and South East Gobe oilfield projects was getting under way. The PNG government has also advocated a local stockmarket, which - at least in theory - could facilitate the realisation of its own holdings in domestic ventures and the retention of PNG assets in PNG hands. Discussions have been held with the Australian Stock Exchange on the technicalities, and with a number of Australian brokers over market-making. Given the high-level political commitment, most observers believe the project stands a good chance of becoming a reality - although Mr Iangalio recently played down the prospect of a July opening, preferring an end-1994 target date. But the level of business conducted on the new market is more debatable. Landowner compensation coupled with the build-up of local institutional funds and a large expatriate community means that there is no shortage of investable money in PNG. A ready supply of quality companies is more questionable, especially outside the core resources sector. 'The key,' says Bruce Parncutt, head of McIntosh Securities, the only Australian firm to maintain a small PNG office, 'will be the quality of the companies'. Lihir could prove a valuable boost.</p>

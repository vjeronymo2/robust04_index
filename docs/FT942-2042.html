			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Comcast to pay Dollars 1.27bn for Maclean Hunter unit Comcast, the US telecommunications group, has agreed to buy the cable television operations of Maclean Hunter, the Canadian communications and media group, for Dollars 1.27bn in cash. The acquisition is the latest big deal in the consolidation of the US cable TV market, which is becoming rapidly dominated by a few large operators. Two weeks ago, Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises paid Dollars 2.3bn for Times Mirror's cable TV unit. Comcast is buying the cable interests of Maclean Hunter, which include services and operations for about 550,000 subscribers in New Jersey, Michigan and Florida, from Maclean Hunter's parent, Rogers Communications, Canada's largest cable TV group. Rogers bought Maclean Hunter three months ago for Dollars 2.2bn. Rogers said then it would sell Maclean Hunter's US cable operations. The purchase will make Comcast the third largest cable TV operator in the US with 3.5m subscribers, behind TCI, which has 10m sub-scribers, and Time Warner, with 7m. Comcast also provides cellular telephone services to more than 7.4m people. Mr Brian Roberts, president of Comcast, said: 'For some time, we have considered Maclean Hunter's systems to be a logical strategic extension of Comcast's cable business. The acquisition allows us to increase our presence in three of the top 15 television markets.' Comcast's purchase, however, has several regulatory hurdles to overcome. Not only is the deal subject to US government approval, but Rogers' acquisition of Maclean Hunter is also awaiting approval in Canada, where the federal Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and the Bureau of Competition are likely to scrutinise the merger between the country's two largest cable TV operators.</p>

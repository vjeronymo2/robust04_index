			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Lottery player alleges dirty tricks bonanza: As bidding closes today for the licence, Motoko Rich reports on the campaigns of two companies which are fighting for a slice of the business 'Have you been brown-enveloped yet?' asked Mr Craig Watson, vice-president for public affairs at G-Tech, one of the world's leading lottery operators. He wondered whether the Financial Times had received an anonymously sent package of potentially damaging material about G-Tech, which he believes is part of a smear campaign to damage the company's chances of winning a role in the UK's first national lottery. The Financial Times has not received a brown envelope but a journalist on a leading Sunday newspaper said he had. G-Tech said that so too had a daily newspaper. According to Mr Watson, 'dirty tricks campaigns' have dogged the company ever since it had emerged as a leader in its field. Bids close today for the licence for the UK lottery, which is designed to raise cash for charity, the arts, sport, national heritage, and celebrating the millenium. G-Tech is battling for a slice of the business against its main US rival, Automated Wagering International. G-Tech has a 22.5 per cent stake in one bidding consortium, Camelot, and both companies are keen to sell computer hardware to the licence holder. The competition for the UK licence is taking on some of the characteristics of bids for US contracts, which are aggressive, litigious and highly political. Although the two companies are openly critical of each other, AWI denies that it is behind a UK campaign to discredit G-Tech. Mr Dan Bower, AWI's chairman, said: 'To my knowledge, we are not running any smear campaign.' The material in the brown envelopes, mostly US press cuttings, alleges that G-Tech uses questionable techniques to influence lottery officials who award contracts and politicians who determine lottery legislation. G-Tech declares itself innocent of all such charges. It points to the six court cases challenging its contracts in the US, of which it has lost none. It also cites its recent success in winning a contract in Texas to provide an electronic system for making welfare payments. 'G-Tech was vetted at the highest level by the federal government in order to win that contract,' said an adviser to the company, which is based in West Greenwich, Rhode Island, and holds 26 of 36 existing state on-line computer lottery contracts in the US. It operates 65 lotteries worldwide. Last year the company reported a turnover of Dollars 501.4m with profits after tax of Dollars 21.7m. AWI holds seven US on-line computer lottery contracts and provides lottery services in Norway and four provinces in Canada. It has annual US revenues of about Dollars 115.5m and profits of Dollars 12.9m. In the UK competition it is not part of any consortium, but it has agreed to supply hardware to three of the bidders: Rank Organisation, the Great British Lottery Company and Games for Good Causes. Like G-Tech, AWI has supplied the Australian company Tattersalls, which is in partnership with the merchant bank NM Rothschild as another bidder for the UK licence. Estimates for the UK lottery's eventual annual turnover range from Pounds 2bn to Pounds 6bn annually. Between 1989 and 1991, when the UK government was considering whether to launch a lottery, G-Tech made two written submissions on how it should be operated. Because most big lottery licences are awarded by governments after a competitive tendering process, those who wish to run the games need an astute understanding of politics. Mr Mark Cushing, senior vice-president for public affairs at AWI, said: 'You cannot participate in the industry and not be involved in politics.' G-Tech devotes considerable resources to the political process. It employs Lowe Bell Communications, a public relations company at which Sir Tim Bell, Baroness Thatcher's former PR adviser, is chairman, and one of G-Tech's main consultants. Lord Moore of Lower Marsh, a former cabinet minister, is a G-Tech director. The company says that Lord Moore is 'very non-executive' and has been 'kept out of their government relations work'. In the US, it uses lobbyists and political advisers from 24 consulting companies, many of which include former government employees on their payrolls. Mr Watson said: 'We try to learn the way government works and we employ consultants who are familiar with the way contracts are awarded. We are quite comfortable and secure in our use of lobbyists.' Some US politicians and G-Tech's competitors, notably AWI, have questioned the company's relationship with regulators and politicians there. AWI's Mr Cushing said: 'The American lottery industry has become highly politicised and our view is that it is driven by G-Tech's political connections.' However, an abuse of political ties by G-Tech has never been proved. Last year, AWI lost a court challenge of the award of the New York lottery contract to G-Tech. Its suit against G-Tech's success in the bid for the Georgia lottery is pending. AWI alleges that G-Tech was awarded the contract with a bid that was as much as Dollars 22m higher than AWI's. Georgia state representative Mr Matt Towery was concerned by the appearance of unfairness. He said: 'There was a perception that once we had opened up the bidding process and received the numbers we were trying to decide how to give the bid to our friends.' In Maryland, a grand jury investigation into the state's 1992 lottery procurement process - although not G-Tech itself - is pending. Mr Leon Billings, a Maryland state delegate who asked the US attorney to launch the investigation, is suspicious of the company's lobbying techniques. Mr Billings believes that a G-Tech lobbyist had access to information that led G-Tech to bid low in 1991, knowing that it would be able to obtain valuable add-ons to the contract without competition in 1992. Perhaps the most embarrassing case for the company has been the action against Mr Clay Jackson, a G-Tech lobbyist who was convicted last year on bribery and racketeering charges. However, the jury did not find that Mr Jackson had bribed a convicted state senator to vote against lottery legislation opposed by G-Tech and the company was never charged with any crime. During the trial a tape was played in which Mr Jackson described Ms Sharon Sharp, California's lottery director, as 'our gal'. Just before Mr Jackson's conviction, she resigned. AWI has also faced allegations of impropriety. Video Lottery Technologies, AWI's parent company, had its licence to operate a video lottery in Victoria, Australia, revoked in 1992 when the company's former chairman stepped down amid allegations that he had done business with convicted criminals. That licence was reinstated last year but the lottery commission in Quebec, Canada, has now denied the company a gaming licence. Last April West Virginia's former lottery director was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges including the allegation that he tried to secure a monopoly contract worth about Dollars 25m for a VLT subsidiary. The company has not been indicted in connection with the case. Mr Peter Davis, the lottery's director-general, said: 'One of my obligations is to satisfy myself that all the applicants are fit and proper and I shall conduct whatever investigations I deem necessary.'</p>

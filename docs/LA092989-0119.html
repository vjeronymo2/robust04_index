			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSING SUBSIDY CERTIFICATES  </P> <P> Torrance has accepted 21 new federal low-income housing certificates to help 10  elderly renters and 11 families pay their rent.  </P> <P> The certificates require holders to pay 30% of their income toward rent, with  the federal government subsidizing the rest.  </P> <P> Torrance, which now controls 569 of the certificates, has a two- to four-year  waiting list for the rent subsidy program, said senior planning associate Susan  Bornemann.  </P> <P> "This will be the first time we've been able to significantly affect our  waiting list in a long time," Bornemann said, noting that it has been at least  four years since the city was granted new certificates.  </P> <P> Under the rent subsidy program, low-income tenants must find apartments that  cost no more than $491 for an efficiency, $588 for a one-bedroom, $684 for a  two-bedroom or $876 for a three-bedroom, depending on the number of people in  the family.  </P> <P> The new certificates are expected to provide about $147,000 in federal  subsidies each year.  </P></p>

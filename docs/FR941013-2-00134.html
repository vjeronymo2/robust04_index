Since parts of this system are retrieved by individual identifier, the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, requires a general notice of the existence of this system of records to the public. The information may be used for telecommunication traffic studies, cost projections or other management studies and to enable the Department to verify call usage, determine responsibility for placement of specific long distance and/or local calls, and detect possible abuse of the government-provided long distance network. The records generated by the telephone systems used by the Department may identify individual telephone numbers and, in some instances, individual users. The records may also identify the originating number from which long distance and local calls are made. This system may contain telephone assignment records, results of administrative inquiries to determine responsibility for the placement of specific local or long distance calls if waste, fraud or abuse patterns are detected, or other records as required by individual components. The Department will maintain these records to further the Government's fiscal responsibility and accountability provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Privacy Act notices covering the comptroller of the Currency's Telephone Usage Information System (TUIS)_Treasury/CC .315 and the Internal Revenue Service's FTS2000 On-line Certification of Usage System (FOCUS)_Treasury/IRS 24.100 are duplicative of the proposed Treasury-wide system of records and will be incorporated into the Treasury-wide system. In accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;130, the two existing notices will be deleted from the Treasury Department's inventory of systems of records. The notice for Treasury/CC .315 was last published at 57 FR 13943 dated April 17, 1992. The notice for Treasury/IRS 24.100 was last published at 58 FR 64350 dated December 6, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new system of records report, as required by 5 U.S.C. 551a(r) of the Privacy Act, has been submitted to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget, pursuant to Appendix I to OMB Circular A&hyph;130, ``Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals,'' dated July 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following Privacy Act notices: Comptroller of the Currency's Telephone Usage Information System (TUIS)_Treasury/CC .315, and Internal Revenue Service's FTS2000 On-line Certification of Usage System (FOCUS)_Treasury/IRS 24.100 are removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Treasury-wide system of records Telephone Call Detail Records_Treasury/DO .211 is published in its entirety below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Alex Rodriguez, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Deputy Assistant Secretary (Administration). <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

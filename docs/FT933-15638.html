			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Accountancy Column: Broad-brush approach for a truer picture  -The final version of the ASB's operating and financial review formula ACCOUNTANCY IS not often compared with painting, but David Tweedie is in an expansive mood as he unveils the latest document from the Accounting Standards Board. 'We've said that this is a broad canvass,' says Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, referring to conversations held in recent months with companies. 'Now you paint away. We're keen that managements say what they like.' The final version of the operating and financial review (OFR), released yesterday, extends the paint brushes and palette expectantly towards British companies in the hope that they will use them constructively and creatively. The OFR is loosely based on the management discussion and analysis (MD &amp; A) with which US companies' accounts must comply. More specifically, the ASB sees its own version as an attempt to emulate what it believes is existing best practice among British companies but also believes it to be far less legalistic than its trans-Atlantic counterpart. The aim is to describe corporate performance, with analysis and a balance of good and bad while providing some element of a projection of the business into the future. Like most good artistic work, the OFR has been months in fruition. The previous discussion draft was produced in April last year. Since then, the ASB has been busily attempting to build consensus around its contents. The delay was partly the result of careful discussions with bodies such as the 100 Group of leading finance directors, the Association of British Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds and the Institute of Investment Management and Research. The 15-page statement is unusual in many respects differing from the normal accounting standards document. First, it is far more comprehensible to the lay reader than most of its predecessors. Technical words crop up far less frequently. That is to be expected, since the aim is to provide guidance which will lead to equally non-technical reports from companies. The OFR is intended to appeal to less knowledgeable readers, at a time when the accounts themselves are becoming more and more complex. 'We're looking for words, not for detailed numbers,' says Simon Peerless, the ASB's project director for the OFR. Adds Tweedie: 'I suspect this is the thing that private shareholders will read. It will also be useful for analysts.' He points out that while many company directors are complaining that FRS 3, the new standard on the profit and loss account, does not provide a fair portrayal of their performance, the OFR will give them the chance to describe their company's position in the way they want. The statement will provide much of the information that interests analysts too, which may be a necessary outlet at a time when informal City briefings are coming under attack by the Stock Exchange because of the risk of passing on inside information. It may, as a result, threaten analysts' position. It will also provide a convenient ground in which companies can describe the state of their internal controls and whether they believe they are 'going concerns' as required by the Cadbury committee on corporate governance. A second difference from normal accounting standards is that the OFR is not prescriptive. Unlike most ASB documents, it does not attempt to pounce on ambiguity in existing rules; nor, unlike other recent publications, does it even include examples to indicate the intention or the spirit rather than the letter of the standards-setters. 'We wanted to let many flowers bloom,' says Tweedie, extending the metaphor. 'We felt that if we provided too much explanation it would kill experimentation. This is not mandatory. We would rather have a much more free-flowing document.' Equally, unlike other standards there is no deadline for compliance. Tweedie hopes the OFR is out in time for some financial year-ends in the autumn, and certainly for many more for the start of next year. That is partly explained by a third difference: the OFR is outside the ASB's formal remit, which is to guide those areas within the statutory accounts at the back of annual reports. 'If it is a standard rather than a statement then we have got to have a locus to do it,' says Tweedie. That raises several difficulties. Most important is how far companies will comply, without the pressure of standards and the threat of the Financial Reporting Review Panel. There is not even the requirement for scrutiny of the statement by the auditors - unless there are any grave contradictions with the financial information in the accounts. All that exists is an unusual endorsement at the start of the OFR: a 'commendation' from the 100 Group, the Financial Reporting Council and the Stock Exchange 'in the interests of good financial reporting'. Tweedie argues that peer pressure will gradually persuade companies to comply, dragging the more recalcitrant executives into line with their more open, loquacious rivals. He points out that about two-thirds of FTSE-100 companies already provide some form of operating review in their annual reports, and cites examples of existing good practice such as from Shell. Some companies are likely to grumble that even if a picture is worth a thousand words, when it comes to the OFR it is only a complement for a few of the many numbers in the accounts. They will be concerned about the time and cost in producing lengthy statements to describe their performance. But Tweedie argues that most companies should already know most of the information they will be asked to provide and that the length of the typical OFR might only been 10-12 pages even for the most complex businesses. More significant, there will be concern over confidentiality. Smaller companies and those with a single product are likely to feel particularly vulnerable to providing information that might provide too much sensitive detail to their competitors. The ASB provides a let-out: that they should say when they exclude this information for this reason. It also suggests that they highlight any changes in expenditure on particular items, rather than providing any specific, absolute numbers. Nigel Stapleton, finance director of Reed Elsevier, and chairman of the technical committee of the 100 Group, says: 'I think the power of best practice will be a very potent force and people will want to be seen complying'. But how likely is it that companies - especially those which have something to hide - will provide ammunition to their critics by highlighting negative information on their performance and their weaknesses? Says Tweedie: 'It's going to be an interesting test of management freedom.' He can only hope that the pictures they paint will be more at home in the National Gallery than the Tate; more representational and classical than they are impressionistic and abstract.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Zulu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page; article published in </F> English]    [Text] Reports surrounding problems within the so-called  national Peacekeeping Force (NPKF), training outside  Bloemfontein, come as no surprise. Trainees reportedly lack  even basic discipline, and have been repeatedly drunk. They do  not obey commands of superior officers, which in any real  military or police force would constitute a serious offence.    Instructors have even been assaulted. Hundreds of trainees  have been observed toyi-toying [protest dancing] around the  camp, chanting "one settler, one bullet." Intimidation of some  trainees by others has been such that other trainees, in fear of  their lives, have been sleeping out in the bush.    According to one report in a Sunday newspaper members of the  supposed peacekeeping force demanded one dead SAP [South African  Police] member and one dead SADF [South African Defense Force]  member by sunrise. Large numbers of trainees attached to the  police forces of the homelands as well as the SAP have simply  felt in disgust.    If reports are true, then those trainees who are seemingly  incapable of behaving like real soldiers are members of MK  [Spear of the Nation; African National Congress military wing].  The purported reason for the National Peacekeeping Force is  that the SAP is incapable of impartially policing black  townships. A new, more credible force is needed, so they say.  This is not true. But what is quite obvious though is that a  large number of the NPKF trainees should never be allowed  anywhere near a uniform or a weapon.    If members of MK at the camp are unable to prevent  themselves  from intimidating and threatening their fellow trainees, is it  not likely that they will do much worse to members of the public  in the townships? That goes without saying.    The whole idea that MK can impartially maintain law and  order  in the townships, whether part of a national peacekeeping force  or not, is absurd. This is particularly so given that the NPKF  is supposedly intended as a kind of "fire brigade" which could  be deployed quickly to stabilize volatile areas of political  conflict in which the ANC is usually a role player.    In fact the debacle outside Bloemfontein tends to contradict  claims by the ANC, that MK and its associated "self-defence  units" are involved in impartial protection of township  residents. That is, quite frankly, nonsense.    What is most disturbing about the behaviour of the  riff-raff in training for the peacekeeping force is that these  are supposed to be the best MK could offer. They are supposed  to be the elite. No wonder the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche laughs when Nelson Mandela  threatens violence against the rightwing. Terreblanche's  pot-bellied commandos were previously considered something of a  military joke. It is now clear however that in a match against  MK it would be an unfair fight.    Let us strip away some myths about the liberation struggle.  If the propaganda is to be believed then MK was supposed to be  fighting for freedom against the apartheid regime. But how many  enemy soldiers did MK kill? Very few. More important for MK  was murdering black people who happened to belong to  organisations outside of the ANC camp.    This is what MK and the SDU's [Self-Defense Units] continue  to do. In September last year the Minister of Law and Order  stated that an incredible 3,258 MK members had been arrested for  crimes of violence during the last 12 month period for which  statistics were available.    ANC leaders, who incidentally were never soldiers, like to  now appear before crowds in crisp, brand new camouflage uniforms  imported from Cuba. MK is presented as a glorious army, and no  doubt this generates much support in certain quarters.    But it is in fact wrong to compare MK to any conventional  military force. More accurate in fact to compare MK to an  organisation like the government's sinister CCB, the Civil  Cooperation Bureau. But, by all accounts, the Government's  death squads were more disciplined.    Like the Government's former death squads, MK's style is  shooting a man in his home. Or throwing a hand grenade at  unarmed people waiting at a bus stop.    The vast majority of victims could never be described as  enemy combatants, not in any kind of military conflict. Because  of this, in spite of being militarily ineffective MK  nevertheless managed to kill a large number of people.    If MK had been a real military force there would be fewer  objections to its integration into reconstructed security forces.    What is clear now, more than ever before, is not only that  MK  members lack the discipline a security force requires. They are  also clearly incapable of peacekeeping without prejudice.</p>

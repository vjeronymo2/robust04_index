			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Management: Master minds - How the GMAT test has been changed to give a better picture of would-be MBAs In two weeks' time about 60,000 ambitious young people will sit down in around 700 centres in more than 100 countries to take the same exam. The results will gain little publicity and few people will be aware that such a single international test is taking place. Yet the examination is a key part of the quest for would-be MBAs (Masters of Business Administration). The exam is the Graduate Management Admissions Test, or GMAT, the only common international indicator of the quality of student applicants for MBA programmes. All but a few leading schools, notably Harvard, require it. It is increasingly controversial on several grounds - including whether some applicants have been cheating. GMAT-takers in October face a more than usually daunting prospect. For the first time in a decade a significant change is being introduced to the test. Candidates will have to write complex essays as well as answer the traditional multiple-choice questions. The GMAT is sponsored and directed by the Graduate Management Admissions Council (GMAC), an influential association of over 100 leading American business schools. Its administration is undertaken by the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey, in the USA. The test takes place four times a year in January, March, June and October. 'The GMAT allows us to reduce 600 applicants for 80 places to manageable proportions,' says Kamran Kashani, MBA programme director at IMO in Lausanne, Switzerland. Kashani believes it is a reliable predictor of academic success, especially in the quantitative area. 'Those who don't do well on the 'quantitative' part of the GMAT do seem to have trouble with subjects such as accounting and finance,' he says. 'There is no doubt that the GMAT has validity.' However, the test has come in for some criticism. A number of business schools are refusing to quote average scores on the grounds that they are 'misleading'. Or they say the GMAT is an inadequate measurement in that it does not provide a rounded picture of of a potential candidate. Kathleen Kiehle Valentine is admissions director of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz business school in the USA. She says that as business schools in the US attempt to diversify their applicant pool and student intake, it is no longer enough just to look at GMAT scores or academic grades. Bradford Management Centre, in the UK, runs its own tests for British students, which it regards as a more accurate predictor than the GMAT. John Sparkes, deputy director of the centre, says that 'the GMAT needs to be re-invented. It is simply too easy for students to prepare and be coached to succeed in it. I don't think that was the original intention.' There is also some concern that in such a geographically dispersed test it would appear to be relatively simple to have someone else take the test for you. There is anecdotal evidence that this can happen in a related test used by business schools and also administered from Princeton, the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Stories abound of students with good TOEFL scores arriving on programmes with only minimal English. Kashani accepts that there are examples of individuals who get others to take the test for them. But he believes it is fairly rare and, like many other academics, sees it as 'an acceptable risk'. Bill Broesamle, president of GMAC, agrees that 'impersonation' is a perennial problem but adds that there are many measures, including photo identification, to gain entrance to the exam, to overcome it. But Bradford's Sparkes warns of a potentially much more significant drawback. 'There is little doubt that there is cultural bias in the GMAT,' he says. 'And that works to the particular disadvantage of the Japanese and other nationals from the far east.' The cultural bias of the GMAT is widely acknowledged. The test exists only in English - and some say American English at that - and its multiple-choice approach is strange to many cultures. 'There is a cultural bias but we take that into account,' says Kashani. 'We don't have a specific formula for discounting it but after a while you get a knack of assessing it and getting it right.' But because of these and other worries, the GMAT is being significantly revised. In the test next month, for the first time candidates will face two half-hour essay questions designed to test ability to analyse complex issues and to argue a position. Traditionally, the GMAT has aimed to measure understanding and reasoning ability, both verbal and quantitative, through multiple choice questions. The highly formal structure of GMAT has made preparation and coaching for the undoubtedly tough test relatively straightforward. Although the new-style GMAT retains the multiple-choice sections, both GMAT administrators and schools hope that the introduction of essay questions, which will be difficult to prepare in advance, will give a much truer picture of candidates. 'Business schools and employers have asked us to include this type of essay question,' says GMAC president Broesamle. 'They are interested in students' ability to address complex issues in writing. This isn't just a test of writing skills. It's testing thinking ability in a different format.' Schools will continue to receive the traditional GMAT score but will also get a separate essay mark and copies of the essays. 'The essay questions should help us a lot,' says the Katz school's admissions chief Valentine. 'They will be a great improvement to the GMAT.' The EFMD (European Foundation for Management Development) welcomes the new essay questions particularly because they should allow non-American students to demonstrate their abilities better. Many academics believe the GMAT may be 10 years late in introducing essay questions, welcome though they are. But the belief that they will overcome the problems of excessive preparation and coaching for the GMAT may be short-lived. GMAC's Broesamle comments that the institutions that provide such training are already gearing up to coach students in writing GMAT-style essays.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AVERAGE GMAT SCORES OF STUDENTS BY REGION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Europe          GMAT  North America      GMAT  Rest of World      GMAT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INSEAD           650  MIT                 680  Otago               619 Cranfield        627  Amos Tuck           655  Sydney              610 London           625  Chicago             650  Singapore           601 IMD              620  Yale                650  Melbourne           600 Theseus          620  Camegie Mellon      640 Warwick          612  McGill              640 Dublin           610  Wharton             640 ISA              610  UCLA                640  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

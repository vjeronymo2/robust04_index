			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: STILL LOOKING FOR LOVE  </P> <P> Will somebody please cast M. Emmet Walsh as a romantic lead?  </P> <P> "It's amazing how I fall into the trap of doing those bad guys," the  53-year-old actor says genially. "I'm still waiting to do a role with a toupee.  And they never let me play Jamie Lee Curtis' love interest. In USA Today, Mike  Clark said it was nice to see me back -- after 'Clean and Sober' -- in the kind  of roles that had made my career: 'playing cesspools in colored shirts.' "  </P> <P> The cesspool of the moment is a CIA operative on the tail of some missing money  in the Jamaica-set, Denzel Washington-starrer "The Mighty Quinn" opening  Friday.  </P> <P> "There are only nine or 10 of us who do what I do," Walsh says of his  character-actor status. "How it happens is you get old and decrepit and bald  and finally they start hiring you. It's not that you're good or anything. They  figure if you've survived, you must be talented."  </P> <P> He laughed. "One learns one's craft, has a couple of lucky breaks, like  'Straight Time' with Dustin Hoffman, 'Blood Simple.' I've done a lot of movies  -- 59 of them. And my career has been helped a lot by cable. Suddenly, people  are looking at movies from 20 years ago, saying, 'Look, that's Emmet Walsh. He  had hair, he wasn't fat.' "  </P> <P> Walsh is equally self-deprecating about his current gumshoe role in the NBC  crime-solving series "UNSUB" ("They waved a great deal of money at me, which  was very hard to refuse.") and the upcoming film, "Chatahoochie," with Gary  Oldman and Dennis Hopper.  </P> <P> "Hollywood has finally recognized me as a sex symbol," the actor boasts,  "realized I could be trusted in certain types of roles. So they gave me a love  interest in 'Chatahoochie.' Of course, it turned out to be another male  prisoner who likes to wear dresses. . . ." JANICE ARKATOV  </P></p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Stronger growth undermines hopes of early rate cut Prospects for an early cut in UK interest rates appeared to fade yesterday as a clutch of official statistics added to recent evidence of stronger economic growth and a survey of business leaders signalled a possible return of inflationary pressures. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, returns to Britain today from a business trip to East Asia. Tomorrow he meets Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, for their first in-depth review of monetary policy since the Budget. High on Mr Clarke's agenda will be official figures, published yesterday, showing housing starts up by 11 per cent in the three months to the end of November, consumer credit business in the same period at its highest level for three years, and details of UK trade with the rest of the world in October showing volume exports growing faster than imports. Three surveys, published yesterday and this morning, provide more evidence of economic buoyancy to add to anecdotal reports of strong high street spending before and after Christmas, and last week's news of rapid growth in December of M0, the narrow measure of money supply. Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance group, reported yesterday that the number of UK business failures in the last quarter of 1993 fell to the lowest level since 1989. A Gallup survey commissioned and released today by DHL International, the distribution company, found increased confidence among UK exporters. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, says in a survey published today that UK businesses are more confident about trading conditions in the current quarter, with 58 per cent forecasting higher profits and nearly a third expecting to increase staff. Moreover, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet poll of 1,938 managing directors in all regions and sectors of British business found a sharp increase in those expecting to raise prices this quarter. More than a third of the managers surveyed between December 5 and 23 said they expected to increase their selling prices. D&amp;B said its prices 'optimism index', which is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents forecasting a decrease from those predicting an increase, increased to 20 for the current quarter from just 2 in the final quarter of last year. The price index was at its strongest level since mid-1991. A year ago it stood at minus 20. While the apparent buoyancy of the economy has shifted the balance of opinion since Christmas against an early cut in interest rates, the outcome of tomorrow's discussions is not certain. Some senior bank officials fear that an early interest rate cut could fuel inflationary pressures, while others fear that the tax increases due in April could stall the recovery. Officials are conscious that the economy is heading into the unknown in view of the very large tax increases in the pipeline. UK financial markets yesterday signalled reduced expectations of a cut in base rates from the 5.5 per cent level set shortly before the November 30 Budget. While other share markets rose, London equities dropped slightly, with the FT-SE 100 index falling 5.4 points to 3,440.6. UK gilt-edged government bond prices also eased, while the pound was firm. Expectations of steady interest rates helped lift the Bank of England's trade weighted sterling index to 82.5 at the close, its highest level since October 1992.

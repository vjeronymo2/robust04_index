			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Quito, 27 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Union sources reported  that Ecuadoran unions decided tonight to suspend the 24-hour  general strike scheduled to begin early on Tuesday. The United  Workers Front (FUT), which called the strike in solidarity with  Indian organizations, said "conditions are not right" for the  strike.    FUT President Raul Andrago said the workers' unions held an  extraordinary meeting this afternoon and evening and agreed to  suspend the strike that was scheduled to begin at 0600 on  Tuesday (1100 GMT). The leader of the main union in this  country of 11 million people clarified that the general strike  has not been indefinitely suspended and announced that it will  be held in mid-July, according to the circumstances.    FUT had called a 24-hour "preventive" strike for Tuesday to  reject the economic policies of Conservative president Sixto  Duran Ballen. The strike was also a show of support for the  peasant and Indian movement headed by the Confederation of  Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie). That organization is  demanding that the government repeal the new agrarian law, which  Conaie considers unconstitutional. [passage omitted]</p>

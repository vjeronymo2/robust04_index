			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone cuts purchase costs FURTHER questions surfaced yesterday over acquisitions made by Hartstone, the loss-making leathergoods and hosiery company which recently negotiated a standstill agreement with bankers following the breach of several covenants. Its annual accounts, published yesterday, showed that following further investigation it would pay Pounds 4m less than planned for the lingerie arm of Aznar, the hosiery company acquired in 1992. Hartstone became one of Europe's leading hosiery and leathergoods companies through a rapid succession of acquisitions. In January it said it would pay Pounds 10.4m in cash and shares for Aznar Industrial. However, the group said that the purchase price would now be Pounds 6.25m. The company said that the balance of Pounds 4.1m, including an initial payment of Pounds 3.7m, would be now be offset against the amount owed on Aznar, the hosiery company and the lingerie group's original parent. Mr Shaun Dowling, the chairman who replaced Hartstone's founder Mr Stephen Barker, said the alteration was an accounting technicality. The group earlier this month announced losses of Pounds 9.86m and Pounds 31m in above the line charges. The results followed profits warnings and the collapse of the share price from 272p in February to a low of 33p. The shares have since recovered, closing at 60p last night, up 4p. Analysts said yesterday that although the accounts were more detailed than normal there remained several questions, particularly as to how Hartstone would deal with difficulties arising from its high gearing of 120 per cent. 'After the standstill they have got a chance to trade their way out of some difficulties but not enough to bring the debt down,' said one. Observers speculated that the group would be forced to sell a business and perhaps call on shareholders for cash. BDO Binder Hamlyn reinforced the view in its auditors report, warning of the possibility of disposals 'at less than current net book amounts'.</p>

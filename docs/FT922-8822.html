			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (2): A dream corridor to Europe - Communications - and a bold plan entitled Green Links THERE IS a vision, which makes the periphery the centre, which changes the shape of European trade flows and which restores rail to the prime position as a handler of freight. It is a vision called Green Links. And it is not surprising that Great Grimsby is enthusiastic about it, because it could provide the town and the expanding neighbouring port of Immingham with a new role in the next century. Green Links is an idea for a rail and sea corridor, linking Ireland and the northern half of England with northern and central Europe. Immingham would be its key British axis, the last UK stop on the route to Germany, Russia, Czechoslovakia. The European Commission is helping to fund studies. Local authorities throughout Europe are involved. But what the idea lacks in the UK is an adequate rail network. 'We're agitating to get British Rail to put more effort into freight. Green Links is aimed at BR as much as at Europe,' said Mr Roy Bentham, Grimsby's director of leisure and economic development. As it is, the growth of the Humber deepwater ports, handling around 60m tonnes of freight a year - Immingham carried more freight in 1991 than in 1990, despite the recession - has been and will continue to be of economic significance. Although the plans for a new coal terminal foundered in March on PowerGen's hesitation, Associated British Ports, the owner, plans a new terminal of a different type, possibly for containers. Immingham is the major port of the region; indeed, it handles a greater volume of freight than any other port in the UK. But there are others, not least that of Grimsby itself, which has won the contract to handle the export of cars from the new Toyota plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire. Here, too, a consortium of fish merchants, fishing vessel owners and private dock operators, working under a licence from Associated British Ports, has a Pounds 16m plan for the modernisation of the fish docks. In Lincolnshire, the fortunes of Gainsborough, an inland port, have been in decline. But, under the new privatised management of AF Budge and John Sutcliffe, at Boston, on the Wash, work is taking place to allow entrance for vessels of 4,500 tonnes, instead of the present limit of 3,000 tonnes. Sutton Bridge was completed at the end of the 1980s as a general cargo port. Inland links to the ports have improved as the road infrastructure has gradually improved. The completion of the M180, running along the Humberside-Lincolnshire border, has been partly instrumental in fostering the growth of the Humber ports. The next motorway dream of the local authority planners relates to north-south communications. It is to have an extension of the M11 from Cambridgeshire through to Durham. It would pass to the east of Lincoln and to the west of Market Rasen, but the proposals and the route suggestions now reside in the Department of Transport awaiting decision. Meanwhile, the main north-south axis is the A1 and there is a programme to upgrade this to a three lane motorway. Other changes are of smaller order. The transformation of the A46 between Newark and Lincoln should be completed by 1996. Improvements have taken place to the east-west A17. The A52 between Nottingham and Skegness and the A158 between Lincoln and Skegness are being upgraded. The Lincolnshire County Council, following a policy of keeping through traffic out of market towns and villages, is spending on by-passes - at Swallow and Wainfleet, for example. Similarly, the main immediate improvements to the rail network are local. Lincolnshire County Council and Regional Railways reached agreement in April on the joint financing of a Pounds 3m package to modernise the line which cuts across the county, through Gainsborough, Sleaford and Spalding, starting at Doncaster and terminating at Peterborough. Without such an agreement the line probably would have been lost. A similar scheme was worked out for the Grantham-Skegness line ten years ago. Certainly there are local fears that British Rail may cut out its InterCity service between Newark and Grimsby, cutting the direct link with London, although there is a local service of Sprinter trains. But rail services, especially from the south of the county, are sufficiently speedy for Lincolnshire to be considered as London commuter territory. This is because of the electrified east coast main line, which means that the Grantham-London connection can be travelled in less than an hour. This route will be increased in importance once the Channel Tunnel opens: Newark is a designated stop for the direct passenger service to continental Europe. But there is one point that worried the Confederation of British Industry as early as 1990. 'The decline in the number of rail freight terminals in Lincolnshire needs halting,' it said in its document, Towards 2000 in Lincolnshire. 'Lincolnshire needs easy access to the inland rail freight terminals to take advantage of the Channel Tunnel,' and hence to ensure growth into continental markets. Continental air links are through Humberside Airport in the north, recently expanded to take more scheduled traffic, and through East Midlands Airport, to the south in Derbyshire. But for transatlantic flights, passengers still have to go either to London or Manchester.</p>

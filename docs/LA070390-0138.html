			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FUNERAL SATURDAY FOR REV. RAYMOND NICKEL  </P> <P> Funeral services will be held Saturday for the Rev. Raymond Louis Nickel, who  founded Orange County's first Lutheran Church in America. Nickel died of  prostate cancer and kidney failure Friday at FHP Hospital in Fountain Valley.  He was 70.  </P> <P> After serving at two churches in Ohio, Nickel moved to Santa Ana in 1951 to  start United Lutheran Church, the first of the Lutheran Church in America  congregations in the county. By 1988, the county had 13 such congregations.  </P> <P> When the family moved from Ohio, it lived "pretty much on a shoestring," said  Nickel's son, John R. Nickel. "They ate on beans for weeks. He always put the  church's needs first," he said.  </P> <P> For its first few years, the church operated out of a women's club in Santa  Ana. In 1953, United Lutheran Church was completed at 1416 S. Bristol St. in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Although the church started with fewer than 10 families, it grew to about 300  families during the Vietnam War, John Nickel said.  </P> <P> "It's a very traditional type of church," he said, adding that many military  families joined the church during the Vietnam War. Since then, as more families  moved to South County, membership dwindled.  </P> <P> The Lutheran Church in America merged with the middle-of-the-road American  Lutheran Church and the Assn. of Evangelical Lutheran Churches in 1988 to  become the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The churches had originated  along German and Scandinavian divisions. All together, the ELCA is considered  more moderate than the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, a theologically and  politically conservative denomination.  </P> <P> Nickel was born on Oct. 15, 1919, in Vandalia, Ohio. In 1945, he married Betty  Lou Creamer of Springfield, Ohio, who is now the principal of Jose Sepulveda  Elementary School in Santa Ana. He attended Wittenburg University in  Springfield, Ohio, and graduated from the Hamma School of Divinity with a  master's degree in 1945.  </P> <P> In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by daughtersMarilyn Dobbs of  Indianapolis and Julianne Preston of Hesperia, Calif.; brothers Vernon Nickel  of Mooresville, N.C., Kenneth Nickel of Jamestown, Ky., and Henry Nickel of  Portsmith, N.H., and four grandchildren.  </P> <P> Services will be at noon Saturday at United Lutheran Church in Santa Ana.  Graveside services will follow at Fairhaven Memorial Park, 1702 Fairhaven Ave.  </P> <P> The family requests that donations can be made to the American Cancer Society  in his name.  </P></p>

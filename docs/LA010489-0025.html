			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUC WARNS OF LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE FRAUD  </P> <P> The California Public Utilities Commission warned consumers Tuesday that as  many as 25 unauthorized companies may be trying to sell long-distance telephone  services illegally in the state.  </P> <P> Marco Valenti, manager of the PUC's consumer affairs branch, said the  unauthorized companies seem to concentrate on residential customers and small  businesses.  </P> <P> Usually, he said, the companies offer some form of flat fee for unlimited  long-distance calling or discounts for signing up friends and relatives. In  many cases, Valenti said, the firms lease only a few telephone lines from major  long-distance carriers, and these lines soon become so crowded that customers  find them constantly busy.  </P> <P> Valenti also cited a case in which a consumer responded to a sales pitch by  mailing $500 to an office address in Dallas only to find later, after  contacting the PUC, that there was no record of any such company. The money has  not been recovered.  </P> <P> Valenti urged consumers approached by representatives of long-distance  companies with which they are unfamiliar to check with the PUC in Los Angeles  (213-620-2570) or in San Francisco (415-557-1048) to make sure the firms are  certified by the state. The State Department of Consumer Affairs also offers a  booklet, "Choosing a Long-Distance Telephone Company," that can be ordered by  calling 916-445-1254.  </P> <P> Hundreds of long-distance telephone companies have started selling service  since the breakup of the Bell System five years ago, Valenti noted. The PUC  certifies more than 120 firms to provide service in California. These companies  are required to file their prices with the commission and to submit to state  regulatory procedures.  </P></p>

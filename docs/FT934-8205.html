			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / 'No 'military exception' to the constitution' the constitutional protections afforded private citizens. 'There is no 'military exception' to the constitution,' it said. 'Indeed, even when the Supreme Court has deferred to military judgment, it has been careful to do so only within the confines of ordinary constitutional analysis.' 'When the military fails to accord individuals the equal protection of the laws, it treads upon an area of expertise that has long been conceded to the courts,' the judgment declared. 'America's hallmark has been to judge people by what they do and not by who they are.' The court's logic is very similar to that advanced by President Bill Clinton whose controversial insistence on ending the 50-year ban on homosexuals has been rooted in the argument that only conduct in uniform should be the determining factor in a person's fitness to serve. The case concerned Mr Joseph Steffan, expelled from the Naval Academy in 1987, just before he was due to graduate, after a navy investigation had confirmed that he had told a fellow cadet he was homosexual. His initial appeal against expulsion was dismissed by a lower court.</p>

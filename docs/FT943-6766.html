			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Graham advances 25% but cautions on housing market The housing market has become more uncertain in the last three months according to Graham Group, the recently floated builders' merchant which yesterday announced a 25 per cent increase in interim profits. Mr Ian Mills, managing director, said the rate of growth in the housing market was expected to slow in the second half. Low price inflation of 1.5 per cent and a glut of newly-built houses were expected to hinder the market. 'It is a recovery that has a lot of uncertainty around it,' he said. Mr Mills said that although the housebuilding market had 'stormed ahead' in the first half, Graham's business was more dependent on builders fitting out the inside of houses. 'We have to be sure that the houses which have been built will in fact sell through.' In spite of such concerns, Mr Mills was sure the group - demerged from BTR in March through a Pounds 210m flotation - would perform well this year. The core plumbing, kitchens and bathrooms side increased market share in the first half. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 7.28m on a pro forma basis to Pounds 9.13m for the six months to June 30, on sales ahead 11 per cent at Pounds 203.3m. The profits expansion reflected efforts to improve margins by selling a better mix of product. Operating margins rose from 4.2 per cent to 4.9 per cent in the first half. Graham's Pounds 36m three-year refurbishment programme was already beginning to bear fruit, Mr Mills said. Sales were ahead by 45 per cent in revamped outlets which had been open for more than six months, against a group average of 16 per cent like-for-like growth. Eleven sites had already been refurbished and a further 20 would be completed in the second half. The maiden interim dividend is 1.75p, payable from earnings per share increased by 23 per cent on a pro forma basis to 5.3p. COMMENT Graham's gloomy comments say more about the group's caution than the market. All those houses that have been built will eventually have to be kitted out with bathrooms and kitchens, so whatever happens, sales will come through at some stage. On its own merits, Graham has a lot to go for and seems to be making all the right moves. The results are beginning to show through in the margin improvement and in increased market share. Forecasts are for about Pounds 18m this year, giving a prospective multiple of 18. The group's real recovery, however, is a year and a half away. Investors who bought in at the flotation are sitting quite nicely. Otherwise, the shares are pretty well up with events.</p>

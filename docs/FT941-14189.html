			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Technology: Colour hologram to halt CD pirates - Worth Watching Music and software held on cassettes and floppy discs have long been pirated, costing the entertainment industries millions of pounds in lost revenues. Now counterfeiters are beginning to copy compact discs, containing music, software and computer games. Compact disc manufacturer Disctronics, of West Sussex, has developed a way of printing colour holograms on to CDs so that a genuine product can easily be recognised from a fake. The hologram is printed on the master copy of the disc - for a cost of between Pounds 800 and Pounds 2,200 - and then replicated. The hologram can be a sliver of a pattern on the disc or a multi-coloured pattern which covers the whole surface - an idea Disctronics believes could prove popular with computer games companies.

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / EC plans pact with Israel THE European Commission yesterday unveiled proposals for a new free trade pact with Israel covering services and a stake in the EC's multi-billion dollar research and development programme. The proposal would extend the 1975 free trade agreement with Israel, and forms part of an unfolding EC policy aimed at capitalising on the breakthrough between Israel and the Palestinians on self-rule in the occupied territories. Mr Manuel Marin, EC Commissioner for development policy, said the new agreement would be an important step in supporting Middle East development. He said other trade arrangements in the region also needed to be updated, and called for round-table talks with Arab states, including Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan. The draft for the new bilateral trade agreement must be approved by EC ministers. It avoids serious concessions on agriculture, but offers other attractions for Israel: A broader political dialogue at ministerial level, enabling Israel to continue its escape from diplomatic isolation; Liberalisation of public procurement, so that public sector contracts are accessible on a reciprocal basis; A separate agreement whereby Israel could take part in the EC's R&amp;D framework programme which accounted for Ecu2.6bn (Pounds 2bn) in 1993; Co-operation on energy, the environment and drugs. Palestinian companies in the occupied territories will not be eligible for funding or special treatment under the EC-Israel pact, said Mr Marin. But this could change, once the nature and extent of self-rule in the territories became clear.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Waidhaus, Germany March 4 (CTK) -- Trade and  Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy agreed here today with the  Bavarian Economy Minister Otto Wiesheu that the National  Property Fund (FNM) would provide a guarantee for uninsurable  damages to the oil pipeline that will run from Ingolstadt,  Bavaria to Nelahozeves, Central Bohemia.    The FNM will deposit the guarantee of 80 million Deutchmarks  with the Czech National Bank for the whole period of existence  of the pipeline, stated Wiesheu.    Dlouhy said that the FNM was happy to do so because of the  significant amount of interest that it would receive from the  deposit.    He added that if the FNM ceased to exist while the pipeline  was still in operation, the state would take over the guarantee.  The pipeline is expected to operate for 20 to 25 years.    Dlouhy expects the guarantee from the Bavarian side to come  from the Bavarian Government or a state organisation.    "In the case of terrorist attack, each side would cover half  the damage. If there is war or revolution, both sides have the  right to withdraw from the agreement," stressed Dlouhy.    Details of the agreement will be worked out by a group of  experts on March 14, according to Wiesheu. The agreement should  be ready for signing by the end of March.    The Bavarian Government has prepared legislation enabling  construction of the pipeline to go ahead, which the Bavarian  parliament is expected to approve in April. It was necessary to  resolve the issue of the guarantee against damages resulting  from acts of God before the legislation could be passed.    Construction of the pipeline began on the Czech side last  September, and will begin in Germany this spring. The project  should be completed in 1995.</p>

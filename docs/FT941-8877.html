			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Herald raises Pounds 65m via placing Herald Investment Trust, a new fund specialising in small media and communications companies, has raised Pounds 65m through a placing. The issue was up to 50 per cent oversubscribed after the size of the fund was capped to allow manageable investment within its stated objectives.

The company is best known for its Pilot Investment Trust, which specialises in very small companies with market capitalisations under Pounds 30m. The new trust will invest in companies with market capitalisations of less than Pounds 300m in the information technology, software, broadcasting, printing and publishing fields.

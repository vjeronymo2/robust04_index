			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Demidenko] </F>   [Text] Kiev, 7 Jun -- "It is too early to talk about an  international conference on the subject of the North Korean  nuclear program. We are still studying the Russian initiative,"  PDRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said today in an exclusive  interview with ITAR-TASS. The minister was reluctant to make  further comments. He said that he will speak about this  question in more detail at a news conference that will take  place in Kiev tomorrow afternoon.    As is known, Russia had recently come forward with an  initiative for solving the crisis in the Korean peninsula by  convening an international conference to be attended by the two  Korean states, the United States, Japan, China, Russia, the  United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

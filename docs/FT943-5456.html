			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Sunset on a boulevard of inflated egos: The agents control Hollywood and, while the stars have grown bigger, the pictures have got small Motion pictures are 100 years old next year but they are not ageing well. This summer's releases - The Flintstones, Maverick, Beverly Hills Cop 3, Robocop 3 - suggest that Hollywood, for 80 years the undisputed headquarters of the movies, is sinking ever deeper into a second childhood. In 1913, Cecil B DeMille chose a one-horse suburb of Los Angeles for his western The Squaw Man. Since then, Hollywood has grown to reflect the dreams and aspirations of America, and to shape the popular culture of the west. But what is becoming of it now? Judging by this year's alarming and widely castigated movies, it is turning into a sort of box-office Babel. Hollywood on the brink of the new millennium is a place where movies are overpriced and overhyped, competing only for financial return rather than critical acclaim or even word-of-mouth commendation. Of course the Hollywood culture has always been tied to box office success. But in the past the integrated studios, with their own stars, producers and writers were at least striving to make great movies. The decline of the studios, under the assault of middlemen acting for big name producers and stars is throwing up quite different products, such as The Flintstones and Maverick (both out of 1950s TV), True Lies (out of James Bond via Last Action Hero) and sequels of sequels such as Robocop 3 and Beverly Hills Cop 3. Such movies use mass publicity to project tired and derivative ideas as ephemeral 'hits'. The fees (including shares of profit) paid to stars and producers have become so huge that studios can no longer afford the great and original screenwriters, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, who once worked for them. So they do not generate the stream of well-crafted stories on which to base their productions. Many commentators, including me, believe that the western film industry is dying by inches and that we know who is responsible. Hollywood today is a kingdom under enemy rule. We mean it is ruled by the agents and publicists who have staged a spectacular coup against the reign of the studios. The rise of the agents began in 1945 when the talent impresario Jules Stein, president of Music Corporation of America, bought the client list of the famous agent, Leland Hayward. It was an extraordinary inventory of talent, including Astaire, Garbo, Gene Kelly, James Stewart and Katharine Hepburn. Stein began at once to create from this list a new instrument which would gradually break the contractual hold of the studios over the stars. By 1948, MCA was putting pressure on the head of Warner Bros to release Bette Davis from a contract that still had several years to run. And one year later Stein secured an historic, unheard-of profits-share deal for another studio escapee, James Stewart, for the Western, Winchester 73. The studios, which for a generation had thrived by controlling costs and nurturing their own talent under tight contracts, began to crumble in the face of this onslaught. And when MCA itself broke up in 1962 - disbanded by Stein as the Justice Department began growling about its stranglehold on the industry - the stage was set for the three replacement companies we know today. CAA (Creative Artists Agency), ICM (International Creative Management) and a new William Morris Agency took over the talent-handling business and, many people believe, now run the entire film industry. And in recent years they have enabled stars with inflated fees to shape the industry's output. This is good for the talent, or at least for their bank balances. But bad for audiences. To understand why, let us see how this new-look industry operates. Broadly: for every Jack Nicholson or Julia Roberts or Francis Coppola, there is a Joe Blow or Jane Blow, an agent or publicist, to act as bellows-minder to the myth. Their job is to tell the outside world that 'Mr Nicholson's price for his next movie is Dollars 12m plus 2 per cent of the gross' or 'Mr Coppola will do The Tonight Show but not Oprah Winfrey' or (if you are a journalist) 'Miss Roberts has never heard of you, go away.' As the studios declined, these doorkeepers to the stars became stars themselves. In the old-style studio, most employees had some hands-on relationship with the stuff coming off the line: the movies. Veteran VIPs will describe the interconnectedness of every studio activity. Publicity, marketing, negotiating for roles, even schooling - for infant stars such as Elizabeth Taylor or Margaret O'Brien - took place inside those walls. And however despotic the seven-year contract may have seemed, it allowed the studios to plan a stream of well thought out movies tailored to the available talent. Today, as the veteran, Billy Wilder says, the studios are 'like the Ramada Inn. You check in, you check out.' The people running studios now change rapidly, whereas the agencies have an awesome consistency of top personnel - and of personality too, handed down from men such as the CAA boss, Michael Ovitz, obsessed with Oriental disciplines and near-religious team spirit. The studios are like British soccer clubs. They reel from one whizz-kid manager to the next. And when a new whizz kid comes in, where does he turn for ready-made ideas and projects to jump-start his production schedule? Why, to the agents. And what is the agent's main interest? To get more money for his client. Hand in hand with these agents, and symbiotic with them in the modern Hollywood are the more recently arrived publicists. Agents (mostly men) find a project for one of their stars and try to package him or her with other clients for the same film. (The most famous - or infamous - example was Legal Eagles, concocted by an agency as a vehicle for Robert Redford, Debra Winger and director Ivan Ghostbusters Reitman. It bombed at the box office, costing Paramount Dollars 35m and earning a small fortune in commissions for CAA.) Publicists (mostly women) ensure that their star, director or prodigy gets on the right chat shows and magazine covers. This double act performs the old one-two that used to be achieved seamlessly by the studios. Get the celebrity in the movie project; then get the celebrity in the public eye. The doyenne of present-day publicists, Pat Kingsley of PMK, went into history as the first to ask a magazine editor: 'Why do you always get to choose the cover?' While the publicists wheedle or coquette or menace, the agents flex ever more alarming muscle. Sometimes they just sit around forcing up clients' fees, until studios, like opera-houses, must risk near-bankruptcy in order to get the crowd-pleasing talent. Sometimes agents put the fear of God into clients who might desert to another firm. And sometimes they graduate to brokering super-colossal deals as Ovitz himself did in the case of the Sony-Columbia and Universal-Matsushita mergers. But Hollywood's new rulers could not have assumed such power without help from the pre-existing power of the artist-megastar. If the break-up of the studios created the opening for these 'personal' minders and advisers, it also made Hollywood a place where artists' egos now float like dirigibles far above the old studios, while the strings are held by the career adjutants down on the ground. These adjutants cannot, many critics suspect, sniff the air as the best bygone studio bosses did, nor see the further horizons of cinema and popular culture. They feel only the immediate crunch of career opportunity. Jeff Berg, head of ICM, has heard the bad press before and answers it for me in his penthouse office on Beverly Boulevard. No, he claims: he and his fellow agents are not taking over: 'We have no interest in assuming the role of the studios. We are not distributors or financiers or producers.' Yet do they not have great power over what is produced? An agent might tell a studio, for example, Look, you can have Macaulay Culkin for Home Alone VIII; but only if you take two of our other stars plus one of our directors and a screenwriter for the same project. Berg says only that: 'We are a mechanising process between the gatekeepers of the studios and the world at large.' At this point the telephone rings and Berg picks it up. 'Hi, Terry.' It is Terry Semel, not so much a gatekeeper at Warner, more President of Motion Pictures. Inspired by this example of spontaneous synergy I walk round to Warner to catch Semel or his fellow supremo at the studio, Robert Daly. Daly is sitting in a large room with a fish tank and a small army of minders. He has an empire to run; and if studios are crumbling, then top-of-the-box-office Warner will be the last one to go. Are agents more powerful today? 'Yes, of course. When Bette Davis was under a contract with us, her agent would come in and scream and kick and Jack Warner would say, Goodbye]' Daly chooses an unfortunate example. After 1949 it was Bette Davis who said the goodbyes. But I take the point - and also Daly's observation on modern times. 'Today, if you want Julia Roberts for a new movie you have to woo her agent.' And do deals. 'They can demand a lot of rights. Most of the time they are asking for more money.' And that money, 90 per cent of which floats up from the agent to the artist, is part of the fine madness guiding modern movie practice. Dollars 12-Dollars 15m per picture plus profit-points is now the going rate for a top male star - a Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger - with top women such as Roberts trailing gamely at Dollars 8m. So the star, having broken free from the old-style studio's ceiling wages and being further flattered by the ministrations of his publicity people, suddenly commands both the ego and the capital to initiate his projects. However much the star's advisers may demure, dreadful films such as Hudson Hawk and Ishtar and Last Action Hero get made. And although the ego may land with a thud, the agents get their upfront 'packaging' commissions and 10-per cents. And the star - such is the militarised power of modern Hollywood hype  -is up and flying again before you can cry 'Variety charts]' The great virtue of the old studios was that egos were kept in check. People knuckled under to the next film on the contract. And when they bowed to the studio's routine publicity demands, it was to a genial daftness quite unlike the terrorism of today's PR work. As Deborah Kerr once remembered for me: 'They would wheel us out for an hour or so to pose for magazine covers - green background for this magazine, pink for that one - or to chatter about how we kept our cold cream in the ice-box. Then back to the movie.' Today it is not this benign exposure that counts in PR work, but the cult of near-mystical elusiveness. The modern publicist's job is to preserve the idea of the star, or star director, as above us all: and to gloss over minor fallings from the sky. (Flop movies often mysteriously vanish from later publicity-packs about a film personality.) Hollywood press agents have become known as 'sup-press' agents for their ability to preserve this myth of unattainability. So big Hollywood movies, powered by their stars' artificially-generated rarity value, are made to seem like visits from an extraterrestrial. It hardly matters whether the films themselves are good or bad: that rarity value invariably makes them an 'event'. And when the star deigns to fly to Earth once a year to open his new film, the PR people surround him and the picture with an entire ecology of support iconography. Batman T-shirts for Tim Burton / Nicholson's offering; Flintstone toys for Spielberg's latest; a whole playroom arsenal for Arnie's new actioner . . . Edward Pressman, the independent producer who has rolled out high-visibility films as diverse as Conan The Barbarian, JFK and Reversal Of Fortune, thinks the age of the ego, encouraged by agents and publicists, has its compensations. 'There is a level of talent and idiosyncrasy that didn't exist in the old Hollywood,' he tells me. 'You could say the quality of mainstream movies that the studio factories made, was more consistent. But it's compensated for today by a lot of films that would never have been made then: experimental films, ones that break the mould.' Point taken: but it applies more to the low-cost end of the market than the high. (Even Schindler's List was a shoestring operation by Spielberg standards.) What we have at the high end is star egomania eternally demanding more money, via the agent, and more image-enhancement, via the publicist. In a word, hype. The same hype that causes millions of gullible film fans to flock to movies like this summer's: movies so freighted with star names or so pre-publicised as Happenings that no one realises - until they have paid Dollars 100m to push The Flintstones or Maverick or True Lies into profit - that the films are as imitative, overblown and perishable as carnival floats. What do the agents care? They take the money (up-front) and run. What do the publicists care? The triumph of their art is written in the ledger books. And what does the 'talent' care? It thinks it is God anyway. Everything tells it so, from the people it employs, to the film-goers hyped into overpaying for its films. If it is a mad world, it is one with its own dismaying logic. When MGM mogul Louis B Mayer saw trouble coming back in those star-enfranchising 1940s - 'The lunatics are taking over the asylum' - little could he have guessed at the perfect mutual support which would evolve decades later, between those lunatics and their Lotusland lackeys.</p>

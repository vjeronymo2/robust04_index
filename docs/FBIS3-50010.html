He arrived on Sunday [16 January] for a visit to Italy, at  the invitation of the general secretary of the ministerial body  supervising Italian secret services.    "Secret services in today's civilized societies assist in  the  battle against crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, arms  smuggling, and the mafia," Fuzessy said.    "Although Central and Eastern European countries freed from  the former Soviet bloc are a promising ground for all criminal  rings in East and West, there is no immediate danger at  present," he said.    Fuzessy's discussions in Italy also concerned supervision  experience, governmental and parliamentary practices of  licensing the use of secret service means, and controlling it  through the central budget.</p>

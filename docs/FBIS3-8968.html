			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radeskyy </F> after meeting with Romanian Foreign Minister Theodor Melescanu  in Bucharest on 16 March; recorded, in Russian with  passage-by-passage translation into Romanian]    [Text] As you know, Romania is our neighbor, a country  with which we have an over 600-km common border. We have  discussed a few theoretical problems and found several joint  points of interest. I am referring to political, military, and  mainly technical-military aspects, such as the training of  cadres and methods of training cadres. We also discussed complex  technical-military issues and ways to coordinate actions, carry  out joint maneuvers, and ensure an exchange of experience.    Today I visited the educational institution of the Romanian  Navy. There, we discussed issues regarding our bilateral  relations and our views about issues that are of great interest  to both sides.    We drafted a number of conventions regarding cooperation  between us, between our countries, such as the accord on  cooperation between the two military departments. We also  broached issues regarding the concept of and our participation  in the Partnership for Peace, which both we and Romania have  signed, and we agreed that this is a first stage and then, we  will have to participate in NATO, but for this new stage we will  have to prepare new proposals. I am referring to military  issues and the issues of our departments.    Thus, in general I am very pleased with this visit because  70  percent of the issues we broached have been solved during my  stay here, after one and a half days, and we still have a few  visits scheduled. Our relations are excellent. Yesterday we  held talks with the minister of defense and today with the  foreign minister. Yesterday we discussed economic issues of  mutual interest with the prime minister [Nicolae Vacaroiu]. He  will soon pay a visit to Ukraine. We also have a meeting  scheduled with Romania's president. In the evening we will meet  with the chief of staff [Dumitru Cioflina], with whom we will  discuss strictly military issues.</p>

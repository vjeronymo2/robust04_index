			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Builders complain to OFT over plasterboard prices BUILDERS have complained to the Office of Fair Trading about increases in plasterboard prices, alleging possible collusion between suppliers. Recession-hit companies in London, south-west England and the Yorkshire area fear that large rises in the cost of such a basic material, due to take effect at the end of this month, could turn low-priced long-term contracts into lossmakers. Reductions in discounts, announced this summer by BPB Industries, the country's largest supplier, are expected to raise plasterboard prices on average by about 10 per cent. BPB has a 65 per cent share of the UK market. Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany which, together with BPB, supply virtually all the plasterboard sold in the UK, are expected to raise prices by similar amounts. The three companies were until recently locked in a bitter European price war. Mr Dennis Maiden, director-general of the Federation of Master Builders which represents 20,400 building companies, has asked the OFT to investigate the latest increases. This follow complaints from members that plasterboard prices in some areas could rise by between 15 per cent and 20 per cent. BPB said yesterday that price increases, depending upon previous local discounts, could range from 7 per cent to 20 per cent but would average about 10 per cent. It is the second increase to be announced by one of the big three manufacturers. At the begining of this year Knauf unveiled a rise in British prices of about 8 per cent. Mr John Maxwell, BPB's finance director, yesterday estimated that only about half of this earlier increase, which had been followed by the other manufacturers, had stuck. He said: 'Plasterboard prices had fallen by more than 50 per cent since 1987 as a result of the price war. Prices, even with the latest increases, will still be more than 40 per cent lower than they were five years ago and 30 per cent lower than in 1990. 'There has been no collusion. If other manufacturers decide to follow our lead it is because they need to increase margins after years of selling at a loss or break-even.' The Federation of Master Builders said that increases would hurt small and medium-sized companies which would be unable to negotiate as big a discount as larger groups. It said many companies already were operating on contract margins which did little more than cover overheads. The federation said: 'Although the increases have yet to come into effect, we believe that there may have been a degree of collusion between the three manufacturers which clearly are going to increase prices in line with each other.' The OFT said yesterday that it had received a complaint from the federation and would monitor the situation.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (2): From revolution to evolution - The economy is already restructuring Two-and-a-half years after President Boris Yeltsin launched radical market reforms, the Russian economy may finally be settling from revolution to evolution. 'The most important role of reformers now is to prevent silly things from happening,' explains Mr Sergei Vasiliev, deputy economics minister and one of the few radical reformers still in government. Six months after the election of a parliament dominated by ultra-nationalists and Communists, and the departure of senior reformers such as deputy prime ministers Mr Boris Fyodorov and Mr Yegor Gaidar, this may sound a bleak assessment. But Mr Vasiliev believes that in order to continue its tortuous march towards a market economy, Russia 'doesn't even need very active reformist policies at the moment. The necessary measures are of a long-term nature and require day-to-day efforts.' Professor Yevgeny Yasin, chief economic analyst for President Yeltsin, takes this argument one step further, claiming that Russia has already completed 'the main reforms' needed by its economy. 'Now we need painstaking polishing work,' he says, citing for example, the need for a more efficient banking and judicial system, and for a crackdown on organised crime. At the alarmist end of the spectrum, Mr Sergei Glaziev, head of parliament's economic reform committee, warns that an expected 25 per cent drop in industrial production this year will mean the 'liquidation' of entire sectors of Russian industry. But dramatic Russian statistics tell only half the story of an economy that is already restructuring in what an IMF economist described as 'a completely chaotic, unplanned way'. With services exceeding 50 per cent of gross domestic product for the first time in Russian history, industrial output, considered the most sacrosanct economic indicator under Communism, now only accounts for 30-35 per cent of GDP. A booming private economy in services and trade is under-reported and virtually untaxed. As a result, up to 40 per cent of the economy may not be taxed at all, and GDP may be undercounted by as much as 15 per cent. In the pursuit of attempts to drive down inflation and set the foundations for economic growth, 1994 has marked the onslaught of the tightest monetary and credit policy since Russia's botched attempt at Polish-style shock therapy in January 1992. The paradox is that the squeeze is being operated by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister who six months ago floated the idea of fighting inflation by 'non-monetary means', and by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, once dubbed the 'worst central banker in the world'. The belated reformism has also been accompanied by some clumsy attempts to return to greater state control over the economy in order to 'restore order' to it. For example, one of Mr Yeltsin's least enforceable decrees issued this month, designed to crack down on tax evasion, require companies to report any banking transactions greater than Dollars 10,000 to the tax authorities. But reformers who feared the worst can pride themselves on the fact that reforms have not been rolled back - not least because a middle-of-the-road government which proposed to change tack turned out to be ideologically bankrupt. Mainly because the departure of the radicals left Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Gerashchenko carrying full responsibility for any resurgence in inflation, it has remained under 10 per cent a month since February, its lowest level since August 1992. An end to subsidised credits to all enterprises except for agriculture, coalmining, and the biggest factories means that companies face a real prospect of closure unless they restructure and as long as the government maintains its tight policies. Related attempts are being made to force companies to repay the Rbs22,000bn in debts they have accumulated with each other in an attempt to cushion themselves against the shock of government policies. 'How can you have a market economy where people don't pay their debts? We have to teach people to give back money they owe,' says Prof. Yasin. At the same time, a mass privatisation programme, putting 70 per cent of industry into private hands by July 1, has been allowed to draw to a successful conclusion. Foreign trade liberalisation has continued, with the lifting of quotas from next month on most exports including the oil and gas which are Russia's main source of hard currency. If carried through, these will effectively remove the last controls on domestic energy prices, as well as abolish an important source of corruption. President Yeltsin, who returned to the economic stage with a host of decrees this month, also ordered the scrapping of exemptions from export and import duties which have cost the country dear. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, estimates that these and other tax breaks may represent as much as 7-10 per cent of GDP. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister responsible for the economy, says the authorities' decision to stick to financial orthodoxy reflects a 'realisation that there are no extravagant means for stimulating economic growth'. Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, claims the new stance is due to a 'general change in the mentality of monetary authorities. . . who, by their own experience, not through textbooks, realised there is a very simple correlation between money supply growth and the growth of prices.' Mr Chernomyrdin can also cite as his personal achievement the relative political stability which has followed the election of the new parliament and the adoption of a new constitution setting out a clear division of powers. Confounding predictions of further conflict between the executive and the legislative authorities, he recently cajoled powerful conservative forces in the new State Duma into accepting an anti-inflationary budget for 1994. Particularly revealing of the political elite's new understanding of economic realities was a refusal by the energy and agricultural lobbies  - strongly represented in the Duma - to support Rbs15,000bn in additional spending demanded by the military. This would not only have wrecked a budget already under threat from falling tax revenues at a time when the government says it has collected only 36 per cent of tax receipts due in the first quarter of this year. It would have meant undermining their own energy and farming subsidies through a sharp increase in inflation because Russia finances its budget deficit, which will be at least 10 per cent of GDP this year, mainly by printing money. Lying not far beneath the surface of reformers' relief over the avoidance of 'silly' decisions, is concern that more is not being done by the government to push through structural reforms. Mr Alexashenko, the reformist deputy finance minister responsible for the budget, says 'the most dangerous problem is that we have no strategic thinking in the government'. 'To the extent that the government is not meeting all the needs of declining industry, there is shock therapy going on but it is a passive policy,' agrees an IMF economist. 'However, there are many sectors which require a pro-active policy and in which the government has to play an organising role.' An industrial policy, providing selective government support for sectors and companies most likely to achieve growth, is described by the government as urgently-needed but has yet to materialise. This year, for example, Russia is to spend Rbs10,000bn on coal subsidies, representing almost a tenth of budget revenues projected at Rbs124,000bn. But none of this money will be used for the longer-term restructuring which is the only way to secure the Russian coal industry's future and stop a debilitating drain on the country's finances. 'There has been a chance for two years to close down at least one mine,' says Prof Yasin. 'Maybe there is not enough political will now; maybe different people are needed in office.' The government is also failing to build up an adequate social safety net to cope with future unemployment and prevent poverty. Earlier this month, President Yeltsin forecast that the fight against inflation would lead to 'regional' unemployment in specific parts of the country, such as Ivanovo province where textile plants have been on the verge of closure for months. Mr Vasiliev argues that even if bankruptcies become more prevalent in Russia, the present financial policies 'mean that enterprises will be dying very slowly in Russia, which is not a bad thing. We can always consider the possibility of a social outburst but I don't think there will be something sudden in this sphere.' But nobody knows exactly what the effects of these financial policies will be on overall employment, not least because of uncertainty over whether the government will keep to them. Unemployment, measured in terms of job-seekers, is still remarkably low at 1.8 per cent. But it is already far greater if one counts the number of people who are being kept on by enterprises but are not being paid. The main question over the next six months is whether the government will adhere to its financial policies when enterprises start closing down. Although the central bank has yet to phase out so-called 'directed credits' to the economy, they carry real interest rates for the first time. Although subsidies are still being found for the biggest enterprises - 'those with good connections to the president and prime minister' according to Mr Alexashenko - most companies now face hard budget constraints. The central bank says it is following to the letter monetary growth targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund. A memorandum of understanding between the Fund and Russia - setting a monthly inflation target of 7 per cent by the end of the year - may be unambitious. But because the government is so much stronger than its predecessors, it may also be the first IMF agreement to be carried out to the letter. 'We haven't set very ambitious goals,' says Mr Tulin. 'But we are realists. The present state of affairs in the economy does not allow us to be more restrictive.' Displaying continuing central bank concern about areas which should be the responsibility of the government, he argues that more ambitious targets for inflation would trigger 'very high unemployment'. But one veiled signal that the government may already be unable to stick to the 1994 budget and monetary growth ceilings came when the central bank earlier this month lowered its official lending rate from 200 per cent to only 185 per cent. This was well above a 140-150 per cent average interest rate calculated by the International Monetary Fund as the benchmark which the central bank agreed to shadow in the memorandum of understanding. Explaining the caution, Mr Tulin says that 'the monetary factors of inflation are under the control of the central bank except for one: the size of the budget deficit.' He says the restrictive policies must also be accompanied by an industrial policy. However, because of the government's likely failure to implement an industrial policy to minimise the damage to Russian industry, foreign investment appears to be Russia's best hope for restarting growth in its manufacturing sector. Mr Chernomyrdin is due to meet international business leaders today to discuss obstacles facing foreign investors in Russia. Prof. Yasin says the government must take the lead in insuring foreign and domestic investors in order to get growth going. When Mr Chernomyrdin travels to Naples to attend the G7 summit with President Yeltsin next month, he will be renewing pleas for foreign investment. He will also be pressing for early negotiations for an IMF standby credit of Dollars 3bn and a long-term rescheduling of Russia's Dollars 80bn of foreign debt. Although the west has been sidelined in its importance to domestic reforms since the radicals tried and failed to carry out shock therapy with western support, the good will of the western financial community remains crucial to Russia's balance of payments. The IMF has calculated that Russia, which has overestimated its trade surplus for this year, faces an external financing gap of Dollars 25bn in 1994, compared to Dollars 15bn last year. Because of the way in which the foreign debt was contracted, with bunched-up maturities, an inordinately heavy burden of debt payments - Dollars 14.5bn of principal and Dollars 6bn in interest - falls due this year. Part of that burden has already been alleviated by an agreement this month rescheduling Dollars 7bn in debt owed to the Paris Club of creditor governments in 1994. So far, however, Russia has been unable to come to any arrangements over the Dollars 26bn it owes commercial banks because of its refusal to accept that banks should be able to seize state-owned assets if it defaults on payments. Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister, hopes nonetheless that Russia will be able to reschedule 'all our debts on a long-term basis' this autumn. For all the present government's shortcomings, Prof. Yasin may be right in arguing that political realities mean there is no realistic alternative to the present team in Moscow. He says that because Russia is not a dictatorship, but a democracy, albeit an imperfect one, 'people find reforms difficult to put up with. They expressed themselves in the December 12 elections.' But here lies the main weakness of a government which has been better able than its radical predecessors to promote political stability in the short term. The danger, ahead of elections scheduled for 1996, is that it lacks the vision and expertise to promote the wider-ranging reforms required for longer-term stability.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / OFT set to limit ITV rights to programmes THE Office of Fair Trading is expected this week to recommend strict limits on the time during which ITV companies can hold the UK rights to programmes made by independent producers. ITV said it wanted to hold UK rights to programmes it had funded for 10 years with an option for a further five years. The OFT is expected to decide that ITV should hold the UK rights to an independent production for only around five years. ITV has told the OFT it is willing to give up its 15-year proposal in favour of individual negotiations on every project, but that offer is likely to be rejected. The OFT is also expected to favour independent producers having the option of being commissioned directly by the network centre. However, the position on rights could be complicated by an EC draft directive which suggests giving primacy on rights to programmes to their authors and directors rather than to the production companies or broadcasters.</p>

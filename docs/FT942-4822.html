			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Labour claims Eastleigh strength Labour yesterday claimed it was running second in tomorrow's Eastleigh by-election as Mr Tony Blair, the front-runner for the Labour leadership, said the party had become more attractive to people in the south of England. Although Labour has privately conceded that it has no chance of winning the contest - called after the death of the Conservative MP Stephen Milligan - it is still hoping to push the Conservatives into third place. However, Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who are expected to take the seat, warned that anything but a vote for his party 'risks putting another Tory MP into Westminster'. Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat candidate, said he had met many life-long Conservatives who said they would never vote for the government again, but he cautioned against complacency. 'At the last election there were many people thinking of voting Liberal Democrat who, in the last week, drifted back to the Tories,' he said. Mr Blair, who spent yesterday morning at Eastleigh police station to discuss crime prevention, made it clear at the morning press conference that he thought Labour had made the necessary changes over the past 10 years for it to have more appeal to southern voters, although he was unable to name the last by-election which Labour won in the south of England. By investing political capital in Eastleigh, Mr Blair has adopted a risky strategy. If the party fails to come second it will be interpreted as a blow to its hopes of winning more votes in the south of England. Mr Stephen Reid, the Conservative candidate, denied that his party's vote had collapsed, arguing that he was receiving 'a positive response everywhere'.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / As They Say In Europe: How to make friends and destroy people Last weekend, said Le Figaro, 'the voters of the majority anxiously heard the tocsin.' The paper was talking about what was supposed to be a victory rally in Paris for the leader of the major right-wing party, Jacques Chirac, who gave up the post to announce he was standing for president next year. No-one expects him to win, even though his party crushed the left in legislative elections 18 months ago. The great difference between Europe and the US is that in the latter every electoral landslide signifies some kind of gigantic once-and-for-all change. The mid-term elections altered the face of US politics for good. Until the next time, that is. When the right swept France, everyone knew it was just because people were fed up with the left. Therefore, it seems, French and American circumstances are entirely different. There will not be a left-leaning Congress for generations while the Socialists will win a crushing victory in France at the next legislative election, if not the presidential. Only Time magazine compared the two countries but chose the period of cohabitation of the 1980s to set alongside the situation President Bill Clinton faces. It is, however, the present cohabitation which is peculiarly relevant to the looming battle in Washington. In Paris an embattled president of the left gazes out from his palace at a legislative body dominated by political opponents. President Francois Mitterrand, aged, maybe dying, and, in the minds of many, entirely discredited, looks on as leaders of the right-wing RPR (Rally for the Republic) and their allies fight it out to be his successor. Yet when Chirac put himself forward as a candidate, he was attacking not Mitterrand but the prime minister, Edouard Balladur, also of the RPR. As a provincial paper noted: 'In seeking an excessive legitimacy at the heart of the RPR, Jacques Chirac risks breaking in two the movement inherited from Charles de Gaulle.' The rivalry between Chirac and Balladur is only one element in the apparent determination of the right to smash itself itself to pieces. Not all its leaders are men of charm and grace: Balladur seems a pretty good chap, Chirac is a bit rough - as mayor of Paris he can scarcely be anything else - Valery Giscard d'Estaing a little shop-soiled. But by comparison with the new majority leaders in Congress, they are cuddly toys. Nonetheless they have relentlessly followed a path that is now known as one of 'suicidal logic.' In Washington, the new leader of the Senate will be Robert Dole, a man of enormous ambition and a gift for in-fighting and poisonous abuse that few can rival. Apart, that is, from the new House speaker, Newt Gingrich, who is in turn regarded as the acceptable face of American conservative republicanism when put alongside his senatorial colleague, Phil Gramm of Texas. It is likely that these gentlemen will all excessively insist on their legitimacy, as the French say, and seek their party's nomination for the presidency. President Clinton should study how Mitterrand contributed to the destruction of his opponents. (This was a purely platonic act for Mitterrand himself has nothing whatsoever to gain from his success.) He will see that the French president has personal qualities that in some ways match his own, although Mitterrand admittedly enjoys the advantage that his interest in the opposite sex has not worked against him among his compatriots. What Clinton lacks is that special crafty, malin quality that characterises the French leader's approach to politics. In fact all the President has to do is to work closely with one or other of the Republican leaders, the less probable the better. The White House should endorse his ideas and back his legislative programme. Once this potential candidate has gained widespread fame and popularity, once his ambition has been inflamed by presidential favour, the President himself will only have to step back a little and watch his opponents smash the movement inherited from Abe Lincoln. The dramatic idiocies which characterised the rigged acclaim for Chirac last weekend could not quite be replicated in a US primary, but it should not be too difficult to inject intra-Republican relationships with the lethal venom that has almost destroyed the RPR. It is all too easy to achieve a gigantic political sea-change in the US. In the mid-term vote, 38 per cent of the electorate turned out. Of those who did only one in eight, or 4.6 per cent of the total eligible, voted Republican because they supported of the party's programme. The French majority is based on support that runs rather higher than 4.6 per cent. Yet it can be wrecked by its own internecine hatreds and a wag of the tail of a lame duck president.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to find out more about how baby walker injuries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are occurring, the Commission's staff is identifying a sample of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 300&hyph;400 cases through NEISS for the period beginning August 15,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, with data collection to continue through September 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These cases are being followed up by telephone to obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information about the incident. In addition, incidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving falls down stairs or steps, and other incidents where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more detail is needed, are being assigned for on-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigations. The data collected through February 1994 have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been analyzed and are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the baby walker incidents reported through NEISS between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 15, 1993, and February 1994, 79 percent were falls down  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stairs or between levels. About half of the stair fall incidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved a fall down basement stairs. About 3 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidents were due to walker tipovers, 3 percent to burns, and 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent to other hazard patterns (for instance, babies hitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their heads on walker trays, climbing on walkers, etc.). In about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 percent of all baby walker incidents, another child appeared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be directly involved in causing the accident. In stair fall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidents, approximately 5 percent involved other children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ages of the children injured ranged from 4 months to 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, with a median age of 8 months. About 95 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> victims were 15 months of age or younger.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Severity of injury. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The majority of children involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baby walker incidents (75 percent) received injuries classified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as ``less severe,'' even though the head and face were often the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injured body parts. Less severe injuries include lacerations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contusions, abrasions, hematomas, dental injuries, punctures, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strains or sprains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> About one-fourth of the children (23 percent) received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries classified as potentially ``more severe,'' such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concussions, burns, fractures, and internal organ injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Incidents that resulted in severe injuries occurred even when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parents were in the same room or area as the child in the walker.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of potentially severe injuries were head injuries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from children in walkers falling down a flight of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basement stairs onto either a covered or uncovered cement floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remaining potentially severe injuries were burns and limb  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fractures. The injuries were of varying severity, ranging from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children who were treated and released to injuries that resulted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in hospitalizations up to 7 days. At the time of the telephone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigations, all of the 128 parents contacted through February  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994 reported that the children had ``fully recovered.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1991, the proportion of ``more severe'' to ``less severe''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries related to walkers was similar to that of cribs, high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chairs, playpens, and changing tables. There was a significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher proportion of ``more severe'' injuries related to baby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walkers than to strollers and carriages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During 1991, 7 percent of the children involved in walker-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related incidents were hospitalized for observation or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensive treatment. There were no significant differences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the proportions of hospitalizations to non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitalizations for baby walkers and cribs, high chairs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> playpens, and changing tables. There was a significantly higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportion of hospitalizations related to baby walkers than for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strollers and carriages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The mechanism of general stair-related injuries differs in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some respects from the mechanism of stair-related injuries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving baby walkers. Falls down stairs without walkers involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a series of impacts; an initial mild to severe impact, followed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a series of mild impacts (tumbling). The bouncing of a walker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> down steps, however, may result in an initial backward thrust of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the head as the walker descends down the steps followed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forward head thrust. One author suggests that ``[s]uch a sequence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could add additional impact energy and thus more severe injury.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (DiMario F: Chronic Subdural Hematoma_Another Babywalker-Stairs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Related Injury. Clinical Pediatrics 1990; 29:405&hyph;8.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E. Other Factors Related to Baby Walker Incidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Step falls and doorway width. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For the stair or step fall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidents, 82 percent of the respondents who agreed to take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements reported the width of the narrowest dimension of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opening at the top of the stairs or step as 36 inches or less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (approximately the size of a normal door opening).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Supervision of the Child and Precautions Taken. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  At the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the incident, about half of the caregivers were in the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> room or area as the child in the walker. For those caregivers who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were in the same room or area with the child when the incident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> happened, 43 percent reported that they witnessed the incident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some parents who did not witness the incident said they had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> looked away momentarily or were distracted by another child when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the incident occurred. In some incidents where the caregivers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were in another room or area than the child in the walker at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time of the incident, the child was in the caregiver's view.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over half of the respondents (61 percent) for the stair and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> step fall incidents reported a closed door, gate, or some other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barrier in use prior to, or around, the time of walker use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (doors-78 percent, gates-16 percent, other barriers-6 percent.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 90 percent of the stair and step fall incidents where a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barrier was in use, the door, gate, or other barrier had been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moved, left ajar, or not latched properly. Seven percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondents for these incidents who reported a gate in use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the gate may have failed; this was reported solely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as ``the walker pushed the gate open.'' Other stair and step fall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidents included cases where children bypassed a barrier or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety precaution or moved too quickly for a nearby adult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the incident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ten percent of the respondents reported a baby walker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incident prior to the incident in the study. Three percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported a previous stair fall incident. Seventy-six percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the respondents reported using the walker again after an injury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred, including over half of those whose child was diagnosed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as having a potentially serious injury. For the stair fall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidents where the walker was still available, 57 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondents who agreed to look for labeling information reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a label with a stair warning.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

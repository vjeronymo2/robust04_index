			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Clarke catches gilts market on the hop - Capital &amp; Credit The decision by the UK chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, to raise base rates on Monday by half a point to 5.75 per cent caught many on the hop. The short sterling futures market had already discounted an interest rate rise but dealers were wrong-footed when it came the week after Mr Clarke's meeting with Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. The rise - the first for almost five years - has fuelled the concern about the pace of future interest rate increases and their impact on gilts. A central plank of the gilts market's performance is likely to be the credibility of the government's anti-inflation policy, which took a dent soon after the base rate increase. When base rates rose on Monday morning, gilts responded positively, rising almost a point at the long end, causing the yield spread against German bunds to tighten. The market's enthusiasm was due to the belief - fuelled by Mr Clarke's statements at the time - that he was moving ahead of events, rather than simply responding to inflation already seen in the economy. One analyst said on the day: 'It is the first time in more than 20 years that I have seen the government acting ahead of a crisis - it has taken the long view. I have never seen it before.' However, the market was soon to change its mind. Two days later the long end of the market fell by more than a point on the news that Mr Clarke already had a rough idea of the Retail Price Index figures when he increased base rates on Monday. The figures - not published until Wednesday morning - showed a higher than expected rise of 2.4 per cent in the year to August. Confidence in the government's pre-emptive anti-inflationary stance took a knock: some traders felt Mr Clarke may have been continuing the long tradition of UK chancellors of reacting to rising inflation too late. Gilts, also wounded by the RPI data, fell more than a point on the day, under-performing the bund market. However, some analysts felt this was an over-reaction: Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi, said: 'Really there is no significant inflation problem, so the increase is still pre-emptive.' This debate over inflationary pressures has led economists to divide into two broad camps: those who think that one-year interest rates of 7 per cent accurately predict base rates in a year's time, and those who feel the economy might become strong enough to force the chancellor to take rates higher to squeeze inflation. Publication of the minutes of the monthly meeting between Mr Clarke and Eddie George makes the process more transparent, pointed out Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets. He is among those who expect to see base rates at around 7 per cent by the end of next year, and inflation at about 3 1/2 per cent. He added: 'As long as the Bank of England is seen to be ahead of events, the gilts market will be reassured, and base rates will not be a negative influence.' However, the December sterling futures contract is already discounting a base rate of around 6.75 per cent - a full percentage point more than the current rate. Mr Thomas dismissed this: 'Short sterling does get a bit carried away.' The forecast of 7 per cent base rates by the end of next year is shared by Mr Richardson of Yamaichi. 'We believe we are entering a 1960s-style inflation era, and we will have 1960s-style interest rates.' He thinks the 10-year gilt yields will fall from around 9 per cent to less than 8 per cent next year: 'We believe inflation has been licked as a long-term problem.' However, Mr Kevin Gardner at Morgan Stanley believes strength in the economy may lead the chancellor to take base rates up to 10 per cent in 1996. The view that gilts may suffer badly from rises in base rates is one held by Mr Chris Dillow, at Nomura Research Institute. He said last week's base rates rise will make no difference to demand in the short-term and 'this means there will be a lot more interest rate rises in the pipeline'. He said: 'The lesson of history is that interest rates rise more than you expect.' Mr Dillow declined to predict where bases rates are going, but simply insisted: 'They will rise further and faster than expected. The idea that you put up short rates and the bond market likes it is pretty mythical. Gilts won't like base rates going up. My advice is to sell them now.'</p>

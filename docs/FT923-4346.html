			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: 'Good for Britain and good for Europe' Following are highlights from Mr John Major's speech to the UK presidency conference. TWO weeks from now we will know the result of the French referendum on Maastricht. It is a pivotal event. . .The Danish referendum has already narrowly said No to the treaty. The combination of that and of a French 'Non' would be decisive. Without the consent of all 12 member states, the Maastricht Treaty cannot proceed. It would be dead. Even if, as I hope, the French vote Yes, the Danish difficulties must still be overcome. And then, across Europe, national parliaments must approve the treaty. In the United Kingdom it may have a bruising passage since - uniquely in the Community - we in Britain will scrutinise the bill line by line, clause by clause and vote on it in the same way. I believe myself that this is a more effective scrutiny than referenda where many votes may be cast on matters wholly unrelated to the treaty. In Britain we do not face a referendum and, given our parliamentary procedure, I have no hesitation in rejecting the concept. The Maastricht Treaty is a product of compromises by 12 nations. A hard-fought outcome. No one member state regarded it as ideal. But we all regarded it as the right outcome for the development of Europe. . . Overall, the treaty is good for Britain and good for Europe. However, important as Maastricht is, we should not let this particular strand of European development blind us to the other issues before us. Maastricht deserves approval but it is by no means the whole agenda. It is but part of a bigger agenda. We have also to: Complete the single market by the end of the year; Strengthen political co-operation, for example, over Yugoslavia; Complete difficult negotiations over future financing; Seek a successful Gatt outcome; Show that justice/home affairs co-operation is alive and well; Strengthen links with eastern and central Europe; Prepare for enlargement. Efta first, then eastern Europe. What lies at the heart of the Community is one very simple idea. . . by binding together the nations of Europe in a common economic framework, it would be possible to build an inextricable network of shared interests that would render war between former enemies impossible. The idea has worked. The Community has been the answer to the destructive side of nationalism in western Europe. . . But there are concerns about how it develops that European governments must address. Many European citizens fear for national self-identity. Will it be lost? Will their domestic interests be subordinated? Will they forever face frustrating restrictions? You could sense that debate in Denmark. It is alive in France. It is an everyday currency in the German Lander. It flourishes in the UK. . . The Community must show that these fears are phantoms. To do so it must recognise and build on national identity and national pride, not appear to ride roughshod over them. For the reality is that no nation's identity will ever be lost. Whatever happens in the Community, the French will be no less French, the Germans no less German, the Danes no less Danish and the British no less British. . . At the core of the Treaty of Rome lies the notion of democratic consent. Its opening words are these: 'Determined to lay the foundations of an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe'. Not ever closer union among governments or bureaucracies but among people. Not federation but conciliation and consent. For many countries in the Community, the idea of a common defence lies at the heart of political union. There is a tension between those member states who believe that we must make progress towards a common defence between the countries of the European Community and those, like Britain, who believe that we have a common defence of Europe and that that common defence is called Nato. Maastricht does not resolve the argument for all time. It does, however, preserve the benefits of what we already have. It maintains the primacy of Nato while building up the European role within Nato. . . What has happened in the former Yugoslavia illustrates both the strength of nationalism and the need to harness it. Not repress it. But channel it. None of us can foresee accurately the world in which we will be living in 20 years' time. But what we can see now is that the American presence on our continent is essential, both for our defence and for European stability. The Maastricht Treaty enshrines two very important ideas. The first is that the Community should only do those things which cannot be better done at the level of member states. That implies scrapping some existing, overbearing legislation, as well as avoiding new, unnecessary regulation. The second is that we can act together in unison without necessarily acting within the framework of Community law. This is a revolutionary change. In foreign policy and in matters of interior affairs and justice we shall work together as 12 within a treaty framework, but that framework will be distinct from the Treaty of Rome. In this respect the Maastricht Treaty showed a mature Community coming of age. It can develop outside the Treaty of Rome as current events are showing. Indeed, it must if the Community is to develop collectively. We need not be confined into centralism. It is the key to progress. The lesson of Maastricht is that we do need to work together, but we do not on every issue need Community law to make us work together. In other words, the very centralising tendency that many are so worried about was addressed and corrected at Maastricht. Maastricht is not the complete answer, but it is the first vitally important step in a new direction. So what would be the position if the Maastricht Treaty was not ratified by all the member states and could not be implemented? Would all those gains be lost? The fact is that you could not set aside the results of a hard-fought negotiation and expect to keep all the gains. I believe that what we won at Maastricht is worth preserving. If the Maastricht Treaty is not ratified, the arguments within the Community will not go away. They will have to be gone through again. Up to now we have decided on our pattern of development and growth from within. For nearly 50 years the shape of our continent was frozen under communism. But, now, even if it wanted to, the EC could not ignore the rest of Europe. It does not want to. All of us have decided it is essential to embrace the democracies to the east. To the countries of eastern Europe the Community has been a source of hope and inspiration through decades of Communist tyranny. Now they are free and the Community must underpin both their economic development and their democratic stability. So, over the next 10 years, what happens outside the present borders of the European Community will be as important to our development as what happens inside the existing Community. The Community will be joined by countries who have rediscovered their nationhood. As I intimated earlier, no treaty is ever perfect: they are all the outcome of a hard negotiation and therefore a compromise. That is true of Maastricht. But if Maastricht did not enter into force, the alternative would not be the status quo ante. The real issues which affect the Community  -our economic development, enlargement, our response to international events and crisis - all require a response. To be effective that needs to be a response agreed among all of the member states. Maastricht gives us the means of doing just that.</p>

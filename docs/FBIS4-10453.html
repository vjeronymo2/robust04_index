			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Regina Terraz] </F>   [Text] The faction led by PT [Workers Party] presidential  candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva emerged as the winner in the  10th Sao Paulo State meeting that concluded yesterday in the  city of Sao Paulo. Lula's Coordination/Unity  [Articulacao/Unidade] faction obtained the largest number of  votes among the Sao Paulo delegates, and managed to make its  proposals prevail in the PT platform. Deputy Jose Dirceu, PT  candidate for governor of Sao Paulo State, said: "The meeting  showed that Lula's majority has prevailed." He added: "It is  not true that Lula does not have the support of the majority  within the PT." The vote outcome was, however, close.    The victory of Lula's faction over Time for Truth [Hora da  Verdade], a more radical group, signifies that Lula's government  plan will be more moderate. The PT decisions in Sao Paulo  State, the stronghold of the party, will weigh heavily in the  drafting of the final document, which is to be approved at a  national PT meeting to be held from 29 April to 1 May.    For instance, on the subject of the foreign debt -- one of  the most controversial topics in the PT program -- the Sao Paulo  members decided to reject the proposal to immediately suspend  payments and to support the PT executive board's original  proposal, which is less radical on this point.    In the final document, the suspension of foreign debt  payments may appear as a measure that could be adopted by the  government after a detailed analysis of the debt. The PT  proposal may also endorse open debt negotiations.    On the subject of privatization, Sao Paulo will also support  the original document, which proposes the suspension of the  privatization process and an assessment of those companies that  have been privatized thus far. The PT delegates declined to  support the idea of bringing back to the government fold those  companies that had already been privatized.    In the opinion of Jose Dirceu, who attended the meeting, the  main PT adversary in the 3 October elections will be the  Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB). Dirceu said: "It will  be Lula against Fernando Henrique Cardoso; and Jose Dirceu  against Mario Covas in Sao Paulo." He noted that the opposition  by Covas -- PSDB candidate for the Sao Paulo gubernatorial seat  -- to the PSDB alliance with the Liberal Front Party [PFL] "is  just a publicity stunt." He added: "In Sao Paulo, Covas is  promoting an alliance with the Liberal Party and with the  Brazilian Labor Party. Hence, he could not possibly claim that  he is against the PSDB-PFL alliance." He said: "What the PSDB  members want is to seize power; they do not care with whom."</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE WAR IS ON BETWEEN GRADCO, PLENUM  </P> <P> Gradco Systems Inc. and Plenum Publishing Corp. traded salvos Thursday as both  companies sent out letters to shareholders criticizing the other's ability to  turn around the struggling manufacturer of sorters for copiers and computer  printer products.  </P> <P> Keith B. Stewart, chairman and chief executive of Irvine-based Gradco, said in  a shareholder letter that Plenum's chairman, Martin E. Tash, and his slate of  proposed board members have no experience in Gradco's primary businesses. He  said Tash is a disgruntled shareholder who made an "unprofitable speculative"  short-term investment in Gradco.  </P> <P> Stewart has proposed to spin off the money-losing Gradco Printer Systems  subsidiary, which makes computer printer products, into a separately traded and  managed company as well as launch a public offering in Japan for the company's  sorter products subsidiary.  </P> <P> "Do not risk control of your company and the future of your investment to a  slate with no apparent knowledge of Gradco's businesses," Stewart said.  </P> <P> Tash said in his letter that Gradco management is fighting an expensive  campaign against Plenum with Gradco's money. He said that Gradco management is  not working to maximize shareholder value and that its spinoff plan should not  be a factor in the proxy fight.  </P> <P> Stewart has made little investment in his own company, and a number of  executives have sold their stock, reflecting a lack of confidence in the  company, Tash said. "Mr. Stewart is simply a hired hand, not a shareholder," he  said.  </P> <P> The statements were the strongest efforts yet by both sides to win the votes of  shareholders since New York-based Plenum, a small publisher of scientific  journals that controls 9.6% of Gradco stock, launched a battle to take control  of Gradco's board a month ago.  </P> <P> Tash has filed a shareholder suit accusing Stewart and certain Gradco  executives of misappropriating corporate assets by  </P> <P> awarding themselves warrants to buy shares in the Gradco Japan subsidiary at a  discount price that could net them a windfall of more than $12 million.  </P> <P> Gradco said in its letter that management believes that the $26.5-million  investment by Japanese investors in Gradco Japan would not have transpired  without an investment by Gradco management in the subsidiary as represented by  the warrant transaction. The shares granted to management were restricted and  therefore were offered to management at a discount, the letter said.  </P> <P> Gradco also disclosed that its debt of $25.1 million at the end of March was at  risk of being called due because of its failure to meet financial covenants.  Management tried to sell the company, but it decided that buyers would not  offer a fair price because the company had lost its largest customer, Xerox  Corp., which accounted for $21 million in revenue.  </P></p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Arts Council grants not biased against regions Your architecture correspondent caricatures the work of our architecture unit and misleads your readers with a prejudiced account of its grants ('Council misses the point', September 13). There is no London bias and no bloated bureaucracy. Thirty-four out of 36 recent awards will benefit the public in the English regions; as to 'offices, personnel and the inbreeding of arts bureaucrats', your critic may be reassured, since the architecture unit consists of just two persons. (Our distinguished advisory group gives its services free of charge.) Your correspondent takes us to task for our apparent disdain of history, but a glance at our grants shows this to be untrue. A modest grant of Pounds 1,000 to the Georgian Group, for example, will help it create a touring exhibition looking at the design of today's cities and their Georgian predecessors. With our valuable sponsors, English Estates, we see the benefits of encouraging the public to take an educated interest in the art of architecture in the context of large-scale building developments. That is why we have jointly supported proposals to create an architecture centre in the east Thames corridor and in eight other regions of England. All of these things your correspondent might have discovered for himself had he bothered to inquire. Anthony Everitt, secretary-general, The Arts Council of Great Britain, 14 Great Peter Street, London SW1P 3NQ</p>

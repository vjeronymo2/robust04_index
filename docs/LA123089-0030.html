			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DIGGERS, PLANTERS  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen:  </P> <P> * Bare-root planting season is here. Look for bare-root roses, fruit and shade  trees, asparagus, artichokes, grape vines and berries such as raspberries,  blackberries and strawberries.  </P> <P> * Fruit trees will appreciate pruning now; however, don't prune  spring-flowering trees or shrubs until they finish blooming.  </P> <P> * Continue feeding your annuals and pinching off their faded blooms so they  will keep flowering in the coming months.  </P> <P> * Don't neglect your garden just because it's winter -- a winter garden can be  filled with color from camellias, primroses, pansies, violas, snapdragons and  more.  </P></p>

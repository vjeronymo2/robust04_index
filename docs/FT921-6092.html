			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists in Pounds 91m agreed bid for Macarthy LLOYDS Chemists, the retailer which is number two to Boots in the UK market, yesterday made an agreed Pounds 91m offer for Macarthy, owner of the Savory &amp; Moore chain and originally the subject of three rival bids. If Lloyds' bid goes through - and UniChem, the drugs wholesaler, had not yet ruled itself out of contention - it will end more than nine months of uncertainty for Macarthy. Lloyds took less than two days to win over the Macarthy board after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on Wednesday cleared the way for both it and UniChem to bid again. Macarthy was first, but unsuccessfully, wooed by Grampian Holdings, the Scottish mini-conglomerate, which put in a bid on May 22 last year when the target's share price stood at 168p. Lloyds joined the fray in August with a bid of one new share plus 21p cash for each Macarthy share, which lapsed on the MMC referral. The new bid is either a 1-for-1 share offer, valued at 327p a share last night, or 305p a share in cash. The latter is 22 times Macarthy's 1990-91 earnings per share of 13.8p. Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief executive, said that after the MMC-imposed delay it had proved much easier to get underwriting for a cash offer. Last August 'the biggest criticism of our bid was that it came too soon after the previous rights issue'. Less than four months earlier it had raised Pounds 71m in a 1-for-2 issue to pay Pounds 55m for the Kingswood chemists' and the Holland &amp; Barrett health stores. The acquisition of Macarthy would involve the company in issuing up to 29.5m new shares, compared with the present total of 86.5m. Mr Dick Steele, finance director, said that the pro forma balance sheet for the enlarged group would show gearing of roughly 60 per cent on net assets of Pounds 80m. At the June year-end, Lloyds had Pounds 5m cash but acquisition-related spending totalled nearly Pounds 20m since then - including Pounds 8m on a 9.9 per cent stake in Macarthy. The target's net debt stood at nearly Pounds 15m in September, when its net assets were Pounds 25.1m. Since then outgoings included Pounds 3.1m in capital spending and Pounds 1.4m dividends. Acquisition costs would include Pounds 800,000 in severance payments to Macarthy's directors plus office closure and redundancy bills. After the acquisition, Lloyds would have 1,280 stores (chemists', drugstores and health stores) compared with 1,079 now. Macarthy adds 172 chemists' and 29 health stores. In the year to June 30, Lloyds increased its pre-tax profit by 53 per cent to Pounds 20.8m on sales of Pounds 258m; earnings per share went up 21 per cent to 20.96p. Macarthy made Pounds 5.31m pre-tax on sales of Pounds 205.8m in the year to September. Lloyds' offer has been irrevocably accepted by Govett Strategic Investment Trust, which owns 16.8 per cent of the shares, giving the bidder a total of 26.7 per cent so far. See Lex</p>

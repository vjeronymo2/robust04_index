			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Better third quarter for Holmes HOLMES PROTECTION, the US security group which is quoted in the UK, got back on its recovery track in the third quarter, reporting a pre-tax profit of Dollars 239,000 (Pounds 158,000) for the nine months to end-September. Though well below the Dollars 4.76m achieved in the corresponding period last year, when profits were boosted by exceptional items totalling Dollars 2.99m, the outcome at the period end represents an encouraging advance on the pre-tax profit of Dollars 133,000 reported at the half-way stage. Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman, said the company's performance in the third quarter, while still below expectations, showed an improvement over the second quarter, and reflected the initial steps taken to reduce expenses. Turnover for the nine months slipped from Dollars 42.1m to Dollars 40.4m. Earnings came out at 0.2 cents (48.5 cents). The company has negotiated an expanded credit facility with its bankers in the form of a Dollars 9m five-year term loan and a Dollars 3m revolving loan. The facilities will be used to replace existing short-term borrowings of Dollars 6m, to finance acquisitions, and provide working capital. Since the period-end, Holmes had reached agreement for the acquisition of two subscriber monitoring contracts and certain related assets providing some Dollars 1.6m of annual recurring revenue. The consideration - subject to the performance of the assets - is Dollars 3.75m net of costs. This sum has been drawn from the new credit facility.</p>

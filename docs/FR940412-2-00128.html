			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Process Evaluation: Process evaluation is both a quantitative and qualitative description of a project. It documents the evolution of the project from inception through implementation and completion. The process evaluation documents what was actually done, what was learned, what barriers inhibited implementation, how such barriers were resolved, and what should be done differently in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future projects. In short, process evaluation allows for successful projects to be replicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of this grant, program process evaluation should:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Document and describe the processes by which the coalition is expanded, refocused, implemented and operated; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Identify factors associated with effective planning and implementation of the prevention strategies for the community or geographic area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comparison Community or Area: Use of comparison communities or geographic areas which closely resemble the community or area served by the coalition is an excellent way to provide a rigorous test of the effectiveness of the interventions to be implemented under this announcement. CSAP realizes that finding suitable comparison communities may be difficult because of the increasing popularity of the partnership movement, and considerable effort may be needed to identify a similar community willing to participate in the full evaluation process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comparison and target communities/areas should be as similar as possible at baseline, because the greater the similarity between the target and comparison communities/areas, the greater the likelihood of detecting and explaining effects of the coalition prevention program on the target community/area. The comparison communities/areas should not have a prevention program similar to the one intended for the target community/area. The target and comparison communities/areas should be geographically distant enough to prevent the transmission of program activities from the target to the comparison communities/areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSAP realizes the difficulties applicants may have in identifying comparison communities or areas. CSAP is also aware of the limitations of this approach given the variation and potential for contamination of prevention programs across communities, regions or States. Despite these limitations, applicants are encouraged to use this approach. However, applicants will not be adversely affected by using a different evaluation approach that will yield scientifically credible data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participation in National Cross-Site Evaluation: A National cross-site evaluation project will be conducted with the goals of identifying: (1) Successful and innovative community-based Coalition models; (2) effective strategies for the prevention of substance abuse, related health and safety problems and risk factors; (3) common inhibitors to forming effective Coalitions: (4) common inhibitors to design and implementation of effective prevention strategies; (5) Coalition models that effectively prepare the service infrastructure of communities for the eventual implementation of Health Care Reform; and (6) Coalition models and prevention strategies that produce the most benefits for the lowest monetary costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects funded under this announcement will be required to participate in the National cross-site evaluation, by contributing data that are comparable across projects. A detailed description of the National Cross-site Evaluation Plan will be communicated to the funded projects at the beginning of the grant program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although participation in the National Evaluation project is mandatory, grantees will not have to expend grant funds for activities that are not already within the local-level evaluation plans. Selected grantees will be technically and financially supported by the National Cross-site Evaluation project for activities that are not within the purview of their local-level projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coordination with Other Federal/Non-Federal Programs: Applicants seeking support under this announcement are encouraged to coordinate with other Federal, State, and local public and private programs serving their target population. Program coordination helps to better serve the multiple needs of the client population, to maximize the impact of available resources, and to prevent duplication of services. Funding priority will be given to applicants who demonstrate a coordinated approach to providing comprehensive substance abuse prevention services (see Award Criteria).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Single State Agency Coordination: Coordination and collaboration with the Single State Agency (SSA) for alcohol and other drug abuse is encouraged to ensure communication, reduce duplication, and facilitate continuity. The application must include a copy of a letter sent to the SSA that briefly describes the proposed project. A copy of this letter should be included in Appendix B to the application entitled ``Letters to/from SSAs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A list of SSAs can be found in the grant application kit. If the target population falls within the jurisdiction of more than one State, all representative SSAs should be involved. Evidence of support for the proposed project from the SSA and from the State Public Health Agency will be considered in making funding decisions (See ``Award Decision Criteria'' section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Intergovernmental Review (E.O. 12372): Applications submitted in response to this announcement are subject to the intergovernmental review requirements of Executive Order 12372, as implemented through DHHS regulations at 45 CFR Part 100. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of applications for Federal financial assistance. Applicants (other than Federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact the State's Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective application and to receive any necessary instructions on the State's review process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. A current listing of SPOCs is included in the application kit. The SPOC should send any State process recommendations to the following address at CSAP ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the address to which the application was mailed):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Review, Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Rockwall II Building, Suite 630, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, Attn: SPOC/CPCD Grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The due date for the State review process recommendations is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> no later than 60 days <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  after the deadline date for the receipt of applications. CSAP does not guarantee to accommodate or explain SPOC comments that are received after the 60-day cutoff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

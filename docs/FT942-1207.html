			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Businesses urged to help finance new royal yacht: Car parks tycoon seeks 'pound for pound' funding Sir Donald Gosling, joint chairman of National Car Parks, yesterday called on the government and industrialists to join him in building a vessel to replace the royal yacht Britannia by the year 2000. The Ministry of Defence, which announced this week that Britannia would be decommissioned in 1997, said Sir Donald's proposal was likely to be the first of many. Sir Donald said he hoped the government would match the private sector 'pound for pound' in building a showpiece vessel for about Pounds 60m. He said that in addition to transporting the royal family and promoting British trade - Britannia's current roles - the ship could be used for adventure training for young people. The ship could be leased to the Royal Navy, which would make it available both to the royal family and the companies which helped to fund it, he said. 'Industries and individuals could take debentures on the ship. The ship is not intended to make a profit, although it might pay some interest to debenture holders.' Sir Donald said he was approached about the idea of building a new royal yacht by a parliamentary maritime group, and he understood it was in touch with other industrialists as well. A defence ministry official said millions of pounds worth of export business, including weapons sales, had been sealed with the help of Britannia. He said: 'The moment people step on board, they can't help being impressed by the high standards of naval engineering.' A glance at the list of organisers of recent events on board Britannia suggests that the yacht has attracted the 'great and the good' of business rather than medium-size and small companies. This week's conference in Helsinki was chaired by Sir Michael Palliser, vice-chairman of Samuel Montagu and former head of the diplomatic ser-vice. In Bombay last November British Invisibles hosted a seminar with opening remarks by Sir Nicholas Fenn, the British high commissioner, and contributions by Sir Hugh Bidwell, former lord mayor of London, and Mr Andrew Buxton, chairman of Barclays Bank. In New York Mr Tony Tucker, director of public affairs for the Scottish Whisky Association, helped organise a reception for 120 congressmen, journalists and other US glitterati. He said: 'Undoubtedly the opportunity to use Britannia was most welcome. It added that extra dimension of royal lustre which would just not have been available in a hotel. The Americans were intrigued and very interested so they came along.' In cost terms, Mr Tucker described Britannia as a 'very good deal' - neither 'wildly expensive nor cheap' but worth it as a promotional tool. There was no 'room hire' charge and no mark-up on food and wine as is customary in hotels.</p>

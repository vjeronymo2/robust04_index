			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nissan introduced the Altima, an all-new FWD midsize sedan replacing the Stanza. It has a 150-hp 2.4L DOHC 4-cylinder engine coupled with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Saab, a GM subsidiary, expanded its 9000 model line by introducing the 9000CS 4-door hatchback and the 9000 aerodynamic hatchback. The 9000CS was powered by a naturally-aspirated 150 hp 2.3L I&hyph;4 or optional turbocharged 200 hp engine. The 4-speed automatic and the 5-speed manual each improved by 1 mpg over the MY 1992 model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subaru introduced the all-new Impreza, which comes in a choice of 4-door sedan and wagon models. The Impreza replaces the 8-year-old Subaru Loyale compact, although the Loyale station wagon will remain in the line. The Impreza is based on a shortened Legacy platform. The United States models are powered by a 1.8L, 110 hp 4-cylinder engine, essentially a smaller version of the 2.2L engine in the Legacy, and sharing its horizontally opposed arrangement. The fuel economy has improved by one tenth of a mile per gallon over the Loyale with automatic transmission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota restyled the Corolla and moved it from the sub-compact to compact EPA classification. The Corolla has a new 115 hp 1.8L 16 valve DOHC 4-cylinder engine and a 5-speed manual transmission. The average Corolla fuel economy improved by 1 mpg for MY 1993 over MY 1992. The Toyota Lexus division introduced the all-new GS300 with a 220 hp 3.0L 24-valve DOHC I&hyph;6 engine and an average fuel economy of 20.5 mpg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volvo introduced the 850GLT, the new front-wheel drive (FWD), sport sedan, powered by a transversely mounted 20-value 168 hp in-line 5-cylinder engine coupled with an all-new 5-speed manual or optional 4-speed automatic transmission designed to take up less space.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> II. Light Trucks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Domestic.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chrysler's Ram passenger van/wagon was restyled in the front and received a redesigned 5.2L engine, along with an increase in horsepower to 230 from 190, improving the average fuel economy on the 4-speed automatic transmission by 1 mpg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford introduced a new redesigned Ranger compact pickup for MY 1993. The Ranger offers a 3.0L V&hyph;6 engine replacing the previously standard 2.9L engine. The average fuel economy with the 4-speed automatic transmission improved by 0.1 mpg, and with the 5-speed manual transmission it improved by 0.5 mpg. The Villager FWD minivan was designed and engineered by Nissan Motor Company and produced at the Ford Avon Lake, Ohio, assembly plant for both Mercury and Nissan. It is the first minivan offered by the Lincoln-Mercury Division. The Villager is powered by a 150-hp 3L SOHC V&hyph;6 engine with sequential electronic fuel injection and a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Nissan version of the minivan is called the Quest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Imports.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Toyota introduced the all-new T-100 full-sized pickup truck for MY 1993. The all-wheel drive T-100 comes equipped with a 3.0L SOHC V&hyph;6 engine producing 150 hp mated to a 5-speed manual transmission with an average fuel economy of nearly 17 mpg. Compared to the Big 3 (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) pickups with 6-cylinder engines, Toyota's 6-cylinder has better fuel economy than any of the Big 3. GM is its closest competitor, being only one tenth of a mile per gallon behind.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volkswagen, some 43 years after inventing the passenger van, introduced in the United States its first front-drive van, the Eurovan. The Eurovan has a box shape, as well as an optional ``pop top'' camper version. The Eurovan is powered by a new in-line, transverse-mounted, 2.5L five-cylinder engine. The 109-hp engine provides 21 percent more power and 20 percent more torque than its predecessor. The new design improved the vehicle's aerodynamics, providing a drag coefficient of 0.37. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

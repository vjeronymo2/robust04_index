Rabrenovic: "24 Firms Closed Down in </F> Kosovksa Mitrovica"]    [Excerpt] The republic market inspectorate closed down 24  private stores in Kosovska Mitrovica [Kosovo] for violating the  regulations of the new economic program. According to Stojan  Zdravkovic, chief republic market inspector, the official  exchange rate prescribed by the National Bank of Yugoslavia was  not respected.    "The new dinar was worth much less there than the German  mark, so the products were mostly purchased with foreign  currency because the prices set in new dinars were much less  favorable. Because of this great difference and the disregard of  the established parity, we were forced to close down these  stores," Zdravkovic explained.    The disrespect of the measures of the new economic program,  according to Zdravkovic, has been most pronounced in Kosovo and  Metohija thus far. In the remaining parts of the republic,  private and especially state enterprises have been accepting the  new conditions of business operations and adapting to the  measures dictated by the anti-inflation program.    The market inspectorate in Belgrade has also been operating  at full speed.    "Irregularities and disrespect of regulations have always  existed, and naturally they exist now too. However, almost  everyone has been respecting the prices prescribed and the new  exchange rate. Firms were closed down in recent days, but mostly  because the merchants did not have the proper accompanying  documents for certain goods," Miodrag Nikolic, chief city market  inspector said.

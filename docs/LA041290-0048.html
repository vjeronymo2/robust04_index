			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> BONDS PRICES MOVE OPPOSITE TO OIL  </P> <P> Bond prices rose in response to a temporary drop in oil prices and a rumor  about trouble at a major bank, traders said.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3/16 point, or about $1.88 for every  $1,000 in face amount.  </P> <P> Its yield, which declines when prices rise, fell to 8.57% from 8.59% late  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bond prices were hurt Tuesday when the sale of $3.5 billion worth of bonds by  the government's Resolution Funding Corp. did not go as well as expected. But  prices jumped shortly after the trading day began Wednesday on a rumor that a  major New York bank was having liquidity problems due to troubled real estate  loans.  </P> <P> If substantiated, that could spur interest in Treasury bonds as some investors  seek to move their money into a safer place.  </P> <P> Later in the day, bond prices also received a boost when oil futures prices  dropped. Lower energy prices can ease inflation, which is one of the prime  fears of investors in fixed-income securities such as bonds. But oil prices  later reversed, returning to the level at the start of the day, causing bond  prices to decline.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.125%, down from 8.1875% late Tuesday.  </P></p>

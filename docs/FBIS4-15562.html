			<p>BFN     [Text] The Hague April 11 ITAR-TASS -- The session of the  preparatory commission for the establishment of an international  organisation in charge of monitoring the ban on chemical weapons  heard a statement of the Russian delegate today. The statement  stresses that much work has been done since the convention on  chemical weapons was opened for signing more than a year ago.  The work mainly concentrated on working out and coordinating  mechanisms of implementing the convention.    However, according to the Russian view, much has yet to be  done to fulfil the mandate of the preparatory commission. Few  of the twenty-three tasks set for the commission by the Paris  resolution are close to completion, and nearly one half of the  total number have not yet been proper considered.    Moreover, the statement says, we are alarmed by the attempts  made from time to time in the course of the preparatory  commission's work to revise the essence of certain clauses, as  well as to enforce interpretations of the text, which was taken  for granted at the moment of signing. In particular, this  concerns the correlation of the national constitutional norms  and the granting of access to chemical installations to  inspectors at their request, the uncertainties in the  understanding of the key definitions, such as "chemical weapons"  and "a facility producing chemical weapons." In addition,  Russia, which will have to bear the cost of eliminating and  controlling its own stocks of chemical weapons, cannot agree to  some of the proposals concerning the distribution of costs among  all member-stations.    When signing the text of the convention on January 13, 1933  in Paris, Russia which has a stock of chemical weapons with the  total weight of the toxic substances totalling 40,k000 tonnes,  was well aware of the scale of the obligations it assumed.  However, proceeding from an understanding that the convention  is a major step towards global disarmament and the strengthening  of international security, and reflects a compromise reached as  a result of difficult many-year negotiations, Russia was among  the first to sign this international agreement. When signing  the convention, Russia stressed that the realisation of the  obligations under the convention will be contiguous with a  number of economic difficulties. This implied the lessening of  Russia's spending on international supervision and verification  and elaboration of economically-acceptable procedures of  conversion of the former facilities producing chemical weapons  to peaceful uses. Russia counted on the possibility of a  favourable solution of these problems.    During the parliamentary hearings about the participation of  the Russian Federation in international agreements on the  elimination of chemical weapons, some committees of the State  Duma noted the need for the final clarification of the situation  concerning the cost of the realisation of the convention.  Questions about Russia's spending, as well as about the vague  idea about the final text of the convention and the uniform  interpretation of its key terms, the amount of basic obligations  which determine the scope of the convention will inevitably  arise when the document is submitted for ratification by the  Russian Parliament and will in fact predetermine the result of  its consideration. Unfortunately, in the past year, the  preparatory commission has failed to examine the procedure of  payments for the verification activity and the conversion of  chemical weapon plants to peaceful production, and no decisions  on these matters have been made up to date.    Russia draws everyone's attention to the fact that the  enforcement of the convention on chemical weapons in 1995 will  be hampered by the failure to solve the above problems as soon  as possible. This is necessary to allow the states that signed  the convention to obtain a full idea about all aspects of  implementing the convention at the stage of its ratification,  the statement said.</p>

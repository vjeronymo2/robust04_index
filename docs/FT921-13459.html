			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / US Treasury ready to sell more bonds without notice THE US Treasury will sell more government securities without notice if it detects attempts by investors to corner the market in new issues. The plan for unscheduled sales of new government debt is part of a reform study drawn up by the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The study was drawn up in the wake of an investigation into attempts in 1990 and 1991 by Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers to rig the market for new Treasury securities. The reforms, which will be officially unveiled this week, are aimed at opening up the US bond auction system, which until the Salomon scandal broke last summer was effectively closed to all but a few big institutions and which escaped close scrutiny from regulatory authorities. The plan to stop 'squeezes' is the most radical part of the reform package, and represents a significant policy change. Squeezes occur when a few investors corner the market in a new issue and then force other investors who need the new securities to pay inflated prices. In the past the Treasury has refused to interfere with the workings of the bond market, but the seriousness of the Salomon squeeze last May (when the firm ended up controlling more than 90 per cent of a two-year note issue) and the need to prevent further manipulations prompted the reversal. The Treasury/Fed/SEC study recommends a complicated new system which allows bidders to view the progress of the auction and which ultimately distributes securities more evenly among bidders. Any changes to the auction process, however, will not be introduced until opinions in the market have been canvassed and the current automation of bidding procedures has been completed. Other reforms that the study will recommend include: Asking Congress to grant the authorities power to force firms to disclose large holdings of government securities, and to legislate tougher enforcement of auction rules Lessening the importance of primary dealers, and allowing other institutions direct access to the auction Improving the dissemination of market prices and data, and allowing the public to see the pre-auction information that is normally available only on brokers' screens A new system to verify large customer bids.</p>

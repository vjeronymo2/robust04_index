Redman, it has been learned, has not brought with him any  concrete proposals, and obviously means only to hear Belgrade's  position on the U.S. initiative for the creation of a  Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The question of  the Bosnian Serb side has been left open in that context.    An answer has, however, come from Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan  Karadzic, who has said that "only political illiterates can  expect the Serbs in Bosnia to accept a confederative model with  the Muslims and Croats," and who has underscored that only two  possibilities exist as far as the Bosnian Serbs are concerned --  "an independent Serb state in Bosnia or the unification of the  Bosnian Serbs with the other Serbs into a single state."    It is believed that Milosevic and Redman will exchange views  on the enhancement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina negotiating  process, which is to produce a comprehensive settlement  acceptable to all three warring sides in the former Yugoslav  republic.    According to unconfirmed reports, Redman will meet in  Belgrade also with Vice-President of the Bosnian Serb Republic  Nikola Koljevic.</p>

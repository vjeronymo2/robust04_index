			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Candidate for Smith seat picked Mrs Helen Liddell, former secretary of the Scottish Labour party, was last night chosen as candidate for the Monklands East by-election - the contest caused by the death of party leader John Smith. Mrs Liddell, 43, won on the first count at the constituency Labour party meeting in Airdrie. The final choice was made from a shortlist of three at a meeting where the selection was made by one-person-one-vote - the first time this procedure had been used in Scotland.</p>

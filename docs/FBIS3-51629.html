			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Roseau, Dominica, 19 Jan, CANA -- Dominica's Trade  Minister Charles Maynard said Wednesday that Latin American  countries may soon be served notice that Dominica has no  intention of playing "trade games".    Maynard's comments were made after news reached the region  that five Latin American banana-exporting countries had got a  panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to  rule that a European Union policy which gives preferential  treatment to Caribbean bananas, violates GATT rules.    Maynard, speaking to CANA, expressed surprise that Venezuela  which has been leading Latin American efforts to develop closer  ties with the English-speaking Caribbean, was among the five  countries.    The minister declined to name any Latin American country  with  which he was unhappy because of their fight for a bigger share  of the European banana market, but it was obvious from his  remarks that he was disappointed with Venezuela.    "We must be conscious of those who are playing games with  us," he said. "There're some countries that want to have trading  arrangements with us but at the same time when it comes to our  trade and our critical trade in bananas, they are on the side of  those who are jeopardising our interest."    Venezuela has extended to Caricom countries duty free access  to its market for an initial period of five years. Just days  ago, it was announced in Caracas, the venezuelan capital, that a  new shipping service would be launched by March to facilitate  trade between Venezuela and the English-speaking Caribbean.    "In the continuing effort ... to preserve what we have, to  sustain the levels of protection that we have achieved, we must  recognise and see where the blast is coming from and expose it,"  Maynard added.    "And we must let our friends know that we cannot seriously  consider a partnership in trade with them as an ongoing  arrangement, if at the same time at the international level,  they're jeopardising our major export in bananas."    Dominica and other Windward Island banana exporters contend  the European preferential arrangement is critical for the  survival of the key foreign exchanging earning industry. They  see the continuing Latin American challenge as an attempt to  hurt their economies.    Reports by GATT panels have no legal weight until they are  adopted by the trade body's full council which must reach  consensus.    Guatemala, Colombia, Costa Rica and Nicaragua are the other  countries which made the complaint.</p>

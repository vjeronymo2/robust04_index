			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Profits warning hits QS shares QS Holdings, the specialist clothing retailer based in the south of England, announced yesterday that profits in the six months to July 30 would be 'substantially' lower than the Pounds 3.86m reported last time. The shares fell 70p to 235p. Mr Marc Walters, chairman, said the downturn would be partly the result of lower sales. This followed 'poor weather in April, May and June'; increased pressure on margins, as prices were cut to shift summer stock; and other store groups - driven by recession to emphasise the value-for-money side of their family wear - invading QS' product area. Mr Walters said the interim dividend would be held at 1.56p. The balance sheet remained strong with net cash and the expansion policy would continue as planned.</p>

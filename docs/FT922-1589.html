			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Regulating the water industry MR IAN BYATT, the UK water regulator, has acquired a reputation as the most interventionist of the utility regulators. This is entirely appropriate in an industry which lacks even the measure of competition existing in other utilities, where gas, for example, competes with electricity, BT with Mercury. The water companies can point to considerable benefits from privatisation: record levels of investment; fast-improving water quality; and better service. But with little potential to increase competition, only assiduous regulation can defend consumers against monopoly abuses. There has been no shortage of reasons for the regulator to intervene. Price rises averaging 5 per cent a year over the rate of inflation produced profit increases last year in double-digit percentages. Most companies have increased prices less than the permitted maximum this year, but only with bad grace after Mr Byatt warned that excessive profits would bring nemesis. While shareholders have enjoyed rising dividends, many drought-stricken parts of the country are enduring hosepipe bans and other restrictions on the use of water. Water company chairmen and chief executives - probably underpaid when nationalised - have tripled their salaries since privatisation with scant regard to public relations. The level of disconnections to collect unpaid bills has climbed steeply, with the most ruthless company 300 times more likely to cut off a non-paying customer than the least. Ambitious plans to use monopoly profits from water supply for acquiring businesses such as waste management have had to be squashed. Tinkering rejected This suggests considerable scope for tightening the regulatory regime when the present arrangements are reviewed in 1995. Mr Byatt has rightly rejected immediate tinkering on the grounds that the Pounds 28bn investment programme would be undermined by a return to the short-termism prevalent when the industry was nationalised. But he has issued a stream of position papers on the options for 1995, inviting debate in the industry and among water users The most important of his proposals is to set the companies' price cap formulae in the light of their rate of return on capital. He has suggested that current rates of return are too high for low-risk utilities. While there is room for debate over the targets, Mr Byatt is undoubtedly right to form a view about appropriate rates of return in the absence of competitive pressure. Environmental objectives Mr Byatt has also questioned the cost of environmental improvements imposed on the companies by the EC and watchdogs, such as the National Rivers Authority. Meeting EC targets for levels of nitrate and pesticide residue, for example, is already costing Pounds 1.8bn - to achieve standards of water purity the value of which is a matter of controversy. The NRA's chairman, Lord Crickhowell, wants to accelerate the already ambitious programme for reducing river pollution. And last week, he urged companies to reduce the rate of extraction from 40 depleted rivers. Such environmental objectives have merit, but decisions must be taken only after thorough cost-benefit analysis. Finally, Mr Byatt has urged that domestic water users should pay for the amount of water they use, rather than the present flat-rate charge, based on house values. The case for metering is strongest in the south and east of England where ground water reserves are so depleted that shortages would long outlive an end to the drought. Grandiose schemes to bring water from the wetter north are under consideration, though a national grid would be ruinously expensive. More promising returns are available on investment in modernising mains, which lose almost a quarter of the water they carry through leakage. However, metering, almost universal among other European countries, offers the only hope of choking off the inexorable rise in demand for water in areas of shortage. It will have to be introduced. Mr Byatt has shown commendable initiative in raising these issues and in cajoling the industry into meeting its social obligations. The water companies may squirm and protest, but consumers are in no mood for compromise.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Abbey National up 6% despite big provisions: Pre-tax profits at Pounds 618m - Dividend rise of 10.5% is largest in sector A STRONG performance by its treasury operation enabled Abbey National, the retail banking group, to report a 6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits last year, in spite of a heavy increase in its provisions against loan losses. Abbey National, the UK's second largest mortgage lender with 13.8 per cent of the market, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 618m during 1991, up from Pounds 582m in 1990. This made it the second most profitable UK banking group last year after Lloyds Bank. As a result, Abbey National increased its dividend by 10.5 per cent to 10.5p, up from 9.5p last year, the largest dividend increase in the UK banking sector. Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, said: 'Abbey National's business is in good shape.' Mr Birch said the bank was positioned to continue progress, having moved into life assurance with the purchase of Scottish Mutual. Group assets rose 23 per cent, from Pounds 46.4bn in 1990 to Pounds 57.4bn. However, more than half of this balance sheet growth came from Abbey National's treasury operations, which contributed Pounds 62m to the overall pre-tax profits, up from Pounds 2m in 1990. The performance of Abbey National's retail banking operations was less impressive. The bank's core mortgage lending operations shrank during the year as the market declined, with its total net UK lending down by 20 per cent, from Pounds 3.7bn in 1990 to Pounds 4.6bn last year. Loan loss provisions almost trebled, rising from Pounds 55m in 1990 to Pounds 155m. During the year, the bank repossessed 8,871 homes, but the number repossessed in the second half was slightly below that of the first half. Mr Birch said that although repossessions were still at a high level, Abbey National had fared better than the mortgage lending industry as a whole and he believed that the bank had weathered the storm. The number of Abbey National mortgage customers more than six months in arrears on payments has more than doubled, rising from 11,563 in 1990 to 24,419 in 1991, about 1.75 per cent of all mortgages. There has been a steady fall in the number of mortgage accounts coming into serious arrears since the second half of 1991. In spite of this Abbey National expects to go on having to make steep provisions against bad loans through 1992 and 1993 until the fall in arrears has worked its way through and been translated into a significant fall in repossessions. In the market, Abbey National's shares fell 11p to close at 292p after heavy trading. Lex, Page 18 Background, Page 20</p>

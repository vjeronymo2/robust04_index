			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Fresh battles at Cairo talks: Immigration dispute emerges at population conference Controversial clauses on immigration have emerged as a new battleground in tortuous attempts to reach consensus on a final document at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. Britain and Germany are objecting strongly to a section of the draft document which says that families of immigrants have the right to be re-united in one country. They are concerned that this suggests that relatives of immigrant workers or of naturalised citizens have rights to immigration. London and Bonn may be prepared to back the principle that families should be united, but are pressing for a new phrasing which could not be used in court, delegates from European Union countries said. The present text, which has not been agreed, urges governments to 'recognise the right of family reunification'. However, the deadlock over text on abortion policy remained the chief obstacle to consensus, with delegates braced to scrap a scheduled weekend break and negotiate up to the last hour of the conference on Tuesday night. 'I don't think there is any one group trying to wreck the conference, although there may be groups trying to hold it to ransom,' said a British delegate. The Vatican and a 'hard core' of about 10 Roman Catholic countries remain bitterly opposed to the proposed wording on abortion, although Moslem states have now given their backing. Dr Nafis Sadik, executive director of the UN population fund, who is chairing the conference, said: 'I do not think the Vatican will agree (to the policy document) even if all the phrases (on abortion) are left out, because basically they are against contraceptive technology.' Holy See officials insisted they were seeking a final text to which they could agree. However, delegates yesterday reached agreement on the controversial financing target of Dollars 17bn by the year 2000, more than treble present levels. Two thirds of the money is expected to come from developing countries. Mr Abdul Suleiman, from the Nigerian delegation, warned the figure 'is very much a global average - in some countries, the ratio will have to be more like 50:50.' Yesterday Baroness Chalker, the UK minister for overseas development and head of the British delegation, repeated her pledge that Britain would spend Pounds 100m over the next two years on overseas family planning programmes - an increase of 60 per cent.</p>

Had there  been no testimony by the brave convoy crew members, which have  just returned from Nova Bila, the knowledge about the position  of about 80,000 encircled Croats would be based on assumptions  and the censored information from the Political Department of  the Croatian Defense Council, but in this way it was clearly  said before the Croatian national audiences that the Croats  would inevitably be expelled from the Lasva Valley if the  conflict continued. The cooperation of the people with the army  and their courage and readiness to make sacrifices are not  enough to defend the century-long Croatian existence in central  Bosnia.    After the loose cooperation between the Bosnian Croats and  the Muslims broke, the Muslims made the plan to control this  area, and this plan has been being carried out for months. After  the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina had occupied Travnik and Bugojno,  it became clear that they wanted to encircle the enclaves in  central Bosnia. The occupation of Gornji Vakuf, the ousting of  the Croatian Defense Council forces from Kakanj, and taking over  the control over Fojnica were the three stages in which the ring  around Lasva Valley was closed in. These operations made it  possible to create a very deep encirclement, which in its  narrowest part is 40 km long. If it was not situated in an  impassable mountainous region, which restricts the use of  military equipment, first of all of armored units, the breaking  up of this ring would be much easier. What is more, such a  mountainous region is ideal for the organization of defense; it  is easy to set ambushes and destroy the enemy's logistics.    The mountains, a bad communication network, and winter  conditions are factors that support the Muslim army since they  require deployment of infantry forces, which is one of the  Muslim advantages. Any intervention by Croatian Defense Council  forces with the aim of breaking the ring around the Lasva Valley  and reaching the positions of the encircled Croatian units in  Vitez would require the deployment of large units that will also  have to secure the corridor through which help is transported to  Novi Travnik, Vitez, and Busovaca. Instead of the expected  breaking out of the encirclement toward central Bosnia, the  Bijeli Put convoy crew was informed about the horrible truth,  which was transmitted neither by the official agency of  Herceg-Bosna nor by the Croatian Television correspondents:  Gornji Vakuf was occupied by Muslims, and the Croatian Defense  Council units were pushed approximately one and a half  kilometers toward Prozor, which means that the ring was even  tightened. The 6th Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina was  entrusted with the defense of the southern blockade line, which  could be broken out by the Croatian Defense Council units from  Herzegovina, and the 3d Zenica Corps of the Bosnian Army was  entrusted with the destruction of the Croatian forces in Vitez.  The blockade of the Croatian Defense Council units along the  inner rim of the encirclement is performed by the Bosnian Army  units from local villages, whereas the striking force of the  Muslim Army is composed of the 352d Mountain Brigade and the 7th  Muslim Brigade from Zenica, known for its extremism and the use  of Islamic religious symbols.    The 17th Krajina Brigade of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  founded in Travnik by the Muslim refugees from the Bosnian  Krajina, also belongs to the striking force of the Zenica Corps.  This brigade played the decisive role when Travnik was taken  over by the Muslims. It is difficult to say how many Muslim  soldiers are directly involved in the conflict with the Croats  of the Lasva Valley, but independent sources estimate that there  are approximately 15,000 Muslims soldiers there. The advantage  of the Muslim forces is their considerable maneuverability and  the ability to make groups along certain directions. Although  Serbian media report on "extensive Muslim offensives," it can be  said that the Muslim forces apply in this area the tactics of  exhaustion by a long-lasting blockade, accompanied by  low-intensity conflicts which might seem local the first sight,  but the Croatian Defense Council gradually loses control over  its territory. Since time in the present situation works for  the Bosnian Army, its commanders adapt the intensity of the  attacks to their needs. In this way they have the initiative all  the time -- they choose the modality, the time, and the place of  an attack according to the defense position of the Croatian  Defense Council.    Although the 3d Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina  attacks in all directions, the center of their attacks are two  directions in the Lasva Valley. Supported by the Kruscica  Mountain, which is parallel with the Lasva River Valley, they  launch their attacks at the town of Vitez with the aim of  creating a connection with the Muslim forces encircled in Stari  Vitez, which would enable them to reach the right bank of the  Lasva. Through attacks in the second direction, which extends  from Zenica via Vjetranica to Dubravica, they want to cut off  the Croatian area between Novi Travnik, Vitez, and Busovaca with  the aim of reaching the left bank of the Lasva and merging with  the southern group of the Bosnian Army units.    According to published but not yet confirmed reports, the  Croatian forces have been pushed back to an area not wider than  200 meters at its narrowest point. This means that the Lasva  Valley has been practically cut in two. The latest Muslim  breakthrough happened after the attack against the Krizanici  villages, in which around 60 local Croats were either killed or  are missing. The communication between Busovaca in the east and  Vitez in the west is now possible only under constant sniper and  mortar fire coming from the positions of the 3d Corps of the  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Under these unfavorable conditions, including the imbalance  of forces and bad weather conditions in an unfavorable area,  decisive resistance is offered by the three Vitez brigades of  the Croatian Defense Council, whose commander is the famous  Tihomir Blaskic. The "Stjepan Tomasevic" brigade from Novi  Travnik, the brigade of the "knights," and the "Nikola Subic  Zrinski" brigade lost many of their members and are inferior to  the aggressor. The proportion of forces regarding the number of  soldiers fell from two to one to five to one in favor of the  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The offensive of the forces loyal to  Izetbegovic which started on 18 December even continued during  the Geneva and Brussels peace talks. It stopped only on  Christmas Day, but was resumed with varying intensity after the  holiday.    Apart from central Bosnia, there are conflicts between  Croats  and Muslims also north of Mostar. There are clashes there for  control of Dreznica, a village and a small river of the same  name. The Dreznica flows into the Neretva River some 15 km north  of Mostar. Lower intensity clashes are reported also from  southern positions of the 111th Zepca Brigade of the Croatian  Defense Council. The inhabitants of Usor are lucky that the  representatives of the War Presidency of Tesanj, which consists  of both Muslims and Croats, declined to carry out the order  given by the Sarajevo Headquarters of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina according to which the members of the 110th  Usor Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council should have been  put under the command of the 7th Operative Group of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The war alliance and human lives are  temporarily preserved.    The encircled 80,000 women, children, old people, some  soldiers, the wounded, and the sick in central Bosnia are still  exposed to attacks by the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although  Slobodan Praljak, a movie director and the Croatian Defense  Council commander for this area, was replaced by General Roso, a  professional soldier, a former commander in the Foreign Legion,  but this could have not changed the balance of forces. Even a  much more powerful army than the Croatian Defense Council could  not occupy the inaccessible mountains of central Bosnia. From  the military point of view these positions are untenable in the  long run. The civilians can be rescued -- by evacuation -- only  if a cease-fire is reached. An open intervention by the  Croatian Army with the aim of liberating the encircled people is  quite a possible and practicable solution, in spite of the  threats of sanctions, because almost 100,000 human lives have to  be rescued!</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The vice foreign minister of China, Mr. Liu Huaqiu,  said that his country wants to become a contracting party in the  GATT to globalize its economy. Mr. Liu is participating in the  ESCAP [Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]  conference currently in session in New Delhi. In an exclusive  interview to Doordarshan correspondent Prabhat Dabral, Mr. Liu  said that the farmers of his country will welcome the conclusion  of the Uruguay Round.    [Begin recording] [Dabral] What is the immediate provocation  for you, Mr. Liu, as the country of socialist economy to apply  for the membership of GATT?    [Liu, in Chinese with superimposed translation into English]  China has all along being carrying out reforms and opening up  policy and the diverse measures and steps we have taken in  economic reforms [and] opening up are also in keeping with the  requirements of GATT. For instance, in the trade sector, as you  know, trade -- the drive for economic growth -- also leads to  high world trade and the trade is playing ever-growing role.  So, China would also upgrade the provision of the GATT in  trying to play a more active part in international trade.    [Dabral] China, like India is also predominantly  agriculture-based economy. What do you think the farmers of  China stand to gain from the GATT, especially from the Uruguay  Round of negotiations or shall we say the Dunkel text?    [Liu, in Chinese with superimposed translation into English]  On one hand, we should protect the interests of Chinese farmers  by improving their income situation every year. On the other  hand, we should also bring our agricultural products to the  international market [words indistinct] buy from and also sell  into the international market. By so doing, we will push  China's agricultural sector into the international market, and  in this way we can also take advanced experience of technology  from the international market which again [words indistinct] on  account of agricultural development.

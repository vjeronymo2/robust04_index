			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing and S.Y. Yue] </F>   [Text] Both the Hong Kong and Chinese governments moved  yesterday to begin implementing measures to cool property  speculation and bring flat prices back to affordable levels.    A top Chinese official revealed that Beijing intended to  ensure that another huge slice of land would be made available  this year for the construction of homes.    Chinese delegates on the joint Land Commission were yet to  reply to this year's land programme submitted by Britain earlier  this year.    The supply of land has been singled out as the most  important  measure capable of taking the heat out of the property market,  which has seen speculators push home prices far beyond  affordable levels.    A deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, Chen Ziying, indicated no less than 100 hectares  would be approved this year.    The Hong Kong Government, which has also pledged to release  more new land for development, yesterday suggested that measures  might be taken to speed up the construction of flats on existing  sites re- zoned for residential use.    It warned that construction firms might be forced to finish  re- development projects within three years if evidence of  hoarding were discovered.    The Acting Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands,  Canice Mak Chunfong, said the three-year requirement at present  applied only to new land.    "If we find developers are holding up land after approval is  given to change its use and to redevelop the area, we will  extend the building covenants which require construction to be  completed within three years," he said.    Moreover, if the developer of a redevelopment project wanted  to sell flats before construction was completed, he might be  subject to the same restrictions as developers of new land.    "Through a consent scheme, the Government can make sure the  pre- sold flats are completed according to schedule. This will  reduce room for speculation by such means as holding up the  construction of a certain number of flats to inflate prices," Mr  Mak said.    More than 130 hectares of land, 60 per cent of the land  supply last year, came from re-development.    If China approves at least 100 hectares of new land, the  supply for the year would be more than double the 50 hectare  limit stipulated in Annexe Three of the Joint Declaration.    And it would be the third consecutive year that Beijing has  agreed that the land grant should substantially exceed the limit.    The land grants for 1992/93 and 1993/94 were 159.3 hectares  and 127.8 hectares respectively.    All new land must be approved by the Land Commission and  half  the money goes to the Land Fund, which is for the use of the  Special Administrative Region government after 1997.    Mr Chen called on the Hong Kong Government to cool the  heated  property market and inflation.    "Not long ago, Governor Chris Patten said he would act to  suppress the prices of consumer goods and property. We look  forward to the practical and viable proposals he is going to  make," he said.    It would take some time for the Chinese delegates on the  Land  Commission to study the British proposals, which carried  detailed information on individual sites, said team leader Chen  Rongchun.    Despite the fact that the land body would normally meet in  March, the Chinese chief told the PWC [Preliminary Working  Committee] that last year's session was held in May.    Leader of the Chinese Land Commission team, Mr Chen  Rongchun,  attributed spiralling property prices to the economic boom in  Hong Kong and southern China, according to a Preliminary Working  Committee (PWC) economic sub-group member, Tam Yiu-chung.    He did not refer to hoarding of completed flats by  developers  or to speculation by China-funded companies, Mr Tam said.    The director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, Lu Ping, has criticised China-funded  enterprises' speculation in Hong Kong's property market.    Mr Tam quoted Mr Chen Rongchun as saying it was estimated  that China-funded enterprises' market share in property  transactions had been six percent.    Mr Mak said the Government was surveying large housing  projects completed in recent years to find out the vacancy rate  and the length of time of vacancy.    "We think many vacant flats are in the hands of speculators  rather than developers. This is mainly due to the economic  factor -- that many people want to put their money into property  as it is a good investment.    "Whatever measures we take, we will be very careful to  balance individual rights to own property and the public concern  on flat hoarding," Mr Mak said.    He said the Government would, in two months, come up with a  package of comprehensive measures to bring down property prices.</p>

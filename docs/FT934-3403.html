			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Rogue brokers targeted in US: The securities industry's need to enforce its rules Although it has been enjoying three consecutive years of record-breaking profits, the US securities industry thinks it may be developing an image problem. Last week, critical comments about sales practices of unscrupulous stockbrokers by a senior Securities and Exchange Commission official touched off a vigorous debate about whether the industry needs to do more to police its broking force and weed out those who break the rules. Mr Carter Beese, an SEC commissioner, set the ball rolling last Thursday when he told the Securities Industry Association's annual conference in Florida that if the industry did not do a better job of tackling what he called 'rogue brokers', Congress might decide to draw up tough new laws to discipline brokers and their firms. Mr Beese was referring to those who boost commission income by selling securities and other products to clients who do not need them, and by recommending unnecessary buying and selling of stocks within clients' portfolios: the practice of 'churning'. Mr Arthur Levitt, recently appointed chairman of the SEC, told representatives last week that tackling unscrupulous brokers and punishing executives who fail to supervise them properly would be a priority of his term at the agency. Mr John Dingell, a powerful member of the House of Representatives, has called on the industry to introduce a 'three strikes and you're out' policy under which those who have faced multiple customer complaints would be permanently barred from the business. Mr Dingell's proposal is a response to the industry's poor record at removing rogue brokers. Although those who abuse the rules and their clients are routinely fired by their employers, they often turn up at another firm. This is because most firms get rid of troublesome employees without a formal internal review for fraud or violation of industry rules. Managements fear that if they take official action against brokers, they will become enmeshed in long and expensive legal battles. Although the debate about brokers' behaviour has suddenly intensified, there is no evidence that industry standards are slipping. According to the National Association of Securities Dealers, until the end of October less than 1 per cent of the country's 463,000 registered brokers were the subject of a customer complaint to the NASD, and only 0.1 per cent were either suspended or permanently barred because of their actions. So why all the fuss now? First, recent publicity surrounding a few cases involving unscrupulous brokers has heightened the public's concern about standards of integrity. In particular, the case of Prudential Securities, which will have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation to thousands of investors who in the 1980s were sold limited partnerships that quickly went sour, has attracted a lot of attention. Second, while rogue brokers have been been around for centuries, the flood of new money over the past two years into stocks and bonds has raised fears that a few may be exploiting first-time investors with little knowledge or experience of investing. Although the facts support the securities firms' view that only a handful of brokers have been breaking the rules, any service industry is sensitive to the issue of declining standards.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- "Enhancing the Role of  the Popular Masses Is the Guarantee for Victory in the Cause of  Independence", a classical work of the great leader President  Kim Il-song, was brought out in booklet by the Afzal Publishing  House in Pakistan on March 28 on the occasion of his birthday.    The booklet says in the preface:    His Excellency President Kim Il-song set out on the road of  revolution in his early years and founded the immortal chuche  idea, and organized and led to victory two revolutionary wars  against imperialism, thus defending and exalting the nation's  dignity and honour.    He has turned Korea into a powerful country, independent in  politics, self-sustaining in the economy and self-reliant in  national defence, and an earthly paradise for the people in a  historically short span of time.    He enjoys boundless respect and reverence of the Korean  people and the world people for the immortal feats and  contributions he has made to the world revolution, as the most  distinguished leader of the working class of the world.</p>

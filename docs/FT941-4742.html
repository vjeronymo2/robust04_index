			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Birds still rule Antigua roost The 25-year domination of Antiguan politics by the Bird family will continue with the victory of the incumbent Labour Party in last Tuesday's general election. Mr Lester Bird, the Labour leader, is to be sworn in as prime minister, succeeding his 84-year-old father, Mr Vere Bird Sr, who has resigned. Preliminary results have given the Labour Party 11 of the 17 seats in the assembly. The opposition United Progressive Party, which had one seat in the previous parliament, took five, with the lone seat on the island of Barbuda going to the People's Movement. The campaign was dominated by charges from the opposition that the Labour government's long control of the government had led to endemic corruption, with the islands, whose economy is based on tourism, being used for drug smuggling and money laundering. Mr Lester Bird consistently rejected the charges during the campaign, but promised to take a hard line against any impropriety in the government. The new prime minister's early tasks will include a decision on the role, if any, which his elder brother, Mr Vere Bird Jr, will play in politics. Mr Bird Jr, who won a seat, was the central figure in a judicial inquiry four years ago, in which it was alleged that he had used his office as a government minister to facilitate the transhipment of Israeli arms to Colombian drug cartels.</p>

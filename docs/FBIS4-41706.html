			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray told  Interfax that the country's regions and territories would  inevitably acquire the economic and legal rights now enjoyed by  its republics.    He said that 18 out of 21 republics incorporated in Russia  were much weaker economically than nearly every region.  Shakhray thought that inter-regional association such as the  Siberian Accord had become a way to achieve horizontal  integration of territories and regions and a new Russian  regional policy.    Shakhray said that an agreement between the central  government and eight inter-regional associations that had been  drafted more than six weeks ago could be signed very shortly.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Maxwell lawyers say media made fair trial impossible Defence lawyers are seeking to have the Maxwell brothers' trial on fraud and other charges called off on the grounds that publicity over the Maxwell affair has made a fair trial impossible. The attempt to halt the criminal proceedings against Kevin and Ian Maxwell was disclosed in court for the first time yesterday when the Serious Fraud Office applied for a reporting ban on a current High Court case concerning Maxwell pension fund assets used to raise a Pounds 50m loan. A successful SFO application would rule out any reporting of the attempt by UK pensioners to recover Pounds 60m from Credit Suisse bank, which accepted the assets as collateral for the loan. The SFO said the ban was necessary to avoid prejudicing the trials, to start after Easter next year. The Credit Suisse case is expected to end next summer, but if the SFO succeeds, pensioners could be left in ignorance of the result for a further two years, their lawyers argued. Mr Justice Lindsay, the Credit Suisse case judge, rejected an SFO request for reporting restrictions on yesterday's hearing. Arguments over calling off the criminal proceedings against all defendants in the Maxwell fraud trial will be heard in January. First in line for trial will be four of the six facing various fraud charges  -Kevin and Ian Maxwell, Mr Larry Trachtenberg, former adviser to Mr Robert Maxwell, and Mr Robert Bunn, former finance director of Maxwell Communication Corporation. In the first trial, Kevin Maxwell will face two charges of a total nine alleging conspiracy to defraud over pension fund assets. Ian Maxwell, Mr Trachtenberg and Mr Bunn will face one charge of conspiracy to defraud. Further proceedings against the four and two former Robert Maxwell employees, Mr Michael Stoney, a former Mirror Group Newspapers finance director, and Mr Albert Fuller, a former MGN treasurer, are set to follow. Mr Michael Crystal QC, for the Mirror Group Pension Fund Trustees, argued against a blanket reporting ban on the Credit Suisse proceedings. He said the proceedings might last until 1997 and the order could prevent pensioners being informed of the result of their action, he said. The trustees and the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the main Maxwell pension management company, are suing Credit Suisse. Ten national newspapers are opposing the SFO application. The hearing was adjourned until December 5.</p>

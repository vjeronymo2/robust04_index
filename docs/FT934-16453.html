			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher builds up US fresh produce side ALBERT FISHER, the food processing and distribution group, has agreed to pay up to Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) for Imperial Produce, a Washington-based distributor of fresh produce and prepared salads and vegetables. Imperial, which has annual sales of more than Dollars 15m to food service businesses in the US capital, is the latest US acquisition by the UK group, which already has strong market positions in Florida and California. In July Fisher paid Dollars 4m for a Texas distributor. Mr Stephen Walls, executive chairman, said this acquisition 'completed the jigsaw' in the south-east of the US. Imperial was already well down the road of Fisher's chosen route, which was to focus increasingly on providing more profitable products - such as pre-cut salads - to customers in the catering business. This is the latest in a series of deals by Mr Walls, who took over as chairman last year from Mr Tony Millar, who built Fisher rapidly by acquisition during the 1980s. In January, Fisher paid Pounds 29m for Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce, herbs and spice company, and assumed Pounds 9.8m of debt. In May it sold Hunter Saphir's herbs and spices business for Pounds 25m to Burns Philip, the Australian group. The group also hopes to raise an estimated Pounds 20m-Pounds 25m by this month by spinning off Charles Sidney, its Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz commercial and passenger car dealer, through a full stock market flotation.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television When American steel millionaire Lawrence Thaw and his wife Peggy toured India in 1939 they went in a huge motor caravan, taking with them a leading cinematographer to record the event on 35 mm Magnacolor film stock. The resulting holiday films provide the material for today's Voices From The Past (7.40 BBC2). Horizon, which follows at 8.10, tells the story of Buckminsterfullerene, a type of carbon discovered by two physicists in 1990 and named after the architect who was so keen on geodesic domes. It seems that the discovery 'revolutionised chemistry overnight', and industrialists are now talking about new polymers, lubricants, and nano-technology, but the two physicists are wondering whether Buckminsterfullerene is the solution to one of the great mysteries of astronomy. The second programme in the four-part Falklands War (9.00 C4) deals with the sailing of the task force and the sinking of the General Belgrano. BBC2 screens the last part of its drama Goodbye Cruel World (9.00) about 'Way's Disease' and the politics of medical charities. Panorama (9.30 BBC1) investigates the disappearance of long-stay geriatric beds from NHS hospitals.</p>

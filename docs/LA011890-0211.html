			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PARKS SCORES 19 IN FOURTH QUARTER TO LEAD MARINA PAST EDISON  </P> <P> It took every inch of 6-foot-11 center Cherokee Parks' offensive ability to  rally Marina High School to a 61-55 Sunset League victory over Edison Wednesday  night at Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Parks scored 19 points in the final quarter, including 11 consecutive free  throws, to help Marina (11-7, 3-0) overcome a 13-point deficit to defeat Edison  for the first time in three games this season. Edison had won two preseason  games.  </P> <P> Parks finished with 28 points, despite sitting out nearly four minutes in the  third quarter when he got his fourth personal foul. He was 14 of 15 from the  free-throw line.  </P> <P> Edison (13-5, 2-1) did an excellent job of containing Parks for three quarters  with 6-10 center Bill Martineau and 6-5 forward Steve Thobe tag-teaming the  junior center. But Thobe fouled out with 3:41 remaining to play and Martineau  followed him to the bench about a minute later with his fifth foul and Parks  broke loose in their absence.  </P> <P> "The game is a lot more difficult when you have a 6-5 forward and a 6-9 center  sitting on the bench with next with five fouls," said Jon Borchert, Edison  coach.  </P> <P> Marina was badly beaten on the boards through three quarters and appeared to be  hopelessly out of contention while Edison's front line of Brandon Jessie, Thobe  and Martineau controlling the boards.  </P> <P> Jessie finished with 19 points and six rebounds, Thobe had 10 points and nine  rebounds and Martineau added 15 points and 11 rebounds. But they were never a  factor in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Parks tied the game, 48-48, with a three-point play with 3:41 remaining and  then capped the turnaround by stealing a pass, dribbling the length of the  court and scoring on a dunk for a 56-51 lead with 1:34 remaining. Afterward,  Parks called the victory a momentum builder.  </P> <P> "These are the kind of games that pick you up and get you going," he said. "We  don't match up very well with Edison. But as long as I established position, I  was able to get a shot off."  </P> <P> Marina Coach Steve Popovich had watched his team in preseason lose to Edison in  the championship game of the Santa Maria Tournament and in the third-place game  of the Irvine World News Tournament. Popovich said he challenged his team at  halftime to beat Edison.  </P> <P> "We're were getting our butts kicked on the boards and didn't do a good job of  getting the ball inside in the first half," Popovich said. "Martineau and Thobe  killed us. But the players met the challenge."  </P> <P> Fountain Valley 57, Westminster 55 -- Mike Merli made a jump shot in the middle  of the key with three seconds remaining to lift host Fountain Valley (7-10,  1-2). Merli had 20 points and 12 rebounds for the game. Eric Zellmer had 13  points and Derrick Corcoran had 10 for Fountain Valley. Mark Murphy, Eden  Yawata and Eric Wilkens each had 13 points for Westminster (5-10, 0-3).  </P> <P> Ocean View 87, Huntington Beach 67 -- Ryan Martin had 22 points and seven  rebounds and Greg Evans had 15 points and seven rebounds to lead Ocean View  (11-5, 3-0). Mustapha Abdi had 23 points for Huntington Beach (7-10, 0-3).  </P></p>

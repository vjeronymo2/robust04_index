			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Tight cost controls benefit Low &amp; Bonar Low &amp; Bonar, the packaging, plastics and specialist materials group, yesterday unveiled a 42 per cent increase in interim profits following a sharp improvement in sales and productivity. Contributions from new subsidiaries and tight cost controls helped lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 20.4m in the six months to May 31, on turnover up 18 per cent at Pounds 201m. Mr Jim Leng, chief executive, said such subsidiaries - dominated by Cereal Packaging and CMB Carton Systems - had turned the group intoBritain's largest food carton manufacturer and a market leader in Europe. 'We're modestly proud of these results. We've got very good operational gearing and margins have risen in all three divisions,' he said. His comments prompted a 16p rise in the shares to 403p. The strong performance - led by its UK-dominated packaging division - was held back only by adverse currency movements and flat trading in continental Europe. Although unfavourable exchange rates wiped Pounds 500,000 off group profits, the packaging business saw profits surge by 75 per cent to Pounds 8.4m in Europe and by 12 per cent to Pounds 2.8m in North America. Currency losses were also offset by the group's plastics and specialist materials businesses, which together accounted for 48 per cent of trading profits. Of those divisions, the plastics business reported profits of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.6m) in Europe and Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 900,000) in North America. Profits in the specialist materials business, which manufactures products including floor coverings for civil aircraft and fibres for artificial hockey pitches, rose 9 per cent to Pounds 6.9m in Europe, although it made a small loss in the US and Canada. The figures were enhanced by a decline in interest payable from Pounds 2m to Pounds 1.2m as the group reduced its borrowings from Pounds 18m to Pounds 16m, equivalent to gearing of 10.9 per cent. Earnings per share rose 33 per cent to 13.59p (10.22p) and an interim dividend of 3.2p (2.9p) is declared. COMMENT Low &amp; Bonar should not be modest about its achievements. It has transformed itself from a conglomerate weighed down by eight divisions into a tightly focused three-pronged business. Despite Pounds 22m of acquisitions, it has also strengthened its cashflow and has enough leeway to make further purchases without coming to the market. Mr Leng, however, is determined to do better and has earmarked some 'underperforming parts of the business to bring up to scratch'. His record suggests he will achieve that aim and forecasts for pre-tax profits were raised yesterday to Pounds 42m for the year. The shares, on a multiple of 13.3, remain at a discount to the sector average.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 18 June, the municipal discipline inspection  commission held a meeting of district, county, bureau (general  company), university and college discipline inspection  commission secretaries and supervisory bureau (section)  directors to relay and implement the guidelines of the national  telephone conference of discipline inspection and supervisory  departments cosponsored by the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission and the Ministry of Supervision. The meeting  stressed the necessity to expand the dynamics of punishment and  to concentrate energy on investigating and handling a number of  major and appalling cases.    Since the second plenary session of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission held last year, Beijing Municipality has  expanded the dynamics of investigating and handling major and  appalling cases, forcefully attacked unlawful and undisciplined  activities, and made appropriate achievements. Thus, the people  have strengthened the confidence in opposing corruption. In  1993, the discipline inspection and supervisory organs across  the municipality investigated and handled 1,044 undisciplined  cases of various categories and handled 593 party members. Of  this, 518 or 49.6 percent were cases involving violation of  economic discipline. Of the cases investigated and handled, 183  or 17.5 percent were major and appalling cases. In the first  five months of this year, the discipline inspection and  supervisory organs across the municipality investigated and  handled 659 undisciplined cases of various categories, an  increase of 48.1 percent over the same period of last year when  445 cases were investigated and handled. Of this, 61 were major  and appalling cases.    Li Yongan, standing committee member of the municipal party  committee and secretary of the municipal discipline inspection  commission, made a speech at the meeting. He said: The  discipline inspection and supervisory organs at various levels  across the municipality should conscientiously implement the  guidelines of the national telephone conference of discipline  inspection and supervisory departments held on 9 June, as well  as the guidelines of the "circular on paying attention to  investigating and handling major and appalling economic cases in  the course of waging the struggle against corruption as issued  by the offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council," and should expand the dynamics of investigating and  handling major and appalling cases. In the next few months, the  discipline inspection and supervisory organs across the  municipality should concentrate time and energy on investigating  and concluding a number of major and appalling cases; pay  particular attention to conscientiously investigating and  handling a number of major and appalling cases of engaging in  corruption, giving and accepting bribes, getting money by fraud,  indulging in smuggling, and seriously violating financial and  economic discipline; and make noticeable achievements. We  should continuously focus our efforts on investigating party and  government leading organs, judicial departments, administrative  and law enforcement departments, and economic management  departments; and emphatically investigate and handle the major  economic criminal cases relating to the leading cadres at or  above the county (section) level. We should openly handle and  expose the cases with influential power in order to build up  momentum and produce an impact. He stressed: The leaders at  various levels, particularly party and government top leaders,  should further upgrade understanding, pay high attention to  investigating and handling major and appalling cases, and  support discipline inspection and supervisory departments to  strictly and rapidly investigate and handle a number of cases of  violating economic laws and economic discipline. We should  ensure the supply of funds for handling cases for the discipline  inspection and supervisory departments and provide necessary  material conditions for investigating and handling major and  appalling cases. Leaders of the discipline inspection and  supervisory organs at various levels should personally go to the  forefront to handle cases. It is necessary to strictly carry  out the system of responsibility for handling cases among each  level. We should further strengthen the coordination and  cooperation of law and discipline enforcement departments and  the departments for supervision over the enforcement of  administrative laws, and have them closely cooperate with one  another, and form cohesive power. Discipline inspection and  supervisory departments should resolutely withstand the  obstacles created by the practice of interceding for somebody.  We should grasp the typical cases of refusing to report and  handle cases, creating obstacles for handling cases, offering  false evidence, and refusing to offer evidence; and openly and  strictly investigate and affix the responsibility for these  cases.</p>

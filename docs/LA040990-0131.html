			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VINCENT THROWS OPENING DAY PITCH  </P> <P> Commissioner Fay Vincent threw out the ceremonial first ball today at Shea  Stadium in New York for the Opening Day game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and  New York Mets.  </P> <P> Vincent, one of the driving forces behind the settlement of the contract  dispute that delayed the season openers for a week, arrived about two hours  before the game.  </P> <P> "I'm really excited," Vincent said. "What a day. I'm a fan, and being someone  involved in the game makes it even more exciting."  </P> <P> Vincent watched the game from a box just to the left of the Mets' dugout and  threw out the first pitch to backup catcher Mackey Sasser, who was surrounded  by about 50 photographers.  </P> <P> The game started under sunny skies and a temperature of 59 degrees.  </P> <P> "When the weather is not good I get blamed, so I'll take credit for the good  weather," Vincent said.  </P> <P> At 1:48 p.m. EDT, Howard Johnson of the New York Mets hit the first home run of  the season. Johnson hit his solo home run in the bottom of the first against  Pittsburgh's Doug Drabek. The sellout crowd at Shea Stadium gave Johnson a  standing ovation, and he responded with the season's first curtain call.  </P> <P> Mike Winters, a minor-league umpire for seven years, was named today to the  National League's umpiring crew.  </P> <P> The 31-year-old Winters will open the season in the Pacific Coast League and  join the National League when umpire vacations begin. Winters replaces the  retired John Kibler.  </P> <P> Winters worked in the PCL the last four seasons with earlier stints in the  Texas League, the California League and the Arizona Instructional League. He  called several NL games as a vacation relief umpire last season.  </P> <P> The Baltimore Orioles prepared to begin the season today without their hottest  pitching prospect, Ben McDonald, who has been put on the 15-day disabled list.  </P> <P> The Orioles also placed pitcher Mark Williamson and infielder Tim Hulett on the  21-day disabled list Sunday.  </P> <P> McDonald, baseball's No. 1 draft choice last June, was placed on the 15-day  disabled list retroactive to last Friday and will be able to pitch April 22.  Williamson went on the list retroactive to March 31 and will be eligible to  pitch April 21.  </P> <P> Hulett is expected to be sidelined about six weeks after surgery on his left  hand Friday.  </P> <P> "I don't take any chances with anybody," manager Frank Robinson said.  "Especially with young guys who may not know what's good for them. We're not  thinking about the present. We're thinking about the future, too."  </P></p>

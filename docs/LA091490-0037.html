			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> THE NEW SEASON;  </P> <P> 'SUDIE AND SIMPSON': TRIUMPH OVER RACISM  </P> <P> Filmmakers have long fed on the richness of Southern literature, but seldom has  a movie of the rural South captured the power of friendship and love as  evocatively as "Sudie and Simpson" (on Lifetime cable tonight at 9, followed by  repeat broadcasts Saturday at 6 p.m. and Monday night at 9).  </P> <P> Louis Gossett Jr. and Sara Gilbert (Darlene on "Roseanne") play the entitled  characters, an outcast black man and a spirited young white girl who together  triumph over fear and racism in a small town in Georgia in 1943.  </P> <P> Directed by Joan Tewkesbury and adapted by Sara Flanigan and Ken Koser from  Flanigan's semi-autobiographical novel, "Sudie," the production is atmospheric  (catch that permanent wave machine in the beauty shop) and redolent of love and  squalor.  </P> <P> There's nothing soft at the core of this heartwarming story. A Gothic subplot  of child molestation involving a white schoolteacher propels the emotional  showdown, and the first image you see is a crude orange sign nailed up on a  tree in the fictional town of Linlow: "Nigger -- Don't Let the Sun Set on You  in Linlow."  </P> <P> What's so well captured is the personal point of view of a 12-year-old girl  rebelling against the taboos in the narrow world around her. Gilbert is  sensational, right down to her mastery of a Georgia dialect, and Gossett is  memorable as a survivor hiding in a shack outside of town and tending his  secret vegetable garden. Textured support comes from Frances Fisher's staunch  schoolteacher and an uncanny performance from newcomer Paige Danahy as Sudie's  chubby, dim-headed girlfriend.  </P> <P> Parents here have taught their kids to be terrified of blacks, and when Sudie,  scampering in the woods, sees a black man in the flesh for the first time, her  stunned reaction (and ultimate bravery) is a moment that catches your breath  and casts writer Flanigan in the luminous path of such Southern writers as  Harper Lee, Alice Walker and Carson McCullers.

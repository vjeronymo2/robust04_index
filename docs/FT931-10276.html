			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News in Brief AXA, the French insurance group, yesterday launched FFr3.65bn (Dollars 663m) of convertible bonds to strengthen the capital position of the group and some of its subsidiaries, writes Richard Waters. The seven-year bonds, FFr741m of which have been placed internationally, are convertible into Axa shares at FFr1,285 each. This represents a 12.7 per cent premium to yesterday's closing price of FFr1,140, which was recorded before the issue was announced. Axa has the right to call the bonds, which carry a coupon of 6 per cent and yield to maturity of 7.5 per cent, at any time from the beginning of 1996. The existing majority shareholders of the group, which control 50.9 per cent, will retain control after the offering. Existing shareholders are being offered one convertible for every 11 shares held, with a priority period to apply before 22 February. ***** NORDIC Investment Bank boosted profit before allocations to Special Drawing Rights 45m (Dollars 61m) in 1992, up 12.5 per cent from SDR40m a year earlier, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. The Helsinki-based bank, which is owned by the governments of the five Nordic countries, saw net interest income rise to SDR65m in 1992 from SDR60m. It is proposing an unchanged dividend of SDR10m to member countries.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Dutch coalition loses majority in election: Labour set to emerge as the largest single party The Netherlands' two ruling parties, the centrist Christian Democrats and Labour, lost their majority in parliament in yesterday's national elections, paving the way for the first three-party coalition since 1981. In a closely fought poll, Labour emerged as the largest party with 37 seats in the 150-seat lower house, according to provisional final results. The CDA took 34 seats. However, both suffered heavy losses compared with the 1989 general election and two smaller parties will play a crucial role in the coalition negotiations. The rightwing Liberals gained nine seats for a total of 31, while D66, a left-of-centre party, doubled its 1989 tally to finish with 24 seats. The four main parties agree on most economic and foreign policy issues but are divided on calls for reform of the country's extensive and generous social security system. Two new parties representing pensioners won a total of seven seats, underlining the importance of social security as an issue in the campaign. In the 1989 election the CDA captured 54 seats and Labour 49, giving the two parties their governing majority. Mr Frits Bolkestein, the Liberal leader, said last night: 'A political earthquake has taken place in this country.' The two most likely coalitions are either a centre-left government consisting of Labour, CDA and D66, or a right-left alliance of Labour, Liberals and D66, which would shut the CDA out of power for the first time since 1918. Labour's emergence as the largest party means it will try to secure the prime minister's job for only the third time since the second world war. Its candidate is the current finance minister, Mr Wim Kok. The dramatic loss of support for the CDA, the linchpin of every government since the second world war, was caused mainly by the impending departure from national politics of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Netherlands' longest-serving prime minister. His successor, Mr Elco Brinkman, does not have the same authority. Mr Brinkman expressed deep disappointment about the results but refused to be drawn last night on what they would mean for the composition of the future government. 'This has not been the CDA's best hour,' he said. The results also showed a rise of support for the far-right Centrum Democraten, which won three seats compared with one seat in 1989, although the result was below the eight seats predicted by some recent opinion polls.</p>

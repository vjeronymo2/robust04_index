			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDING OF PUBLIC TV  </P> <P> Sharon Bernstein's "An Advertiser Finds a Spot on Public TV" (April 7) more  than anything else points up the financial plight of public television,  increasingly caught between twin mandates: to remain true to its mission and to  be increasingly self-supporting.  </P> <P> Some critics say we should put stricter limits on corporate underwriting and  on-air identification of underwriters.  </P> <P> Others say we should reduce or eliminate on-air fund drives. Still others want  us to curtail telemarketing and direct-mail membership efforts.  </P> <P> The suggestions come after the Reagan Administration cut real dollar federal  support of public broadcasting and passed tax law changes that made it  increasingly difficult for individuals to contribute to nonprofit  organizations.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, California is one of only two states that give no support to public  broadcasting. And only one of every seven viewers of KCET contribute to the  station.  </P> <P> These are facts of life. It would be helpful if the critics would acknowledge  their existence and provide constructive suggestions.  </P> <P> WILLIAM H. KOBIN, President and CEO, KCET, Los Angeles  </P></p>

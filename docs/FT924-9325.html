			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Romania may slow reforms Romania's incoming prime minister called yesterday for slower economic reforms, Reuter reports from Bucharest. Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, who was asked by president Ion Iliescu on Wednesday to form Romania's new government, is known for opposing the policy of shock price liberalisation which formed part of Romania's ambitious market economy reforms. He proposed a gradual three-year alternative instead.</p>

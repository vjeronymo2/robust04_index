			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa today met Libya's envoy  to the Arab League, Ibrahim al-Bishari.    Afterward, al-Bishari stated that they discussed bilateral  relations and Arab and international issues of common interest  within the framework of the excellent ties between Egypt and  Libya.    On the Libyan-Western crisis, al-Bishari said Libya regrets  the Security Council's renewal of the unfair sanctions imposed  on it in accordance with Resolution 748.    The Libyan envoy added that the Arab League is undertaking  an  Arab initiative based on the resolution issued at the last  meeting of the Arab League Council. He said that if this  initiative is accepted, it will lead to a response to Security  Council Resolution 731, will satisfy the judicial cooperation  involving all the parties, will protect the rights of everyone,  including the Western countries, and will protect Libya's right  and sovereignty.    He noted that the initiative calls for the trial of the  defendants in accordance with Scottish law and before a Scottish  court sitting in the International Court of Justice. He said:  We have not yet heard the West's official view of this  proposal. He expressed the hope that this proposal would be  taken seriously and objectively because it would be a way out  for everyone. He said the Arab League secretary general has  conveyed the Arab initiative to the ambassadors of the three  Western countries.</p>

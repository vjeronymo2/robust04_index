			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> COLD-HEARTED 'CROSSING'  </P> <P> "What's the rumpus?" is the byword among "Miller's Crossing's" Jazz Age  mobsters. What is the rumpus, anyway, about this elegiac, stylish gangster  movie (throughout San Diego County), the third feature from the brothers Coen?  </P> <P> The Coens -- Joel directs, Ethan produces, they write together -- love old  movies. "Blood Simple" was their Hitchcock, their stark little black film, its  tongue very slightly in its cheek. It put them on the map. "Raising Arizona"  was their stupefyingly madcap comedy, and for all those to whom it gave  blinding headaches, it also introduced Holly Hunter, fair return for a few  aspirins.  </P> <P> With "Miller's Crossing," the Coens have turned to what they call the  "dirty-town movie" of the '20s, full of casually violent gangster bosses,  dangerous dames and ruthlessly tamped-down dialogue.  </P> <P> It's a jump for them, in control and accomplishment, yet when you get past the  luscious look of the piece and the roiling sound of its talk, it's a chilly  film and foolishly light in the upper story.  </P> <P> The Coens' love for the movies of the past is respectful in a clinical, remote  way, as though films were museum-quality clocks, not pulsing, soulful things,  warm and even inconveniently messy at times. Self-conscious formalism has been  the Coens' signature. Before, when they've assembled their clockwork films,  those movies -- for all their puddling blood or wacko action -- have been cool  and smooth as plastic.  </P> <P> "Miller's Crossing" certainly isn't plastic. It's dark and hushed as a men's  club; it almost smells of polished leather and pricey cigars. When it isn't  indoors, it's in arching, cathedral-like woods. It has somber, poetic images  and an especially fine musical score that braids its Irish themes together  hauntingly.  </P> <P> Best of all, it has Albert Finney in a grand turn as Leo, the watchful Irish  gangster boss. There is something about the sight of Finney, alone, at night  and on the offensive, his cigar stub jammed into his dressing gown pocket, his  crested slippers on his bare feet, his Thompson machine gun spitting sparks  into the dark, that is breathtaking -- as filmmaking and as characterization.  </P> <P> At Leo's right hand is Gabriel Byrne as the inscrutable Tommy, the most savvy  lieutenant a boss could want except for his lousy luck at gambling and his  invariable success with the ladies -- currently Verna, the lady of Leo's heart  (Marcia Gay Harden). As Verna's brother, Bernie Bernbaum, there is John  Turturro at his peak of smarmy perfection as a weasel only a sister could love,  and you worry a little about her.  </P> <P> Yet anything this stylish should have something to say, and "Miller's Crossing"  is a declaration of serious but not altogether fathomable intentions. And  unfortunately for a movie about friendship and loyalty, its diversions aren't  enough to melt its cold, cold heart.  </P> <P> Heart may be what the movie needs most, but a bit of clarity wouldn't hurt  either. Even here in gangsterland, where random characters are cherished and  non sequiturs are considered wisecracks, there is a difference between  complications and impenetrability, and this plot is a bloody thicket.  </P> <P> Broadly, the story revolves around Leo, Tommy and Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito).  Caspar, the token Italian mobster, opens the film begging Leo for the right to  kill Bernie, a bookie whom he calls "the schmatta" -- Yiddish for rag. Seems  every time Caspar fixes a fight, Bernie screws the odds, making the fix almost  pointless.  </P> <P> But Leo won't fork over Bernie, partly because he won't be muscled, partly  because Bernie is Verna's brother, and Leo's besotted with Verna. There is also  the indelicate matter of Tommy and Verna, and Tommy, of course, is too  honorable -- or too something -- to hide that forever. In the full-scale  warfare that ensues, Tommy leaves Leo's side to go over to a rival and Leo  disappears from the screen, leaving a hole the size of Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> Byrne's Tommy remains at the center of things, the movie's iceman. He's  supposed to be the ultimate loner, his brain whirring faster than everyone  else's, his eyes shaded by that heavily symbolic hat. Byrne's beaky, promising  face can hold us, but not forever. He's an opaque actor playing  impenetrability, and it's possible to get tired of peering behind his  remoteness for a glimpse at whatever's supposed to be inside.  </P> <P> It's one of the movie's heavy jokes that Tommy is sapped, kicked, gut-punched,  choked, thrown down three flights of stairs and beaten almost into  insensibility, only to bounce back in the next scene, unscathed. With this  ongoing insider joke, the Coens have their laugh but lose their audience.  </P></p>

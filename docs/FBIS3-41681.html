			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Bespalov, Rostov oblast] </F>   [Text] A panic has gripped the Rostovites recently due to  the rumors of an impending infection.    Through local press, the Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight  authorities are constantly expanding the ``assortment'' of the  infection threatening the health and life of the citizens of  Don. Izvestiya have already reported an outbreak of  Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Reports are being received from  Neklinovskiy, Myasnikovskiy, and Matveyevo-Kurganskiy rayons  about large-scale infection of tularemia--a very serious disease  transmitted by rodents and mosquitoes.    More than 150 patients have already been recorded. In the  last several days, 11 children in Rostov have been infected with  salmonellosis. And finally, the last alarm signal was sounded  about diphtheria. Last year, this disease afflicted 93 persons  in Rostov oblast, three of whom have already died. This summer,  the incidence of diphtheria in Rostov's Voroshilovskiy borough  alone increased by sixfold.    ``Why did this new misfortune befall us?'' say poor  Rostovites shaking their heads. Some especially nervous citizens  are already hinting about ``splitting'' to some safe location  for a month or two.    Most likely, this infection phobia is being hyped by the  reports which for the past two weeks have continued to appear on  the pages of Rostov newspapers. What is interesting is that  nothing like that happened before--during censorship, the press  was strictly warned ``not to hype horrors.'' And I have been  told that today, frequent information about danger is only one  of the elements of public concerns about health and vigilance  which cannot hurt in today's situation.    Thus, there is no reason for panic--the best thing would be  to get immunized. Yet in expert estimates, if there is a threat  of a tularemia and diphtheria epidemic, more than 80% of  the  oblast residents must undergo this procedure. The local  authorities developed a mass population immunization program,  and resources were allocated to the public health administration  for purchasing the necessary immunization preparations. And a  simple precaution could not hurt.</p>

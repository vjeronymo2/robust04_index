			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LOUISIANA;  </P> <P> EX-KLAN LEADER TO RUN FOR U.S. SENATE  </P> <P> Republican state Rep. David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan,  said that he will seek the U.S. Senate seat of J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.). The  Louisiana GOP plans to endorse a candidate Jan. 12, but Duke said that he  probably will run even if he is not the party's choice. He joins a field of two  other Republicans who are seeking Johnston's seat. Duke, who in the past has  been associated with the far-right Populist Party, disavowed his racist beliefs  when he was sworn in as a state representative. Since leaving the klan in the  1970s, he has headed the National Assn. of White People, which he says promotes  "equal rights for everyone."  </P></p>

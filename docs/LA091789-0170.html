			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN FALLS APART LATE, 26-10;  </P> <P> KINGSMEN TRAIL BY TWO IN FOURTH QUARTER BUT ST. MARY'S PULLS AWAY  </P> <P> While most of the St. Mary's players gathered in the middle of the field,  celebrating a 26-10 victory over Cal Lutheran, another handful of players stood  anxiously outside the Gaels' locker room and watched quarterback Tim Rosenkranz  being strapped onto a stretcher and loaded into a waiting ambulance.  </P> <P> It might have been a Pyrrhic victory for St. Mary's (2-1). Rosenkranz, the  active career passing-yardage leader in Division II, left the game midway  through the second quarter because of a back injury with the Gaels leading,  6-3. The injury was diagnosed as a back strain and Rosenkranz was later  released from the hospital. His playing status is uncertain.  </P> <P> Rosenkranz's replacement, freshman Kevin Lemmo, had never thrown a pass in  collegiate football but threw for 111 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> "The first pass the left-hander threw kind of surprised everybody," Cal  Lutheran Coach Bob Shoup said of Lemmo's initial effort, a 10-yard completion  to wide receiver Lee Dongallo. "We didn't know he was left-handed. That's  something we hadn't practiced on. We made some mistakes in coverage."  </P> <P> Lemmo didn't show quite the elan of Rosenkranz, who completed 12 of 14 passes.  With St. Mary's leading, 6-3, in the third quarter, Lemmo fumbled on a blitz  and the ball popped out of his hands to Cal Lutheran linebacker Alonzo  Williams.  </P> <P> Williams galloped 60 yards for a touchdown, but Cal Lutheran (0-2) snatched  defeat from the jaws of victory with a defensive-holding penalty that not only  nullified the play but awarded St. Mary's 10 yards. The Gaels scored three  plays later.  </P> <P> "It was the big play," Shoup said. "With it, we're going with momentum into the  fourth quarter and a lead, and I think we would have blown the ballgame open.  That's about as dramatic a turnaround as you can get."  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran closed the gap with five minutes to play. Quarterback Dan  Nagelmann rolled right and found fullback Dan Smeester with a two-yard  touchdown pass. Trailing only 12-10, the Kingsmen stiffened on defense, and the  offense attempted to mount a game-winning drive with 4:25 remaining.  </P> <P> On the first play, however, Nagelmann overthrew tight end David Deisinger over  the middle, and defensive back Miles Freeman intercepted, returning the ball to  the Cal Lutheran seven.  </P> <P> "Instead of trying to loft it, I just zipped it," said Nagelmann, making his  first start for Cal Lutheran.  </P> <P> The Gaels scored three plays later.  </P> <P> "We've just got to learn to straighten it up when they get that kind of break,"  said linebacker Scott Schultz, who led the Kingsmen with 12 tackles. "We still  could have won."  </P> <P> St. Mary's scored its final touchdown after Cal Lutheran reserve quarterback  Tim Zeddies fumbled at his 30.  </P> <P> Running back Jeff Lapinski shredded the St. Mary's defense with 71 first-half  yards but suffered a slight concussion and rushed only twice in the second  half.  </P> <P> Dean Henderson then picked up the load, gaining 60 yards in 12 second-half  carries, but, despite netting 140 yards with a fairly proficient rushing  attack, Cal Lutheran couldn't put points on the board. Three lost fumbles, one  interception and an anemic 0 for 6 on third-down conversion attempts, kept the  Kingsmen stymied.  </P> <P> "We've got to get off scoring one touchdown a game if we're going to win  against this level of competition," Shoup said. "We still play a little  tentative on offense, like we're almost there."  </P> <P> Linebacker Bobby Crume led the St. Mary's defense with 12 tackles and he had  two fumble recoveries and a sack.  </P></p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 6.3% in a difficult week THE Nikkei average fell to a new low for the year as investors sold ahead of the government's emergency meeting to discuss support measures for the market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index fell 542.15 to 15,497.79, down 6.3 per cent on the week, on arbitrage unwinding and index-linked selling. The index opened at the day's high of 16,014.55 and fell to the day's low of 15,490.57 by mid-morning. Volume fell from 237m shares to 200m. Declines led advances by 737 to 219, with 152 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 23.27 to 1,204.55 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 6.68 to 933.49. Speculation that the government will decide on a Y6,000bn supplementary budget to boost the economy disappointed market participants, as this had already been suggested by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Share prices fell as discouraged dealers and investment trusts sold out. Market participants remained sceptical about the success of the emergency measures in supporting the market. 'The possibility of the government's plan attracting new buyers into the market is very low,' said Mr Kaoru Shimura, head of pension fund management at Sumitomo Life. However, Mr Yasuo Ueki, head of equity trading at Nikko Securities, said that yesterday's decline indicated that the disappointment had now been discounted. 'An unexpected proposal will be a positive factor, while there will be no negative effects on the markets even if the proposals are not new,' he said. Persistent worries about the troubled real estate business depressed banks, realtors and contractors. Mitsubishi Bank lost Y50 to Y1,610 and Sumitomo Bank fell Y60 to Y1,260. Nippon Housing Loan, the troubled housing loan company, fell for the seventh consecutive day, losing Y13 to a record low of Y172. Mitsui Fudosan, the leading real estate company, fell Y25 to Y720, while Daikyo, the condominium developer, declined Y60 to Y621. Electricals were weak on fears of downward revisions. Investors now reckon that since the economy is unlikely to rebound, originally expected this autumn, earnings forecasts at the electronics companies are too bullish. Hitachi lost Y5 to Y745 and Sony fell Y140 to Y3,850. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 250.91 to 17,940.03 in volume of 24m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed. Brokers in Bombay boycotted trading on fears that more brokers' assets might be seized by the government. HONG KONG fell in afternoon trade, the Hang Seng index slidding 144.40 or 2.44 per cent to 5,772.76 in turnover of HKDollars 3.35bn. The index has lost 5.7 per cent on the week. Banks lost ground with HSBC Holdings down HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 54. SEOUL gained ground in low turnover. The composite index put on 3.46 to 521.99 for a week's rise of 1.5 per cent. Turnover fell to Won153.65bn from Won170.52bn. Gainers outpaced losers 435 to 250 with 157 unchanged. TAIWAN finished higher in spite of a weak opening. The weighted index closed up 43.29 at 4,022.16 but was down 6 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to TDollars 26bn from TDollars 30.35bn. MANILA slipped as profits were taken in oil stocks. The composite index shed 7.37 to 1,463.39 but was 1 per cent higher over the week. Gainers outnumbered losers 21 to 14 in combined turnover of 252m pesos. SINGAPORE fell sharply with the Straits Times index down 23.34 to 1,401.31, a fall of 3.4 per cent on the week. Shipyard stocks continued to be weak with Jurong Shipyard down 45 cents at SDollars 8.05. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index shed 8.71 to 593.53, a 2 per cent drop on the week.</p>

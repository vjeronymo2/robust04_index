			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (9): EC warning causes concern - The ailing steel industry THERE is an air of resignation in Prague following the latest bout of sabre-rattling between Washington and the European Community over steel subsidies and recent EC warnings against 'excessive' steel exports and dumping by east European producers. Officials know that as a small producer, the Czech Republic can do little to arrest the wave of protectionist sentiment in the west. Mr Vladimir Dlouhi, trade and industry minister, dismisses the EC charges as unfounded. 'There is no dumping. There are no direct subsidies to steel mills, and practically no indirect subsidies.' He says if the EC really wants to help eastern Europe, it should open its markets rather than erect protectionist barriers. Mr Vladimir Petr, director for steel at the industry ministry, takes a more conciliatory line. 'We will do what is agreed, and we're talking to our companies to make sure they behave themselves.' In the meantime, he says, Czech steel makers will look for new markets elsewhere. But there is no masking the disappointment with the EC over its threats against a domestic industry that is already in the throes of a crisis and whose restructuring will cause many job losses. The drive for modernisation and higher productivity is expected to see employment in the steel industry fall from around 85,000 today to 45,000 by 2000. Much of the burden of job losses will fall on the north-eastern region of Ostrava near the Polish border which is home to the Czech Republic's three biggest steel plants, Mr Petr says. To add to the uncertainty, new agreements with the EC will have to be drawn up separately with the Czech Republic and Slovakia following the break-up of the former Czechoslovak state on January 1. Czech and Slovak producers are operating on the basis of agreements drawn up between the EC and Czechoslovakia in 1990/91 with quotas for this year expected to remain at their 1992 levels. This allowed for exports to the EC of 1.1m tonnes of rolled products annually, and 60,000 tonnes a year of steel pipes. Officials admit exports of rolled steel to the Community have doubled since 1990 when they totalled 783,300 tonnes compared to 1.5m tonnes last year, but they say this had nothing to do with dumping. Czechoslovak producers faced with the collapse of markets in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, a sharp decline in domestic consumption, and a freeze on the domestic arms industry imposed after Czechoslovakia's 'velvet revolution' in 1989, looked to western Europe for markets. They were competitive because production costs are about 30 per cent lower than in the EC, Mr Petr says. 'Wages and transport costs are low and we have cheap iron ore from the Ukraine, but this will not last and the next three or four years are going to be difficult.' Officials say the Community also conveniently overlooked that Czechoslovakia exported steel to the former East Germany when setting the quotas. This gives no comfort to companies already struggling to survive such as the giant Poldi United Steel Works in Kladno, some 30km west of Prague. In February, the company appealed for urgent financial help from the government to overcome a serious financial crisis that had already forced it to temporarily close down two of its plants. During the past two years, Poldi has cut its workforce by half to around 10,000 workers, with another 3,000 jobs due to go this year. Poldi's troubles came to a head following the state-owned electricity utility's decision to sharply reduce power supplies to the company which it said owed it CzK260m. Poldi has debts of CzK5.1bn, but it is also owed almost CzK3bn in unpaid bills from more than 200 customers including some of the largest Czech companies. To overcome this debilitating circle of bad debt, it wants the government to inject CzK1bn into the company and to allow it to raise another CzK1bn through the sale of real estate assets. A resumption of economic growth after the past two years' sharp fall in output would help, but it will be a long and painful haul until the Czech steel industry recovers. Total steel production in the former Czcheslovakia has fallen by 20 per cent from 14.9m tonnes in 1990 to below 12m tonnes last year, according to the latest estimates, and it is set to continue to fall. Long-term prospects for the industry will depend on the success of restructuring as well as on access to markets. A study commissioned by the government and completed last June favours privatising all the Czech Republic's steel industry with the larger companies to be split up into smaller units to make them more attractive to foreign investors. As a first step towards privatisation, 11 companies have been turned into joint stock companies for which the government is hoping to find foreign partners for joint ventures. What the government would like is to repeat the successful sale last month of a wheel-making subsidiary of Nova Hut, the large steel and metallurgical group, to Hayes Wheels International of the US. The company makes about 1.5m car wheels annually, but under the agreement with Hayes, production will be raised to 11.5m wheels a year with supplies going to leading car manufacturers in Europe including General Motors, Volkswagen, Renault and Mercedes. As part of the restructuring plan, Czech steel production will be lowered from last year's 7m tonnes to 5.5m tonnes a year by 2000. The aim is to raise productivity and improve quality while reducing energy and raw materials consumption. This will help to save resources as well as maintain the competitiveness of local industry as labour and other production costs rise. Three large projects include construction of a new rolling mill in Vitkovice and of a mini-mill for Nova Hut, each with an 800,000 tonnes a year production capacity; and another mini-mill in Trinec to produce cables. Total investment for the three projects will be CzK12.9bn spread over four years. 'All of these priority actions should give a good return on the capital invested,' Mr Petr says.</p>

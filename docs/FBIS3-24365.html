Mezova: "Ilyas Bechelov: </F> I See in Today's Parliament Elements of Reforming the  Representative Authority"]    [Text] Ilyas Bechelov is a colonel in the internal  service, former chief of the Corrective Affairs and Social  Rehabilitation Service, and chairman of the Legislative  Commission of the former KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] VS  [Supreme Soviet]. He is a graduate of the School of Physics and  Mathematics, KBGU [Kabardino-Balkaria State University] and the  USSR MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Academy. At the December  election he once again became a deputy to the Council of the  Republic of the KBR Parliament and once again headed the same  commission -- the Commission on Legislation, Law and Order,  Security, and Human Rights. He is married, and has a son and two  daughters.    [Mezova] Ilyas Borisovich, why, after serving twenty years  in  the MVD system, did you decide to run for election, first to the  Supreme Soviet, and then to the KBR Parliament?    [Bechelov] For me it was a complete surprise when, in 1991,  people from my home town in Kamenka came to me and suggested  that they nominate me as a candidate for election to the Supreme  Soviet. I must confess that many people advised me not to run,  saying that an MVD worker would not be elected, especially since  there were more popular candidates, including farm managers.  Nevertheless I agreed and, to my surprise, I won. It may be that  something that played a role was the fact that I had grown up in  Kamenka and had gone to school there. I have a lot of friends in  the district: Balkarians, Karbadinians, Russians...    [Mezova] In December of last year you decided to run for  election again. Does that mean that you didn't really like the  work of making laws?    [Bechelov] At first I did not want to run again, and I even  took a job at the Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral Commission].  In general, I was planning to return to the MVD. After all, it  is specific work that I was accustomed to. Once again the voters  began arriving. My current electoral district is big, and is  absorbing a large number of populated places: Bulungu,  Khushto-Syrt, Nizhniy Chegem, Yanikoy, Lechinka, Kamenka... I  was nominated by the collective at the Sovkhoz imeni  Baysultanov, and the voters -- and I am tremendously grateful to  them for this --supported me again.    [Mezova] But certainly it must not have been such a simple  thing, after the MVD, to engage -- and successfully -- in the  work of creating legislation.    [Bechelov] Definitely... There is a big difference in the  nature of the work. At first I was greatly tormented by all that  paperwork. I was not accustomed to that kind of monotonous,  painstaking work. However, I adjusted to it gradually and have  even learned to enjoy it.    [Mezova] But how do you sense the difference in the  activities of the former Supreme Soviet and the present Council  of the Republic, which is operating on a professional basis?    [Bechelov] Here too there is a substantial difference. The  work at the Council of the Republic is proceeding, in my  opinion, in a time-responsive and efficient manner. We literally  "chewed up" our Provisional Rules, for example, since we worked  so carefully on them. We passed them in two readings. Of course,  the working commission responsible for developing and modifying  that vast document also worked scrupulously. The document is  ready for publication. On the insistence of Yuriy Mairov,  Chairman of the KBR Constitutional Court, we thoroughly wrote  out the procedure for reviewing the budget and included it in  the Rules.    [Mezova] Was the budget under joint jurisdiction from the  very beginning?    [Bechelov] Yes. Its initial review was our responsibility.    [Mezova] Is there a difference between the initial and  secondary discussions?    [Bechelov] The difference is contained in the names  themselves. We are the first to review the document. The  Representatives' Council accepts our recommendations and  comments and, after discussion, submits the document for joint  review.    [Mezova] Are you satisfied with the powers that have been  assigned to the Council of the Republic?    [Bechelov] The question of powers was resolved in a  constitutional and, in my opinion, completely satisfactory  manner. We shared with the Representatives' Council the question  of confidence or lack of confidence in the government, and the  Representatives' Council, in its turn, shared with us the  question of reviewing the budget. It is completely logical that  such important questions have to be reviewed jointly. I also  consider it to be correct that a large number of other questions  are also under joint jurisdiction. In that way they will be  developed more efficiently. It would scarcely seem to be  desirable to transfer just to the Council of the Republic all  the questions that the Supreme Soviet used to engage in.    [Mezova] What other differences do you think exist between  the present Parliament and the former KBR VS?    [Bechelov] Primarily there has been a change in the  functions  and the structure. There is no Presidium, that narrow group of  people that used to decide many very important questions,  including those dealing with personnel. In order to resolve  specifically the joint questions and to define the agenda of the  joint sessions, the Coordination Council was created. In today's  Parliament I see, to a certain extent, elements of reforming the  representative authority.    [Mezova] Could we dwell more concretely on those elements?    [Bechelov] First of all, there is the two-house system, the  beginning of the formation of a professional parliament, albeit  by way of one house. Today the Parliament will resolve questions  of an interethnic nature through a committee that was specially  created for that purpose; the procedure for reviewing and making  decisions dealing with those questions has already been firmly  established in the Constitution.    [Mezova] What can you say about the makeup of the Council of  the Republic?    [Bechelov] It seems to me that, on the whole, the deputies  to  that house are rather competent and are capable resolving any  questions. They have a sufficient amount both of professional  and everyday experience, and the necessary logic for thinking  things out. I do not see in our house any people who are  extremist in their views, but all of them are rather  independent. There are many young people, and I like to work  with them: they are restrained and knowledgeable people. The  makeup of the house is rather varied. Many people have left  their jobs and have taken up the professional work of creating  legislation. I am convinced that, in a year, the Council of the  Republic will be asserting itself in a loud voice.    [Mezova] Do you foresee the formation of factions and blocs  in the Council of the Republic?    [Bechelov] Most of the deputies, it seems to me, adhere to  centrist views. Possible blocs based on nationality are absorbed  by the Committee on Interethnic Relations.    [Mezova] What will your commission, which is one of the  leading ones in the house, engage in?    [Bechelov] There is no need to offend the other commissions,  each of which is the base commission in its field for the  creation of legislation. Naturally, we shall create laws,  conduct parliamentary hearings and audits, take active part in  developing RF [Russian Federation] legislative acts, and give  our findings on drafts that are prepared by other commissions.    [Mezova] Am I correct in thinking that your commission needs  professionals more than any other one does?    [Bechelov] The makeup of the commission is rather good, and  professionally trained. In addition to me there are Khazan  Shorov, a jurist and militia lieutenant-colonel; Zamir  Shibzukhov, investigator from the Urvanskiy procurator's office;  Khazanbi Shogenov, criminal-affairs procurator from the KBR  procurator's office; Vitaliy Protasov, retired colonel; and  Robert Zhurtov, economist, correspondence-course student at the  KBGU Law School.    [Mezova] At the beginning of our conversation you mentioned  in passing what a few people have been asserting: that an MVD  worker would not be elected. But in the present Parliament MVD  workers have occupied what I think is a rather solid position.  Do you think that this attests to the fact that the population's  attitude toward your associates is changing?    [Bechelov] Yes, there are six of us in the makeup of the  present Parliament. I must say that Khusey Eneyev, Yuriy Kokov,  Khasan Shorov, Boris Kerefov, and Adalbi Shkhagoshev are not  only real professionals, but are also people whose reputations  are completely unsullied. Yes, I am convinced that people's idea  of the MVD is changing. Also, it is obvious that the crime  problem that is engulfing us must be resolved. And, finally,  this fact attests to people's confidence and high evaluation,  and this must be perceived as an advance.    [Mezova] Are you satisfied with the house's Provisional  Rules?    [Bechelov] In my opinion, there have been definite  achievements. The most important questions will be decided by  secret voting. The house's work is carried out in three state  languages. A question that has caused long disputes is the  question of keeping an account of the work performed by the  deputy. A new section on parliamentary hearings provides  considerable rights to the commissions for reviewing various  important questions. For the first time the Provisional Rules  deal with the procedure for holding sessions, and define the  spring and autumn sessions and the summer and winter  parliamentary vacations.    [Mezova] Almost two vacations? Isn't that too lavish?    [Bechelov] That is how it is done throughout the civilized  world. And the same thing is stated in the Russian rules. The  work days have been defined: Monday and Tuesday in the permanent  commissions; Wednesday and Thursday, house sessions; and on  Friday the deputies work in the districts. We have also planned  that on Thursdays, for one hour,nd that the members of the  government will reply to the deputies' oral or written questions.    [Mezova] Do you think that, in the new Parliament, the  status  of deputy has risen, or has fallen?    [Bechelov] I think that it has risen. First of all, a  professional house has appeared. That is on the whole. This is  attested to by the procedure for reviewing questions at the  sessions, and by the parliamentary hearings...    [Mezova] What are the tasks that are confronting the house  in  the near future?    [Bechelov] Our commission has defined a working group to  develop drafts about local self-government. Other groups have  been created: a group to prepare the publication of the KBR  Constitution (Basic Law) with a consideration of the amendments  and additions that have been made; and a group to develop the  Rules for the joint sessions of the two houses. Things are also  proceeding in the same way in the other commissions. In general,  the ice has been broken, and our speaker was right when he said  in an interview that the house has taken the direct line in  creating legislation.    [Mezova] Is there anything that you would like to convey to  your constituents and the readers of our newspaper?    [Bechelov] Almost all the deputies, in their pre-election  statements, mentioned the need to preserve peace and stability  in the republic. I would hope that everyone will remember that  and will apply all his efforts to assure that our nation lives  in tranquility.</p>

			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: Witness to a cool Shavian triumph - Saint Joan, George Bernard Shaw's powerful drama With Saint Joan George Bernard Shaw wrote a play that requires a charismatic heroine, but plugs her in only at certain points. It is not, strictly speaking, a star vehicle, and if played like one it usually founders; Shaw had other fish to fry. At the Strand Theatre, the director Gale Edwards (Australian, female) has got the balance exactly right. It stirs mind and heart alike, and if you have intelligent teenage children you should take them along to be stirred as well. Few modern 'classics' command our thoughtful sympathies like Saint Joan, and still fewer productions do them such faithful justice. The play is not really about 'Jeanne la Pucelle', but about the almost-accidental role she played in a larger, much tougher world of politics and religion, of which she understood nothing. In fact Saint Joan represents a disillusioned, retrospective, 1920s view of History as Realpolitik. The heroine is there to fascinate us, but the heart of the drama - and it is drama, not just Shavian sparring - lies in the different ways she is perceived and used by the political masters, both the French (Burgundian) and the English. All Joan has to do is to be, while the real action stretches out around and beyond her. In the small person of Imogen Stubbs, she is a marvel of bright-eyed energy, from her first bounding entrance. Distinctly elfin, in fact, with balletic touches, and much more gamine than gamin; one remembered Joan Plowright's homely, no-nonsense activist (a long way back]) with some nostalgia. But Miss Stubbs wields a big, tremulous voice with the best of them, and regularly catches us between the ribs. Perhaps she could measure a greater distance between eager optimism at the start, and weary desolation at the end. Those Audrey Hepburn eyes do not change much, and there was an awkward moment when she collapsed to the floor in despair, too obviously confident of succour by strong arms - which she duly got. As a butterfly broken on a wheel, nevertheless, she is a radiant creature. The production has stark sets by Peter J. Davison, basically vertical slabs that just once open out to give us a fine side-chapel view of the Dauphin's coronation in Reims Cathedral. (Reims, by the way, is sometimes Reims and sometimes 'Reems', even in the mouths of different French personnel.) That is all to the good: picturesque ramparts are not what the play needs. What it chiefly needs is a solid team of politicos, both temporal and spiritual; and these Miss Edwards has supplied in full measure. Faced with pages of Shavian debate, many a director equips his or her actors with a rich variety of tics to sugar the pill. Not Miss Edwards; instead, she makes the debates supply the characters - the variously foxy or temporising Frenchmen, the blunt or choleric English. We listen hard. I particularly admired Bruce Purchase's virtuosity with the Archbishop's speeches, which he rattles off quite lucidly at high speed, thus saving vital minutes. There is a good Dunois from Philip Quast, and a properly sullen Cauchon from Paul Webster. Highest praise, though, for Peter Jeffrey's Inquisitor and Ken Bones' Earl of Warwick, both of them revelling in pawky subtleties. Jeffrey is a gentle model of temperate, deadly reasonableness; Bones - with a startling likeness to Norman Tebbit - plays Warwick with an air of cheerful ruthlessness, letting his weary, cynical intelligence peep through as the situation develops. There is just a trace of pain, and distaste, when the execution has to be got through. Jasper Britton's artful Dauphin supplies more than comic relief. There is a twitch or two too many, but his petulance is genuine and sour. As young Brother Martin, appalled at seeing the trap close, Nicholas Rowe conveys strength as well as a tender heart. In the epilogue, Gordon Langford Rowe is splendidly unbuttoned as the plain English Soldier. Among others too numerous to mention, there is no weak link. As Warwick's testy chaplain, de Stogumber, David Daker for once makes the real voice of Bernard Shaw heard. A plain, thick Englishman, he fulminates and blusters vengefully, but when the chips go down he is overcome with simple horror. In his empirical English way, he needs to see what a burning at the stake means; but having seen it, his revulsion is absolute. A real vegetarian's argument, that: amid all the thrust and counter-thrust which Shaw mimics with such relish, this is where the stopper comes, the final NO. Shaw was not a cynic.</p>

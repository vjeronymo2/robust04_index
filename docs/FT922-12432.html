			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Confused by credit CONSUMERS wanting a reliable yardstick for the cost of credit need something better to guide them than the present annual percentage rate (APR) calculation offered by lenders. So says Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association. Eaglesham claims that APRs can sometimes be highly misleading and that few consumers really understand them. Only 15 per cent of adults in a 1989 survey knew accurately what an APR is, though a further 15 per cent had a vague idea. But nearly half of all credit users said that they took APRs into account when assessing an offer of credit. Eaglesham says that the Department of Trade and Industry, which is proposing ways of making consumers more aware of the risks of borrowing too much, ought instead to be finding better ways of comparing deals. Calculating APRs has always been a complex task which can be performed only by specialists, but the operation has become even less straightforward now because many financial services products - for example, credit cards - combine fixed annual fees with interest payments, while the amount borrowed varies. So, for example, although Barclaycard Visa's annual charge and interest rate are both lower than those of Lloyds Access, its APR of 27.8 per cent is 1 per cent higher than the Lloyds Access APR. Why the difference? The two banks have assumed different amounts of borrowing. Eaglesham points out that because the cost of the interest-free period for credit card users was not taken into account for the APR, the card issuers have been able to push up the real interest they charge borrowers by quietly scrapping this allowance. If you are taking out a fixed-rate mortgage, you will probably have discovered that the nominal rate is a better guide to the monthly payments you will actually have to make than the published APR. A more fundamental problem with mortgages is that the costs of any repayment vehicle, such as a personal equity plan or an endowment policy, are not included. Eaglesham calculates that on a Pounds 50,000 mortgage for a couple both aged 40, a pension mortgage adds 3 per cent to the APR and a low-cost endowment 2 per cent. Mortgage indemnity policies, compulsory for some borrowers, are also not included. So what could be done? Eaglesham has several suggestions. She wants APRs applied to current account overdraft borrowing (something for which retail groups have long been pressing). She wants a standard set of assumptions for each particular type of credit (eg, credit cards), the automatic inclusion of compulsory costs, and dual APRs to reflect the difference of any optional costs. She also suggests that some consumers might find it easier if the APR was expressed as cash and labelled 'true cost.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, many times in-bond violations are discovered when carriers come forward and disclose the violations to Customs. In order to encourage this behavior, new guidelines have been promulgated to permit mitigation to as low as $25 per entry when the in-bond carrier brings such violations to Customs attention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Occasionally, the merchandise which is not properly delivered or is delivered short is, in fact, restricted merchandise. In those instances, mitigation guidelines based upon a loss of revenue do not take into account the possible inadmissibility of the merchandise. Accordingly, the guidelines are amended to specifically address these situations. Where the principal or surety can show that entry was made, duties were paid and the merchandise was found to be admissible, the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount between $100 and $1,000, consistent with guidelines for admissible merchandise; however, in those instances where the bond principal cannot show that entry was made, duties were paid and the merchandise was found to be admissible, the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of an amount equal to the duties plus an amount between 25 and 50 percent of the value of the merchandise, but not less than $250.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the in-bond guidelines are amended to permit use of the Option 1 mitigation procedures when the violation involves the late delivery of in-bond merchandise or the late delivery of in-bond documents to Customs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Changes to Section IV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV of the bond cancellation standards includes guidelines for cancellation of claims arising from failure to redeliver merchandise to Customs custody. An anomalous situation results under current guidelines for cancellation of claims for failing to mark merchandise with the country of origin (as required by the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1304) when the merchandise is not marked and liquidation of the entry has become final, which would preclude Customs from assessing marking duties. Pursuant to current guidelines, if liquidation is final, thereby barring the assessment of marking duties, claims are cancelled upon payment of an amount equal to no less than 50 percent of the value. This places the bond principal whose entry has been liquidated and such liquidation has become final at a mitigation disadvantage compared to the bond principal whose entry has not been liquidated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The latter principal, if a first-time violator, would receive mitigation to an amount between 10 and 25 percent of the value of the merchandise, after marking duties have been deposited. This would leave this principal with an ultimate liability, combining the payment of marking duties and the bond charge cancellation amount, of between 20 and 35 percent of the value of the shipment. Rather than further penalize the principal whose entry has been liquidated and such liquidation has become final, Customs is amending the guidelines to provide for mitigation to an amount between 20 and 35 percent of the value of the merchandise for the first-time violator whose entry has been liquidated and such liquidation has become final and to an amount between 35 and 60 percent of the value of the merchandise to the subsequent violator whose entry has been liquidated and such liquidation has become final, thereby barring the assessment of marking duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidelines are amended to add a section dealing with cancellation of bond claims that arise from failing to redeliver merchandise that is marked with a false designation of origin in violation of the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 1124 and 1125. These guidelines, designated as a new paragraph F provide for mitigation less generous than that afforded violations involving failing to mark merchandise with the country of origin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidelines for cancellation of claims for violation of other Customs statutes and regulations permit cancellation of claims incurred by first-time violators upon payment of an amount between one and five percent of the value of the merchandise. This guideline does not provide Customs with sufficient mitigation flexibility. Accordingly, Customs amends the guidelines to permit cancellation of claims incurred by first-time violators upon payment of an amount between one and fifteen percent of the value of the merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new guideline has been formulated for cases that involve failure to provide a sample to Customs. Under current guidelines, if an importer fails to provide a sample and liquidated damages result, the importer will receive mitigation in the one to five percent range because this is considered to be a violation of other Customs statutes or regulations. If an importer has a violative shipment, and a sample will serve to provide evidence of the shipment's inadmissibility, the importer could benefit in mitigation from failing to provide that sample. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

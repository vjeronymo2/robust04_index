			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Privatizations Will Entail the Loss </F> of 800,000 Jobs"]    [Text] Milan -- Privatizations in Europe might entail the  loss of over 800,000 jobs by the end of 1998. This is one of  the main conclusions reached by six major European research  institutes, including the Italian institute "Prometeia," in a  report on economic prospects in the Old World. The research  centers -- part of the Ereco network -- surveyed over 120  businesses in the European Union and EFTA (European Free Trade  Association) countries, employing 3.5 million people overall,  and destined to be put up for sale on the market within the next  few years. Over one-fifth of the workforce currently employed  in these businesses will lose its jobs as a result of increased  competition in Europe. The hardest-hit countries will be France  (290,000 jobs lost), Italy (180,000 jobs lost), and Germany,  where future job losses are estimated at 140,000.</p>

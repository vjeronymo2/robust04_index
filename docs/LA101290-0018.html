			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEARCH FOR AMERICA LEADS HIM ABROAD  </P> <P> Re "Crime Fears Cramp New Yorkers' Style" (Sept. 16): It's not the city. It's  the nation. New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago -- over the years the  nation has grown mean, and, by extension, (so have) its people.  </P> <P> I'm 55 years old, part American Indian. This is my country. I spent 15 years in  the civil rights movement. I caught a freedom bus in 1960 and went to look for  America. Meridian, Birmingham, Jackson, Chicago in '68 -- this wasn't the  America I read about.  </P> <P> And it has grown worse. Children starve, old people have no dignity. No food.  No homes. Next month, I'm outta here -- putting my van, my cooking equipment,  my body on a boat to Europe, and my dreams. I plan to open a restaurant in  Prague and call it the American Dream -- anyone's welcome. Nothing to leave  behind, except a note on the door: Gone to Czechoslovakia. Gone to look for  America.  </P> <P> SAL GIANNETTA  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

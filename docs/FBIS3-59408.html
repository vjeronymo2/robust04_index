			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ryszard Rogon: "Aviation Industry Potential and </F> Prospects"]    [Text] Recently a PAP [Polish Press Agency]  correspondent reported from Vienna on the long line that formed  by our helicopter at the air show in Wiener Neustadt in Austria.  Unfortunately, there was no such line to purchase the  Sokol--only those who wanted to take rides in it. Because of its  good qualities and the international acclaim it has garnered,  the helicopter competes strongly with others in its class.  However, the general crisis in the aviation branch has made the  competition considerably tougher.    The Sokol is now the best-known Polish aviation product. It  comes in many different versions: fire-fighting, luxury,  medevac, air-sea rescue, combat, etc. Work is constantly being  done to improve it. An important asset of the Sokol is its  price: less than half as much as other similar designs. The WSK  [Transportation Equipment Plant] PZZ Swidnik, which produces it,  is counting heavily on strong export sales.    The flattering reviews that have been picked up during the  shows and international exhibitions clearly favor this effort.  The most reliable market, however, even though it is not as  receptive, is the domestic one. The military, the police, and  the other state training organizations are now committed  customers. Regular orders are growing. The military, for  example, is already flying several Anakond aircraft--that is,  modifications of the Sokol that are designed for air-sea rescue.  Preparations are also being made for the production of a  transport helicopter version for the Army that can carry about  15 soldiers. In the combat version, the proposals include the  Salamander and the Huzar, which is outfitted with Western  equipment and weapons.    The Swidnik plant can also make money on the production of  the PW-5, a glider that has won in world competition.  Cooperation with the company ATR should also yield profits. The  modernization of several sections of the plant is just the first  result of preparations to manufacture subassemblies for the  ATR-72 aircraft.    Mielec or, more accurately, the Transportation Equipment  Factory in that city, is the largest and best-known aircraft  plant in our country. A special economic zone was to be  established here as an "incubator" for business, and the  production of subway cars for the Warsaw metro has even been  undertaken. Finally, the Iryda, the An-28, the M-20 Mewa, the  Iskierka, and the Dromader aircraft are also being produced  here. Cooperation with Boeing (in the production of aircraft  doors) is also raising hopes for the future. The designers are  working on several new projects. It will soon be possible to  talk about them. Thus far, orders from the military (for the  Iryda) have constituted the best source of funds. There are not  enough sales of them, however, to finish work on a contract (for  the purchase of engines and equipment) amounting to 58 Mewas for  a U.S. company. This year the military may also procure 10 An-28  Bryza aircraft. The sale of several tens of Dromader aircraft  has also been finalized. It has turned out that all of the  aircraft, when properly advertised, still consistently find  buyers.    Everyone in Mielec is hoping that the worst is now over.  Despite what some of our former "politicians" may think, they  feel that, in the future, they will no longer be condemned to  produce just golf carts. Among other things, historical  tradition (the plant dates back to the 1930's) favors the  appearance of an aviation plant that will be able to handle  government orders and production for export.    The PZL [Polish Aviation Plant] Okecie is primarily a  manufacturer of aircraft such as the Wilga, the Koliber, the  Orlik, and the Flaming. However, the enterprise should most of  all tout (if it manages to begin production of it) the widely  renowned Skorpion battlefield aircraft. The best-sellers at the  moment are the Orlik and the Wilga. There are high hopes for the  Flaming, which may break into the U.S.-Canadian market. There is  a real chance of selling about 2,000 copies there.    Basic information about other Polish enterprises in the  aviation industry, along with their production profiles, can be  summarized in several sentences. The Institute of Aviation is  involved in the development and design of aircraft and engines.  The Combine for Standard Hydraulic Parts, PZL-HYDRAL, in Wroclaw  produces fuel regulators for turbojet and turboprop engines,  hydraulic components, and systems, and turns out heating  equipment and electronic gear. The Transportation Equipment  Plant PZL-Rzeszow produces a whole line of engines for aircraft  and helicopters, as well as various kinds of engine parts. The  Transportation Equipment Plant Kalisz also has a similar  production profile.    A completely atypical aviation plant that is currently  experiencing growing organizational-financial difficulties is  the Glider Experimental-Production Enterprise PZL Bielsko."The  enterprise is struggling to survive. We should recall that the  most famous Polish glider designers (Foka, Cobra, Jantar, etc.)  once came from there. It is now producing the Puchacz, Junior,  and the Jantar Standard, as well as three record-holding  gliders: the SZD-55 (15-meter class), the SZD-56, and the  aerobatic SZD-59.    The search for optimum solutions that could help solve the  aviation industry's main problems has already begun. Efforts at  cooperation are being renewed, and cooperative ties are being  steadily tightened. In the near future, there should be a  clearly formulated concept of how military and civilian aviation  will develop. At that point, it will be realistically possible  to evaluate the prospects for our "wings" and those who build  them.

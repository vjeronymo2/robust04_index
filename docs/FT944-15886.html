			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Coffee and the reason for living: When it comes to cafes, London yields to most of Europe I probably take coffee too seriously. When I order my morning cappuccino, I keep a guilty, but beady, eye on the hapless dupe whom I have randomly picked out to kick-start my day, just to check that nothing is amiss: that the amount, quality and pressure applied are as they should be; that the milk is not allowed to boil; that it is gently coaxed into the cup; and, finally, that no one dares sprinkle chocolate on top (a violent lurch across the counter coupled with a low, rumbling sound in Dolby stereo usually does the trick). The afternoon espresso poses fewer problems, but vigilance is still required. It must be small, strong, thick, black as soot but topped with a subtle film of golden-brown which just catches the light as you twirl the cup in your hand. Obsessive, I know, but then coffee is a way of life; an integral part, dare I say it, of European civilisation. With frontiers ever shifting, holiday destinations turning into battlefields and finance ministers springing in and out of monetary systems as if in a country dance, what better way is there to define and defend this troubled continent than to celebrate the splendour of its cafes? The will to while away the hours over a cup of Arabia's finest unites Paris, Rome, Madrid, Athens, Amsterdam - every European megalopolis which prides itself on cultural vitality and elan. All these cities understand the creative link between intellectual fertility and the coffee house. But London, alas, cannot count itself among them. From Potsdam to St Petersburg, as we speak, brilliant minds are shaping philosophies for the new millennium in a glorious haze of caffeine-charged inspiration, lucid as laser-beams, while the British can only sup their placid pints of mild-and-bitter and dream about village greens and the 19th century. Over-stating my case? Imagine the scene: Jean-Paul Sartre and his sidekicks are meeting for a few hours of reflective debate at the Jug and Firkin. It is a sultry, crepuscular evening, the master is at the bar: 'Ah, Simone, bonsoir] What's your poison?' 'I'd love a pint of Ruddles, please, Jean-Paul. Shall we sit down?' 'Well, it's a bit crowded. Why don't we join the hundreds of people standing outside, spilling beer all over each other because their glasses are too full, making sure we don't take up too much of the pavement, precariously balancing our pork scratchings against our Heidegger texts and invent a new philosophy?' Hell really is other people when you have to fight your way into a London pub in the summer. Has it not occurred to anyone that Britain's cultural life has been crippled as a result of its refusal to embrace the bean? To be fair, things are changing. It is possible to find the odd part of Soho where one can spend an hour or two in relative comfort, drinking respectable coffee and imagining, for a moment or two at least, that there is revolution in the air. And the city which never goes to sleep (because it never properly wakes up) is actually at the forefront of an exciting coffee-related development - the Internet cafe. Cyberia ('the world in a coffee cup'), just behind Tottenham Court Road, is a brand new concept in customer service, where you can sit in front of a screen and surf on the super-highways, as it were, communicating with enthusiasts all over the world while nibbling a croissant and sipping the golden liquid. I tried it; the spirit of intellectual inquiry knows no technological boundaries. But when it comes to information super-highways, I find it quite hard to leave the hard shoulder. I wanted to send out a message asking if anyone wanted to set a new agenda with me for the post-historical world, but I got stuck in the England football team for Wednesday's international against Romania. In other words, I used it exactly like a newspaper, which I know is my problem rather than Cyberia's, but I cannot honestly see it catching on. Are people not meant to talk to each other in cafes, or is that old-fashioned? To idle away at a pavement cafe is more, much more, than a blissful waste of time; it is an act of defiance. It says to all those around you who are buzzing to work or racing home: Wait. There is more to your lives than this. Relax, and think about the world in a different way. Smoke a pipe, write a novel, argue about the existence of God. It is part of our ancestors' rich heritage, and it is the reason life is worth living. I probably take coffee too seriously.</p>

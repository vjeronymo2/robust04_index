			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Arts: The Dearly Beloved, by computer - Theatre The Hampstead Theatre's publicity says that this new play is by Philip Osment, but it is easier to believe that Osment just let his computer do the work. You can just see the instructions he fed in beforehand: '1. Make it very Chekhovian,' '2. But make it modern - eg include at least one lesbian,' '3. Have a death in the third act,' '4. Then make everyone accept new life in the fourth act, and learn to love one another more than before.' The computer has done its job with bland efficiency. The Chekhovian aspects consist of the facts that these characters are all stuck in the provinces, that sooner or later almost everyone onstage reveals that he or she is wailingly unhappy, that everyone spends time harking back to the past and/or imagining the future, that conversation is littered with non-sequiturs, and that all that happens (apart from one death offstage) is characters arriving, departing, drinking too much, and falling in love too readily. Alaric (cf. Trigorin in The Seagull), a sophisticated media bigshot, returns to his native provinces. Two local women (both unhappily married) compete for his attentions, and one local husband is wildly jealous of his success. Alaric is in complete contrast with Terry, his mentally retarded brother who is still looked after by their mother. The fact that Alaric speaks less spontaneously and originally than most other people onstage is not made interesting. The dialogue is wholly composed of commonplaces and platitudes, apart from the lines given to one of the local wives, Elaine, who is cast in what a computer might take to be a fresh wise-rustic vein. But Alaric has as bad an influence on her as on everyone else, and she is reduced to cliches before Act Three. The Dearly Beloved is a morass of remarks like 'What's the point of all this suffering, I wonder?' 'Wherever you go, you take your life with you,' and 'Awful thing, isn't it, remorse?' Then there are the symbols. Baby in Pram = New Life. The Deer = The Beauty of Nature. The Choir = Human Co-operation. There are nine in the cast, and each of them manages to over-emphasise at least one point during the the play. The production is by Cambridge Theatre Company; Mike Aldreds directs. The only deft touch in the whole affair is the title. You spend the first three acts applying it to Alaric and (in ironic contrast) Terry, and maybe (also ironically) to the various girfriends in the cast. Only when the death occurs does the title take new irony and new force. At the Hampstead Theatre, London NW3. 071-722-9301.</p>

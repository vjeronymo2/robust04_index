			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / S Yemenis welcome UN envoy Northern Yemeni forces pushed to within 20 miles of the southern Yemeni city of Mukalla yesterday but were ordered not to shell it, Reuter reports from Maifa, Yemen. In the city, southern Yemenis welcomed UN peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who is expected to meet Ali Salem al-Baidh, president of the southern state which seceded from a four-year union with the north on May 21. Mr Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister, is trying to arrange a ceasefire between Sanaa and Aden. He met Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh in Sanaa last week. Deputy prime minister Abdul-Qader Bagammal told a news conference in Sanaa that northern troops were under orders to keep their artillery just out of range of Mukalla, which contains many historic buildings, an airbase and an oil export terminal. Meanwhile northern forces have taken control of a huge central chunk of what was, before unification in 1990, South Yemen.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARATROOPER CHARGED IN MAN'S DEATH IN PANAMA  </P> <P> In a criminal action arising out of the invasion of Panama, a decorated Army  paratrooper has been charged with murdering an unidentified Panamanian man and  assaulting three others, military officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> First Sgt. Roberto Enrique Bryan, a 42-year-old career soldier of the 82nd  Airborne Division, was accused of fatally shooting a prisoner who was captured  Dec. 23 after a grenade was thrown from a car filled with Panamanians, killing  one of Bryan's men.  </P> <P> The alleged slaying followed a shoot-out in which several occupants of the car,  all in civilian clothes, were killed and at least two men were arrested in the  incident at a checkpoint, according to Army sources.  </P> <P> Bryan, a native of Panama, also is charged with three counts of aggravated  assault for allegedly hitting two Panamanians with the butt of his M-16 assault  rifle on Dec. 20 -- the day that U.S. forces swept at dawn into Panama -- and  whipping a third man with a section of rubber hose Dec. 21, said Army Maj. Joe  Padilla, a Pentagon spokesman. In the invasion-day incidents, Bryan is charged  with hitting one man on the head with the M-16 and smashing another man on the  hand.  </P> <P> The charges against Bryan stemmed from a probe by the U.S. Army Criminal  Investigation Command. The Army command reportedly is investigating 20 other  incidents of serious misconduct during and after the Panama invasion.  </P> <P> Military officials would not comment on the status of those ongoing  investigations, including one into the possibly accidental shooting of a  civilian as two U.S. soldiers fled a Panama City brothel without paying.  </P> <P> Bryan has been appointed a military lawyer. He is not being ordered confined at  Ft. Bragg, N.C., the 82nd Airborne's base, said Maj. Ned Ennis, a spokesman  there. Ennis added that Bryan has been relieved of duty and is spending time  "crafting his defense."  </P> <P> The charges are expected to be referred to an investigating officer, who will  recommend whether the case should be forwarded to Maj. Gen. James H. Johnson  Jr., commander of the 82nd Airborne, who will decide whether to convene a  court-martial.  </P> <P> Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the maximum penalty for  premeditated murder is death or life imprisonment, dishonorable discharge,  forfeiture of all pay and allowances and reduction in rank.  </P></p>

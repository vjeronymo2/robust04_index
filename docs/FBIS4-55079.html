			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [KONTINENT staff report] </F>   [Text] Yesterday the leaders of the ASP [Alternative  Social Liberal Party] issued a reminder that the BSP [Bulgarian  Socialist Party] and DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms]  deputies could not muster 121 votes, the minimum needed for  parliament to adopt decisions. ASP Organizational Secretary  Vasil Velinov said that if Berov gives in to all the BSP's  demands for cabinet changes, he will have to propose them in a  half-empty chamber, thus delivering an unmistakable hint that  the deputies in the NSD [New Alliance for Democracy] group would  simply boycott parliament if Berov were to reach full accord  with the Socialists.    The ASP leaders have no intention of meeting or holding  consultations with the BSP or Berov. According to Velinov, with  the DPS they had merely held "free discussions" that produced no  concrete results, and that they would have a meeting with the  Center for New Policy after the latter's national conference in  Veliko Turnovo at the end of the week.    The position of the ASP on whether it would support the  cabinet and on the forthcoming structural and personnel changes  in the cabinet should become known after the meeting of the ASP  Political Council next Tuesday [10 May].    Following a further meeting between Berov and the BSP, it  became clear that the BSP would find out on Monday how many  posts it will obtain in the imminent cabinet shuffle. Berov is  to announce the new names in parliament on Wednesday 11 May.  Despite having been given a written document explaining the  concept behind the cabinet changes, the Socialist leadership is  reportedly not satisfied and has established differences in  principle with Berov's intentions. At their last meeting with  Berov, the BSP leaders reported did not accept the prime  minister's idea of converting the power industry and forestry  committees into ministries and of merging the tourism and trade  departments.</p>

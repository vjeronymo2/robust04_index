			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Serbian gunmen kill Bosnian deputy prime minister THE BOSNIAN deputy prime minister was killed yesterday by Serb gunmen who dragged him out of a UN convoy near Sarejevo airport, a UN spokesman said. The killing threw new shadows over the prospects for peace talks in Geneva. The Bosnian mission to the United Nations said the country's deputy prime minister Mr Hakija Turalic, believed to be in his late 40s, was shot seven times and killed while riding in a UN convoy from the airport to the city centre. Mr Turalic was returning from the airport when two Serbian tanks blocked the road and he was dragged from the car. He was then identified and killed. Meanwhile talks between the warring factions in Bosnia resume in Geneva tomorrow with few prospects for an early agreement, amid renewed fighting in Sarajevo and other parts of the country. After failing last Tuesday to persuade the main combatants - the Bosnian Moslems and Serbs - to endorse a draft constitutional and ceasefire agreement, international mediators are attempting to broaden the negotiations to include Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the hardline president of Serbia. The mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance, representing the United Nations, and Lord Owen, the European Community representative, have written to Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump Yugoslavia, asking him if he would consider including Mr Milosevic in his delegation. It can be assumed that the mediators would not have written to Mr Cosic unless they had won Mr Milosevic's prior approval for such a move during their meeting with him in Belgrade this week. After their meeting, Mr Milosevic said he was willing to support all efforts which would lead to a peaceful solution of the Bosnian conflict and that the mediators' plan was 'a good approach' to a settlement. Mr Fred Eckhard, the mediators' spokesman, said in Geneva that they hoped Mr Milosevic could play the same kind of brokering role as he did when Mr Vance was negotiating the end of the war between the Yugoslav federation and Croatia a year ago. The mediators appear to believe that only Mr Milosevic can exercise enough pressure to persuade Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, to accept their peace plan, which he has so far rejected. Specifically, Mr Karadzic is insisting that the Serbs, who currently hold 70 per cent of Bosnia-Hercegovina after pursuing a relentless campaign of 'ethnic cleansing', should be allowed to have their own independent 'state within a state'. Their ultimate, if undeclared, objective is that such an entity should eventually be absorbed into a Greater Serbia. However, the mediators, who have proposed the creation of an independent, sovereign Bosnia-Hercegovina divided into 10 internally self-governing provinces without an international legal status, have stressed that such a solution would be unacceptable to the international community. More important, the Serbs' demands have also been firmly rejected by President Alijah Izetbegovic of the Moslem-led Bosnian government, who had talks with US Senate leaders in Washington on Thursday and is to meet French President Francois Mitterrand on his way back to Geneva today. While approving in principle a separate draft agreement on a cessation of hostilities, which only the Bosnian Croats have so far signed, Mr Izetbegovic has made clear that he cannot countenance an independent Bosnian Serb state. He has also demanded modifications to the provincial map tabled by the mediators, which would give the Serbs control of about 50 per cent of the country and the Moslems about 25 per cent, including the main urban and industrial areas. The remaining territory would have either Croat majorities or mixed populations.</p>

[XINHUA] Many measures will be taken this year. What are  the key ones?    [Hong Hu] There are two key points in reform this year. One  is to deepen the reform of the enterprise structure and to carry  out experiments on the establishment of a modern enterprise  system. The other is to promote the reform of the  macroregulation and macrocontrol structure and, at the same  time, to carry out as a supplement the building of the market  system with the essentials market as the dominant factor and to  speed up the progress in the reforms of the social security and  housing systems.    [Du Yali] In October 1993, GUANGMING RIBAO published a  report which stated that losses of state assets were serious,  totaling 100 million yuan a day. This attracted the attention  of the readers. Please tell us whether or not the rate of such  losses has been curbed. Is the situation improving?    [Hong] This issue has attracted great attention in the State  Council and measures are being taken. In the course of carrying  out modern enterprise system reform and of reorganizing property  rights this year, how to avoid the loss of state assets is an  issue especially worthy of our attention.    Hong Hu disclosed after analyzing several causes of the  losses of state assets at present: The work of formulating the  "Regulations on Supervision and Control Over State Assets" has  been completed. At present, some technical problems are being  handled and the regulations will soon be promulgated. The  regulations explicitly state the responsibility of government  investment organs in supervising and controlling state assets.  The promulgation of the regulations will effectively curb the  rate of losses of state assets.    [LIEN HO PAO] The reorganization of property rights will  inevitably result in unemployment for some people. Is the  living standards of these people secured?    [Hong] Both the reorganization of property rights and the  readjustment of the enterprise organization structure involve  the issue of arrangements for the placement of staff members and  workers. The state has always attached great importance to  this. In May last year, the State Council issued documents  clearly stating the arrangements for staff members and workers  of state enterprises who are awaiting jobs and departments  concerned have, in accordance with the number of people and a  certain percentage, established insurance funds for those  awaiting jobs. According to relevant documents issued by the  state, the living standards of the staff members and workers in  bankrupt enterprises are secured.    Liu Zhifeng said, in reply to a question on housing reform  raised by RENMIN RIBAO: On 31 December 1993, the State Council  issued a circular on resolutely stopping sales of houses at low  prices. Some people mistakenly thought that housing reform  would stop. As a matter of fact, stopping the sales of houses  at low prices is precisely to better promote housing reform.  This is because the sales of houses at low prices will easily  lead to unfair distribution once again, which is harmful to  long-term housing reform. The State Council will soon  promulgate a decision on speeding up the residential housing  system reform in towns and cities. Selling houses will be the  dominant factor and selling, renting, and building houses will  be carried out at the same time. Various departments should  energetically and safely promote the sales of houses strictly in  accordance with the method for fixing prices stipulated by the  State Council.</p>

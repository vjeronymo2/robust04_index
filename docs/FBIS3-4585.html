			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan's household spending  in 1993 posted the first decline in real terms in 12 years,  reflecting the prolonged recession, the government said Monday  [28 February].    Households spent an average 335,246 yen every month last  year, down an inflation-adjusted 0.6 percent from the year  before.    Family expenditures last fell in real terms in 1982, when  average monthly household spending slipped 0.8 percent, the  Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said in a preliminary report.    Households of wage earners decreased their spending by a  real  0.4 percent to 355,276 yen for the first decline in 13 years, in  line with a marginal 0.1 percent rise in their average monthly  income in the year to 570,545 yen.    The barely perceptible rise in income, attributed to reduced  bonuses and income from part-time work, was the lowest increase  since 1981, when an oil crisis paralyzed the Japanese economy.    Expenditures by households of nonwage earners were down 1.1  percent to 300,050 yen a month on average, the first fall in  four years.    For all categories of households, spending was down last  year  on foodstuffs, housing, furniture, clothes and education.    Outlays increased on utilities charges, medical care,  transport and communications, and entertainment.    For December, household spending rose 0.4 percent from a  year  earlier to 438,233 yen, the third straight month of gain  following a 1.4 percent increase in November and 0.4 percent  rise in October.    Despite the recovery in overall spending, however, wage  earners' households spent less in the latest reporting month,  with their income continuing to be depressed.    Those households spent an average 474,156 yen, down 0.2  percent from a year earlier and the eighth consecutive month of  decline from year-earlier levels, which is the longest losing  streak since the agency started compiling the statistics under  the current formula.    Income of wage earners' households in December was down 0.2  percent to 1,213,090 yen, with the winter bonus paid in the  month showing a 0.9 percent decline.    Spending by households of nonwage earners, in contrast, rose  1.1 percent to 373,485 yen.    An EPA official said it is "uncertain whether the nation's  household spending has really been picking up as long as wage  earners' households keep their purse strings tight."    In December, spending on housing, durable goods, medical  care, transport and communications, and entertainment increased,  while outlays on foodstuffs, utilities charges, and clothing  fell, the report said.</p>

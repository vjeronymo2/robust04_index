			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: European officials display their relief EUROPEAN finance ministers and monetary officials meeting at the International Monetary Fund in Washington yesterday put the best face on things as they reacted to the first news of France's vote on the Maastricht treaty, write George Graham and Peter Norman. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, acknowledged that the Yes vote had only narrowly prevailed but said, as he disappeared into a meeting with his fellow EC finance ministers, that the result would still be enough to calm the markets. 'A small majority is better than a minority. It is a good result. It is a positive signal for the integration of Europe. It is a positive for the markets.' His optimism was endorsed by some European central bankers. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, said the result 'will certainly calm down the markets' while Mr Lamberto Dini, director general of the Italian central bank, agreed it was positive. French officials cheerfully maintained that even a narrow Yes would restore calm to the markets. One suggested the EC ministers' most important business in their meeting would be the ceremonial opening of champagne bottles. Some officials privately acknowledged, however, that the mood in private meetings was far less cheerful. 'Any closer and we would all have been diving for cover,' said one European diplomat. 'We're not out of the woods yet,' a senior EC official added.</p>

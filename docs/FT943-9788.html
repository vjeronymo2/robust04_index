			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: London City launches revised offer for Towles London City Equities has made a revised 275p per share offer for Towles, the lossmaking clothing manufacturer. The Australian investment group made its original offer of 265p per ordinary share at the end of May. With a 51 per cent stake in the company but only 14 per cent of the voting rights, London City said at that time it was making the offer because it was 'outraged' at Towles' continuing losses. The offers for the other classes of share remain at 115p cash for each A ordinary share; 52p for each A preference share and 78p per B preference share. The directors of Towles have indicated that they will accept the revised offer in respect of their entire beneficial holdings - representing 33.8 per cent - and have unanimously recommended that shareholders also should accept.</p>

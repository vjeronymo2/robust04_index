			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> INVOCATION FLAP APPEARS RESOLVED  </P> <P> The City Council this week laid to rest a monthlong controversy over prayer  before its meetings by unanimously passing a resolution that appears to satisfy  everyone.  </P> <P> The resolution emphasizes the city's support of freedom of speech and says that  the city's use of invocations is not intended to endorse any particular  religious belief.  </P> <P> Although city officials say there have never been problems with invocations in  the past, a letter from the mayor asking local clergy to refrain from using  language that might endorse a particular religious belief during invocations  sparked a protest last month.  </P> <P> City Atty. James Rourke, whose memo prompted the mayor's original letter, said  later, "Speaking about Jesus Christ is obviously identifying a particular  religion." But Mayor Richard B. Edgar later wrote another letter backing off  from that stance.  </P> <P> The resolution was drafted by an attorney for the Christian Coalition, the  group that led the protest.  </P> <P> When asked whether saying "Jesus Christ" during an invocation would violate the  new resolution, City Atty. Rourke declined to comment. "What do you think?" he  asked. "I'm not going to add anything more to it. It really was a non-issue."  </P> <P> But Rourke did say that the city would probably not take any action against  anyone who violated the policy.  </P> <P> The two invocations given since the flap began have not identified specific  deities, and the resolution seems to change little. But Christian Coalition  spokesman Frank Kazerski said it was a victory for the group.  </P> <P> "It changes things 180 degrees," he said. "The original letter that the mayor  put out was instructing clergy that they were not supposed to endorse any  particular religion. This says the city of Tustin is not endorsing any  particular religion."  </P> <P> At Monday night's meeting, Edgar said he was glad to accept the resolution.  "Truly, we don't have a conflict," he said. "But we do need to be careful."  </P> <P> In urging the council to adopt the resolution, Tustin attorney Nova D. Pack  said: "We do feel that invoking God in passing legislation is important, for it  is the wisdom of God that will prevail rather than the wisdom of the world."  SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

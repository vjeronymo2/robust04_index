			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Cadbury lays out new rules for directors THE MANAGEMENTS of British companies would have to defer more decisions to non-executive directors and give more information to shareholders under proposals unveiled yesterday after a far-reaching review of corporate governance. The Committee on Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance was chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, head of ProNed, an organisation which promotes the role of non-executive directors, and former chairman of Cadbury Schweppes. The proposed reforms are almost entirely voluntary. The Cadbury committee, however, proposed that they be given immediate force through a new listing requirement to be adopted by the London Stock Exchange. This would require companies, beginning with their 1992 accounts, to disclose the extent to which they comply with the recommendations and to explain non-compliance where it occurs. Sir Ron Dearing, a member of the Cadbury committee and chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, the UK umbrella organisation for accountancy bodies, said yesterday the group might urge that some of its recommendations be made statutory if companies did not adopt the voluntary code. 'If two years on there has been massive non-compliance, then we may have to consider new regulations,' Sir Ron said. A monitoring committee will be established to review compliance. 'If companies do not back our proposal we believe that there will be increasing pressure for legislation and external regulation which will be less effective than the approach we recommend,' he said. At the heart of the recommendations is a code of practice for boards of directors covering matters ranging from the structure of remuneration and audit committees and disclosure of performance-related pay to the role of directors in preparing annual accounts. Many companies yesterday welcomed the report as a well-balanced attempt to promote higher standards of boardroom accountability and to ensure that effective self-regulation precluded the need for legislation. Most of the larger companies claimed that they were well on the way to implementing the main recommendations. The Confederation of British Industry said the report had tried to strike a balance between prescription and the flexibility needed for the wide range of businesses invited to adopt the code of practice. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the report complemented and reinforced initiatives the government had already taken to improve financial reporting. But Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's corporate affairs spokesman, condemned its 'lack of teeth', warning that a voluntary code might amount to a 'recipe for inactivity'. Sir Ron conceded that elements of the report fell short of what had been sought by many institutional shareholders. However, he said the committee believed it was crucial to make proposals that all parties could agree on in order to ensure compliance. Stronger measures might never have obtained the backing of corporate boards, he said. Among the report's key recommendations are: Board authority should be divided between chairman and chief executive; board structures combining the two roles should ensure the presence of a strong independent element with an appointed leader. The split between salary and performance-related pay, and basis for the latter, of the chairman and the highest paid UK director should be disclosed in annual accounts. Each board should have an audit and remuneration committee, with the audit committee to be composed wholly of non-executives and the remuneration committee to be 'wholly or mainly' composed of non-executives. The committee considered, but rejected suggestions that shareholders should have the opportunity to vote on directors' pay. Sir Ron said that, after heated discussion about the matter, the committee came to the view that such a rule would hamper recruitment of qualified executives. Interim financial statements should be discussed with auditors although need not be formally audited. Audit committees should meet at least once a year with external auditors without the presence of executive directors. Non-executives should be able to be remunerated by the company for the cost of independent advice from outside professionals if necessary.</p>

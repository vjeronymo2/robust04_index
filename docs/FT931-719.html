			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (8): The sun did not set - Refineries and plastics THE modern image of Singapore is of an economy dominated by electronics and other high tech products. But petroleum, one of Singapore's most established industries, still forms a key element in the economy. Those who once referred to petroleum in Singapore as a sunset industry have been proved wrong. Last year more than SDollars 400m was spent on upgrading and refurbishing existing refineries. Singapore is the world's third biggest refining centre after Rotterdam and Houston. The oil majors and the locally and foreign held Singapore Refining Company have invested heavily in a range of sophisticated plant and equipment. The total capacity of Singapore's refineries is now slightly over 1m barrels a day, supplying almost 40 per cent of Asia's refined product imports. Singapore has also become - along with London and New York - one of the world's main oil trading centres. The petroleum sector accounts for more than 10 per cent of Singapore's total manufacturing output and refined goods continue to be one of the largest items in the country's trade account. Low refining prices world-wide have squeezed local profit margins in recent years. But Singapore's future as a refining centre would seem to be assured by a number of factors: Singapore's geographical position, at the centre of the supply chain from the Middle East to Asia's main markets in Japan and South Korea, is becoming ever more important as most economies in the Asia region rapidly expand. Oil demand in the Asia region is now rising by nearly four per cent a year compared with a world average of 0.5 per cent. Total petroleum demand in the Asia Pacific region is projected to rise from the present 14.5m b/d to nearly 20m b/d by the turn of the century. To meet this fast expanding regional demand, increasing amounts of oil will have to be shipped from the Middle East - through Singapore. Though exploration activities are being stepped up in Asia, only about 44 per cent of the region's oil needs are locally produced. By the turn of the century it is estimated that nearly 80 per cent of Asia's oil will be imported. Though several countries in the region have announced plans to build refineries, there is concern about the increasing costs involved. Singapore is fortunate to have an established refining industry: it is far cheaper to expand and upgrade existing plants than build new ones. As a consequence of upgrading programmes Singapore is now acknowledged as one of the most efficient refining centres, capable of processing a wide range of product. Particular emphasis has been put on investments in equipment to produce low sulphur fuels, the so called 'green' products increasingly in demand in the region. A considerable petrochemical industry has grown up alongside the petroleum sector. Overall nearly 300 foreign and local companies are involved in refining, petrochemicals, industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals and advanced materials. As in the refining sector the petrochemical industry's margins have been squeezed in recent years by generally low world prices, plus a rapid rise in regional production, mainly caused by several plants coming on stream in South Korea. But Singapore's planners see a big growth in regional demand for petrochemical products in the years ahead and have successfully attracted some of the biggest names in the business to invest in new plants. As in all areas of investment activity, Singapore is providing key infrastructural support. A landfill project is planned which will unite five islands off the main island of Singapore into a SDollars 4bn petrochemical complex. Du Pont, Mobil, GE Plastics and others are investing more than SDollars 2bn in a variety of projects. One of Du Pont's plants will produce key ingredients for polyurethane used, among other things, for liners in the ever expanding running shoe industry. Companies such as Nike moved their manufacturing operations to Asia some years ago: of the 90m pairs of shoes Nike produces each year, less than two per cent are made outside Asia. In future Du Pont will be able to feed Nike plants in Indonesia and elsewhere from its Singapore plant, rather than from the US. 'We've been selling our products in this region for many years,' says Mr Thomas Springer, managing director of Du Pont's Singapore operations. 'Now having a presence here makes sense both from a production and from a sales point of view. Over the next few years we see our market in the Asia Pacific growing at twice the rate of anywhere else.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Disappointing Election"] </F>   [Text] A turnout of over 50 percent is certainly an  improvement on what has been up to now the low point of 46.1  percent in 1989, but it can still be argued that there is a  disappointingly low level of interest in the European  Parliament. What is especially disappointing is that the no side  was strengthened particularly at the expense of the Social  Democrats, and this could well revive the old Social Democratic  conflict between supporters and opponents of greater European  cooperation. The fact that a third of votes went to opponents of  union will underline Denmark's image as the European paradox,  and it could also sow doubts about the Danes' wholehearted  participation in the intergovernmental conference in 1996.    The day before the election both Prime Minister Poul Nyrup  Rasmussen and Liberal Party leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen  predicted very optimistically that the turn out would be between  58 and 60 percent. And it is perhaps these two men in  particular who should take part in a face-to-face showdown to  discover to what extent they bear part of the responsibility for  the people's lack of interest. Were the elections to the  European Parliament not really about domestic politics? And is  it right that party leaders who are not running in the election  should assume the dominant position in an election campaign that  is not theirs? In the Folketing the party leaders leave the  responsibility for voicing the party's views to their respective  spokespersons, and only by way of exception do the party leaders  step into the frontline. The same should be true of European  politics. Leading candidates do not need stand-ins -- not even  in nationwide television programs. The Socialist People's  Party's John Iversen takes the view that the European Parliament  should be closed if people do not take an interest in it. The  problem is rather that the members of the European Parliament  [MEP's] have been unable to give their place of work a presence  in everyday Danish life. The 16 newly elected European  Parliament deputies are therefore facing a major task in  explaining why the European Parliament is worth taking an  interest in.    The Social Democrats' major losses meant that the Liberal  Party has taken over the yellow jersey of the largest party.  But the improvement in the Liberal Party's fortunes was not as  great as predicted. The Conservative People's Party enjoyed  what we could call the former prime minister effect. Poul  Schluter received a pat on the back and had a very good  election. Lone Dybkjaer and Lilli Gyldenkilde were vote magnets  for the Radical Liberals and the Socialist People's Party  respectively. Meanwhile the Center Democrats had a catastrophic  election. The Center Democrats' Peter Duetoft has the knowledge  and the objectivity, but he lacks trenchancy. And it is true  that the party did not benefit from the fact that Arne Melchior  stepped in as an interim MEP right in front of the nose of Peter  Duetoft when Erhard Jakobsen wanted to give his successor a  further chance to create a profile for himself. The question is  whether we have not now seen the overture to the Center  Democrats' withdrawal from the work of both the Danish and  European parliaments.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Letter: Tecs at forefront of displaying flexibility in supporting business Sir, Charles Batchelor's refreshing article on academic recognition of the need to support established business ('Thinking the unthinkable', December 8) quite rightly highlighted the plan for a network of business advice centres ('one-stop shops') as indicative of changing government priorities. This change is good news for business; yet I fear the article gives the impression that this is something new for the Training and Enterprise Councils. In reality Tecs have long been aware of the need to encourage international competitiveness in business of all types and stages of growth; the new moves from the Department of Trade and Industry will help us do more of it. Tecs do have the flexibility to support start-up businesses; and the French and German models your correspondent quoted would not be beyond the purse or capability of any Tec. However, before we abandon the British start-up model completely, we would be wise to remember that Britain's system excites international (not just European) interest. Only last week, a delegation of 'business incubator' managers from Israel came to Hertfordshire Tec to learn more about our support for business, and their positive response was similar to that we received in the staterooms of Brussels a few months ago. When more than eight out of 10 businesses that start with our help are still flourishing in spite of the current recession after their first 18 months, something must be going right. Many Tecs already provide a significant and growing level of support for businesses that employ more than 20 people, and are between three and five years old. Hertfordshire Tec's 'Business Masterclasses' were designed here more than 18 months ago specifically to inject expertise into just this type fo company. More than nine out of 10 delegates - senior managers and managing directors of local firms - come from companies three years old or more. Just less than half the companies employ 21 or more people. Other established Hertfordshire businesses are enthusiastically tapping into Tec services designed for growth or survival.

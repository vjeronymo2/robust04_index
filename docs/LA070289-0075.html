			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RUB IS THERE  </P> <P> In his essay on Marshall McLuhan, Thomas Cahill states that "virtually  everybody admits to not having finished any of his books. . . ." I certainly  believe that Cahill is included. To refer to his most famous work, "The Medium  is the Massage," as "The Medium is the Message" is to say very little regarding  Cahill's undertaking of the work. Aye, there's the rub!  </P> <P> S. R.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Louis Won] </F>   [Text] It would be a pity if Hong Kong people had lost  their confidence in the future following Mr Lu's visit, Mr  Patten said yesterday. He was responding to a poll published by  the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST yesterday which showed 36 percent  of people felt less confident about Beijing's handling of the  transition.    But Mr Patten said he believed the more Mr Lu was able to  visit Hong Kong, the more people would feel reassured. He hoped  both sides would be able to demonstrate their commitment to  cooperating with each other to encourage Hong Kong people to  have more confidence.    Mr Patten repeated his call for dialogue. "We want to have a  dialogue with Director Lu. We want to see more work flowing up  and down the channels of the Joint Liaison Group, the Airport  Committee, the Land Commission and so on. "I think that the  meeting of the Land Commission recently was a positive  development and showed commitment on all sides to the well-being  of Hong Kong. I think we'd like to see... the next Joint  Liaison Group meeting as successful," he said.    Mr Lu ended his nine-day visit at Kai Tak airport yesterday  in the manner in which he had arrived -- bypassing the media.    Mainland PWC [Preliminary Working Committee] members will  return to Beijing today.</p>

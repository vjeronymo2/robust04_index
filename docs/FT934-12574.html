			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Bidders dig deep to stage final showdown: The rising stakes in the battle for Paramount How much is Mr Barry Diller, chairman of the television home shopping group QVC Network, prepared to pay to snatch Paramount Communications away from its engagement to Viacom, the cable television company? That is the central question facing Paramount shareholders this week, following Sunday night's move by Viacom to increase the value of its agreed bid for the company from Dollars 7.5bn to Dollars 9.5bn, thus matching the value of QVC's hostile offer. The move sweeps aside the financial edge QVC has enjoyed since it entered the fray on September 20, with a Dollars 9.5bn proposal. And it leaves Viacom with a slight upper hand: it has the agreement of the Paramount board to a merger, and the two marriage partners are advanced in obtaining the necessary regulatory clearances. Viacom also has the advantage of 'lock-up' provisions that allow it to buy 20 per cent of Paramount's stock at Dollars 69.14 a share and receive a Dollars 100m payment from Paramount if its bid does not go through. 'The ball is in QVC's court to decide whether to step aside or raise its offer,' says Ms Margo Vignola, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. It was Mr Diller, a prominent film industry figure, who increased the tempo of the contest last Thursday when, frustrated by the Paramount board's reluctance to open negotiations, he changed the terms of QVC's bid proposal, while maintaining the overall value. First, he announced that QVC would proceed this week with a cash tender offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's shares, at Dollars 80 a share, costing Dollars 4.8bn. It would buy the remaining 49 per cent in a later stock-swap tender, also valued at around Dollars 80 a share. The move had two important elements. First, it raised the amount of cash in the QVC offer from Dollars 3.5bn to Dollars 4.8bn - shareholders generally prefer to receive cash. Second, by launching a tender, QVC by-passed the Paramount board and took its offer directly to the shareholders. The manoeuvre left Viacom with no alternative but to increase its offer. It therefore launched a tender offer on Sunday on the same terms as QVC, and offered to buy the remaining 49 per cent in a second stage tender at Dollars 80 a share in a mixture of common and preferred stock. Ms Jessica Reif, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, says this leaves Mr Diller with three choices: 'He can increase the cash portion of his bid, he can increase the total value above Dollars 80, or he can walk away. But given the scarcity value of the assets I think walking away is the least likely.' But how much more can either QVC (with revenues of around Dollars 1bn) or Viacom (revenues Dollars 2bn) afford to pay for the much larger Paramount (revenues of Dollars 4bn)? Their offers are already far from cheap - Ms Reif puts them at around 19 times Paramount's 1993 operating cash flow and 36 times its earnings. With Dollars 4.8bn in cash on the table, both companies appear to be getting close to the limits of their war chests. QVC's armoury contains around Dollars 5bn, consisting of Dollars 3bn in bank loan commitments and Dollars 500m of equity investments from four other media companies: Comcast, Liberty Media (both of which are already large QVC shareholders), Cox Enterprises and Advance Publications. Viacom's new offer was made possible by a Dollars 1.2bn equity commitment from Nynex, the Baby Bell telephone company, and a further Dollars 600m from Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental business. It must also have lined up some Dollars 3bn in bank borrowings. However, in addition to the war-chests, the protagonist gaining control of Paramount will have access to that company's Dollars 1bn in cash reserves, giving each side some latitude to increase its offer. Either side might also persuade their media backers, or bankers, to provide some extra money. Certainly, takeover battles have a habit of soaring out of the bounds of rational financial considerations, and Paramount is such a rare prize - one of the last of the large, independent Hollywood film studios - that the bidding seems certain to go higher, be it from QVC, Viacom or an entirely new entrant to the fray. The heads of all three companies have a great deal riding on the outcome. For 70-year-old Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, the deal is a chance to cap his career in style - although he vowed yesterday not to carry out 'an excessively leveraged transaction'. For Mr Diller, it is an opportunity to turn QVC from a humble television home shopping business into a leading US entertainment concern. Mr Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount, is anxious to complete the friendly deal with Viacom and avoid being swallowed by QVC. He and Mr Diller are bitter enemies. The only thing that can be said with certainty is that the battle is far from over. Few shareholders will be interested in the tender offer when even better terms seem likely to be on the table before too long.

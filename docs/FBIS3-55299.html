			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "What Inflation Was Like in December </F> 1993"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Council of  Ministers-Government center for the economic situation reports  that according to operational figures for the weekly monitoring  of prices in December:    the overall inflation index was about 112 percent, including  102 percent for the period 21-27 December and 800 percent since  the start of the year;    the growth rates of prices for food and nonfood goods  continued to lag behind the change in rates for paid services  for the population;    the growth of consumer prices in medium and small cities  outstripped their increase in price in large cities;    the volume of sales of food goods was 5 percent higher than  last month.    The cost of a selection of 19 of the most important foods in  December throughout Russia on average was 30,700 rubles [R]  calculated on a monthly basis and increased 11 percent compared  with the previous month and sevenfold since December last year.  The cost of this selection for stores (irrespective of form of  ownership) is assessed at an average of R29,500 and for  unorganized trade at R39,800. The cost of the selection  according to prices which have taken shape at city and informal  markets was 35 percent greater than its cost in the stores, as  was the case in late November.    In December the gulf between the maximum and minimum cost of  the selection in various Russian cities was equal to a factor of  3.8 times.    The greatest increase in the cost of the selection over the  month was recorded in the Central Chernozem and Northern regions  -- 16 and 15 percent respectively. And the selection increased  least in cost in the Central and Northwest regions -- by 7 and 8  percent.    An increase of more than 20 percent in the cost of the  selection of the most important foods was noted in 13 Russian  cities. Of these the cost of the selection increased over 30  percent in Rubtsovsk, Abakan, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and  Naberezhnyye Chelny.    The cost of the selection in Moscow as of 27 December was  equal to R34,600, exceeding November's level by 6.4 percent,  while in St. Petersburg it was R29,700 (9.3 percent). In the  list of observed cities Moscow moved to 35th place (in late  November it was 33d) while St. Petersburg moved to 58th place  (it was 59th).  <H3>  Inflation Indexes in 1992 and 1993 (for end of the period,  in percentages of December of preceding year) </H3>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1992                     |1993                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |January                  |352                      |126                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |February                 |502                      |162                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |March                    |683                      |190                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |April                    |840                      |221                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |May                      |943                      |264                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |June                     |1,092                    |310                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |July                     |1,172                    |370                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |August                   |1,262                    |478                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |September                |1,513                    |578                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |October                  |1,891                    |688                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |November                 |2,397                    |805                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |December                 |2,968                    |897                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H3>  Average Cost of Selection of 19 Most Important Foods which  Comprise the Basis of the Population's Weekly Purchases  Calculated on a Monthly Basis in 1993 (for the end of the  period, in rubles per person)  December 1992--4,373 </H3>    January--5,356    February--6,449    March--7,478    April--8,527    May--10,850    June--13,103    July--16,469    August--18,318    September--20,410    October--23,347    November--27,708    December--30,724</p>

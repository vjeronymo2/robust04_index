			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Lloyd's lifts its capacity to Pounds 10.9bn Lloyd's of London yesterday announced that its capacity - the amount of premium its syndicates are allowed to accept - will increase towards the upper end of expectations to Pounds 10.9bn in 1994, compared with Pounds 8.9bn in 1993. Corporate investors have supplied Pounds 1.6bn in capacity, while individual Names, who have traditionally provided the insurance market's capital base, are committing Pounds 9.3bn. 'It is a very satisfactory situation for the market to be in and as good as we could possibly have hoped,' said Mr David Rowland, chairman. An increase in average commitments by individual Names reflected in part the relaxation of solvency requirements and helped offset a decline in the number of Names to 18,022 from 19,537. So-called 'working Names' - who work with agencies and brokers at Lloyd's - raised their average involvement to Pounds 372,000 from Pounds 318,000, while external Names raised their overall premium limits to Pounds 561,000 from Pounds 486,000 in 1993. Mr Rowland also said Lloyd's was considering changes to new voting rules, after protests by Names action groups. The market took the first steps last year to weight its voting system in favour of Names committing increased capital. Separately, Mr Richard Southwell QC criticised internal disciplinary procedures at Lloyd's. Mr Southwell was deputy president of a Lloyd's appeal tribunal sitting in the case of Mr Edward Cowen, a former underwriter. Mr Cowen was suspended from the market after a Lloyd's investigation into a series of reinsurance transactions entered into between 1987 and 1989. A Lloyd's disciplinary committee later upheld the suspension and publicly censured Mr Cowen, after finding him guilty of four charges of 'discreditable' conduct and one of 'detrimental' conduct. On appeal Mr Southwell confirmed the penalty of notice of censure but found Mr Cowen guilty of 'discreditable' conduct on only one charge. The case against Mr Cowen had lasted a total of 72 days between 1990 and 1992. In his decision, made available yesterday, Mr Southwell said: 'In future, proceedings of this kind should be conducted so as to ensure, so far as possible, a shorter period before trial, a shorter trial, less expenditure of money and less burden, above all on the defendant faced with disciplinary charges, but also on Lloyd's' In conducting a trial 'wherever appropriate and fair, the procedure should not be allowed to become excessively legalistic', said Mr Southwell.</p>

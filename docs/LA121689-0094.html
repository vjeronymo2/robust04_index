			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG ATTORNEY SERIOUSLY HURT BY CAR BOMB  </P> <P> A bomb exploded in the car of a locally prominent criminal attorney as he left  for work Friday, seriously wounding him, police said.  </P> <P> Gino P. Negretti, 71, aided by neighbors, narrowly escaped flames that engulfed  the car moments after the blast in a residential section of Miami, police  spokesman David Rivero said.  </P> <P> "He's pretty well known as a defense attorney, and a lot of his clients are  drug defendants," Rivero said. "Obviously, that's one of the angles that will  be checked."  </P> <P> The attorney started his late-model Cadillac and was making a U-turn in front  of his home when the bomb exploded.  </P> <P> Negretti was rushed into surgery at Jackson Memorial Hospital, where doctors  removed shrapnel from his arms and legs, Rivero said. The officer said that  both of Negretti's arms were broken but none of his vital organs appeared to  have been hit. He was listed in stable condition.  </P> <P> The Puerto Rican-born attorney has been well known in Miami legal circles for  decades. He has represented several defendants in prominent cases involving the  city's Cuban-American community.  </P> <P> Negretti defended anti-Castro activist Humberto Lopez Jr., who fled to the  Dominican Republic while appealing a conviction for illegal possession of  explosives.  </P> <P> In 1967, Negretti was one of the attorneys who represented six men convicted of  an attempted invasion of part of Haiti in a plan to set up a base for  anti-Castro actions against Cuba.  </P></p>

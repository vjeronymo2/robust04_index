			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service expects that all landowners, regardless of their status, will comply with the Act and will contribute to the conservation of the desert tortoise. Low, medium, and high density desert tortoise habitat exists on Utah tribal lands. Tribal lands were not excluded from final designation because no new biological or economic information was provided, and tribal lands contain desert tortoise habitat necessary for recovery of the Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit. This recovery unit is unique in that it contains some of the highest densities of desert tortoises known throughout the species' range, and it is the smallest recovery unit, requiring more intensive management to ensure long-term survivability and ultimate recovery of the unit. Desert tortoise habitat necessary for recovery within the Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit is not distinguished by landownership boundaries, and it includes Federal, State, private, and Tribal lands. Following Service approval and implementation of a Washington County HCP, the Service will reevaluate the critical habitat boundaries and may propose to modify critical habitat, if appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 12:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service received several comments concerning the Washington County HCP process, an effort that has been on-going for more than 2 years. The final critical habitat designation should reflect the final Desert Habitat Preserve, to be proposed under a Washington County HCP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Washington County, Utah, is preparing an HCP under section 10 of the Act, as part of its application for a permit to take desert tortoises incidentally. To issue a section 10(a) permit, the Service must determine that, to the maximum extent practicable, the applicant will minimize and mitigate the impacts of the taking. The mitigation for the Washington County permit includes establishment of a Desert Habitat Preserve, primarily for desert tortoise survival and recovery. Washington County has not yet submitted an application for a section 10(a) permit or an HCP to the Service. This final designation of critical habitat for the desert tortoise reflects in large part the habitat conservation planning process to date that, if successful, will result in a desert habitat preserve of sufficient size and configuration to provide for survival and recovery of desert tortoises in this recovery unit. If the Service approves a Washington County HCP and issues a permit to take desert tortoises incidentally, the Service may reevaluate critical habitat, and propose revisions, if appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 13:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The designation of critical habitat will create ``dumping grounds'' for desert tortoises.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Handling (e.g., ``dumping'') of desert tortoises is prohibited by the Act, which defines ``take'' to mean to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect any listed species. Critical habitat provides an extra layer of protection for desert tortoise habitat, but has no effect upon the other protections provided by the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 14:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Desert Habitat Preserve boundary line north of the city of Washington was ``agreed upon'' by members of the Washington County HCP Steering Committee, and that exact line should be reflected in final designation of critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has not reviewed that ``agreed upon'' line, nor has it approved any aspect of a Washington County HCP to date. That line will be reviewed in the context of a Desert Habitat Preserve established under a Washington County HCP, as part of the mitigation for incidental take of desert tortoises and their habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 15:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some respondents perceived critical habitat designation for the desert tortoise as a means by which the Federal government can seize and ``federalize'' public and private lands. One person saw designation of critical habitat as a Federal conspiracy. The Service has a hidden political agenda, is deliberately misinforming the public, and is attempting to control private property, much in the same regard as if under a communist regime.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designation of critical habitat does not, in and of itself, impose additional legal restrictions on private lands except for actions that are authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal agencies on those lands. Non-Federal, as well as Federal lands, with or without designated critical habitat, are still subject to the prohibitions against take of listed species on their land, pursuant to section 9 of the Act. Designation of critical habitat is not a conspiracy, but rather is a requirement of the Endangered Species Act for threatened and endangered species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 16:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous comments were received from DOD agencies, requesting that military installations be excluded from designation of critical habitat. The agencies cited concern over their ability to use existing facilities, the existence of desert tortoise management plans, the increased cost of managing critical habitat, and existing regulatory mechanisms that make the designation of critical habitat unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

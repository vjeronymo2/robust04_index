			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tea planters find salvation in samovars - Imports by CIS states have filled a yawning gap in Sri Lanka's market IN ONE of the more theatrical gestures of his tenure as Russian president, Boris Yeltsin last month stopped in the middle of his television broadcast announcing his putsch against the communist old guard in parliament and calmly sipped a cup of tea. The chances are the tea came from Sri Lanka, for Colombo expects to sell more than 30,000 tonnes to Russia and former Soviet states this year, making the Commonwealth of Independent States by far the country's biggest customer for of tea. Everyone agrees that Russia and the CIS have come to Sri Lanka's rescue. Two years ago Colombo lost its biggest market in Iraq because of the post-Gulf war United Nations trade embargo and this year, with production expected to be up 30 per cent on 1992, it suffered two further blows with sharp declines in demand from Iran and Egypt. Last year by far the largest proportion of Sri Lanka's 178,000 tonnes of tea exports was shipped to the Middle East, with Iran in top place taking 24,000 tonnes, Jordan a close second, with nearly 22,000 tonnes, and Egypt third with almost 17,000 tonnes. Iran and Egypt alone accounted for 23 per cent of Sri Lankan exports, but in the first seven months of this year sales to these two fell by half, while Russia and the CIS came from nowhere to take 19,100 tonnes  - or 16 per cent of all Colombo's exports. By the end of this year Russia and the CIS are expected to have bought upwards of 30,000 tonnes of Sri Lankan tea out of total exports of about 205,000 tonnes. Traditionally, the former Soviet Union imported most of its tea from India in a barter arrangement under which Russian arms were effectively for Indian commodities. But with the break-up of the Soviet Union and arguments with New Delhi over exchange rates the CIS has turned to the world market for its annual requirements. Sri Lanka was quick to spot the opportunity and mounted a strong export drive, which has enabled Colombo to sell almost all of its cheaper tea to this new market in 1993. Mr Rupasena Karunatilleke, minister for plantation industries, visited Russia in July and Mr AR Mansoor, the minister for trade, made a three-week tour through Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Uzbekistan and the Ukraine in September signing agreements with all five states to promote trade. 'The CIS pays cash and there is tremendous scope for exporting tea and other commodities to these countries,' says Mr Mansoor. The Russian market is highly attractive to Colombo for a variety of reasons, including what the Sri Lankan Tea Board sees as the possibility of gaining added value by direct marketing. According to Mr T. Sambasivam, a consultant with the board, the main attractions include: Russia traditionally absorbs about 160,000 tonnes of tea a year, mostly orthodox teas of which Sri Lanka is by far the world's biggest exporter. The CIS and Russia pay cash. Deteriorating economic circumstances means these countries want the cheapest quality tea, which suits Sri Lanka because it can offload traditional teas which otherwise might be difficult to sell. Russia has few factories for packaging and labelling into consumer packs  - a field in which Colombo has great expertise. No multinational drinks company has an entrenched position in Russia, nor does one single brand dominate the market. Mr Sambasivam says if all goes well the hope is to export up to 40,000 tonnes to Russia and the CIS next year when it is hoped that Sri Lanka's newly-appointed plantation managers will have further boosted the country's tea output to a record 250,000 tonnes, weather permitting.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Post Office to Contract Out Work: The Postal Service said it plans to contract  out some automated letter sorting, a plan that could result in as many as  12,000 jobs moving from the post office to private companies by 1995.  </P> <P> Hiring private companies to do letter sorting could save $10 to $12 per work  hour, compared to the costs of postal employees, the Postal Service said. The  change could save as much as $4.3 billion over 10 years. Moe Biller, president  of the American Postal Workers Union, quickly denounced the announcement as a  "disgrace."  </P></p>

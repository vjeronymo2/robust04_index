			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 5 SAPA -- A former commanding officer  of the police's Vlakplaas Training Unit, Lieutenant-Colonel  Eugene de Kock, and two other people have been arrested, SABC  [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports.  This follows the Goldstone Commission's investigation into third  force activities allegedly involving the police. The three will  appear in court shortly.    Further arrests were expected overnight on Thursday [5 May],  according to security sources.    The arrests were effected by an international investigation  team headed by Transvaal Attorney General Jan d'Oliveira. Lt-Col  de Kock was arrested at the International Police Association pub  in Pretoria on Wednesday night.    Dr d'Oliveira said on Thursday night he would have a  complete  report on Friday morning. He said he had left teams to effect  more arrests during the night at their discretion.    They were operating according to a certain programme, and he  would be told of any crisis during the course of the night.    Mr Justice Richard Goldstone said on Thursday night it would  be inappropriate for him to comment.    Official police spokesmen said they had been kept in the  dark  about the operation, and did not know who the arresting officers  were or where detainees were being kept.    The Goldstone report, released by outgoing State President F  W de Klerk, recorded allegations of police officers having been  involved in secret projects to run guns to the Inkatha Freedom  Party. Three police generals, including Deputy Commissioner  Lt-Gen Basie Smit, were put on compulsory leave after the  Goldstone report was made public but were later reinstated. Gen  Smit and Lt-Gen Krappies Engelbrecht this week announced their  retirement.</p>

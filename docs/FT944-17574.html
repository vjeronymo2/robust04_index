			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prototype Sir, I refer to your article, 'Patchy start seen to training plan' (October 3). This year there is only a small number of prototype modern apprenticeship schemes, and they are not behind schedule at all. Indeed, our greatest problem this year is that many employers and young people are expressing great interest, but training and enterprise councils only have funding for a small number of places in the prototype sectors. Next year will see the national launch of modern apprenticeships across the country and in a large number of sectors.

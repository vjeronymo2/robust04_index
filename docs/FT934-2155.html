			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: A North Sea hot potato The Emerald Producer, the floating oil production platform written down by more than Pounds 42m by Trafalgar House yesterday, has consistently proved a problem child for its owners. Most spectacularly it was behind the effective demise of Davy Corporation, founded in 1830, as the UK's largest independent engineering contractor. It was originally a drilling rig, owned by Midland &amp; Scottish Resources, operator of the Emerald oilfield east of Shetland. Midland sold it to Davy in 1989, at the same time awarding Davy a contract to convert it into a production platform. Davy was then to sell the platform back to Midland for a fixed price of Pounds 118.8m in August 1990. But Davy had difficulties managing the conversion. Losses on the contract eventually ran almost as high as the contract price at Pounds 114m. Trafalgar then took Davy over and agreed in May last year to lease the platform to Midland for Dollars 65,000 a day. Midland, which is still operating the platform in the Emerald field, found that production failed to live up to expectations. Initial estimates suggested that the field would produce 30,000 barrels a day for the first two years of its life. It kicked in with a peak of 25,000 b/d in August last year, but this has dwindled to 16,000 b/d. As a result Midland in August wrote off the entire value of the Emerald Field development. The provision of Pounds 97m put the company Pounds 113.6m in the red for 1992 on turnover of Pounds 28.1m. In September the company defaulted on its charter payments to Trafalgar. Mr John Hawksley, managing director, said yesterday that the company was in discussions with Trafalgar to rearrange the charter to fit in better with the likely production and economic life of the field. Trafalgar said the Emerald Producer had been carried in the balance sheet at September 30 at Pounds 66m, a figure supported by independent valuers. Following the default and reduced life expectation of the field, it is writing the value down by Pounds 42.1m and making a Pounds 9.5m provision for costs pending its redeployment or sale. The results show that turnover from the platform fell from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 15.8m for the year to September.</p>

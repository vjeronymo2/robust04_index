			<p>BFN     [Text] President Suharto says economic globalization which  has drastically changed the patterns of production, trade, and  finance is being accompanied by the emergence of large economic  groups among developed nations. This has in turn led to  protectionism, discriminatory practices, and unhealthy  competition. President Suharto said this during a state dinner  banquet in honor of Netherlands Prime Minister and Mrs. Ruud  Lubbers at the State Palace in Jakarta tonight. Accordingly,  the head of state called for efforts to narrow the economic gap  between the North and the South through constructive  international cooperation, consultations, and dialogue.    Touching on human rights, President Suharto said Indonesia  and fellow nonaligned nations as well as other developing  nations have on various ocasions voiced a clear united stand on  the matter. According to the head of state, all nations must  protect and promote human rights through international  cooperation on the basis of equality.    In a return speech, Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers said he  regarded Asia as a fast-growing important region. The varied  traditional characteristics and assets of Asian nations are a  factor that has contributed to the current growth of the region.  The prime minister added that Indonesia plays an important role  in developing ASEAN, attaching importance to South-South  relations, and contributing to the emergence of new economies in  the region.    An exchange of souvenirs took place before the state dinner  banquet. The Netherlands prime minister and his wife presented  President and Mrs. Suharto with an ancient wall clock made in  1880 and a porcelain fruit container. In return, President and  Mrs. Suharto gave Prime Minister and Mrs. Ruud Lubbers an animal  carving, books on Indonesia, batik shirts and material, and a  set of silver handicrafts.</p>

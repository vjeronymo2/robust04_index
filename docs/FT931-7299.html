			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Imro chief urges new pensions regulator THE PENSIONS industry needs a new regulator to force trustees to demonstrate they are competent and independent of the employer, and order their removal if necessary, Mr John Morgan, chief executive of Imro, the fund managers' self-regulatory body, said yesterday. He told the annual investment conference of the National Association of Pension Funds in Eastbourne that the current patchwork system of pension regulation had become 'a dog's breakfast'. Mr Morgan said: 'The rules of the game are not clear, particularly to trustees who are the most important players, and present opportunities for a variety of interpretations, possibly to the detriment of scheme members.' He acknowledged that the cost of tougher regulation could force some smaller schemes out of business. Rather than replace trust law which governs pension funds, the industry should be more effectively regulated and its rules enforced. The new regulator's remit should cover all aspects of the business except fund management, currently supervised by Imro which was responsible for authorising the late Mr Robert Maxwell's company, Bishopsgate Investment Management, which managed employee pension funds later found to be missing more than Pounds 440m. Mr Morgan, who acknowledged Imro's part in the Maxwell affair, retires in July, two months early, and will be succeeded by Mr Philip Thorpe, a special adviser to the Securities and Investments Board. Mr Morgan said the current system placed far too much responsibility on individual trustees who might or might not be up to the task. A pensions regulator should have the scope to review the eligibility and appointment of trustees and the relationship between the employer and trustees, and to enforce regular reporting by trustees and scheme administrators to beneficiaries and regulators. The Commons' social security committee plans to examine the handling of the pension funds of a number of formerly state-owned companies, as part of an inquiry into the government's plans for the pension funds of soon-to-be-privatised businesses. Harland &amp; Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder, Swan Hunter, its Tyneside counterpart, and National Bus Company are among the former public-sector entities whose funds the cross-party body plans to look at.</p>

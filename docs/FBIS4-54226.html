			<p>Political   System   <F P=102> 943E0010D Hanoi TAP CHI CONG SAN in Vietnamese Feb 94 pp  42-44 </F>  <F P=103> 943E0010D </F> <F P=104>  Hanoi TAP CHI CONG SAN </F> <F P=105>  Vietnamese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Le Huu Nghia, assistant professor, MA in </F> philosophy]    [Text] From the lesson of the failure of restructuring in  the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, from the experience of  reform in China, and from the realities of renovation in our  country over the past seven years, we can affirm that: it  is imperative to firmly maintain political stability if society  is to be renovated. Politics touches particularly complex  and sensitive social relationships of which class relationship  is the core. Politics is the relationships among social classes  and groups in the competition for and the maintenance and use of  state power. Therefore, touching politics is touching the state,  the social system, the survival of the social system.  Concentration on renovation is possible only if there is  political stability; if there is no political stability, nothing  can be done. For this reason, political stability is the basis  for social stability in general; political  instability is likely to result in instability in other areas of  society.    Two forms of political stability can be seen in  reality. There is a form of stability that is synonymous with  sluggishness and nondevelopment. Naturally, such stability can  hardly last; very often it becomes the cause of instability  later on. The form of stability we would like to talk about here  is the one linked with development, the form of stability with  development and for development. This stability is not a purpose  in itself; on the contrary, this stability is only a condition,  and it is development that is the purpose. In this sense,  political stability becomes an indispensable condition for  and factor of development.    Political stability is not in opposition to political  renovation. Therefore, we should not fear political renovation  because of our desire for political stability. To carry out  political renovation we must achieve political stability, but to  achieve basic, lasting sociopolitical stability, political  renovation must be carried out in the right direction and in an  efficient manner. Stability must be achieved by means of  renovation and through renovation. So, political stability is  both a precondition for and a result of political  renovation. Political stability is dialectically  unified with political renovation; in stability there is  renovation, and in renovation there is stability. Thus,  political stability implies alteration and change, but such  alteration and change must be in harmony with the set  socioeconomic development objectives instead of running counter  to it, and basically must be controlled by the leading and  managing subjects, namely the party and state. It can be said  that, political stability is political renovation carried out in  a principled manner and in conformity with our party's  renovative line.    According to the aforementioned concept, the task of firmly  maintaining political stability in order to renovate politics  and other aspects implies the following basic factors:    -- Firmly maintaining the party's right to leadership over  the political system and all society. This means that the party  must really holds power and its objectives, viewpoints, and  principles must be thoroughly reflected in its renovative line.    -- Firmly maintaining the political system with the state  apparatus as a state of the people, by the people, and for the  people. Although the organizational structure and personnel of  the state may change, the political character of our state must  not be changed.    -- Firmly maintaining our legal system. Laws may be revised,  amended, and refined, but their class nature and their focus on  the people's interest must not be altered. This legal system  compels all citizens, including cadres, party members, power  holders, and party and state organizations to abide by the law.    Over the past years we have recorded very important  initial achievements in firmly maintaining political stability  and renovating the political system in an extremely complex  international and domestic situation resulting from the collapse  of the socialist system in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,  from the intensification of domestic hostile forces' scheme of  sabotaging our regime, and from the socioeconomic difficulties  which became severe at times. The successful maintenance  of political stability, as it was done in the recent past,  has become a prerequisite for ensuring the success of  the renovation undertaking. Political stability is also a very  basic factor in broadening international relations and  attracting foreign capital investment. Political stability has  contributed to checking the drop in public confidence in the  party and state.    Looking back at the past few years, we can see that our  political system has taken a step in renovating the organization  and mode of operation of the party and state. The sociopolitical  organizations have developed in a more diversified manner, and  their social character and initiative have been enhanced. A  democratization process has been initiated within the party and  in society at large, and democracy has developed further in the  economic, political, cultural, and ideological fields. The roles  of the National Assembly, the mass organizations, and the mass  media have grown markedly.    These achievements would have been impossible if there had  been no achievements in economic renovation. Recent economic  renovation has been the most outstanding achievement of all, and  it is due to economic renovation that political stability has  been maintained and the political system has been renovated in  accordance with the demand of economic development.    However, the achievements in maintaining political stability  and in renovating the political system are attributable not only  to economic renovation but also to other important factors such  as:    -- The roles of various elements in the political system,  especially the role of the party. Our party has been able to set  forth at an early date a correct renovative line that conforms  to objective realities and responds to the masses' aspirations,  and has known how to carry out renovation in a principled manner  and through appropriate steps.    -- Our people and nation, with their tradition of following  the party, have voluntarily accepted the party leadership  because they do not want to lose political stability and do not  want to see the social system collapse. All our people want  political stability so that they can "earn their living,"  develop the economy, and raise their living standards. They do  not want political pluralism and multiparty opposition, which  will only cause social chaos.    -- Our army and security forces, which are always loyal to  the party and the people and have considerable experience in  defending the fatherland and in firmly maintaining political  security and social order and safety, have actively and  effectively opposed the "peaceful evolution" scheme of the  hostile forces.    However, next to the achievements already recorded, there  remain numerous problems that we must continue to resolve.  Specifically, they are the following:    -- Recently, our economic renovation undertaking has only  recorded initial achievements, and the market economy mechanism  has just begun to take shape. There has been considerable  confusion in determining the socialist orientation in the  conditions of market economy, and both the theoretical and  practical aspects of this issue have not yet been clarified.  Development of the market economy and multisectorial economy has  inevitably altered the social and class structure and, through  this, will affect the political system and may cause new  complications in the political domain. In addition, the hostile  forces are taking advantage of our economic and cultural  open-door policy to carry out sabotage with the aim of causing  political instability and eventually changing the political  direction.    -- The regulatory and managerial capability of our state in  the market economic is still weak, which may easily lead to  chaos and confusion in the economy and society and violations of  the law and morality (such as the phenomena of tax evasion,  counterfeiting, corruption, smuggling, and so forth...). This is  a favorable environment for speculators to collude with  degenerate and deviant persons in various state agencies, and  this is the chief, direct cause of corruption and smuggling.    -- A section of the people, including cadres and party  members, and especially the youth, still vacillate in their  faith and their socialist ideal, and in their confidence in the  socialist path.    -- The renovation of organization and of the mode of  operation of the party, the state, and the various mass  organization is still ineffective. Renovation of the political  system is not yet really commensurate with economic renovation,  particularly with regard to organization and the management  apparatus. The state machinery remains bulky and bureaucratic  and has not yet been reformed to any appreciable extent. The  legal system is still deficient and lacks uniformity, the  effectiveness of laws and regulations remains low, and laws and  social order and discipline are still being seriously violated.    The party's activities in the market mechanism still show no  little confusion. Many problems concerning the building of the  rule-of-law state remain unclarified. An operational mechanism  ensuring the unification of power while effecting a division of  labor and responsibility among the legislative, executive, and  judiciary organs in the conditions of market economy has not yet  been clearly established.    -- There have appeared a number of factors that may cause  political instability: the activities of "peaceful evolution,"  sabotage, violence, and subversion of reactionaries at home and  abroad. Although these factors have not yet led to political  conflict, they should not be lightly dismissed; on the contrary,  we must fully perceive their complexity, dangers, and  consequences at an early date in order to take active measures  to guard against, prevent, and overcome them.    From the realities of firmly maintaining political stability  and renovating the political system over the past years we can  draw a number of conclusions as follows:    1. Resolutely and firmly maintain and renovate the  party leadership and do not accept political pluralism and  multiparty opposition. Recognizing political pluralism and  multiparty opposition is tantamount to creating proper  conditions for the enemies of the class to rear their heads and  to contend with our party for the right to leadership, thereby  causing political instability and sabotaging and toppling our  regime.    2. Correctly combine economic renovation and political  renovation, using economic renovation as the basis and  political renovation as the key link. When we say using economic  renovation as the basis we mean that political renovation must  proceed from the economy and in accordance with the demand of  economic development. However, this does not mean that political  renovation is dependent on economic renovation in a mechanical,  totally passive manner as "the tail" of economic renovation; on  the contrary, politics must play an active role  because it is a subjective factor. When resolving economic  issues we should have correct political viewpoints. Therefore,  to carry out economic renovation there must be at least some  political renovation and some renovation of the economic  thinking among the basic elements of the the political system,  namely the party and state. For this reason, economic renovation  is possible only if there is a gradual political renovation; we  must take the initiative in gradually unscrambling  each link of the political system to create proper conditions  for economic renovation. For this reason, Lenin on the one hand  regarded politics as the concentrated manifestation of economy  and on the other hand held that politics must take precedence  over economy.    3. Continue to consider economic renovation to be the  focal point, actively develop the economy, and resolve the  pressing problems concerning the people's living standards.  Through this effort we must continue to restore the people's  confidence in the party and to unravel psychological and  ideological entanglements.    4. Resolve social problems to create a wholesome social  environment for political stability and renovation. To this  aim, we must resolve the burning issues; for example, we must  effectively combat corruption and smuggling, struggle against  obnoxious cultural products coming from abroad to cause moral  "pollution," reduce social injustice, create many more jobs for  the people, limit the division between the rich and the poor,  and satisfactorily resolve the land issue in the countryside to  avoid turning it into a "hot point" likely to cause social  explosions. We must heighten vigilance against the "peaceful  evolution" scheme and resolutely suppress sabotage, rebellious,  and subversive activities of the reactionaries at home and  abroad.</p>

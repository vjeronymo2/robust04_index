			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A plan for pensions A FRIEND worked part-time without contributions to an occupational pension for several years to April 1987. From 1984 to 1987 she made contributions to a personal pension, and backdated contributions to 1977. She received refunds from the Inland Revenue. The amounts varied but were always far less than the maximum permitted. She ceased the payments to the private pension in 1987, when her employer gave her a full-time job with a pension. Recently her employer has given her the chance to contribute extra to backdated her occupational pension over some of the years for which she has already contributed to a personal pension. Should she or her employer approach the Revenue? As she did not use the full allowance for her personal pension can she either: (a) make up the balance through the occupational scheme and, if so, is the limit the same as for the personal pension, or, (b) could she refund the tax rebates received from the Revenue for her personal pension and have her occupational pension back-dated to the full extent allowed? Presumably your friend is being given the option to pay additional voluntary contributions (AVC) under her present scheme. Neither your friend nor the employer need to go back to the Revenue in respect of past benefits because its rules are clear on this. Your friend can get relief from AVCs so long as the total of her ordinary scheme contributions plus AVCs does not exceed 15 per cent of her taxable earnings from the job. However, if she pays AVCs at the maximum rate and this produces a total pension in excess of the limits then the excess would be refunded less tax when she retires. Given the substantial amount of unpensioned back service this is unlikely, but most pensions department will do a rough calculation - which must include personal pension / self-employed annuities - for a member who wishes to pay AVCs. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

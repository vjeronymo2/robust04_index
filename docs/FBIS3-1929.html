Li, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central  Committee  of the Chinese Communist Party, made the remark at today's  opening of a symposium on the educational thoughts of Deng  Xiaoping.    He said that the study, publicizing and implementing of the  educational thoughts of Deng Xiaoping are also main conditions  for party and government leaders at all levels to enhance their  competence to exercise leadership over China's modernization  drive.    The symposium, which was sponsored by the Research Center of  Educational Development of the State Education Commission, has  the purpose of studying and understanding the educational  thoughts of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and discussing how to  implement "outlines of educational reform and development in  China".    In his speech, Vice-Premier Li said that education made up  an  important part of Deng Xiaoping's theory. In probing into ways  for solidifying, developing and building socialism, Deng  Xiaoping had treated education as one of strategic issues which  will be of vital importance to the overall situation of China's  socialist construction and the historical fate of socialism.    He had carried out concentrated investigations into it, and  had formed educational theories with Chinese characteristics,  which had developed into a scientific theoretical basis and  powerful ideological weapon for guiding China's educational  reform and development.    Deng held in his educational theories that we would rather  exercise patience on other aspects, or even sacrifice some  speed, in order to make a success of educational work. In his  theory, he also pays great attention to solving input in  education, improving treatment of intellectuals and helping  solve practical problems faced by teachers.    He added that for an economically underdeveloped country  like  China, a down-to-earth and unswerving manner should be adopted  to solve practical problems and to achieve a fast and healthy  development of the country's education.</p>

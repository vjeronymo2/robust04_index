			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] After the death of President Habyarimana in a  plane accident on 6 April, the clique in power in Kigali  implemented a plan to systematically exterminate all Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development members and  sympathizers, the sole party in power in our country for the  last 20 years. The carnage was intended to result in the deaths  of all those who do not hold the same views as the dictatorial  clique. The death of President Habyarimana served as a pretext  to launch organized massacres. Today, three weeks after the  incident, more than 200,000 have fallen victim to these  unprecedented barbaric acts, which still continue. To kill so  many people in such a short time is a record in the history of  organized massacres.    Following the tragedy that our country has and is still  experiencing, our foreign media colleagues came to cover the sad  events. But they often come with their pre-conceived ideas, one  such being that the Rwandan problem is an ethnic one. The  dictatorial power has always orchestrated a disinformation  campaign, intended to make people believe that the Rwandan  problem is an ethnic one between the Hutu and Tutsi.  Fortunately, Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] officials have  consistently taken every opportunity to explain the reality of  the situation to the international community. That is why, on  22 April, RPF President Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, during a  visit to Kibungo Prefecture in eastern Rwanda -- a prefecture  totally under the control of the RPF, just like Byumba -- met  with and was interviewed by foreign journalists who were  visiting the disaster-hit region. I invite you to listen to  this interview, however, first I would like to inform you that  the questions were put forward through an interpreter. Colonel  Kanyarengwe began by recalling and confirming that the Rwandan  problem is a political one, which requires a political solution.  [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr.  President,  in case the peace negotiations fail, will the RPF be able to  capture Kigali? If that happens, what are your plans?    [Kanyarengwe] Concerning the negotiations, we think that the  Arusha negotiations are sufficient, since they constitute a  document which was the outcome of a long period of discussions  and compromise between the RPF and the government. We may have  to adjust the terms of the Arusha Accord. Otherwise, that  agreement is enough for us. In view of the pace of events, for  the time being we are taking precautions before entering Kigali.  But we think that, taking into account the pressure which is  being placed on the capital, things will be sorted out over the  next few days. I cannot tell you the hour or day, but we are  sure that over the next few days the fate of Kigali will be  settled. As to the arrangement of an administration after  Kigali falls, that is a question that we will discuss with  survivors of those other opposition parties which were in  existence before this episode began.

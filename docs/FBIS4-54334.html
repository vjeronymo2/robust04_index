			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Ambassador to the ROK Georgiy </F> Kunadze by KBS anchorman Yi Yun-song; Kunadze answers in Russia  with Korean subtitles -- place not given; recorded]    [Text] [Yi Yun-song] How are you?    [Ambassador Kunadze] How are you?    [Yi] I believe ROK President Kim Yong-sam's upcoming visit  to Russia will serve as an opportunity to further deepen and  develop ROK-Russia relations which have been promoted for the  past four years since diplomatic relations were established.  What does Russia expect from President Kim Yong-sam's visit to  Russia?    [Kunadze] First of all, President Kim Yong-sam is like an  old friend, and, therefore, the warmest hospitality will be  extended to him during his visit to Russia.    [Yi] The Russian Government has proposed eight-party talks  to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. The eight parties  are North and South Korea, the United Nations, the United  States, China, Japan, Russia, and the International Atomic  Energy Agency. What does Russia think are the prospects for  resolving the North Korean nuclear issue? And, what efforts is  Russia making to hold the eight-party talks?    [Kunadze] The situation surrounding the North Korean nuclear  issue is serious, and various methods have been sought to  resolve this issue. Russia is optimistic about this issue.  Therefore, Russia has proposed eight-party talks to discuss  stability on the Korean peninsula. Still, this does not mean we  intend to replace the on-going bilateral [as heard] talks with  the eight-party talks.    [Yi] Five North Korean loggers arrived in the ROK on 18 May.  This is a testament to how much relations between the ROK and  Russia have developed. It has been learned that approximately  90 other loggers hope to defect to the ROK. Will there be  difficulties in their defection to the ROK?    [Kunadze] We do not know the exact number of loggers who  want to defect to the ROK. However, it is clear what Russia  attaches the greatest importance to in resolving this issue is  whether each logger hopes to defect to the ROK.    [Yi] The ROK and Russia have failed to reach agreement on  how Russia will repay the principal and interest of the $1.53  million which was loaned to Russia as part of the $3 million  loan which the ROK promised when the two countries established  diplomatic relations. The ROK demands a repayment with goods,  separately from the agreement of the Paris Club, a meeting of  creditors. It has been learned, however, that Russia hopes to  repay with weapons. Would you tell us Russia's position on this  issue?    [Kunadze] Our position is simple: We are ready to repay the  loan to the ROK. We hope to find appropriate ways to do so.  However, I think that the fact that we cannot violate the  resolution of the Paris Club must be put into consideration.</p>

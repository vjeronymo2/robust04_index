			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Penalty over BCCI loss ruled out The two Western Isles council officials who were held responsible for losing Pounds 24m in the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991 are not to be surcharged, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has decided. He ruled that surcharging the two men - making them pay a financial penalty for their errors - would not be appropriate in the particular circumstances of the case. The two officials are Mr Donald MacLeod, who was director of finance for the council, and his deputy Mr Brian Lawrie. Mr MacLeod was dismissed by the council while Mr Lawrie left it shortly before the BCCI crash to become director of finance at North East Fife district council. The Commission for Local Authority Accounts, the equivalent in Scotland of the Audit Commission, recommended that they pay the council 'an amount considered to be appropriate recognising that any sum to be paid can represent only a nominal proportion of the loss'. Mr Lawrie, who was subsequently sacked by North East Fife district council and then reinstated, had sought judicial review of the commission's decision but the case was dismissed last month.</p>

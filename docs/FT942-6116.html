			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Top US Congressman charged with corruption: Rostenkowski may face 'several years in jail' A US federal grand jury yesterday charged Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, the powerful Democrat chairman of the House ways and means committee, with 17 counts of corrupt practices, including embezzlement, mail and wire fraud and tampering with a witness. Mr Eric Holder, the federal prosecutor in Washington, said Mr Rostenkowski, now in his 36th year in Congress, had been guilty of 'a pattern of corrupt activity going back for 20 years' and had 'embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from his congressional expense allowances in order to enrich himself, his family and his friends'. 'This indictment alleges that Congressman Rostenkowski used his elective office for an extensive fraud on the American people,' he said. Mr Rostenkowski is forced under House of Representatives rules to resign his committee chairmanship, and his absence from this key panel is likely to make passage of healthcare reform legislation this year no easier. The indictments were brought after the failure of negotiations under which Mr Rostenkowski would have pleaded guilty to lesser offences and stepped down from the chairmanship of Ways and Means. But on Monday he declared he was innocent of all charges and was determined to clear his name in court. Mr Holder said that if Mr Rostenkowski was found guilty he would spend 'several years in jail'. He said an arraignment in a Washington court could take place within 10 days but he warned that defence motions could delay an actual trial for months or longer. The indictments include charges that Mr Rostenkowski embezzled more than Dollars 50,000 from the House post office by converting postage stamp purchases into cash; that he misappropriated Dollars 40,000 from the House stationery office in the form of gifts for friends; and that he cost the House treasury Dollars 70,000 by leasing cars for his personal use. Mr Rostenkowski was also charged with putting on his pay roll - paid for by public funds - personnel who mostly performed private duties for him and his family. The total cost was as much as Dollars 500,000, Mr Holder said. A statement issued by Mr Rostenkowski late on Monday was unequivocal. 'I did not commit any crimes. My conscience is clear and my 42-year record as an elected official is one I am proud to once again run on.' Fighting to 'regain my reputation in court is a far more attractive option than pleading guilty to crimes I did not commit'. Yesterday, the White House said it would continue to work with him.</p>

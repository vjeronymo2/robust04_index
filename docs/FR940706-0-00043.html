			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Debt Collection Act of 1982 specifically provides for the assessment of interest and, in 1984, the joint regulations were amended to reflect the provisions of that Act. Reference to the ``U.S. Rule'' was properly deleted from the amended joint regulations and a reference to 31 U.S.C. 3717, the statutory provision authorizing agencies to assess interest on debts, was substituted. In this rule, as was done in the amended joint regulations, the obsolete reference to the so called ``U.S. Rule'' is deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in 24 CFR 17.110, a section relating to final decisions on amounts of indebtedness made by HUD Deputy Assistant Secretaries or their designees, paragraph (b) providing that copies of the final decisions will be distributed to the General Counsel, the Office of Finance and Accounting, and the debtors (or their attorneys or representatives if applicable) is revised so that it only provides for copies to debtors (or their attorneys or representatives, if applicable). The change reflects HUD policy that any provisions relating to distribution of documents within the Department should not be included in a regulation designed to inform the public of its rights and obligations. Such provisions are more appropriate in a handbook or other internal HUD directive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the strictly technical nature of this rule, and the fact that the statutory provisions involved are, at any rate, self enforcing, the Department has determined that notice and public comment procedure under Title 5 of the United States Code is unnecessary and is therefore issuing this document as a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedural Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Secretary has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is technical in nature. It effects no substantive changes in HUD programs or policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Semiannual Agenda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was listed as item number 1532 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20435) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612, Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federalism, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that the policies contained in this rule do not have Federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review under the Order. No programmatic or policy changes result from this rule's promulgation which would affect existing relationships between the Federal Government and State and local governments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12606, The Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Family, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule is technical in nature and makes no significant change in existing HUD policies or programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An environmental assessment is unnecessary, since internal administrative procedures whose content does not constitute a development decision affecting the physical condition of specific project areas or building sites are categorically excluded from the Department's National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(k).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 17  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administration practice and procedure, Claims, Government employees, Income taxes, Wages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, 24 CFR part 17 is amended to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 17_ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

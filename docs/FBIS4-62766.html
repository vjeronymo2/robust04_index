			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Yelkov: "If MiGs Could Raise Pollock"] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Bad Luck Army </H5>   You can still remember the time when all military units  without exception were anonymous? They dealt with the anonymity  with military resolve. All the units acquired numbers and many  of them acquired renown: the 14th army, the 12th post....    Many but not all. The 10th air defense separate army made a  serious bid for popularity in connection with the violation of  the air border by a Cessna. But not the Cessna on which Rust  flew in in May 1987. Later: On 29 May 1988 Mattias Rust's  instructor tried to repeat his exploit by flying into the zone  of responsibility of the 10th separate army from the North.  They did not shoot down the Cessna but simply expelled it. The  incident because of the speculative interest in facts of a  directly opposite nature remained unnoticed by the press. The  10th air defense army nonetheless acquired some renown: After  the arrest of a general who was chief of the army rear services  and several of his subordinates. The journalists called the  trial "the air defense case." A renown which is highly specific  and even offensive to thousands of officers honorably serving in  the not very comfortable conditions of the Arctic. Actually, as  the famous cartoon character wisely noted, good deeds do not  bring you fame.    The 10th army includes all the air defense forces units and  formations covering the Russian North from the Arctic Amderma to  Karelia. Hundreds of fighters, powerful radar, and air defense  missiles. Headquarters in Arkhangelsk. Subordinate to Moscow.  During the Cold War its regiments and divisions stood loyally as  a buffer on the routes of strategic bombers to the capital. To  get through to Moscow they would first have had to destroy the  10th army.    The most modern MiGs and missiles were always in the 10th  army. But so were the Northernmost townships and garrisons.    Today a high price has been paid for former priorities. The  state has deemed it unnecessary to maintain radar stations and  airfields in the Arctic. God be with the hardware, but people  went with the hardware: They had destinies, plans, hopes....  On the Arctic islands they have had to abandon considerable  material assets, homes, barracks (they took decades to settle in  and just months have been assigned for the evacuation). Perhaps  the army's reduction will ease the federal coffers? Neither  today nor in the next year or two. According to the figures of  Aviation Lieutenant General Gennadiy Vasilyev, commander of the  10th army, the withdrawal of a few units has cost eight times  more than their maintenance.    The general mood is quite pessimistic. The majority are  holding out but a feeling of futility and uncertainty has  already lodged in many hearts. And that is a terrible state.  It brings any ordinary psychological problem to a dramatic  finale. On 25 april on a small island of the Novaya Zemlya  archipelago Captain Andrey Proskurdin, commander of a radar  company, shot his wife with an assault rifle and then took his  own life. He left no note.    It is not only the regiments of the 10th army that are being  reduced. No one knows what will happen to the army itself  tomorrow. In an attempt to prevent mental ferment tempting  prospects are being outlined for the officers. In newspapers  Moscow generals discuss the creation of military space defense  forces.    Space is all very well. But it is increasingly difficult  for the air regiments to break away from the earth. There is no  kerosine or spare parts. Kilp-Yavr is the 10th army's forward  airfield not far from Murmansk. Colonel Nikolay Ovechkin's SU-7  regiment is based here. The pilots' flying time last year  averaged 30-40 hours. They will hardly fly any more this year.  Is that a lot or a little. In the Saudi Arabian air force a  fighter pilot spends 20 hours in the air. But not in a year. A  month.    Incidentally, Western air reconnaissance operators as though  out of spite are increasing their activity at our borders.    The commander of a Norwegian "Orion" ASW aircraft receives  something like $6,000 a month. Ovechkin's boys, who prevent the  "Orions" from brazenly covering our submarines with  hydroacoustic buoys, at least in Russian territorial waters  (U.S. submariners simply ignore our sovereignty) have not  received a ruble since January. The coffers of the financial  section are hopelessly empty. The airmen are writing letters to  the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office and threatening to go on  strike. And...they are on duty and guarding the border  passionately as though to spite someone.    Major Vladimir Yelgin, commander of the airfield technical  backup battalion, says that he has developed a sixth sense as  yet unknown to science: An inner voice tells him when he should  leave the headquarters for the airfield to avoid meeting the  officers' wives. The women bring their children and go to the  headquarters to ask for the money they themselves and their  husbands have earned. But where is the battalion commander to  get this money?    In the nearby air defense missile brigade commanded by  Colonel Sergey Tikhov, the state of affairs as regards paying  money is similar but here all the scientists have actively been  procuring mushrooms and berries and dry-curing fish since the  fall.    The brigade is armed with the most sophisticated missiles  including the "star" of the Abu-Dhabi exhibition, the S-800  system. Its NATO codename is "Grumble." A most inept name.  Both the men and the system are remarkable ungrumbling. The  missiles have been stored in containers without servicing for 10  years. Such is their design. It must be supposed that is in  case the Defense Ministry's money dries up completely even for  the purchase of food for rations and the troops begin to faint  from hunger.    No, no one here is against peace. Even those whose  profession is preparation for the opposite. But who said that  an insulting attitude toward the men who carry guns is the path  toward peace and stability?</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Police officers in Northern Ireland said they raided 30 homes and arrested 28  people in connection with recent leaks of security files identifying Irish  Republican Army suspects. The Royal Ulster Constabulary would not comment on  British news reports that the detainees were members of the Ulster Defense  Regiment, the locally recruited and mainly Protestant part-time force of the  British army. Charges have not been filed. The raids followed allegations that  secret files on IRA suspects have been leaked to Protestant gangs.  </P></p>

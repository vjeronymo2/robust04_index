			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRIGHT'S TIES TO DEVELOPER KEY FOCUS OF HOUSE PROBE  </P> <P> Beginning with their first chat over coffee in 1963, the friendship of House  Speaker Jim Wright and developer George A. Mallick Jr. has been predicated upon  their mutual drive to be successful.  </P> <P> "He was a young congressman; I was a young businessman," Mallick told The Times  last week, recalling how he and Wright liked each other from the moment they  met. "He was ambitious in politics and public service; I was ambitious in  business. We both had dreams. We talked about our dreams -- you know, how young  lions talk."  </P> <P> A quarter-century later, both men have achieved their dreams. Wright, 66, holds  the nation's third-highest office. Mallick, 54, a wealthy entrepreneur, has  both made and lost millions of dollars in the boom and bust economy of the  Texas real estate market.  </P> <P> But the complex financial and social relationship that has grown up between  these two men over the years is now a central issue of a House ethics  investigation that threatens to tarnish much of their success and perhaps even  deprive Wright of his speakership.  </P> <P> It is estimated by the House Ethics Committee conducting the investigation that  Wright and his wife have received at least $100,000 in direct personal benefits  from Mallick -- including the use of a Cadillac and a condominium. That is in  addition to substantial profits that the Speaker has reaped over the years from  their joint investments.  </P> <P> A key question that congressional investigators are now trying to answer is  whether Wright, in his gratitude for Mallick's largesse, ever used his power in  the House to win legislation or government action that would benefit his  friend. House rules strictly prohibit members from accepting gifts in excess of  $100 from persons with an interest in legislation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deny Using Influence  </P> <P> Both men staunchly deny that Wright tried to use his influence to benefit  Mallick on two occasions at issue -- once when the federal government was about  to foreclose on a $2-million loan backed by the developer and another time when  he was trying to raise funding for the restoration of the old Ft. Worth  stockyards. Mallick noted that the loan ultimately went into default and that  he never found funding for the stockyards project.  </P> <P> "If I benefited, I want to know where?" Mallick said in a lengthy telephone  interview from his office in Ft. Worth. "I don't see where I have monetarily  profited by this relationship. I don't see where I socially have profited. I  have never gotten a government contract. I have not had a HUD grant for more  than 20 years. I've never asked him, his staff or any member of Congress for  anything."  </P> <P> After nine months of inquiries, the Ethics Committee is expected to issue its  findings on Wright's financial affairs soon, perhaps as early as this week.  Many in Congress have concluded that, if the report is very critical, Wright's  leadership in the House could be weakened, perhaps so much that he would lose  his top-ranking post.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Met at Dedication Ceremony  </P> <P> As both Wright and Mallick remember it, they first met 26 years ago when the  congressman attended a dedication ceremony of a shopping center developed by  Mallick in suburban Ft. Worth. Afterward, they went for coffee, hit it off and  talked for more than two hours.  </P> <P> From the start, Wright seemed drawn to Mallick because of the developer's  notable success at making money. At the time, the young congressman was  weighted down by an enormous personal debt that he had incurred in an  unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 1961.  </P> <P> Mallick, the son of a wealthy wholesaler and grandson of a Lebanese immigrant  who made a fortune after starting out as a peddler, already was well  established as a real estate developer when he met Wright. By 1967, he would be  hailed as Ft. Worth's "outstanding young man" of the year.  </P> <P> According to Mallick, Wright asked him during their first chat if he could  invest some money in one of the many land deals that Mallick was putting  together. "I sure would like to make an investment in real estate," he recalls  Wright telling him.  </P> <P> Their conversation led to Wright's first business deal with Mallick in 1965 --  a $5,000 investment with nine others to purchase a piece of property near Ft.  Worth. Even after Wright sold his share a few years later, he continued to ask  Mallick frequently about it -- "how's our investment doing?" he would say.  </P> <P> Other members of Congress who know Mallick characterize him as typical of many  wealthy hangers-on that they encounter in their home districts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seen Drawn to Politics  </P> <P> "He's one of the innumerable people you see out there who just like to be a  part of politics," said Rep. Martin Frost (D-Tex.), who -- like Wright -- has  received many campaign contributions from Mallick. "There are thousands of  these people around the country."  </P> <P> While Mallick clearly likes being identified as the Speaker's friend, Frost and  others insist that the Texas developer has never sought to trade openly on his  relationship with Wright.  </P> <P> "George is a 100% teetotaler, all-American, a good man and a good citizen,"  said Carlos Moore, another one of Wright's business cronies. "He's not a liar  or a conner. I've never known him to drop Jim Wright's name in his life.  Everybody knows he and Wright are friends, but you lower yourself when you  flaunt it. If people want to draw their own conclusions, fine."  </P> <P> Mallick acknowledges that his friendship with Wright is an unlikely one.  </P> <P> "It is a bit of an odd couple," he said. "If you look at it, you wouldn't think  we would fit. He's Protestant, Irish and red-headed; I'm Lebanese, Catholic and  black-headed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Both Intensely Private  </P> <P> Yet despite their many differences, Wright and Mallick both have reputations as  loners and intensely private men. Like Wright, who has few close friends among  his colleagues in the House, Mallick is known in Ft. Worth as a man who would  rather spend time with his wife and five children -- ages 22 to 30 -- than  socialize with the city's other wealthy folks.  </P> <P> Mallick said that he was drawn to Wright initially out of admiration for the  congressman's controversial stand in favor of civil rights. In 1958, when  Mallick was building homes for middle-class blacks, he attended a public  meeting at which he said Wright defended his civil rights stand after a woman  in the audience demanded: "What are you going to do about these niggers?"  </P> <P> Indeed, Mallick himself has experienced considerable discrimination during his  life. His dark complexion has often been misunderstood in a town where there  are few other people of Lebanese heritage.  </P> <P> As a boy, he recalls, he was ostracized by his teacher and other children after  his family moved into the wealthiest neighborhood in town. "The teacher  actually segregated me in the classroom," he said.  </P> <P> In fact, Mallick believes that he is still the target of discrimination. He  said he was particularly upset recently when he heard that an investigator had  referred to him in private as "a short, overweight, olive-skinned man of  Lebanese descent."  </P> <P> In time, the Wright and Mallick families grew close, creating an even firmer  bond between the two men. Mallick's wife, Marlene, talks by telephone almost  daily with Wright's second wife, Betty. In addition, Betty and Mallick's  daughter, Angela, like to go shopping together, and the Wrights frequently  socialize with Mallick's sons, who are neighbors at the Ft. Worth condominium  where they stay when the Speaker returns to his home district.  </P> <P> According to Mallick, he and his wife frequently dine with the Wrights when  they are in Ft. Worth -- either going to a restaurant or gathering at Mallick's  sprawling ranch home.  </P> <P> It was out of this friendship that the idea first arose to put Wright's wife on  the Mallick payroll. After resigning from the House Public Works Committee  staff when Wright became majority leader, she received salaries of $18,000  annually from Mallick in 1979 and 1980 before switching to a position at  Mallightco -- a closely held company that blends the names of the two families  -- for the years 1981 through 1984.  </P> <P> Mallightco, which recently was dissolved, was formed in 1979 when the Wrights  put up $58,000 in stocks and the Mallicks kicked in an equal amount of assets  -- creating a pool of money from which they made investments in everything from  stocks to gems.  </P> <P> Mallick portrays Mallightco as nothing more than "an investment club" among  friends. "On its best day, it wasn't worth a half-million dollars," he said.  "There was nothing to hide or we wouldn't have put our own names on it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Acted as Adviser  </P> <P> Both Wright and Mallick insist that Betty earned her salary from Mallightco.  Wright refers to his wife as "a career woman," and Mallick added: "This was a  serious job. She watched the stocks. She went to numerous meetings with me. She  gave me some very good advice."  </P> <P> Although he denies that he created Betty's job simply to funnel money to the  Wright family, Mallick acknowledges that consideration was given at the time to  how Wright's wife could best earn outside income without creating a conflict of  interest for her husband.  </P> <P> "When she went to work for me, we thought it was perfect -- a local firm with  no interest in legislation," he said. "This was so far removed from Jim  Wright's job, it seemed very proper."  </P> <P> Mallick said that Mallightco hired Betty primarily to avoid a 70% tax surcharge  imposed on the earnings of personal holding companies that have no apparent  business activity. "We needed an employee; Betty was that employee," he said.  </P> <P> In addition to her salary, Betty received the use of a brown 1979 Cadillac,  which the family still drives, and the use of a condominium owned by Mallick's  son, Steven. Before buying the condo in 1988, the Wrights paid $21.67 a day to  use it whenever they were in Ft. Worth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calls It Strictly Business  </P> <P> Mallick justified Wright's use of the condo by noting that he has always  provided rent-free apartments for his employees. "That's the way I do  business," he said. "It was Betty Wright's use of the apartment through the  employ of the Mallick company. Jim Wright was merely her spouse."  </P> <P> While insisting that their arrangement violated no rules, Mallick conceded that  he made a mistake in not dissolving Mallightco in 1987 when Wright ascended to  the position of House Speaker. He said he did not realize that Wright's  finances would be scrutinized so closely as Speaker.  </P> <P> Despite his insistence that he has no interest in legislation, Mallick did  provide Wright with a 25-page report on Texas' troubled savings and loan  institutions in 1987 as the thrift industry was unraveling in that state.  Wright asked him for the report after a meeting attended by about 125 Ft. Worth  business people who were complaining about foreclosures.  </P> <P> In response to the concerns, Wright pressed House Democrats in early 1987 to  amend legislation recapitalizing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.  to require federal regulators to show "forebearance" in dealing with the  troubled thrifts.  </P> <P> Mallick's role as adviser to Wright came into question as the result of a  current lawsuit against Mallick, his wife and son, Michael, stemming from a  $2.2-million loan that they received from the now-defunct Interwest Savings  Assn. in 1985 to develop a shopping center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Fire Sale Prices'  </P> <P> When they made no payments on the loan, the property was liquidated for $1.2  million by the FSLIC and the agency is seeking the additional $1 million from  the Mallicks. The Mallicks have countersued on grounds that the property was  sold at what Mallick describes as "fire sale prices" and that more should have  been gotten for it.  </P> <P> Committee investigators are reportedly investigating whether Mallick stood to  gain directly from the forebearance clause that Wright sought in the savings  and loan legislation. But Mallick noted that the savings and loan did foreclose  on his loan. Moreover, he said, the shopping center loan was not facing  foreclosure until more than six months after he completed his report.  </P> <P> Likewise, Mallick insisted that his efforts on behalf of the stockyards  development occurred long after Wright had already secured $11.8 million in  federal grants for the project in the years between 1974 and 1986. He said that  he would have earned an interest in the stockyards project if he succeeded in  raising enough money to refinance the debt of the private developers but that  he failed to do so.  </P> <P> Trouble is nothing new for a man who by his own admission has made and lost at  least two fortunes in his career. In fact, Mallick suffered a much worse  setback in the economic downturn of the early 1970s, when he found himself  overextended on loans and was forced to sell much of his property, including  Mallick Tower, his 10-story showcase building in Ft. Worth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sued by Bank  </P> <P> Mallick subsequently was sued by a New Mexico bank for failing to repay a  $1-million loan and, although he proved that the bank had failed to credit  payments to his account, the lawsuit prompted an investigation by federal bank  examiners and the FBI. The investigators found nothing, and Mallick's finances  rebounded.  </P> <P> According to court records, Mallick and his wife also have been cited or sued  repeatedly by state, local and federal officials for not paying taxes. In the  last six months alone, Mallick was sued by Ft. Worth for $8,640 in delinquent  taxes, was hit with a federal tax lien for $2,250 and subjected to a state tax  lien for $2,722.  </P> <P> Staff writers J. Michael Kennedy and Bob Drogin in Ft. Worth contributed to  this story.  </P></p>

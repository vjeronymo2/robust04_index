			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: Assessment of teachers a PR gambit Sir, Central government has ordained that over a period of two years, all teachers must be assessed. Similar practices in industry are held up as a model. I have no objection to assessment, provided it is fair and leads to positive results. But it seems questionable whether it will work in education. Three points concern me as a teacher in a state comprehensive school: Given that the assessor will be a member of the school staff, it will be difficult to ensure his or her neutrality. Areas to be assessed - such as classroom teaching, marking, discipline, relations with parents, administration of a department - are to be negotiated between assessor and assessee. Thus, if I, the recipient of assessment, felt weak in any of these categories - I might, for instance, feel weak on discipline - could negotiate for these to be omitted. This is wrong; every aspect of the job should be assessed. What outcome to assessment can there be? There will be no salary increase - a fixed scale does not allow for individual reward - and further training to correct weaknesses is financially out of the question, as schools are limited in their funding from the borough and from central government. So what positive benefit can accrue from this time consuming exercise? It is largely a public relations gambit that seems to offer little to remedy defects in the system.

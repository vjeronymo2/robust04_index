			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- Russia's First Vice-Premier  Oleg Soskovets told a conference in the Kremlin today that his  vision of the state of the national economy was far from rosy.    He pointed to notable changes in the economic situation in  Russia in the first months of this year, characterized by a  further slump in production concomitant with the slow-down in  the rate of growth of inflation, higher unemployment and demand  constraints. No growth of accumulation was recorded in the use  of the gross domestic product, and while the crediting and  monetary policy grew tougher, tension increased in the financial  state of enterprises. The amount of outstanding debts to  suppliers kept growing in relation to the monetary resources on  the accounts of industrial and construction enterprises and the  non-payment crises showed no signs of abatement.    Soskovets stressed that the share of loss-making and idling  enterprises in the industry as a whole kept growing, and the  industrial production slump from January to May went 25 period  [as received] deeper from the same period last year. The  reduction in production was the deepest in the processing  industry and consumer goods production.    Soskovets said the slump in production was no longer due to  the severance of former economic ties but to demand constraints  and structural factors, as well as to the shortage of money at  the disposal of customers. "Stocks of manufactured goods are  swelling, mass-scale production has to be stopped or curtailed  at a large number of enterprises, which results in the reduction  not only of effective but also of physical demand and in the  accelerated spread of paralysis along technological chains," the  vice-premier said.    Soskovets stressed however that far from all enterprises  were  in a crisis. Many of them has adapted to the new conditions of  economic management, accumulated rouble and hard currency  reserves, and are delaying remittances of resources to the  accounts of their suppliers not because they lack money but  because they seek additional profits.    The reduction in the volume of production continued in many  regions of Russia, Soskovets said. Out of the 21 republics  within the Russian Federation only Karelia, Komi, Kalmykia and  Yakutia registered the reduction in output by less than 20  percent. The situation remains extremely complicated in the  regions where processing industries and industries producing  means of production prevail. These are the Central, Volga and  Ural regions, and some parts of the northern, northwestern and  eastern Siberian economic regions.    The pursuance of the policy of the macroeconomic  stabilization has brought to light a number of problems which  have been accumulating in the economy for a long time. One of  the most serious among them is that reforms have not affected  the technological structure of production: most enterprises have  been unable to cut the cost of production, particularly in  conditions of a tougher competition with foreign producers on  the domestic market.    As concerns the social sphere, Oleg Soskovets said "certain  positive shifts" have taken place there since the beginning of  the year. Measures were taken to increase wages and monetary  incomes and improve the provision of pensions. Along with this,  the differentiation in society has continued to increase, and  the situation on the labour market grew increasingly worrisome.  Although formally the level of unemployment in the country  remains quite low at 1.7 percent of the economically active  population, "the dynamics of this process is growing".</p>

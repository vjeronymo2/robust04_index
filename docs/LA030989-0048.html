			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Former Broadway producer Adela Holzer was arraigned in New York Wednesday on  second-degree grand larceny charges that she duped investors out of at least  $1.5 million in oil investments that she actually used to help finance an  upcoming pop opera. The judge in Manhattan's state Supreme Court entered a plea  of not guilty for Holzer, who appeared alone, allegedly because she failed to  pay her lawyer. Holzer, 54, was ordered to return with a lawyer on Wednesday  for a hearing. Holzer was arrested after a wary investor hired a private  investigator to look into her background. She allegedly used some of the money  to finance two pop operas conceived by Tom O'Horgan, "Senator Joe" and "Nimrod  and the Tower of Babel." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia digs into platinum and palladium stocks Russia is digging deep into its precious metal stocks to reap the benefits of record world-wide platinum and palladium sales this year, according to Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum group metals marketing organisation. JM suggests that platinum demand will rise by 7 per cent to a new peak of 4.32m troy ounces in 1994, driven up by the requirements of producers of anti-pollution car exhaust catalysts and jewellery makers. Palladium sales are expected to rise by 12 per cent to 4.735m ounces, thanks to a substantial increase in demand from Japan's electrical industry. Russia, the world's biggest producer of palladium and the second-biggest of platinum, is stepping up exports to provide much of the extra metal. JM in its interim review of the markets suggests that Russian sales of platinum will jump by 17 per cent from the 1993 level, to 800,000 ounces, while its palladium sales are expected to be more than 20 per cent ahead, at 2.9m ounces. These export levels can be sustained only from stocks, suggests Mr Jeremy Coombes, the JM precious metals division's general manager, marketing. Russia's platinum group metals are by-products of nickel production by the Norilsk combine and JM says Norilsk's output has fallen by about a half from the peak (estimated at between 800,000 and 1.2m ounces) reached in the late 1980s. 'Since there is little prospect of increased production from Norilsk in the near term, future sales will depend on the size of the stockpile and the readiness of the Russian government to make metal available to the market,' says Mr Coombes. Only a very few Russian officials have any idea of the size of Russia's stocks and how long they may last. In 1991 a deluge of Russian metal caused great disturbance in the platinum market but this year Russia 'is carefully tailoring platinum sales to meet demand, so its extra exports are causing no great concern,' Mr Coombes says. The Russians do not want to see palladium's price go too high - it recently reached its highest point for five years - because they fear this will encourage substitution by other metals, particularly nickel, he explains. 'So Russia will not let the palladium price race away, but it will want to see how high it can drift up.' JM makes no palladium price forecast but it concludes that there will be a slight surplus this year. It suggests demand will increase from 4.215m to 4.735m ounces, while supply will rise from 4.26m to 4.87m ounces. Platinum supply is forecast to fall slightly, from 4.39m to 4.385m ounces, while demand is expected to rise from 4.03m to 4.32m ounces. This means that the platinum surplus, 360,000 ounces last year, will shrink to only 65,000 ounces in 1994. Better fundamentals and the interest of investment funds in platinum (as part of a general move into commodities this year) has helped buoy up the price, JM says. It expects sentiment towards platinum to remain positive as further advances in demand result from sustained economic recovery around the world and that this will continue to support the price in a range of Dollars 400 to Dollars 450 an ounce during the next six months. Platinum was fixed in London yesterday at Dollars 416.85. Platinum 1994 interim review: free from Johnson Matthey, 78 Hatton Garden, London EC1N 8JP, UK.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The commander of the Rwanda Patriotic Front, RPF,  Major General Paul Kagame, has said the United Nations' proposal  to send an intervention force at this stage amounts to  complicity in the massacre of the innocent people.    In an interview with Kampala's capital radio, Major Kagame  criticized the United Nations for pulling out its peacekeeping  forces at the height of the massacres, and he did not see why  they now want to come back. He said it would appear that they  want to protect those who are carrying out the massacres.    He said the struggle of the RPF to bring the situation under  control is worth it. He stressed that capturing Kigali, on  which the RPF now has a strong grip, might not solve the  problem, and they are trying to bring the situation in the whole  country under control. He said it is now just a matter of time  to accomplish this task. He admitted that many people have lost  their lives in the struggle to end the massacre.</p>

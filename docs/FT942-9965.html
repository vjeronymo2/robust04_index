			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Czechs rule out incentives Czech premier Vaclav Klaus yesterday ruled out any further government incentives for foreign investment in the Czech Republic. Speaking at the opening of British electronics maker AVX's Dollars 30m tantalum capacitor plant, he said that it showed special incentives were not necessary for foreign investment to enter the country. AVX, the British subsidiary of a US electronics component maker which is part of the Japanese Kyocera Group, moved its production lines from a plant in Nuremberg, Germany. The AVX plant, the largest British investment in the Czech Republic to date, employs more than 1,000 people making high-tech capacitors, which account for 30 per cent of the world market outside Japan.</p>

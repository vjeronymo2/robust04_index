			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng today called on all localities to properly handle relations  among reform, development and stability and firmly carry out new  reform measures.    Joining a group discussion with deputies from Hainan  Province  to the National People's Congress (NPC), Li Peng said that in  the process of reforms, it is necessary to discover problems and  promptly solve them.    Li Peng also heard today a group discussion by NPC deputies  from Jilin Province.    Hainan deputies raised proposals on strengthening the island  province's infrastructure, developing its rubber industry and  exploiting its marine resources.    Li Peng said Hainan, as China's largest special economic  zone, has made remarkable progress in reform and open policy  implementation and is one of China's most promising areas.    He expressed the hope that Hainan would make use of its  advantages in location and resources to serve as the country's  vegetable supply and rice breeding bases and quicken  infrastructure development.    The premier also emphasized the importance of maintaining a  high ethical standard in Hainan, China's largest special  economic zone.    With the Jilin group, the premier heard deputies speaking on  enterprise reform, grain production, the opening of border  areas, and the introduction of a share-holding system for  enterprises.    On improving the performance of state-owned enterprises, Li  Peng said it is necessary to give them support by way of  introducing reform measures.    "But, fundamentally speaking," the premier said,  "enterprises  should rely on themselves to find markets for their products and  to improve their performance through technical renovation and  scientific management."    After he left the Jilin delegation, Li Peng met with and  spoke to deputies from Fujian Province.    Speaking of uneven economic development within Fujian, he  said the province should make efforts to narrow the gap between  developed Xiamen, Fuzhou and Quanzhou and its backward  northwestern and eastern parts in a bid to achieve common  prosperity.</p>

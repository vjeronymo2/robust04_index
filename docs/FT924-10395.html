			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Pensions allowances MY WIFE and I recently surrendered a single pension policy held in our joint names. The difference between the premium and the surrender value is several thousand pounds, will my wife's half affect her over 65 age allowance? Without her half of the profits her income does not exceed her 'personal allowance' limit for the age allowance. Therefore, although she would not be liable to pay tax on her half of the profit directly would she indirectly have to pay tax on whatever position exceeds the age allowance limit? Yes: the whole of your wife's share of the chargeable gain is taken into account in calculating her age-allowance clawback, so there may be an effective 12 1/2 per cent tax charge. You will be eligible for topslicing relief in calculating any 15 per cent higher rate liability, but there is no topslicing for age allowance clawback. If you provided the funds to pay the premium, it may be that section 547(1)(a) or section 674A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 requires the whole of the chargeable gain to be treated as your own income. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

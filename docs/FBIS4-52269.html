			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Korean shipbuilders, even  though they have won fewer ship orders than their Japanese  rivals this year, are excelling in terms of price per tonnage of  ships ordered, the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said  Saturday.    In January-March, Korean shipbuilders received orders for  1,011,000 tons at 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, amounting to 1,196  dollars per tonnage.    Japanese shipbuilders received orders for 2,969,000 tons at  3.06 billion dollars for 1,032 dollars per tonnage.    With orders received in April added, Korean shipbuilders  posted 1,299 dollars per tonnage in the first four months, while  the data for Japanese shipbuilders in April are not available  yet.    Korean shipbuilders, who secured enough orders for the  coming  two years already last year, have sought to win relatively more  profitable orders since the turn of the year, while their  Japanese competitors have employed a low-price strategy.    At the price per tonnage, Korea topped Japan by 837 dollars  to 704 dollars in 1990; however, Korea lagged behind Japan with  1,023 dollars to 1,130 dollars in 1991, and with 1,143 dollars  to 1,513 dollars in 1992.    Last year, Korean shipbuilders received orders for 9,519,000  tons at 7.35 billion dollars for 772 dollars compared with 1,231  dollars for Japanese shipbuilders.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Retention of two-tier Devon urged Plymouth will have its own free-standing local authority but the rest of Devon will keep its two-tier council structure under plans announced yesterday by the Local Government Commission for England. The commission's preferred option follows the pattern of other large counties, where cities would be given unitary councils - allowing them control over education, social services and strategic planning - while the system of county and districts would remain intact elsewhere. The plan would leave nine district councils working with Devon County Council, and would cost between Pounds 2m and Pounds 6m to implement. It would generate no savings in the longer term, the commission said. Two alternatives which would involve abolishing the county council were also proposed. As its second preference, the commission suggested that Plymouth, Torbay and Exeter should all be unitary, while rural districts would be merged to form three more unitaries: Northern Devon (including North Devon, Torridge, and part of West Devon districts); Eastern Devon (formed by merging East and Mid Devon districts); and Southern Devon and Dartmoor, which would merge South Hams and Teignbridge with part of West Devon. Costs of this option were put at Pounds 19m to Pounds 23m, with no savings in future. However, a modification which would merge Exeter with Eastern Devon to create five unitaries in total might save up to Pounds 5m a year, the commission said. Similar plans to create two new unitary authorities in Essex, based around Southend and Basildon, while leaving the two-tier structure intact in the rest of the county were also confirmed by the commission. It said this would cost between Pounds 6m and Pounds 12m with no savings, while its alternative of six unitaries would cost between Pounds 26m and Pounds 32m with annual savings of up to Pounds 8m.</p>

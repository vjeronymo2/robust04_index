			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / B&amp;C writ stops creditors getting Atlantic payout A planned payout to the creditors of Atlantic Computers has been cancelled, following news of an impending Pounds 1bn legal claim against the failed computer leasing company, its administrator said yesterday. Mr John Soden of Price Waterhouse, Atlantic's administrator, said he was unable to proceed with plans to pay creditors a first dividend of 16 pence in the pound in June. Instead, payment was 'unlikely to exceed a few pence in the pound'. A Pounds 1bn legal action against Atlantic Computers is being prepared by Ernst &amp; Young, the administrators of British &amp; Commonwealth, which collapsed in 1990 following the failure of its Atlantic Computers subsidiary. The writ is expected to allege that Atlantic Computers mis-stated its financial position when it was acquired for Pounds 407m in 1988. The news of the impending writ has prompted the Atlantic Computer's administrator to serve a protective writ against Atlantic Computers' auditors Spicer and Pegler, now part of Touche Ross. Writs have also been issued against three former Atlantic directors. The purpose of the writs is to indemnify the Atlantic administrators if the B&amp;C action succeeds. The news of the legal action will come as a blow to creditors who have an estimated Pounds 400m of claims. Mr Soden said it could be 'four or five years' before the legal action was resolved. The move by B&amp;C's administrators will dash hopes of a swift payout that were raised when Price Waterhouse recovered about Pounds 70m of an intercompany debt due from Atlantic Computer System, a US subsidiary company. That led the administrators to draw up a scheme of arrangement, a method of distributing cash to the company's creditors that avoids a liquidation, which was approved a few weeks ago. A spokesman for the Spicer &amp; Pegler partners said that they were aware that 'moves have been made on a protective basis' but they were unable to comment further at this stage.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SOVIET GEORGIANS MARK SLAYING OF 19  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of Soviet Georgians rallied in Tbilisi today on the  anniversary of the slaying of 19 pro-independence protesters by Soviet forces,  and burned the region's military chief in effigy.  </P> <P> There was a partial re-enactment of last year's 4 a.m. assault, when troops  armed with shotguns, shovels and toxic gas charged onto Rustaveli Boulevard in  the Georgian capital.  </P> <P> Radio stations broadcast the sound of rumbling tanks and ringing bells.  </P> <P> From midnight Sunday through early today, people carrying flowers and candles  thronged the boulevard. About 100,000 Georgians stood with raised fists for a  silent moment to honor the dead.  </P> <P> Later, demonstrators burned an effigy of Col. Gen. I. N. Rodionov, regional  military commander, in front of the city's Government House, which overlooks  the broad square where Soviet troops moved in.  </P> <P> Nineteen people died in the clash a year ago, and another was killed by troops  in a separate incident. Thousands suffered ailments from the gas.  </P> <P> The assault caused a nationwide furor, raised doubts about President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's proclaimed policy of not using troops to stifle dissent and brought  many Georgians into the battle for independence.  </P> <P> The memorial protest Sunday and today had more an air of defiance than of  mourning. Most speakers spoke of the impetus the deaths gave the republic's  burgeoning independence movement.  </P></p>

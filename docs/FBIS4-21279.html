Shaffic Mohammed, Kishore Basdeo and Kenrick Ruyes were  denied bail when they appeared before the Sauteurs Magistrate's  Court in Grenada on Tuesday.    The trio had been detained by Carriacou police since  February  8, when their pirogue experienced engine troubles and had to be  towed ashore.    Police said they discovered that the men were sailing in an  unnamed speedboat, carrying unusually large amounts of cash,  including some U.S.$153,000 and 10,000 British pounds sterling.    The men told the police they were on their way to St. Lucia,  but they were kept in custody pending investigations into the  origin of the cash.    During this time the Grenada police received a call from a  Tunapuna businessman who claimed that the money on the boat was  his, and that the correct sum was $164,500.    Grenada attorney Kenrick Radix who is representing the trio,  said that he successfully challenged their detention by filing a  habeas corpus application on their behalf on February 11.    However, the men were not released until February 14.    As soon as they were released, he said, they were arrested  and charged with drug trafficking in Grenada, drug trafficking  in St. Lucia and drug trafficking in Trinidad, and unlawful  possession of U.S.$153,000 and 10,000 British pounds, being the  proceeds of drug trafficking.    The cases were adjourned to February 22.</p>

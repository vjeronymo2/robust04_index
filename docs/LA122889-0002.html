Livingston, 84, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter whose Business  Outlook column appeared in more than 50 newspapers across the country twice  each week. Livingston started his column in 1945 and used the Philadelphia  Inquirer as his base from 1972 until his death. The Inquirer said that  Livingston also compiled a twice-yearly survey of economists across the country  and that it was one of the nation's first consensus economic forecasts. He won  his Pulitzer in 1964 for a series of articles titled "The Power Pull of the  Dollar." They described how Communist countries, particularly those of Eastern  Europe, were being pulled toward the West by a variety of economic forces. In  Pipersville, Pa., on Monday.  </P></p>

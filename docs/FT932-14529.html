			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Insurers seek curbson scrip dividends ONE OF Britain's largest shareholder groups is seeking a meeting with the Confederation of British Industry to voice concern about the trend for companies to offer dividends in the form of shares rather than cash. The investment committee of the Association of British Insurers last week discussed the spate of so-called enhanced scrip dividends issued by seven large corporations in the past three weeks. The ABI wants CBI members to agree that the use of enhanced scrip dividends should be limited to the current year and to those companies with significant tax problems. ABI members fear the consequences of some companies increasing the number of shares in issue. 'They are increasing the amount of equity that they must service and limiting the scope for future dividend increases,' one committee member said. The scrip dividends are expected to increase each company's outstanding share capital by 2.6 to 5.5 per cent. If shareholders choose the cash option, their percentage holding in the company will fall. Furthermore, many large shareholders, such as life insurers and pension funds, rely on dividend cash flow to meet liabilities and may feel unable to take up the enhanced scrip offer. The ABI will also press the stock exchange for a new rule barring companies from announcing enhanced scrip dividends after the ex-dividend date. Investors who sell shares after the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive the dividend payment. Accordingly, the share price normally falls after the ex-dividend date because new buyers do not receive the dividend. But news of enhanced scrip issues causes the share price to rise. Some investors may have sold shares after the ex-dividend date but before news of the enhanced scrip. This, argues the ABI, means those investors sold at a price which was lower than it should have been. In enhanced scrip dividends, companies offer shareholders an option to receive a dividend in shares that is 50 per cent higher than the value of the cash dividend.

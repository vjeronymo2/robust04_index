			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: US consortium ups Learmonth Burchett stake Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems, the USM-quoted computer services company, is acting to ensure that a greater proportion of its capital is held by US investors. Mr Roger Learmonth and Mr Rainer Burchett are selling shares and, with their families and related trusts, granting options to a US consortium led by Bessemer Venture Partners III which will increase its holding to 19.4 per cent. The consortium is being offered 975,000 shares at 85p and options on a further 1.03m at the same price. The deal will leave Mr Burchett with a holding of 16.6 per cent and Mr Learmonth with 11.3 per cent. The shares were unchanged yesterday at 94p. The move follows a rights issue, underwritten by the consortium, which left it with a 10.2 per cent stake. 'This was considerably less than they had hoped for,' said L&amp;B, which wants to increase its US shareholders as it moves its focus across the Atlantic.</p>

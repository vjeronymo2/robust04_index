If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Code shall not apply to the proposed guarantee by the Bank to an employee benefit plan that retains the Manager as investment manager for such plan (the Plan) of the value of the Plan's principal investment with the Manager, provided that each of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) the fiduciaries of the Plan who are responsible for the selection and retention of the Manager as investment manager for the Plan, and for the selection of the guarantee from the Bank, are independent of the Manager, the Bank, and their affiliates; (2) no separate fee or remuneration is payable by the Plan or any other person to the Manager, the Bank, or any of their affiliates for the guarantee; (3) the Plan is entitled to cancel the investment management agreement with the Manager, and/or the guarantee provided by the Bank, at any time upon reasonable notice; (4) the Agreement between each Plan and the Manager and the Bank will be amended to provide that, for purposes of enforcing the Bank's guarantee, the determination of the value of a Plan's assets under the Manager's investment management at any relevant time shall be made pursuant to objective standards determined jointly by the Manager and the Plan's custodian, which is the bank or other entity holding the assets of the Plan or other Plan fiduciary responsible for causing the Plan to enter into the Agreement; (5) however, if the Manager and the Plan's custodian are unable to agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser to make this determination; if they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each select a qualified appraiser and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot agree, by a third qualified appraiser designated by the two appraisers, and all such appraisers will be independent of the Manager; and (6) the investment management agreement between each Plan and the Manager and the Bank will provide (a) that income from any lending from a Plan's account will be credited to the Plan's account and not to the Manager's account, and (b) that no lending of this type will occur under circumstances where the borrower is a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to the Plan unless the conditions of Prohibited Transaction Exemptions 81-6 (52 FR 18754, May 19, 1987) and 82-63 (47 FR 14084, April 6, 1982, as corrected by 47 FR 16437, April 16, 1982)] are satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of this proposed exemption, the term ``affiliate'' of another person means any person directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such person, provided that the Manager shall not be deemed an affiliate of another person solely because the Manager has investment management authority or discretion over the assets of the other person. For purposes of the foregoing, the term ``control'' means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a person other than an individual. Further, for purposes of this proposed exemption, a Plan fiduciary shall be deemed ``independent'' of a person only if: (1) the fiduciary is not an affiliate, as defined above, of such person; and (2) the fiduciary has no other relationship to or interest in such persons that might affect the exercise of such fiduciary's best judgment as a fiduciary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Facts and Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Bank is a bank organized under the laws of the Republic of France and is a subsidiary of Compagnie Financiere de Paribas, represented to be one of the world's leading banking and financial groups. The Bank, through its subsidiaries, branches and offices, operates in over 60 countries, including the United States, spanning the whole range of banking activities. The Bank's operations are structured in four principal groups: corporate banking, capital markets, corporate advisory services, and investment management. As of December 31, 1990, the Bank's consolidated assets totalled approximately FF 568 billion (US $111 billion), with consumer loans totalling approximately FF 176 billion (US $34 billion) and customer deposits totalling approximately FF 228 billion (US $44 billion). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Manager, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, is responsible for defining the Bank's overall investment objectives and managing its pooled investment products (including specialized country or regional funds, diversified growth and income funds, and fixed income funds). Worldwide, the Manager and the Bank's institutional management team had total assets under management of almost FF 55 billion (US $11 billion) at the 1990 year end. The Manager is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and, according to the Applicants, qualifies as an investment manager under section 3(38) of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Manager's principal business activity in the United States is the provision of investment management services for various clients, including the trustees or other fiduciaries of plans governed by the Act. The Manager currently serves in such capacity with respect to five U.S.-based clients, including three Plans, involving approximately US $190 million in assets under management (including approximately US $85 million of Plan assets). The investment media in which the Manager will invest a Plan's assets is generally subject to specific investment guidelines and restrictions prescribed by the Plan fiduciaries, but may include fixed income instruments (such as bonds, mortgage-backed securities, Treasury bills, and commercial paper), options on fixed income securities, forward rate agreements, floating rate notes, and currency hedging instruments. According to the applicant fixed income related instruments are intended to be used as a hedge or as an alternative to bonds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department expresses no opinion herein as to whether or not the Manager qualifies as an investment manager under section 3(38) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Manager and the Bank have entered into investment management agreements with certain non-Plan clients which provide that the Bank will guarantee the value of the client's initial principal investment, if the client does not cancel the agreement before the first anniversary of its effective date and not over 50 percent of such investment has been withdrawn by that date. Mechanically, the Bank would contribute its own funds to the client's account with the Manager, for distribution to the client, in the event the client elected to cancel the agreement or to withdraw funds from the account at a time when the value of such account was less than the amount of the client's principal investment therein. Such agreements terminate after one year, subject to renewal by written agreement of the parties thereto. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

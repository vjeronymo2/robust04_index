			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Bonn postpones UK beef ban Germany yesterday pulled back from an immediate ban on British beef imports but warned that a ban on 'mad cow' beef was now official government policy and would be enforced if European Union agriculture ministers did not come up with a solution at their next meeting in late May. The cabinet has told Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister, that he can impose a four-year ban on all cattle over three years old after final consultations with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The foreign and agriculture ministries and the farmers' union have argued that a ban is unenforceable as British beef can reach Germany via third countries. The ban may also be illegal under European law, but a health ministry spokesman said the measure had been approved by the justice ministry and is 'most definitely legal'. EU agriculture ministers have so far resisted restrictions on the movement of beef and a Bonn official said he was 'very, very sceptical' that after five months of 'very intensive' negotiations any additional measures would be agreed. Mr Seehofer said he had received countless reports that meat imports from Britain had fallen in recent months, given the media coverage of the subject. In 1992, the last year for which figures are available, Germany imported 2,092 tonnes of British beef.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Tuskar chairman under threat from dissident MR Duncan McGregor, chairman of Tuskar Resources, the Irish exploration company in which shares have been suspended since August, faces a move to oust him from the board at the annual meeting on Friday. Mr John Lord, a stockbroker and dissident shareholder, has mounted the challenge by mailing his own proxy voting form to shareholders. Initially he wanted to change the direction of the company, but he apparently now wishes to keep it in the resource sector. This, according to Tuskar is 'an extraordinary about turn'. In his own letter to shareholders yesterday, Mr McGregor countered, saying that Mr Lord 'has no operating experience of the natural resource industry', that his proposals for running the company 'would not generate an early cash flow', and that 'it could be a considerable time before dealings would recommence'. He said the board was 'unequivocally committed to keeping Tuskar in natural resources'. Retrenchment carried out by the board had placed the company in a net cash position, would bring new exploration opportunities to be announced shortly, and put the company in a position 'where it will shortly apply for a recommencement of dealings'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Munir Ahmad Khan] </F>   [Text] It is widely assumed that Pakistan has achieved  nuclear capability and can exercise the nuclear option if and  when in the future a political decision is made in this regard.  This capability has been earned at great technical economic and  political cost. As time passes, Pakistan will be subjected to  even stronger pressures to compromise on the nuclear issue and  roll back or even abandon its nuclear programme. National  interest demands that we retain our nuclear option as long as  India does as it may take India a considerable time before it  agrees to subscribe to the Non- Proliferation Regime for Sough  Asia as has been proposed by Pakistan. During this period  Pakistan has to maintain its nuclear capability. The question  is now can we sustain our nuclear option.    Realistically speaking, pressures on Pakistan will mount and  not decrease with time. The US commitment to non-proliferation  is toughening and not receding. World public opinion is turning  against nuclear weapons even in the hands of nuclear powers and  certainly more and more against the so-called near-nuclear  weapons states such as India, Pakistan and Israel. There is  hardly any difference of views among the nuclear-haves that  further proliferation has to be contained. So we will have very  few or no allies to back us up. We may even be on our own.    The assumption that once a country acquires nuclear  capability it cannot be eroded or taken away is rather naive and  an illusion. While it takes considerable technical skill and  political determination to achieve this, in the first place it  needs even greater effort to retain it later on. France was a  nuclear rebel until the 1980s but the changed international  situation and pressures from its partners in Europe and across  the Atlantic compelled it to conform to the NPT  [Nonproliferation Treaty] South Africa was able to build a small  nuclear arsenal by defying international embargoes over a long  time, but found it politically impossible to hold on to it and  had to surrender 8 or 10 nuclear bombs it had built. Ukraine,  with its 1,600 nuclear warheads, ranks as the third nuclear  power in the world and has sophisticated long-range missiles to  deliver them to any part of the world. Yet it cannot even  service this arsenal. Its economic and security compulsions  have forced it to give up this formidable capability. Even the  UK finds it harder and harder to hold on to its modest stockpile  of nuclear weapons in spite of its imperial longings.    It appears that its is relatively less difficult to climb  the  nuclear ladder but much harder to hang on after getting there.  We should not underestimate the challenges we will face in  sustaining our nuclear option and must prepare ourselves to do  all that it takes to keep it.    While it will become increasingly hard for us to retain our  nuclear option it is relatively easy to lose it. The quickest  way to do this would be to increase our nuclear rhetoric to win  greater public applause at home. This nuclear jingoism which  our politicians and technologists have engaged in to win cheap  popularity has been extremely costly to the nation. It has sent  completely wrong signals abroad and played into the hands of our  opponents. It also provides a ready excuse to India to continue  with its massive nuclear programme. It is, therefore very  important that both the government and the opposition and all  responsible leaders of various parties exercise restraint when  talking about the nuclear issue. This is needed particularly at  a time when the US Congress has started debating a revision of  the Foreign Assistance Act which could hopefully dilute the  Pressler Amendment and provide an opening for the US President  to resume US Pakistan cooperation in the economic and defence  fields.    Even if the Pressler Amendment is somehow miraculously  withdrawn or circumvented it will only be a temporary relief.  The nuclear issue between the US and Pakistan will not be  resolved as the US will continue to pursue its objectives  through other means. India will persist in strengthening its  nuclear muscle and reach posing a growing threat to our  securing. The stakes will get higher and higher. The strategy  we should develop must be one which enables us to keep the  nuclear option open for a long time. This means we should take  immediate steps to reduce our vulnerability to outside pressures  and build up the strength and stamina to resist coercion.    Politically we need a renewed commitment to our nuclear  programme and to maintain the nuclear consensus. The Government  and Opposition have to speak with one voice so that there is no  rollback and no unilateral compromise. This demands a measure  of political maturity on all sides. We have to take the nuclear  issue out of the political areas so that it is above petty  politics.    Economically, Pakistan is extremely vulnerable. Our  dependence on foreign economic and financial aid has to be  reduced. We have to put our economic house in order. This  requires making tough and unpopular economic decisions which is  not an easy matter for any political government. But we can not  expect the aid donors to underpin our economy so that we enjoy  the luxury of wasting funds at home and continue to postpone  economic reforms. Without a strong economy no country can ever  maintain a nuclear option.    In the defence field, we are highly dependent on foreign  military supplies equipment and hardware. India meets 80 per  cent of its defence needs through indigenous production while we  are critically dependent on imports. We have to build our own  defence industry. It will require a bold new approach to  mobilise our internal technical and human resources, involve the  private enterprise and establish the essential infrastructure  for our defence industry which we have neglected so far.</p>

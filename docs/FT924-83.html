			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Reinsurance rates trigger tough talks MOVES TO impose swingeing increases in reinsurance rates in the wake of record losses have lead to unusually protracted bargaining in London as insurance companies seek to renew annual contracts. Rates for all property reinsurances have risen but North American insurers have been asked for rises on average of up to 80 per cent compared with two years ago. Mr Jonathan Marland, broker with Lloyd Thompson, said: 'It's the toughest market in living memory.' He added that a series of catastrophe losses since 1987 had eaten into the reinsurance market's capacity to help direct insurers offset their exposures to heavy losses. The latest of these disasters - Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and Louisiana in August - underlined the industry's growing exposure to catastrophe losses. Claims of more than Dollars 13bn made Andrew one of the world's most expensive hurricanes, nearly three times as big as Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Hurricane Andrew had a direct impact on the US insurance and reinsurance markets, driving some smaller companies out of business and reducing the capacity of US reinsurers to undercut their rivals. This strengthened the arm of underwriters at Lloyd's syndicates and London companies seeking to obtain rate increases. As a result US companies have been asked to pay up to 50 per cent more for their reinsurance than last year, according to brokers CT Bowring, which buys reinsurance in London for four out of 10 US insurance companies. Buyers have also been paying more for less protection. Underwriters are making only between Dollars 100m and Dollars 200m of cover for each customer compared with Dollars 300m two years ago. UK insurers have been asked 25 per cent more on average. One London broker said: 'People are underwriting risk in a way they haven't done in years.' The willingness of Lloyd's underwriters to take a tough bargaining position has been reinforced by the knowledge that a bad result in 1993 could put them on the dole queue. More than 150 syndicates have folded in the past two years and several companies have withdrawn from the reinsurance market. Names - the individuals whose assets back the Lloyd's market - who were members of specialist reinsurance syndicates bore the brunt of the market's losses in 1989, when Lloyd's reported results for that year last June, in line with its three-year accounting system. In the wake of that experience members' agencies - who funnel Names into syndicates - are already running shy of those specialising in catastrophe business, preferring to place members on syndicates specialising in less risky business such as motor insurance. Inevitably, the increases are leading to prolonged haggling between brokers and underwriters. This week Many insurers have still not obtained reinsurance cover. Mr Peter Grove, a Lloyd's underwriter for nearly 20 years, said: 'The market is very, very late. The renewal season will go on well into January.'</p>

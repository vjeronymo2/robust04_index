			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / NUM court threat over pit safety row REFORM of the detailed health and safety legislation governing the operation of British mines, which some private contractors believe is a necessary condition for privatisation, could be blocked in the courts by the National Union of Mineworkers. The NUM has received legal advice which suggests that a judicial review could successfully challenge any attempt by the government to reform the relevant 'management of mines' part of the Mines and Quarries Act. Health and safety in the mines is regulated by detailed provisions in the act, which NUM officials say makes British mines three times safer than mines in the US. The roles of production supervisor and safety inspector are combined in British mines through the deputy - represented by the union Nacods - ruling out conflict between productivity and safety. Reform proposals supported by the government and British Coal have been presented to the Health and Safety Commission. These would abolish the existing deputy function, replace statute with codes of practice and give mine managers much more discretion in applying the rules. Mr Peter McNestry, general secretary of Nacods, which is fighting the proposed changes alongside the NUM, said: 'This is where the real battle over labour relations in the mining industry is going to be.' According to Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining, which is negotiating to buy pits from British Coal, changing existing regulations is a condition of making many pits profitable. He does not believe the proposed changes would lead to a deterioration in safety standards, but they would improve productivity. 'At the moment a hell of a lot of people are paid to do nothing,' he said. The proposed changes are likely to be presented to the government, employer and trade union representatives on the Health and Safety Executive either this month or next but the TUC representatives, Mr Alan Tuffin, the former postal workers leader, and Mr Peter Jacques, a senior TUC official, are certain to reject them in their present form. The HSE has never over-ruled its union representatives on a matter of substance. But the NUM believes that if the government decided to press ahead with the changes in spite of a divided HSE, it could still be saved by a clause in the Health and Safety at Work Act which requires any change to health and safety laws to either maintain or improve safety standards. One NUM official said: 'We might lose the battle over changing working practices but our legal advice tells us that we can hold on to the safety legislation.' That was rejected by Mr Budge, who said that the proposed changes would not be seen by the judges as a deterioration in safety standards. British Coal and the unions are already in the middle of a consultation exercise over working hours, prompted by the Department of Trade and Industry. The NUM and Nacods will resist changes making 10-hour shifts and Saturday working routine. These changes have been accepted in most pits where the Union of Democratic Mineworkers is dominant and at pit level in most NUM mines.</p>

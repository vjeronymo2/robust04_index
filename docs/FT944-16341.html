			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms busy The telecoms area attracted the most concentrated activity in the market, with turnover in the top three stocks, BT, Cable and Wireless and Vodafone, totalling 37m shares. There was also keen support for the two classes of Securicor stock and Security Services. Securicor/Security Services hold a 40 per cent stake in Cellnet, the cellular phones group in which BT has a 60 per cent shareholding. Dealers said the sector had been boosted by recent speculation of a demerger of Cable and Wireless's Mercury telecommunications business, which includes its highly successful One-2-One digital cellular phones business. Any demerger of Mercury is expected to attract strong demand in the stock market and could trigger a rerating of the other cellular companies. It was also said that BT might launch a pre-emptive strike to acquire the Securicor minority holding in Cellnet in the event of a Mercury demerger. C&amp;W, also helped by the expansion of HK Telecom in China, rose 6 to 421p, while BT settled a penny higher at 396 1/2 p. News of a joint venture in France with Generale des Eaux and Southwestern Bell helped to drive Vodafone 12 1/2 ahead to 217p. Securicor ordinary rose 18 to 1463p, the 'A' stock 36 to 936p and Security Services 35 to 780p.</p>

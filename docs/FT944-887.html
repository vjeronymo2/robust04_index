			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / BBC settles over Panorama claims The BBC has paid undisclosed damages to Mr Iginio Santin, a London restaurateur, over allegations in a Panorama programme concerning his role in negotiations over the transfer of the footballer Paul Gascoigne from Tottenham Hotspur to Lazio Roma. In the High Court this week, the BBC said it had not intended to suggest that Mr Santin had acted dishonestly. It accepted that an allegation in the programme that the transfer deal had been concluded before Mr Santin had become involved was false. The BBC's solicitor said it accepted Mr Santin made a 'significant contribution' to negotiations between the clubs.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Collecting: Antiques look better / Detecting signs of a recovery in the auction houses IT IS TOUCH and go but it seems that the arts world, both auction houses and dealers, is nursing the antique market back to health. For some, this is the worst recession since the 1970s; for others it is a welcome re-assertion of common sense after the speculative excesses of the late 1980s. In a way it is easier for the auction houses. Although both Sotheby's and Christie's have shed staff - and profits - they are building confidence by holding fewer, smaller, sales and rejecting anything stale and over priced. As a result they are selling on average 80 per cent by value of their trimmed down auctions. Many lots are going below estimate and there are more after-sale deals, but certain sectors such as furniture, silver and glass, where collectors are basically connoisseurs rather than investors, have sold well, while unrestrained Italian bidding, supported by the Spanish and Germans, has underpinned Old Master prices. British pictures, less attractive to the continentals and with former enthusiasts, the Americans, feeling poor, are still in the doldrums. Two important works by Hogarth, the only surviving oils from his famous series of engravings 'The Harlot's Progress', were unsold at Sotheby's last month at Pounds 74,000 each. Admittedly they were in poor condition but a year ago the estimate would have been at least Pounds 250,000 and the successful bid probably higher. But dealers, their basements heaving with unsold stock, are reluctant to add to their liabilities. The auctions for the really difficult markets, such as Impressionist, post-Impressionist, contemporary and Scandinavian art, have been so curtailed that London in June, when antique fairs, dealer shows and large auctions reclaim the capital's pre-eminence as an international art centre, will be a shadow of its old ebullient self in the auction rooms. Indeed there is criticism that the salerooms are being too cautious - that they need to test the market more belligerently to enable confidence to return. It is the dealers who are showing the enterprise. But then their plight is often worse - they are not well resourced global corporations, but, usually, individuals in debt to their banks and desperate to ease their overdrafts by making sales. Business reached rock bottom in early 1991. The British Antique Dealers Association monitors exports for the Government, and sales of antiques overseas - in cash terms the bulk of trade for most large dealers - were 50 per cent down in the first quarter improving. But, against forecast, no large dealers have gone out of business. Their banks are giving them another few months grace in the expectation of an upturn and certainly there are more enquiries from prospective buyers. European dealers have come to dominate the trade and the possibility of movement in the house market in the second half of the year must be encouraging for the dealers in decorative works of art. The sectors which showed the most frenzied appreciation - notably the later Newlyn School and the Scottish colourists - have disappeared from view, with the holders of such paintings waiting for an upturn - in five years time? Instead big dealers in this sector, such as David Messum, have discovered more modestly priced artists, such as the Edwardian Harland Fisher, to promote. London's biggest dealer, Richard Green, keeps his masterpieces hidden away but has stayed busy selling perennial favourites in the under-Pounds 20,000 range such as Russell-Flint and this week unveils the pretty Parisian Belle Epoque works of Paul Cesar Helleu. Some dealers are pretending that there is no recession. Harari &amp; Johns yesterday opened its summer show of Old Masters, which contains pictures ranking with anything on offer at recent auctions, including works by Dosso Dossi, Canaletto, Murillo, and Gainsborough. While potential sellers are avoiding the auction houses, and their uncertain public returns, the dealers, often relying on generations of contacts, can winkle out interesting works. Arthur Ackermann is offering a 1760s view by Samuel Scott of Alexander Pope's long demolished villa at Twickenham which has been out of the UK for 60 years. It is part of 'The Pleasures of Observation', covering British paintings over three centuries. Of course this is an excellent time to buy art. Salerooms - after the auction - and dealers are amenable to offers. Only those forced to sell will be offering their antiques but the hard pressed trade must let good things go cheaply. There are even new operators setting up shop. Art Collection, of Elystan Street, has been established by ex-City men to offer a wide range of works of art priced between Pounds 50 and Pounds 1,250, basically for home decoration. Their prices could look cheap in two years time.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alfredo Carquez Saavedra] </F>   [Text] Only 5 percent of Venezuela's corporations pay what  they really owe in income taxes.    This is because most companies declare losses every year. If  they admit to making money, they report earnings in the bracket  with a top rate of 20 percent.    This profile, which better resembles a nation in Africa, is  unreal. In Venezuela, it is simply a matter of not paying taxes  because of loopholes in the law and because the agency that does  the collecting has also fallen victim to the crisis.    These are the conclusions of Gustavo Garcia, who teaches at  the Institute of Higher Administrative Studies (IESA). Garcia  recently completed an investigation of the Venezuelan tax system  for the World Bank.    "Corporations pose a very serious problem," he said. "Tax  evasion rates are extremely high. Some 23 percent of the  businesses that file returns claim losses. This is happening in  a business world of some 250,000 corporate entities."    "In addition, almost 60 percent report earnings of between  one and 500,000 bolivars. In all, 83 percent of the businesses  that file returns are reporting either losses or earnings of  under 500,000 bolivars a year. A scant 4.8 percent claim annual  earnings of between a million and two million bolivars."    Garcia noted that the latest version of the income tax dates  from 1991. Under 1991 rules, the rate for businesses that earn  under two million bolivars is 20 percent, not the maximum rate  of 30 percent.    "And if you count how many claim profits of between one  bolivar and two million bolivars," he said, "it turns out that  73 percent of the firms filing returns pay at the 20 percent  rate.    [Carquez] Does this mean that only 5 percent of corporations  are paying what they really owe?    [Garcia] Precisely. This is the 5 percent that reports  earnings of over 2 million bolivars.    [Carquez] But that is unreal. It makes Venezuela look like  some country in Africa.    [Garcia] If it were true, the nation would be bankrupt. The  average corporation pays 281,343 bolivars in income tax, a  figure comparable to the most backwards countries in Africa.    This comes to $3,517 at the 1992 exchange rate. If company  earnings average this little for a whole year, then they are all  broke. In constant 1984 prices, it works out to 29,826 bolivars,  which at that year's exchange rate is $2,983. However, there are  also companies that pay high taxes due to the political and  economic fallout that comes from looking like tax dodgers.    This shows that the margin for avoiding and eluding taxes is  enormous. Many taxpayers do not just break the law. They also  take advantage of all its shortcomings to lower their tax burden.    [Carquez] What must be done about taxes?    [Garcia] Except for oil companies, what you see in the  Venezuelan tax system is a persistent drop in collections from  both individuals and corporations since 1986. This reflects the  extremely high rate of tax evasion in Venezuela.    Evasion slashes potential revenues from corporate taxes by  about two thirds. The rate is lower for individuals, but  figuring out how much lower is far more complicated.    The reasons Garcia gives for tax evasion include: weak laws;  poor administration; and limitations in the tax code itself.  These, he said, "have been building up over time and got even  worse during the latest overhaul."    Garcia called the value added tax and the corporate assets  tax fundamental to the modernization process. But he warned that  major shortcomings remain. They make tax collection more  difficult because the political will is missing to beef up the  agencies that run the Venezuelan tax system.    To make up for lost income tax collections, the government  has resorted to other taxes, and this has led to huge economic  distortions.    "With income tax revenues on the slide, payroll taxes have  gone up significantly. This partly explains the erosion of real  wages in Venezuela and social unrest. Moreover," Garcia said,  "the taxes have not been offset by improvements in the services  for which they were collected."    Payroll taxes have gone up even faster then the rate of  inflation, he noted. The 1989 cap of 3,000 bolivars on social  security deductions first climbed to 15,000 and last year  reached 45,000.    "And even though tax hikes were necessary," he said, "the  problem is that payroll taxes were the only ones that rose.    "The problem is that there is a direct tax on work. This  combined with the system of social benefits makes jobs more  expensive in Venezuela. So companies tend not to raise wages  because it also raises their liabilities. Every increase  triggers a jump of 18 percent in the payroll tax."    Adding payroll and income taxes together shows how much  individuals are paying. "Only those with incomes above 2,000,500  bolivars a year pay taxes comparable to the deductions from the  wages of workers making less than 45,000 bolivars a month.    "Instead of direct taxes on those with higher earnings, they  are imposing more direct taxes on workers. The Venezuelan tax  system has strongly contributed to lower wages by overtaxing  work while losing its ability to collect from individuals."    Once the value added tax and the tax on corporate assets are  approved, Garcia expects they will help ease the tax situation  in Venezuela. That will leave the income tax in need of three  major reforms.    Drastic measures are needed to eliminate exemptions, such as  the one for agriculture, that are still on the books. Slashes  are also needed in the deductions allowed as investment  incentives and in many personal tax deductions.    When the income tax reform took effect, he recalled, the  number of individual taxpayers dropped from 1.3 million in 1991  to only 350,000 in 1992.    "We tax 1.75 percent of a population of 20 million and 5.4  percent of the work force," he pointed out.    Garcia thinks the cap on payroll taxes must go. He wants  this  done in order to benefit workers, not companies, and he wants  tax delinquency to be punished.    "The problem here is that the only sanction with a jail term  is the one against tax collectors who keep the money. It is  curious that in Venezuela violations of the tax laws are not  regarded as crimes," he said.    Likewise, he added, the agency that collects the taxes has  to  be fully autonomous. It must be autonomous administratively, and  it must have its own budget. The way to achieve this is to give  the agency a budget equal to a percentage of "between 2 and 3  percent" of revenues from nonpetroleum taxes.</p>

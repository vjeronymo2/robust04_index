			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If that firm continues to have less than 300 employees, e.g., 275 full-time equivalent employees, for the period of May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, it may file by May 7, 1995, a new notice to claim an exemption for the period from May 8, 1995, to May 7, 1996, for any product for which it sold less than 400,000 units in the United States during the period of May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995 and where labeling does not bear nutrition information or health or nutrient content claims. However, if the firm continues to have more than 200 full-time equivalent employees for the time period of May 8, 1995, to May 7, 1996, the firm will not be eligible to claim a small business exemption for its products after May 8, 1996. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(iv) of the act, within 18 months after that date, it will have to bring the labels of its products into compliance with the provisions of &sect;&sect;101.9 and 101.36. On the other hand, a firm with less than 200 full-time equivalent employees during the period of May 8, 1995, to May 7, 1996, e.g., 175 employees, would be eligible to file a notice by May 7, 1996, to claim a small business exemption for the time period May 8, 1996, to May 7, 1997, for any product that was on the market before May 8, 1994, and of which it sold fewer than 200,000 units during the period of May 8, 1995, to May 7, 1996. Only those firms having less than 100 full-time equivalent employees would be able to file a notice to claim a small business exemption for a 12-month period after May 8, 1997, and then only for products having approximate annual sales of less than 100,000 units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(ii) and 101.36(f)(2)(ii),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a person that is planning to introduce a new food product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into interstate commerce effective August 1, 1994, (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after May 8, 1994) and that has, for example, an average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 50 full-time equivalent employees (during the period of August 1, 1993, to August 1, 1994) may file a notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with FDA by July 31, 1994, claiming an exemption for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product from the requirements of &sect;&sect;101.9 or 101.36 for the period from August 1, 1994, until July 31, 1995, if it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably anticipates selling fewer than 100,000 units of that product during the period from August 1, 1994, to July 31, 1995. As discussed above, the filing of the notice serves to establish the exemption for the food product. If the firm continues to have less than 100 employees, e.g., only 55 full-time equivalent employees, and continues to sell less than 100,000 units of the product in the United States, the firm will be able to annually claim an exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is proposing in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iii) and 101.36(f)(2)(iii), consistent with the provisions of section 403(q)(5)(E)(iv) of the act, that a small business exemption for a product shall expire 18 months after the date on which the average number of full-time equivalent employees or number of units of food products sold in the United States exceed the numbers necessary for a food to be eligible for an exemption. For example, under the provisions of proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iii) and 101.36(f)(2)(iii), an exemption for a low-volume food product for the time period between May 8, 1994, and May 7, 1995, expires 18 months after the date on which sales of that food product exceed 600,000 units, or the average number of full-time equivalent employees of the firm claiming the exemption exceeds 300. Alternatively, the exemption shall expire 18 months after the ending date of the 12-month period that the food product was exempt under &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18) or 101.36(f)(2). This provision will provide to a small business approximately the same amount of time after the eligibility for exemption ends that firms that did not qualify for a small business exemption had to bring the labels of their products into compliance with section 403(q) of the act after the publication of final rules implementing that section of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is proposing in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv) to require that the certification statement include a commitment on the part of the person claiming an exemption that he or she will notify FDA if the number of units of a food product sold, or the average number of full-time equivalent employees employed, by the person exceeds the applicable numbers. Having made such a commitment, a failure to notify the agency that the food is no longer eligible would subject the person to action under Title 18 of the United States Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Modification of Exemption Eligibility Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 403(q)(5)(E)(v) of the act provides that FDA may by regulation lower the requirements pertaining to the average number of full-time equivalent employees or the number of units of food products requirements for eligibility for exemption for any food product first introduced into interstate commerce after May 8, 2002. Under the act, before FDA can lower these requirements, it must determine that the cost of compliance with the lower requirements will not place an undue burden on persons that would be affected by the lower requirements. FDA is proposing to reflect this provision in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(v) and 101.36(f)(2)(v) of its regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

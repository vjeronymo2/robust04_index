			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe must also provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b)(1) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is further requesting Tribes to provide a statement of legal authority from the Tribal Attorney General or its equivalent demonstrating that the Tribe has adequate jurisdiction to regulate the MSWLFs on the reservation. In addition, EPA is requesting a Tribe seeking program approval to demonstrate that it: (1) Is federally recognized; (2) has a government exercising substantial duties and powers; and (3) is capable of administering a permit program. If the Tribe has already demonstrated to EPA that it meets the first two of these criteria in the context of the approval to operate another EPA program, it need not do so again.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also requesting Tribes to provide an explanation of the jurisdiction and responsibilities of all Tribal program implementing agencies (including any State agency acting pursuant to an agreement with the Tribe) and designation of a lead agency to facilitate communications between EPA and the Tribe. These requests reflect the criteria used in other environmental statutes to assess whether Tribes may apply for program approval. If a Tribe has already provided information and/or a legal statement on the Tribe's jurisdiction and capability to operate another EPA program, EPA requests the Tribe to provide only those additional material necessary to support its application for MSWLF permit program approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Regions will determine whether a Tribe has submitted an adequate program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 2. Tribal Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> EPA is extending to Tribes the same opportunity to apply for permit program approval as is available to States. Providing Tribes with the opportunity to apply for adequacy for purposes of adopting and implementing MSWLF permit programs is consistent with EPA's Indian Policy. This Policy, formally adopted in 1984, recognizes Tribes as the primary sovereign entities for regulating the reservation environment and commits the Agency to working with Tribes on a ``government-to-government'' basis to effectuate that recognition. A major goal of EPA's Indian Policy is to eliminate all statutory and regulatory barriers to Tribal assumption of Federal environmental programs. Today's tentative determination to approve a Tribal MSWLF permit program represents another facet of the Agency's continuing commitment to the implementation of this long-standing policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's interpretation of RCRA is governed by the principles of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chevron, USA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Where Congress has not explicitly stated its intent in adopting a statutory provision, the Agency charged with implementing that statute may adopt any interpretation which, in the Agency's expert judgment, is reasonable in light of the goals and purposes of the statute as a whole.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 844. Interpreting RCRA to allow Tribes to apply for an adequacy determination satisfies the Chevron test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States generally are precluded from enforcing their civil regulatory programs on Tribal lands, absent an explicit Congressional authorization or State-Tribal agreement to do so.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> California  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  480 U.S. 202, 216 and n.18 (1987). Yet, under the current statutory scheme, EPA generally is precluded from enforcing the MSWLF criteria as well. Furthermore, Congress has not yet created an explicit role for Tribes to implement the Subtitle D program, as it has done under most other major environmental statutes amended since 1986 (Safe Drinking Water Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RCRA does not explicitly define a role for Tribes under sections 4005 and 4010 and reflects an undeniable ambiguity in Congressional intent. Indeed, the only mention of Tribes anywhere in RCRA is in section 1004(13), a part of the definitions of key terms in RCRA. Section 1004(13) defines the term ``municipality'' to mean; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> a city, town, borough, county, parish, district or other public body created by or pursuant to State law, with responsibility for the planning or administration or solid waste management,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> or any Indian tribe or authorized tribal organization or Alaska Native village or organization[.] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (emphasis added). The term ``municipality'', in turn, is used in sections 4008(a)(2) and 4009(a) of RCRA with reference to the availability of certain Federal funds and technical assistance for solid waste planning and management activities by municipalities. Thus, Congress apparently intended to make explicit that Tribes could receive funds and assistance when available in the same manner as municipal governments. However, Congress did not explicitly recognize any other role for Tribes under other provisions. There is no accompanying legislative history which explains why Tribes were included in section 1004(13) and nowhere else.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA does not believe that Congress, by including Tribes in section 1004(13), intended to prohibit EPA from allowing Tribes to apply for an adequacy determination under subtitle D. First of all, it is clear that Tribes are not ``municipalities'' in the traditional sense. Tribes are not ``public bodies created by or pursuant to State law.'' Indeed, Tribes are not subject to State law except in very limited circumstances.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cabazon <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> supra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Indian Tribes are sovereign governments whose authority is subject only to Congressional approval.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Worcester  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Georgia,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 31 U.S. (10 Pet.) 515 (1832). There is no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to abrogate any sovereign Tribal authority by defining them as ``municipalities'' under RCRA, i.e., that Congress intended section 1004(13) to subject Tribes to State law for RCRA purposes. Moreover, it is a well-established principle of statutory construction that Federal statutes which might arguably abridge Tribal powers of self-government must be construed narrowly in favor of retaining Tribal rights. F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law, 224 (1981); See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., Ramah Navajo School Board  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bureau of Revenue,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 458 U.S. 832, 846 (1982).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that inclusion of Indian Tribes in section 1004(13) was a definitional expedient, to avoid having to include the phrase ``and Indian tribes or tribal organizations or Alaska Native villages or organizations'' wherever the term ``municipality'' appeared, not to change the sovereign status of Tribes for RCRA purposes. Second, given the limited number of times the term ``municipality'' appears in RCRA, it does not appear that Congress intended to define an all-inclusive role for Tribes for all potential statutory purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (5): Group offers a lesson to its suppliers - Profile of Case Communications AT the end of last month Case Communications, the Dowty subsidiary that makes modems, multiplexors and other data communications products, called together 80 of its leading suppliers. It was less than happy about the quality of some of the components it was receiving and their late arrival. Having spent three years radically and sometimes painfully overhauling its own manufacturing facilities, Case would now like its suppliers to do the same. The company has not issued an ultimatum. With a turnover of just under Pounds 100m a year it is not big enough to insist on improvements from its suppliers. Nor would Case's ingrained corporate culture of co-operation and team-working allow it to contemplate such a move. The fact remains, however, that Case will reduce the number of suppliers it uses in the coming years. The company is no longer willing to spend money testing goods it has purchased to make sure they perform to specification. Similarly, it does not want to have to stock large amounts of goods because only 60 per cent are delivered on time. Mr Alex Kachellek, the company's manufacturing director, says that Case delivers 95 per cent of its products on time. Three years ago the figure was 55 per cent. Four years ago the company's performance was not measured. It was sufficient to know that monthly revenue targets were being met and that the company was making a profit. Under these comfortable conditions, the sweeping changes that Mr Kachellek proposed in 1988 were met with many raised eyebrows. Even the six-person team he set up to implement the changes had at least one dissenter at the outset. Apart from improving delivery, Mr Kachellek wanted to make-to-order (rather than to forecast) and in the shortest time possible. The first step, he declared, would be to reduce lead times from six weeks or more to 15 days. As a youngish electronics manufacturer, Case had a solid foundation for the structural changes Mr Kachellek sought. The company understood computers and communication products. They were its business. All 1,200 people employed at its Watford headquarters could use and had access to computer terminals. The terminals were networked so that information generated on its manufacturing resources planning system flowed electronically from sales via manufacturing to despatch. From the start Case fostered flexibility among its people. Divisive practices were shunned in favour of free-for-all parking, a single canteen and monthly pay cheques. Team working and team problem-solving were encouraged. Against all this was the threat posed by competitors in the quickly-changing electronics industry in the Asia Pacific region. Case brings out about one new product every month and the life cycle of these products is only 10 months to two years. Margins are thin. Case had the advantage of a reputation for product quality but knew it had to offer its customers speedy and reliable delivery or they would go elsewhere. Mr Kachellek is convinced that without the changes he started, Case would be sub-contracting much of its manufacture to Asia Pacific. Only a small amount has been sub-contracted and, as manufacturing has improved, some of that is likely to brought back to the UK. Case's products are turned out in nine days. Work in progress on the factory floor is worth about Pounds 300,000 compared with 10 times that amount three years ago. In other words, the factory is much easier to control. Mr Kachellek insists that his managers and staff in the factory solved most of Case's manufacturing problems. Like many manufacturers these days, he downplays the role of technology. There have been no large additions to its manufacturing management system in the past three years, nor has there been large scale automation of the shop-floor. Case's biggest single investment in this period of change was the Pounds 22,000 it spent on a machine to insert integrated circuits into a printed circuit board. 'You don't have to spend lots of money on information technology,' says Mr Kachellek. 'It is easy to take the technology too far and we've done that in the past. Manufacturing should be simple and we all need to be reminded of that.' Since 1988 Case has switched from a centrally run and organised factory to a distributed one. Again it is becoming the fashionable thing to do in manufacturing and it is supported by a similar move from central to distributed computing. Case has separate areas for making printed circuit boards, cables, final products and technical documentation. Each has its own stores. Office-bound production planners no longer tell the factory floor what to make and when. Supervisors decide their own schedule to meet the delivery dates given by the planners. This way of working has reduced lead times and late deliveries but, stresses Mr Kachellek, more was needed to reduce manufacturing costs. Just over 70 people were made redundant three years ago. Since then a further 150 people in manufacturing have left Case and not been replaced. Only 150 people remain in manufacturing. In the year to the end of March, Case reckons that its revenues have increased by about 15 per cent and that it is one of the few profitable companies in the data communications business. Mr Kachellek makes no claims about manufacturing's part in this performance. He is not sure if Case's customers are satisfied but he knows he is not. Manufacturing improvements will continue at Case and, Mr Kachellek hopes, at its suppliers.</p>

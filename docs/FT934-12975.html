			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Markets: Reality of new issues fashion - The Bottom Line SHARES IN Virtuality Group, which makes computer software simulating virtual reality, leapt to an 82 per cent premium when they started trading on Tuesday - making the launch one of the most successful as well as intriguing of the recent wave of new issues. Supported by a rising market, most of this year's new issues are now trading at a healthy premium to their flotation price. However, private investors would be unwise to conclude that all new issues are therefore a safe bet. There were several unusual features about the Virtuality issue, which sought to raise Pounds 9.45m for product development. Institutions worldwide expressed interest in the company, which uses headsets and software to generate a three-dimensional world - or virtual reality - with which people can interact. John Gregory, of the stockbroker Beeson Gregory, said the issue was also unusual in the degree of genuine press interest in company and its founder, Jonathan Waldern, 33, who started the company in the garage of his Leicester home in 1987. Because the flotation aimed to raise only a modest amount, most of the shares went to fund managers. About 80 institutions received a total of 5.9m shares, but this number fell sharply amid heavy turnover as they booked a quick profit and sold to the hundreds of private investors keen for a piece of the action. Offering what might prove to be the technology of the future has obvious attractions. Dorling Kindersley, which publishes highly illustrated reference books, has seen the price of its shares more than double since it was floated last October. This is partly because the company has a stake in another futuristic area , multi-media, which combines CD and computer technology. Picking the right technology is not the whole story, however. Video cassette recorders have transformed how we use television, but Philips and even the mighty Sony both lost out in the battle over which format would dominate the global market. Virtuality has impressive shareholders in the shape of IBM and Motorola, yet even after this week it still only has a market capitalisation of Pounds 79m, making it in a very small player indeed. The fact that Virtuality is still making losses also made it an unusual sort of flotation candidate. One attraction of new issues to institutions in the current market is that most of the companies coming to market have a track record and plausible story to tell, which have been checked by their advisers. So long as the shares are not greedily priced, they therefore present a fairly safe bet for the fund managers. Prices are normally set at a level which give the company's backers a modest initial premium, often because the companies want to attract and maintain the long-term support of the institutions. Two engineering groups which floated this year, David Brown Group and Quadramatic, have already come back to the market to raise money for acquisitions. Gregory says most flotations will be oversubscribed, if they are priced correctly. But even a good company can be shunned if the advisers are too ambitious: 'It's almost always feast or famine.' Stock market fashion can also be crucial. Shares in JD Wetherspoon, the London pub chain, have more than doubled since flotation last October. They might have been thought to attract strong interest from the public then, but the intermediaries' portion was only 79.4 per cent subscribed, leaving the rest of the shares with the institutions. The flotation just missed last year's pre-Christmas rise in the market. Beeson Gregory placed about 25 per cent of the available Virtuality shares with private-client stockbrokers. It is keen to increase the involvement of private investors in new issues, perhaps by some sort of tendering arrangement. New issues can thus offer investment opportunities, but institutions are on the inside track. Private investors who are interested in a particular flotation should check market opinion of the pricing. Above all, they should not be extrapolate too much from the performance of unusual companies such as Virtuality in a bull market.</p>

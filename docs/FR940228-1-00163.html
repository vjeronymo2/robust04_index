			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Issues that the community was asked to address and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community's views:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What information should the Secretary require on the form to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement the specific information required by the statute?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Information should include documentation of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's accreditation or preaccreditation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree-granting authority, authority to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postsecondary education, and State licensure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;With one exception, participants were satisfied that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information currently collected on the Department's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application forms is adequate, and new requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would needlessly add burden. One participant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended a separate application for proprietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Specific categories should be established for different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of institutions and academic functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information should include the names and social  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> security numbers of key administrative personnel and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> board members. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provided that new information required by statute is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected (financial statements, description of student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aid processing at the institution, information on main  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and branch campuses, and information on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's third-party servicers), information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently collected is sufficient. However, additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information should be collected on whether an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's owner has had substantial control over a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed institution that owes refunds to students or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenders. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Should the Audit Guide be revised to require the auditor to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verify the information on the application form?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Participants recommended no changes in the audit guide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [Kansas City, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A minority of participants indicated that there should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be changes, without specifying what changes are needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Section 498(c)(1) addresses financial responsibilities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires an institution to show that it is able to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promised services, to provide administrative resources necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Title IV duties, and the meet all of its financial obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including refunds and repayments to the Secretary for Title IV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issues that the community was asked to address and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community's views:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What information should be required from an institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit the Secretary to determine that the institution provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the services described in its official publications and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No additional information needs to be collected from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions. [Kansas City, San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If the Secretary needs additional information, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary should be able to collect it from data made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available through State and accrediting functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [Kansas City, New York, Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The best way to obtain information would be through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site visits. [New York, Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Department needs to take action on institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with failing financial statements, rather than simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collect them. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The establishment of uniform financial standards would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be difficult, because different standards need to apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to different types of institutions.

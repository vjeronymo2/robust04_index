			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 5 April  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Chief Editor Lashes Out at Security Guards' Conduct    2. Labor Party Leader, Journalists' Trial Begins    3. Cleric Assails Artists' Antiterrorism Role    4. Ruler's Glorification Criticized    5. Cleric on "The End of Israel"    6. Writer Affirms Muslim Brothers Will Survive  <H5>  CHIEF EDITOR LASHES OUT AT SECURITY GUARDS' CONDUCT </H5>   In a 1,200-word editorial entitled "The Sultan's Guards" on  pages 1 and 2, Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn lashes out at the  chief of the State Security Detectives Department, guards from  which prevent cars from using the roads surrounding his home,  arrest children for using fireworks, harass the inhabitants, and  grant themselves the right to take goods from any shop without  paying for them. He adds that three of these guards entered a  refreshment shop for a "free" soft drink a few days ago. When  the salesman asked them to pay, he was not only insulted, but  one fired a bullet at his head and killed him instantly to  punish him for his insolence, Husayn writes.    Husayn asks: If the chief of the State Security Detectives  does not know how to select his guards--who should be the elite  of the police--how can we be reassured about security in the  country?    Claiming that the police are no longer bound by the law,  Husayn says that this horrific incident should be punished on  the political level and then on the legal level. He explains  that police involvement in a battle against armed terrorism does  not mean the police can turn into an armed division that acts  without any controls.    Husayn maintains that the "arbitrary security approach"  pursued against violent groups in Upper Egypt enhances public  hostility toward the security forces. This provides fertile  soil for more counter violence, he says. He criticizes  officials for failing to realize that armed terrorism is a  result of the crisis in the regime, which, failing to develop  the democratic practice, tries to stifle that small amount of  democracy achieved in the press and refuses to listen to the  Islamic pulse of the nation. He notes that television shows the  American soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, yet someone like  Shaykh al-Ghazali and cleric 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahim are banned  from appearing on television screens. "This nation has returned  to Islam. If the authorities do not let it express itself  peacefully within the limits of the law and the Constitution,  how can it expect stability to prevail?," he asks.    He maintains that the authorities rig elections to prevent  Islamists from ruling because they know that "the ruling party  will not survive semiclean elections." He stresses that the  battle to secure clean elections must start now because  "rectifying the electoral process is crucial for rescuing the  nation from its crisis."  <H5>  LABOR PARTY LEADER, JOURNALISTS' TRIAL BEGINS </H5>   An 800-word report on page 1 by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Munim and  Khalid Yunis says that the first hearing in the trial of the  leaderships of the Labor Party and AL-SHA'B newspaper opened on  Saturday "amid a crowd of Egyptian patriotic forces" and "strict  security measures." The report gives an account of the hearing,  at which the trial was postponed until 8 May.  <H5>  CLERIC ASSAILS ARTISTS' ANTITERRORISM ROLE </H5>   In his 500-word column "This Is Our Religion" on page 12,  Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali finds it ridiculous that actors and  actresses who have no knowledge of Islam should be recruited in  a campaign to fight terrorism and teach Islam to the public.   <H5>    RULER'S GLORIFICATION CRITICIZED </H5>   A 500-word column by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus called "The  Natives" on page 12 criticizes the underdeveloped world that is  ruled by "tyrant regimes" for shouting the slogan: "We sacrifice  blood and soul for you, Mr. President." He says the slogan is  welcome when the sacrifice is made for martyrs who fall as they  sincerely fight the Israeli occupier but it is a "living example  of backwardness" if it is shouted in a country full of  "political scandals."    Citing examples of these "scandals," 'Abd-al-Quddus suggests  that the ruler in a backward country achieves an overwhelming  victory by rigging elections, restricting opposition, exercising  absolute authority, and controlling the press, which always  glorifies him. He concludes: "My country cannot take one step  forward under such conditions."  <H5>  CLERIC ON "THE END OF ISRAEL" </H5>   In a 500-word article entitled "The End of Israel" on page  11, al-Azhar cleric and Consultative Council member Ibrahim  Ahmad al-Waqfi cites verses 4-5 of Sura 17 of the Koran,  al-Isra', in which God judged that the sons of Israel would do  mischief twice on earth and be defeated twice. The writer  suggests the first time might have been when Babylonian  Nebuchadnezzar's army fought the Jews, killed thousands of them,  and drove them out of Palestine or when the Muslims conquered  Jerusalem during the time of Caliph 'Umar Ibn-al-Khattab.    He contends that we are now going through the second  episode.  "The Jews set up a state in Palestine and expelled its people  with the help of the enemies of Islam," he says, adding that  their major ally, America, supplied them with weapons and funds  and made them stronger than the collective Arab nation, just  like the sixth verse of the Sura promised.    Citing the same Koranic Sura, verse 7, the writer contends:  The second time, the Jews would be fought and defeated by  people who undo all the mischief that the Jews did in the holy  lands and enter the mosque just as they did the first time.    He concludes by citing Prophet Muhammad's assertion to  Muslims that they would fight Jews and triumph over them and  that a rock would tell a Muslim if a Jew hid behind it and the  Muslim would say: Kill him.  <H5>  WRITER AFFIRMS MUSLIM BROTHERS WILL SURVIVE </H5>   Ahmad al-Malat's 2,500-word article "What are you planning?  You are playing with fire" on page 5 discusses the "oppression  the current regime in Egypt plots by night against the Islamic  current."    He writes: The poor Egyptian people have been afflicted for  40 years with the military coup that "begot rulers who imposed  themselves on the people."    He criticizes those who repeat that there is nothing called  the Muslim Brothers and who deny the Muslim Brotherhood the  right to take part in national dialogue.    Referring to a statement published in the 24 March edition  of  AL-WAFD, al-Malat criticizes former Interior Minister Hasan  Abu-Basha for warning against the Muslim Brothers' pursuit of  power under the pretext of upholding religious principles and  for accusing them of holding an unholy alliance with terrorism.    Giving an account of what he calls the oppressive measures  the authorities adopt against Muslim Brothers countrywide, he  advises the authorities not to exhaust themselves by chasing the  Muslim Brothers, because "they are the rock on which the heads  of those before you were crushed."    He assails those who claim to adopt Islam in spite of the  hatred he sees them harboring for it. He also suggests that  there is restriction of al-Azhar's role and that preaching has  been made exclusive to their "hired hands."    He notes the triumph of the Islamic Welfare Party in  municipal elections in Turkey and accuses the media of playing  down that triumph. He also praises the Islamic current in  Algeria and Sudan and wishes Sudan's al-Bashir success in  pursuing the Islamic course. He notes the "good steps toward  enforcing God's law in Yemen" and wishes the Yemenis success.    He concludes: Attempts to "cut the wings of the Islamic call  will not succeed, because our feathers grow rapidly."</p>

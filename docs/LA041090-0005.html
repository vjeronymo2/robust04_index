			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALAYSIAN RAIN FORESTS  </P> <P> We take strong exception to the thrust of "Malaysia's Native People Feeling  Bite of Logger's Ax" (March 19). The article is misleading and over-dramatic,  and does not give a fair assessment of the role of the timber industry in the  Sarawak forest or in any other tropical forest.  </P> <P> It is important to recognize that native groups in all regions of the world are  in time exposed to advanced civilization, and it is an obligation of society to  make available to those groups the benefits of a higher standard of living. The  Penan natives of East Malaysia are very small in number, and it is unreasonable  to assume that they would not be exposed to the outreaches of a more modern  society whether or not timber harvesting takes place. It is also unfair to  downplay the economic benefits.  </P> <P> On behalf of the International Hardwood Products Assn., we object to this  misleading slant directed at our industry. Rather, we have taken the initiative  to promote good forestry practice and have assumed a worldwide leadership  position to ensure the ongoing preservation of tropical forest regions wherever  they exist.  </P> <P> O. KEISTER EVANS  </P> <P> Legislative Liaison  </P> <P> International Hardwood Products Assn.  </P> <P> Alexandria, Va.  </P></p>

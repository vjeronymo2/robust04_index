			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Detroit, March 14 KYODO -- Japan's Labor Minister  Chikara Sakaguchi assured his Group of Seven partners Monday [14  March] that Japan's so-called lifetime employment system is  alive and well, even though the nation's economy is in the  doldrums.    Sakaguchi, speaking at the G-7 jobs conference in Detroit,  acknowledged that the weak economy has made unemployment an  "increasingly serious" problem in Japan but argued that the  vaunted Japanese employment practice is under no threat of  extinction.    Sakaguchi put up a spirited defense of lifetime employment  in  Japan in response to a "theme" paper the U.S. Government  prepared for the jobs meeting that appeared to challenge the  Japanese employment system.    The U.S. paper, prepared by White House chief economist  Laura  Tyson, argues that the low Japanese unemployment rate -- 2.5  percent last year -- reflects a tendency among Japanese firms to  retain workers even during cyclical downturns.    Tyson described the bloated payroll in Japanese companies as  a form of "hidden unemployment" which she said is "sizable and  rising."    "This along with other changes (in the Japanese economy) are  putting the Japanese 'lifetime' employment under real strain,"  the Tyson report said.    Sakaguchi said Tyson's characterization of the Japanese  employment system is off the mark.    "As a matter of solemn fact, those workers remain employed.  They are actually working at the workplace and drawing their  pay. I think it's not appropriate to describe the situation as  `hidden unemployment'," Sakaguchi said in a prepared statement.    Sakaguchi, the sole Japanese cabinet minister represented in  the G-7 jobs conference, told his G-7 colleagues that Japan's  private-sector businesses are under no "forced obligation" to  retain their workers.    Japanese managers do so, he said, because they believe  employees' "understanding and good will" is essential for a  company's long-term well-being.    Sakaguchi said Japanese employers are by no means abandoning  their lifetime employment system, noting that Japanese firms  usually use natural attrition -- rather than outright dismissal  -- in restructuring their businesses.    "Japanese firms still pay a lot of attention to maintaining  long-term stability in their employment system," Sakaguchi said.    The Japanese labor minister, however, acknowledged that  Japan  itself has a thing or two to learn from its G-7 partners when it  comes to employment policy.    One such factor, he said, is inflexibility in the Japanese  pay system.    Sakaguchi said Japanese firms that give their employees the  assurance of job stability should change their pay system, which  is largely based on the number of years an employee has worked  in the company rather than job performance.    Japanese companies should, therefore, introduce a more  efficient job evaluation system, such as those already  established in other G-7 countries, Sakaguchi said.    Another lesson Sakaguchi said Japan should learn from its  G-7  partners is to foster a job market that would enable workers to  change companies more easily, when requiring a new job.    "At a time when vast changes are taking place in industries  and at a time when workers too are changing their way of  thinking, we too should realize there will be more labor  movement across companies and industries in Japan over the long  run," he said.</p>

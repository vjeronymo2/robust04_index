			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Milk Marque The move today to a new marketing regime for UK milk parallels the experience of eastern European countries forced to switch overnight from central planning to a free market. The transformation will be traumatic, and the consequences will be unfathomable. In the short term, the impact of the change on big dairy companies such as Unigate and Northern Foods looks wholly negative. Milk prices will rise and the food processors will find it impossible to pass the full increase in raw materials costs to customers. This is especially true for products such as cream, yoghurt, cheese, butter and milk powder, where the ready availability of imports will limit manufacturers' scope to pass on cost increases of up to 20 per cent. Fresh milk is not threatened to the same degree by imports, and the dairies have already pushed through higher prices. Despite Tesco's decision to mark up the price of milk by 2p a pint as of today, the brunt of the price rises will fall on consumers who have their milk delivered at home. Higher prices for the traditional pinta will accelerate the sharp decline in this high-margin segment of the market. Long term, the Milk Marque regime may benefit the larger dairy groups. They will get greater flexibility in the sourcing of milk. They will seize the opportunity to rationalise their manufacturing operations, for example, by cutting excess capacity. But the transition to a new order is likely to be a turbulent one, and during that transition shares in Unigate or Northern Foods will tempt only the brave.</p>

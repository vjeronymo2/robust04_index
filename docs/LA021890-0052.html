			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TOUR DE ROCKWELL;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE FIRM OPENS ITS SANTA SUSANA FACILITY TO SHOW THAT IT IS  CONDUCTING NUCLEAR RESEARCH AND ROCKET TESTING SAFELY.  </P> <P> Rockwell International, criticized by neighborhood and anti-nuclear activists  concerned about the safety of its nuclear research operations, dropped the veil  of secrecy Saturday at its Santa Susana field laboratory, opening its gates to  the public for the first time in more than 40 years.  </P> <P> Nearly 150 rain-soaked people toured the 2,600-acre facility west of Chatsworth  in what officials called an effort to prove that the rocket testing and nuclear  research at the site is being conducted in a safe, responsible manner.  </P> <P> "We're doing this because there is an obvious need for us to reach out to the  community and show that we operate in a safe manner," said Pat Coulter,  spokesman for Rockwell's Rocketdyne Division. "We're proud of what we do up  here. This is a national asset, and we get a lot of calls from people wanting  to know more about what we do."  </P> <P> Rockwell has been the subject of accusations and negative publicity since the  disclosure last May of a federal Department of Energy report that acknowledged  the existence of chemical and radioactive contamination in the DOE portion of  the Santa Susana site. The pollution has been described as mostly low-level,  but the report greatly increased scrutiny of the facility and raised concern  among area residents.  </P> <P> The three tours conducted on Saturday marked the first time since 1947 -- when  Santa Susana was established as a rocket testing site -- that the public had  been allowed on the property.  </P> <P> Engineers and experts guided busloads of visitors through the rugged, scenic  terrain, pointing out drab buildings and mammoth towers where engines for the  Apollo missions and the space shuttle were built and tested. Roars from some of  the engine tests have often been heard several miles from the location.  </P> <P> Large, round tanks that could hold half a million gallons of hydrogen gas  loomed over the bus as it cruised the wet roads.  </P> <P> Also included on the tour was the nuclear "hot lab," a heavily shielded  workshop where nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials are handled by  remote control.  </P> <P> The tour guides -- Frank Will, manager of equipment engineering, and Gerry  Gaylord, manager of facility programming at the company's Energy Technology  Engineering Center -- assured passengers that most of the nuclear facilities on  the site were inactive, and 97% of the radioactive contamination in the soil  and building had been cleared away.  </P> <P> The hot lab is scheduled to be shut down in October after current work is  completed.  </P> <P> Although the bus passed through most of the acreage of the test site during the  hourlong tour, passengers were not shown the inside of any building and were  not allowed off the bus until the end of the tour for a question-and-answer  session with company officials.  </P> <P> At times, the tour resembled a visit to Universal Studios. Will pointed out two  boulders on a hillside "that you may recognize. That's where 'The Six Million  Dollar Man' and 'Wonder Woman' were filmed."  </P> <P> None of the activists who had criticized the work at the site attended the  day's first tour, even though a few said they were invited.  </P> <P> One activist, Don Wallace, called the tours "an outrageous public relations  stunt."  </P> <P> Another activist, Jon Scott, who had intervened in Rockwell's license hearings  before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said: "I would love to go in a way. I  would love to have the concession on gas masks. All these folks want to do is  do a song-and-dance about NASA and avoid the contamination part."  </P> <P> Most of the passengers on the first tour were watchful but calm. When Coulter  asked what everyone had thought of the tour, the group applauded.  </P> <P> John Weems, who lives in Dayton Canyon, said he had gone because he wanted to  learn more about radiation and soil contamination. He said a neighbor had  drilled a well near his house, and sodium contamination from the well had  killed nearby trees.  </P> <P> "I wanted to know if the same kind of thing was happening here," he said. "But  it seems pretty safe. They took us to all the places I had read about in the  newspaper, so they were pretty honest."  </P> <P> Robin Barr, who went with her parents, said she was satisfied that the  operation was safe but added, "I think they could build more wells up here so  that the contamination could be cleaned up as they go along."  </P> <P> Another passenger, Elaine Riley, said the safety of the operation was the least  of her concerns.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to see the rock formations," she said. "They were beautiful. Too  bad this place isn't open for hiking."  </P></p>

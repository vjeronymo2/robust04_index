			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER HITS LIGHT POLE, CUTS POWER TO RESIDENCES  </P> <P> The driver of a green Cadillac delivered a knockout blow to a sturdy light pole  early Saturday, cutting off power to about 1,600 residences on the city's  southwest side, police said.  </P> <P> The Cadillac ran off the road at Placentia Avenue and 20th Street at 2:39 a.m.  and sheared off the pole, downing electric lines and cutting power to  residences for about an hour.  </P> <P> And just as police thought they had the mess contained, another driver plowed  through barricades set up at the intersection.  </P> <P> The driver of the Cadillac, Mario Rebolliar, 21, of Costa Mesa, and the other  driver, Luis Fernandez, 25, also of Costa Mesa, were charged with driving under  the influence of alcohol and were arrested at the scene. No one was injured.  </P> <P> Police could not estimate how fast the Cadillac was traveling at the time of  impact, but Police Lt. Gary Webster said:  </P> <P> "It had to be putting along pretty good to knock one of those poles off."  </P> <P> Although power was restored in the area, Webster said it will take at least 24  hours to install a new pole.  </P></p>

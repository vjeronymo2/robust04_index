			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> JAMES DOUGLAS FILES FOR DIVORCE  </P> <P> Heavyweight champion James Douglas has filed for divorce, his wife's attorney  said today.  </P> <P> Robin Stith, attorney for Bertha Douglas, said Douglas alleges gross neglect of  duty and incompatibility. Neither Douglas nor his manager, John Johnson, could  be reached for comment. Johnson's son and executive assistant, John Johnson II,  said the Douglas camp will not comment.  </P> <P> Stith said Douglas filed for divorce Wednesday in Franklin County Domestic  Relations Court. She said Bertha Douglas will contest it. "Mrs. Douglas and I  have not yet figured out what our strategy will be. But we're going to protect  her interests. That's for sure," Stith said. "My client doesn't want a  divorce."  </P></p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Professor ahead in Bogota poll A flamboyant philosophy professor appears to have wrestled the mayoralty of Colombia's capital Bogota from the ruling Liberal party in the biggest upset in Sunday's municipal and provincial elections. Partial results showed Mr Antanas Mockus, beating his Liberal opponent by a wide margin. Mr Mockus conducted an unconventional campaign, placing no paid advertising and erecting only four advertising hoardings in a city of nearly 7m people. He also cancelled all public appearances during the past week saying people were saturated with elections. Early returns from the rest of Colombia showed the Liberal party holding on to power and remaining the dominant political force in this country of nearly 36m people. However, the traditional Liberal and Conservative parties lost a number of cities to candidates backed by civic fronts.</p>

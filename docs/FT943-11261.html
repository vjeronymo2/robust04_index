			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / China suspends listing of new stocks China's beleaguered stock market regulators have suspended new stock listings this year to brake the downward slide by the country's equity markets. China's A-share index for local investors in Shanghai, the country's main exchange, closed at 333.92 on Friday, 80 per cent down from its February 1993 peak of 1,640.71. The decision to stop new listings followed an emergency meeting between the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and stock market officials. It reflects growing official concern at a disastrous loss of public confidence in China's fledgling stock markets. The freeze on new listings covers share issues delayed from last year and those proposed for 1994. The commission had already slowed the listing process but that had little effect on the markets. The CSRC will seek to increase the number of institutional investors and will encourage the establishment of Sino-foreign companies to channel funds into the A-share market, which is restricted to local investors. Among reasons identified by stock regulators for the market volatility is the lack of a solid institutional base among investors. Most investors are private individuals seeking short-term speculative gains. China's securities regulators are also looking at schemes to pump money into 'selected securities institutions to enliven trading'. The latest CSRC announcement made no mention of plans to combine A-shares and B-shares to boost confidence in the market and increase turnover. B-shares for foreigners are denominated in yuan but are traded in US and Hong Kong dollars. Foreign securities analysts say that while merging the A and B-share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen is desirable, it is not feasible as long as the yuan is not fully convertible. In continuing efforts to 'talk up' the markets, Mr Liu Hongru, chairman of the CSRC, was quoted in the official media on Saturday as saying that China would issue Dollars 1bn worth of B-shares for overseas investors in the 'coming years'. Mr Liu said the timing of the shares would depend on 'market conditions' and on companies' preparatory work. He also noted that foreign companies had discussed listing in Shanghai and Shenzhen, depending on yuan convertibility. No timetable has been set for making the yuan convertible, but Chinese officials say tentatively that they hope such a step can be achieved 'within five years'. Foreign institutions, including Japanese investment houses, have been buying B-shares, but those markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen are jittery. Indexes are down by some 30 per cent this year. Regulators are seeking to put the best face on the collapse of the markets. 'The problems that have cropped up in the stock markets are ones in the course of progress,' Xinhua quoted one official as saying. World stock markets, Page 24</p>

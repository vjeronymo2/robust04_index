			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Record results at Bear Stearns BEAR Stearns, the Wall Street broking house, yesterday reported a 57 per cent increase in fiscal fourth-quarter net income to Dollars 78.8m in the wake of strong trading revenues and a buoyant underwriting business. It was the second-best quarterly performance in the firm's history, and took Bear Stearns' earnings for the full year, which ended on June 30, to a record Dollars 294.6m, more than double the Dollars 142.9m earned a year earlier. The firm's return on the equity for the year was 28 per cent, also a record. Bear Stearns said earnings in the fourth quarter were up across all of its departments, but singled out the 47 per cent increase in revenues from trading, especially in mortgage-backed securities, convertible bonds and government securities. Investment banking revenues were also significantly higher, thanks to increased stock and bond underwriting during the quarter. The pattern of earnings for the whole year was much the same, with investment banking leading the way, aided by big contributions from areas including asset securitisation and high-yield/bankruptcy business, municipal trading and public finance, and emerging markets operations. Bear Stearns was also helped during the year by cost-cutting measures, including the move of its clearing and operations personnel from Manhattan to Brooklyn in New York and similar relocations in Chicago, Boston and London. The decision to bring all of the firm's data processing activities in-house was also completed during the year, and should result in a 'several million dollar' reduction of annual data processing costs beginning in fiscal year 1993. Mr Alan Greenberg, chairman and chief executive of Bear Stearns, believes that the firm can improve on its record annual results. He said: 'We have momentum and our job is to try to keep it going.'</p>

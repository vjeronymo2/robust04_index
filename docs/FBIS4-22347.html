			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rustam Arifdzhanov: "The Government </F> Proposes--the National Economy Disposes; Energy: All against  One: The General Campaign of the Branches against the  Joint-Stock Company of the Russian Power Industry Is at a  Standstill for the Time Being"]    [Text] When domestic affairs are not running very smoothly,  war is necessary as an extreme measure to pull out of the  situation. The image of the foreign enemy, whether it is a  person of Caucasian nationality, American thrice-cursed  imperialism, or the Afghan mujahidin wandering from place to  place in an area that is rather remote from the average Russian  zone, temporarily unites society and distracts from local  disorders.    It is the same with economic battles. The VPK [military  industrial complex] can hardly brag about important successes.  Affairs in the fuel and energy complex are far from excellent.  Metallurgists and machine builders are having difficulties.  After uniting, Russian industrialists have mounted a campaign  against the joint-stock company Unified Energy System of Russia  [YeES].    February was a time of especially massive attacks. First  Deputy Prime Minister Soskovets, a VPK favorite, demanded the  removal of the president of YeES, and Minister of Fuel and  Energy Shafranik proposed changing the structure of the  joint-stock company, dividing it into two--the producers of  energy and its suppliers to consumers--and Minister of Labor  Melikyan cited the average wage of power engineers of 130,000  rubles [R], which exceeds that in other industries.    But the reason for the beginning of combat operations was  the  steady increase in rates for electric power. The reason,  incidentally, is rather well-thought out. It is not the power  engineers who are increasing the rates. The Yeltsin edict "On  the Liberalization of Prices" of 1 November 1991 states clearly  that prices were being dropped for products of all branches  except electricity. The state retained the right to regulate  rates in this branch. In practice, 75 regional and one federal  power commission give the "OK" for any change in rates for  electric power.    At the same time, the cost of a kilowatt is really  increasing. The power industry itself is in a difficult  financial position. Consumers owe it R3.2 trillion. The effort  to eliminate the joint-stock company is understandable: There is  a joint-stock company, it is necessary to pay off debts, and if  there is no company, of course, there also are no debts.    Price formation is a special and sore subject. Last year,  coal prices increased by a factor of 14, gas--by a factor of 23,  and fuel oil--by a factor of four. For this reason also the cost  of electric power increased by a factor of 6.5. But even with  this, our rate amounts to only 20-30 percent of the level of  most developed countries. In the United States, for example, the  rate for industry is about 5 cents per kilowatt hour, for the  population--8 cents. The Russian price of electricity for  industry vacillates from 1 to 2.5 cents, and for the population  on average approximately 0.3 cents. Thus, Russian rates are  lower than world rates by a factor of three to four. And, very  likely, it is not the fault of the power industry that the  prices for products of Russian industry and agriculture reached,  and in many ways exceeded, world prices, but there has been no  success in stopping the drop in production. However, the idea  itself of strict price regulation is meeting the resistance of  consumers, especially those that are energy-intensive, such as  metallurgy with its obsolete technologies. And, as a result, the  size of the established subscriber payment does not allow the  conduct of investment in the development of a federal power  industry. But, after all, a number of krays and oblasts of  Russia have ended up today without their own sources of electric  power. Kaliningraders are dependent on Lithuania, Pskov  residents receive their heat and light entirely from Estonia and  Belarus, and Omsk and Novosibirsk rely on Kazakhstan. The  northern Caucasus is generally deficient in capacity.    The stubborn resistance of the power engineers in March  stopped the general campaign. But this does not at all mean that  the military operations have been stopped. It is simply that a  respite has been declared, after which new summons to the branch  war are possible, and pogroms, and fierce battles. The sides are  gathering strength.</p>

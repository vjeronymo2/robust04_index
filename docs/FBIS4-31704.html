			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Laszlo M. Lengyel: "There Are No Major </F> Differences in the Foreign Policy Programs"]    [Text] The coordination of the foreign policy programs of  the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] starts today within the framework of the  ongoing coalition negotiations. Comparing the documents, we can  say that there are few actual differences between them. The  foreign policy section of the negotiations will be mostly a  field of expert coordination, rather than political fighting.  Neither of the programs is an ideological one; they can be  clearly called pragmatic, and both are based on international  realities and interests.    Both parties regard European integration and neighborhood  policy as the cornerstones of Hungary's foreign policy attitude,  and this provides the goals of our foreign economic, security,  integration, and national minority policies.    The SZDSZ regards full NATO membership as the most important  concluding moment of integration; the MSZP puts Hungary's  membership in the European Union in first place. Therefore, the  MSZP regards the Partnership for Peace program as an adequate  step on the road leading to the NATO, stressing that this  strengthens the confidence of the countries in our region toward  each other and creates the conditions for the NATO-compatibility  of the Hungarian defense forces. The SZDSZ does not emphasize  the importance of the Partnership stage so clearly. The MSZP  would use a referendum in the matter of NATO membership, but  this is not so clearly formulated in the SZDSZ program.    Both the MSZP and the SZDSZ are aware of the fact that the  conditions of economic, political, and security policies and  military alliance cooperation with Europe must be primarily  created within Hungary itself; a hasty and unprepared  integration would cause serious damage to our economy. It is  impossible to start a "competition" in this process in our  region and get a more favorable position than others; at the  same time, we must be aware of the fact that Hungary has  recently been present in Western considerations "according to  its weight" and, although this might give the impression of  devaluation, this is actually not the case. However, the  unsettled relations with our neighbors is a factor that hinders  integration and it harms the measure of our acceptance. Looking  at it from both directions, it is important to create a  modernized and attractive Hungary, a desirable partner.    The differences derive from the political habits and cadres  of the two parties. Foreign policy has traditionally been a  success area of the MSZP and, along with Gyula Horn, Laszlo  Kovacs, and Csaba Tabajdi, numerous other theoretical and  practical experts, former ambassadors, and foreign officials can  now be employed. The SZDSZ-shop led by Istvan Szent-Ivanyi,  with its straight strategic line that puts greater emphasis on  principles, will emerge along with the MSZP foreign policy that  will probably be able to react to the changes with great  security.    In Csaba Tabajdi, the MSZP has a considerable expert on the  international standards on the issue of ethnic Hungarians living  beyond our borders and the national minority issue in general.  The Tabajdi-group clearly declared the principle of "national  minority rights in exchange for the border clause," which does  not contradict the idea of the Szent-Ivanyi group according to  which "Hungary does not have any territorial demands that can be  implemented; nor can it have such demands; however, guaranteeing  national minority rights is clearly a European norm." It is a  matter of taste which of these has more argument value and which  is more idealistic, or more practical. (One can also mention  here a pseudo-argument, but the issue can also be interpreted in  the way that the border issue on the other side, and the  situation of national minorities on the Hungarian side received  a psychological weight that led to the development of a real  situation of something in exchange for something else).  Differences mostly emerge in the clear stand in favor of the  autonomy concept of the ethnic Hungarian minorities, because  this appears more clearly in the MSZP. The fact that both  parties think in terms of contributing to the social and  economic modernization of the neighboring countries, economic  contacts that improve the situation of ethnic Hungarian  minorities and generally the bilateral relations, including the  legal conditions (investment protection, avoiding double  taxation, and the creation of special economic zones) takes away  the strength of possible debates. The MSZP is more in favor of  a basic treaty with an adequate content, formulation, and  guarantees; the SZDSZ, however, regards the treaties an  important, albeit not outstanding, element of the means of our  neighborhood policy.</p>

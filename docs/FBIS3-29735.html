LE MONDE recently cried for a "special inspection" of the  DPRK, claiming that a "decisive attitude of the international  community" should be shown.    This is a pernicious propaganda aimed at casting a chill  over  the agreement between the DPRK and the IAEA. It reveals the  sinister intention of France to force "special inspection" upon  the DPRK and take international "sanctions" and pressure against  it.    As was already reported, the afore-said agreement has been  unanimously welcomed by world public opinion as affirmative  developments for a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    France, however, is obtrusively crying for a "decisive  attitude of the international community," ignoring the unbiased  opinion. This is not only an intolerable challenge to us but a  criminal act to arrest the affirmative developments provided  with so much efforts.    Some time ago, the French foreign minister and the Foreign  Ministry spokesman argued that the DPRK's "nuclear issue" should  be "examined" by the United Nations Security Council. France  has called for "sanctions" more than once against the DPRK to  isolate and stifle it, in league with the U.S. right-wing  conservative forces, Japan and the South Korean puppets.    Such persistent moves of France against the DPRK are  apparently aimed at finding a pretext for resuming its nuclear  test, charging the DPRK with the fictitious "nuclear issue."    They are also motivated by its wicked design to encourage  the  United States, a dialogue partner of the DPRK, to confrontation  with us to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks, cause a military conflict  in Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula, profit from a  massive sale of destructive military equipment and strengthen  relations with the South Korean puppets.    We take a serious view of the criminal acts pursued by the  French wuthorities to stifle the DPRK.    If France continues to resort to such insidious acts without  discretion, it would drink a bitter cup.    France would be well advised to clearly see the situation,  ponder over the matter and promptly stop such wicked acts as  doing harm to others.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Poor volume again depresses equities POOR trading volume remained the principal feature yesterday of a UK stock market unwilling, or unable, to move out of its current trading range. Lingering hopes of an early cut in UK base rates pushed share prices ahead at first. But FT-SE 2,550, challenged at 8.37am, proved the best of the day's range and the final reading showed the index some 13 points below this level for a net loss of 1.3. A further half-point reduction in base rates is considered inevitable before the UK general election, which the stock market has pencilled in for April 9. But the latest bout of rate speculation has come from the London money markets, and has been received with caution in the stock market as it awaits the latest UK inflation statistics, due at the end of this week. Uncertainty over both interest rates and impending UK public opinion polls continued to add to uncertainty in the equity sector. Although there were many active features in the market, overall business in equities remained very disappointing for marketmakers. Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail, or customer, business in equities fell to Pounds 690.4m on Monday, the lowest daily total since last November after extracting the half-sessions traded over the Christmas break. Yesterday's Seaq equity volume, which takes in both customer and intra-market business, reached only 432.7m shares, little better than Monday's 426.4m, bearing out traders' comments that 'business was little better'. Nervousness over the fall in genuine investment activity has been heightened this week by reports that another broking operation is up for sale, and by a further management shake-up at Salomon Brothers, of the US, involving its London based operations. Encouraged by Wall Street's firmness overnight and by renewed interest rate hopes in the money markets, equities added 11.5 on the Footsie scale in early deals. In the absence of investment support, however, shares soon backed off and the Footsie struggled to remain in positive territory. Later, London was helped by an early advance in New York but when the early gain in the Dow was trimmed to 6 points in UK hours, the London market shaded lower again. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,537.1, a net loss of 1.3. Traders now see the London market as caught in a trading range between FT-SE 2,400 and 2,550, or '2,600 on a good day', as one trader put it yesterday. Until both the domestic political and economic outlooks become more clear, fund managers appear unwilling to chase stocks, although support yesterday for ICI and for some store issues indicated that they are selective buyers rather than sellers of shares. Traders also said that the institutions had shown interest in second line issues. There was no immediate response in London to reports that Mr Alan Greenspan, chief of the US Federal Reserve Board, had told a US bankers' meeting that the Fed stood ready to ease US monetary policy further if necessary. The London market remained apprehensive over the outlook for Wall Street and for the economic situation in the US. Also overhanging London were doubts concerning the Japanese stock market ahead of its return to trading today after a national holiday.</p>

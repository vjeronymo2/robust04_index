			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TELL TV TIMES: WHICH SPORTSCASTER DO YOU WATCH?  </P> <P> It's World Series time, which means attention is turned to sports. Which  sportscaster is your favorite, locally (such as KNBC's Fred Roggin, right) or  nationally (ESPN's Chris Berman) -- and why?  </P> <P> Here are the responses to the Aug. 26 question: How far should TV go?  </P> <P> TV's preoccupation with sex in the content and dialogue of the majority of  sitcoms smacks of writers trapped in a warped adolescent state of mind. Is it a  lack of imagination or creative ability that continually shortchanges the  public? Thank heaven for the few remaining tasteful programs and for Channel  28.  </P> <P> Bobbye U. Kelly, West Hills  </P> <P> </P> <P> How sad it is that the networks feel they need to lower their standards to  compete for ratings by using common "street" language. They have even put the  words in the mouths of children, which indicates to those watching that this is  acceptable language. These words become a part of the general public's speech  that is unacceptable to many viewers who find such language abhorrent.  </P> <P> Our literary and educational levels have already dropped to new lows. This  language is not necessary nor does it really add to the shows.  </P> <P> Mary K. Goodhart, Monarch Beach  </P> <P> </P> <P> I am a firm believer in: "There is a time and place for everything." There is a  time for adult programs and for children and teen programs. I believe it is  time to start taking care of our children. I know our children should not be  subjected to such frank, obscene language. As a society we should be doing  everything in our power to protect them from such.  </P> <P> Maureen McClement, Laguna Hills  </P> <P> </P> <P> The great classic shows didn't need bad language. Maybe it's a crutch for  writers who can't think of something better to say.  </P> <P> Charlotte Ortega, Saugus  </P> <P> I do not use "four-letter words" in my workplace nor do my co-workers or  acquaintances and friends (except in extreme anger). I personally don't  consider them a necessary additive on TV, and will usually not watch shows that  use them.  </P> <P> J.M. Peterson, Fullerton  </P> <P> </P> <P> Do we have to lower standards to appeal to the less civilized? Do we have to be  crude to make a point?  </P> <P> Look at the ratings. What an example for our children.  </P> <P> Catherine Stuy, Camarillo  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frank language? Realistic?  </P> <P> Never have we spoken, nor our friends and neighbors in our middle-class  neighborhood spoken, the language we hear prevalent on TV series today. Because  of the coarse language we no longer turn to any sitcoms.  </P> <P> Patricia A. Ongstad, Thousand Oaks  </P> <P> </P> <P> Should TV use "frank language?" My answer is NO! A 6-year-old may say "you  suck" without knowing what it means and probably because it was heard on TV. I  don't understand why this kind of "realism" is necessary, and it certainly does  not improve the quality of any show. Why do we want to encourage the use of  vulgarity anyway? I've already stopped going to most movies because of the  never-ending vulgarity.  </P> <P> M. Eiser, Canoga Park  </P> <P> </P> <P> I am appalled and outraged at the use of the vulgarity and dirty language that  is being used on television shows. My family turns off the channel when the  language used is more than we can digest.  </P> <P> To take a small child like Sarah Martineck (on CBSU "Uncle Buck") and expose  her to the filthy language of this world is a crime, and contributes to the  delinquency of a minor.  </P> <P> The Burwell Family, Northridge  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low-life language never adds to a show. Review some of the exceptional shows of  the '60s, especially situation comedies. 'sing young children to promote such  purposes is awful. I'm restricting more shows each year.  </P> <P> Bill Hartman, Cypress  </P> <P> </P> <P> I gave up sitcoms when Archie Bunker flushed his toilet on television, so I  would not watch "Uncle Buck." However, putting garbage language in the mouth of  a darling little girl like Sarah Martineck is disgusting on the part of the  writers.  </P> <P> My husband and I love good police and law dramas and looked forward to "The  Trials of Rosie O'Neill." It was on for 15 minutes. Rosie is no lady and we are  not interested in her foul mouth or her live-in situation.  </P> <P> Marilyn Culbertson, Arleta  </P> <P> Accomplished actors with good material do not need vulgar language to keep up  with the times. Good taste is timeless.  </P> <P> Norma Schumm, Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

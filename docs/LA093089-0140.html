			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIELD GOAL TRIES FAIL; WESTERN EDGES OCEAN VIEW  </P> <P> Using a ball-control offense and taking advantage of some lucky breaks, Western  High School held off Ocean View, 9-7, Friday in a defensive struggle at  Huntington Beach High School.  </P> <P> "We just had a little more luck than they did tonight," Western Coach Jim  Powell said.  </P> <P> Western's luck included surviving a 12-men-on-the-field penalty as Ocean View  kicker Sean Rogers missed a 45-yard field goal attempt with 1:31 to play.  </P> <P> The penalty gave the Seahawks (2-2) a second chance, but they couldn't convert  it. Rogers barely missed the potential game-winner from 35 yards out with 31  seconds left, kicking wide to the right.  </P> <P> Western took a 3-0 lead on its opening drive, converting on a 27-yard field  goal by Gilbert Brito. Western's only touchdown came on a one-yard run by Corey  Manliguines in the third quarter, which made the score 9-0. MIKE ITAGAKI  </P></p>

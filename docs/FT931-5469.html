			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: VW looks to changes in working practices MR FERDINAND Piech, chair-man of Volkswagen, yesterday prepared the workforce for radical changes in working and manufacturing practices, and announced a sharp cut in investments for this year. Capital spending on the automotive business will be cut to DM6bn (Dollars 3.6bn) compared with about DM9bn last year, the company said after Mr Piech told an employees' meeting in Wolfsburg that job losses and spending reductions were unavoidable. The cuts mark a further retrenchment in VW's ambitious spending plans. The group spent DM9.9bn in the vehicles divisions in 1991 and had planned to spend almost DM12bn last year. Although no details were given of where the spending cuts would fall, VW has announced that development of its new works at Mosel, eastern Germany will be scaled back. Mr Piech, making his first address to the workforce since he took charge on January 1, said the group aimed to make a profit this year in spite of an expected 20 per cent drop in German car registrations. The German motor industry was in its steepest decline since the war and the crisis would continue well into next year, he added. He demanded a fundamental rethink and said hierarchical structures had to give way to team work. Every means of improving results would be brought to bear, he said. Costs would be cut, component prices reduced and productivity increased. Vehicles had to be made less complex, with more common components. The aim was to be able to construct the whole model range on a single construction set. This would improve flexibility as well as save costs, he claimed. He appealed for co-operation and said in future, workers would be treated more as individuals and expected to contribute as 'part of the company family'.</p>

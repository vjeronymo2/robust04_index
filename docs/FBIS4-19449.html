			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Einar Koch report: "Kinkel: Do Not Save on the </F> Bundeswehr"]    [Text] An open quarrel has broken out in the government  coalition in Bonn about the future of the Bundeswehr!    Free Democratic Party Chairman and Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel is firmly against plans by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  to reduce the strength of the Bundeswehr from 370,000 to 320,000.    Kinkel told BILD: "The Bundeswehr finally needs planning  security, and for the families as well. In the long run, the  discussion cannot be such that one says: We have such and such  an amount of money, and for that we can afford such and such a  Bundeswehr. If I had my say, the decided strength of 370,000  should be maintained if at all possible. I do see the financial  problems, but in this case one has to reexamine all other  possibilities of saving money."    Ruehe wants to present his concept for the Bundeswehr to the  Bundestag this week.</p>

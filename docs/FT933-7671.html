			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Brazilians curb wage adjustments BRAZIL'S economics team was yesterday celebrating its most impressive victory in the federal Congress to date. The Congress voted by 318:144 late on Wednesday night to pass government legislation granting monthly wage adjustments of 10 percentage points below the monthly inflation rate. The vote brought to an end a battle begun two months ago, when the Congress approved monthly wage adjustments aimed to keep employees' pay fully abreast of inflation. The horrified finance ministry estimated then that such full adjustment would cost the government the equivalent of an extra Dollars 11bn a year on pensions and salaries, based on this year's figures. The change on Wednesday night was the result of frantic lobbying in Congress by government members. Mr Jamil Haddad, health minister, was forced to quit after his party had refused to support the government. In a final push to secure legislators' votes, Mr Winston Fritsch, chief economic policy-maker, presented Congress members with figures to show that inflation would top 50 per cent a month in December if the full adjustment were retained. The vote took place amid galleries packed with trade union members who jeered the result and threw banknotes into the auditorium. Afterwards Mr Odacir Klein, a Congressman from the Democratic Movement Party, which had supported the government, warned the administration: 'This was the last blank cheque - now we must see some results'. A jubilant Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, appealed for patience yesterday: 'We won't do anything crazy such as shock plans, price freezes, dollarisation or prefixing of prices. We will do what is necessary and you can be sure we will reduce inflation.' The Brazilian financial markets yesterday had their best day for months. The main Sao Paulo stock market index closed last night at 85,132 points, up 5,598 on the day.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO NINE SLIPS PAST ST. BERNARD, 6-5, FOR CAMINO REAL TITLE  </P> <P> After much debate -- eight innings worth -- the verdict is in: El Segundo is  the Camino Real League baseball champ.  </P> <P> Pat Llamas' single over a drawn-in St. Bernard infield scored pinch-runner Rick  Clark with the winning run as the Eagles defeated the Vikings, 6-5, and  captured the league title Wednesday night at El Segundo.  </P> <P> The Eagles scored three runs in the bottom of the eighth after St. Bernard had  jumped to a 5-3 lead in its half of the eighth.  </P> <P> The victory assures that El Segundo (21-5 overall and 12-1 in league) will  enter the playoffs as the league's top seed. St. Bernard fell to 17-5 and 11-2  in league.  </P> <P> "We took a vote on the team on whether to be champs or co-champs and it came  out 14-0 that we wanted to be outright champs," said El Segundo Coach John  Stevenson.  </P> <P> The Eagles loaded the bases against pitcher Dan Melendez to start the inning on  a walk, an error and a hit. Dan Manjarrez's single brought El Segundo to 5-4,  and Chris Lane singled in a run to tie the game.  </P> <P> With the infield drawn in and the outfield shallow, Llamas, on an 0-2 pitch,  poked a chopper over third base and into left, scoring Clark with the winning  run.  </P> <P> "It's the best feeling I've had in my life," said Llamas, who had struck out  twice against Melendez. "He had me the whole night, but that last pitch was  right there."  </P> <P> St. Bernard scored twice in the top of the eighth to take the brief lead.  </P> <P> Clark, who improved to 9-0, was in control from the second until the eighth  when he walked leadoff hitter Chris Richardson on four pitches. One out later,  Sean Friedin reached on an error and pinchhitter Phil Ruhl singled home  Richardson. Sean Dunbar's suicide squeeze plated Friedin, who had gone to third  on Ruhl's hit.  </P> <P> But Melendez (9-2) and St. Bernard couldn't hold on, to the chagrin of Vikings  Coach Bob Yarnell.  </P> <P> "I'm more disappointed that we couldn't hold onto a two-run lead," he said.  "I'm sure we'll still be seeded pretty high, but we just didn't make the plays  when we had to."  </P> <P> The game got off to a rocky start when both teams scored three runs in the  first inning.  </P> <P> Clark retired the first two batters but walked Melendez intentionally and hit  Al Ibarra with a pitch. Richardson poked a single to center that scored  Melendez. Ibarra scored when center fielder Erik Evans bobbled the ball and  Grant Hohman then singled home Richardson.  </P> <P> The Eagles tied the game in their half of the inning. Jeremy Carr was hit by a  pitch to lead off and Evans grounded softly to second. Sean Dunbar fielded the  ball cleanly, but Hohman dropped the relay and both runners were safe.  </P> <P> Garrett Quaintance singled home both runners and took second on the throw to  the plate, which was too late to nail a sliding Evans.  </P> <P> After reaching third on a wild pitch, Quaintance scored on Ken Talanoa's  fielder's choice.  </P></p>

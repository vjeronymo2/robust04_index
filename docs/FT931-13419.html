			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Week in the Markets: Price gloom greets coffee talks NEGOTIATORS FROM coffee producing countries gathering in London for a two-week meeting beginning next Monday with their consumer counterparts were given a timely reminder over the past few days of the price of failure in their efforts to secure a price supporting International Coffee Agreement. As New York investment funds resumed the heavy selling that had pulled prices back sharply from recent 12-month highs London robusta futures fell more more than Dollars 100 a tonne and New York arabica's by more than five cents a lb. London's March position, which three weeks ago stood at Dollars 1,023 a tonne, touched a three-month low of Dollars 867 a tonne yesterday before rallying to Dollars 902 a tonne, down Dollars 73 on the week. Coffee traders appeared to take little notice of the producers' professions of confidence ahead of the ICA talks, in which they hope for significant progress towards the agreement of supply management measures to be included in a new pact when the present one expires at the end of September. 'There is a lot of determination on our part to get this agreement at least made viable by the end of March,' said Mr Marques Porto, head of the Brazilian delegation, as he outlined the biggest producer's position in informal talks with other leading producers on Thursday. 'We are prepared to bridge the gap with consumers on some very key issues,' said another member of the Brazilian delegation, Mr Valdemar Carneiro Leao. Among these issues is the consumers' call for 'automaticity' - the rolling over of individual countries' export quotas (which would be subject to periodic adjustment in response to price movements) at the same level from the end of one coffee year to the beginning of the next. Brazil is now prepared to accept this system, but would want it to come into operation only at the end of the second year of a new pact, with that year's quotas being determined at an International Coffee Organisation council meeting at the conclusion of the first year. 'It is much too risky to say that the system will work perfectly from the start, which is why we want a council at the end of the first year,' Mr Porto explained. Brazil says it is also prepared to consider consumer demands for stock verification by the ICO in exporting countries, but in return it wants consumer commitments on imports from non-member producing countries and re-exports from non-member consuming members. The other crucial issue is 'selectivity' - allowing consumers the determine the amounts allotted to different types of coffee within the overall quotas. Brazil and Colombia, the second biggest producer, are reported to have reached a common stance on this, but no details have been revealed. Although coffee traders will clearly be watching the negotiations closely over the coming fortnight they see little prospect of them giving prices a significant boost. 'It will be interesting to see if they can maintain minor progress but it won't really affect the market,' one London dealer told the Reuter news agency. 'Agreements take a long time to implement.' The most significant price movement at the London Metal Exchange this week was three months lead's dip to an 11-month low of Pounds 286 a tonne on Thursday, in spite of sterling's weakness against the US dollar. The price steadied to Pounds 288.75 at yesterday's close, but that was still Pounds 5 down on the week. The downtrend was fuelled by the publication on Thursday of a report by the International Lead and Zinc Study Group showing that exports of the metal from the former eastern bloc had nearly tripled last year from 49,000 tonnes in 1991 to 120,000 tonnes. That pushed the western world into a supply surplus of 85,000 tonnes, compared with a deficit of 6,000 tonnes in 1991. 'This news is far worse than even pessimistic observers had forecast,' commented Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group. He said he had cut his forecast of the 1993 average lead price as a result by 11 per cent from the 24 US cents a lb he predicted at the end of last year. The study group painted a similarly gloomy picture of the zinc supply/demand balance. It said former eastern bloc exports had more than doubled in 1992, causing the western world surplus to rise from 86,000 to 238,000 tonnes. Mr Moore cut his forecast for this year's average zinc price by 10 per cent to 54 cents as a result. Aluminium prices remained weak as LME stocks continued to build up and copper was down in dollar terms, although the pound's fall meant that it showed a small sterling rise. The strongest LME market was tin, which was pushed steadily higher by technically-inspired buying until it ran into overhead resistance on Thursday. The three months price fell back Dollars 72.50 yesterday to Dollars 5,992.50 a tonne, up Dollars 87.50 on the week. Concern about the Middle Eastern situation helped the gold price to rise early in the week, but with fears of further central bank sales continuing to weigh on market sentiment it failed to break through resistance above Dollars 330 a troy ounce. Yesterday the price fell back 80 cents to end Dollars 1.40 up on the week at Dollars 329,25 an ounce. Platinum staged a substantial technical rally before running into profit-taking yesterday. The price was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 360.50 an ounce, down Dollars 4.40 on the day but Dollars 4.10 up on the week.  ------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------- Aluminium     +6,250  to  1,617,275 Copper        +3,650  to  314,850 Lead          +1,475  to  231,525 Nickel        +1,554  to  77,196 Zinc          +11,375 to  511,725 Tin           -45     to  15,675  -------------------------------------</p>

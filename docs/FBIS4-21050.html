			<p>Costa   Rica   <F P=102> PY0704224294 La Paz Television Nacional Network in Spanish  1700 GMT 6 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY0704224294 </F> <F P=104>  La Paz Television Nacional Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] We will now read a news agency report that confirms  what this newscast previously reported. It states that Isaac  Oso Chavarria's assistant Edgar Fernandez Lazcano has been  clandestinely and illegally removed from the country by DEA  agents. The news agency report states:    The U.S. antinarcotics agency has excused itself before the  Costa Rican Government for not having warned of the transit  through Costa Rica of a Bolivian citizen who testified that  former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora is linked with a drug  trafficker.    Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman reported that the  DEA cited urgency in its letter as the reason for not having  informed the Costa Rican Government of the arrival of Edgar  Fernandez Lazcano in Costa Rica.    Fernandez Lazcano, who was on his way to Miami on Sunday [3  April], again reported in Costa Rica that last week--during a  long testimony before Bolivian Prosecutor Leopoldo Ramos  Herrada--he revealed the alleged links between former Bolivian  President Jaime Paz Zamora and drug trafficker Isaac Oso  Chavarria.    Fernandez Lazcano, who was clandestinely removed from  Bolivia  by land via Peru, was detained by chance by OIJ [Investigation  Agency] agents in downtown San Jose during a drug enforcement  operation. Following some consultations, the Bolivian  prosecutor and Drug Enforcement Officer Ruben Zegada Portugal  asked for permission to question him in conjunction with Costa  Rican officials.</p>

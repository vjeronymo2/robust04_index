			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Inner-city funds contest may reopen MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the environment secretary, yesterday held out the prospect of a further round of City Challenge, the government programme which invites local authorities to bid for funds for inner city regeneration. Opening the Cities '93 conference in Birmingham, Mr Howard said a further round would depend on the results of an assessment of the first two rounds of City Challenge, in which 31 of the 57 urban priority areas each won Pounds 75m a year over five years for regeneration. No further money is available for City Challenge in this year's public spending plans. But funds will be available in 1994-95 as three-year urban programme projects come to an end. Mr Howard said about half of the government's Pounds 4bn budget for urban develop-ment was already allocated through competitive bid-ding. He was looking at ways of increasing competition among local authorities for his department's funds. 'If money is handed out as a matter of routine and accepted as a matter of routine, it will be spent as a matter or routine,' he said. 'Competition provides an escape from the dead hand of routine.' Even areas which were unsuccessful in City Challenge find that the process of bidding sparked the imagination and energy of local people and businesses, he said. 'Far more is achieved than before, and lasting relationships are formed.'</p>

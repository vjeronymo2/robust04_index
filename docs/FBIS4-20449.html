According to the experimental  design, when the parasitemia was detected in rhesus monkeys  infected with sporozoites of Plasmodium cynomolgi, a  combined therapy of pyronaridine 6 mg/kg body weight, artemether  10 mg/kg and chloroquine 20 mg/kg once daily for 3 days was  carried out to clear the erythrocytic parasite and then the  short-term relapse was observed in the animal for 100 days. The  combined therapy was given again when relapse occurred.    One onset of relapse occurred on the 47th day after therapy  in monkey M194 infected with sporozoites 11 x 10[.sup]3[/].  In M195 infected with sporozoites 55 x 10[.sup]4[/], relapses  occurred for three times on 30, 37 and 51 days respectively  after medication, but during a follow-up period of 200 days, no  relapse was shown in M192 and M193 infected with sporozoites 50  and 55 x 10[.sup]2[/], respectively.    The results showed that the frequency of the short-term  relapse was relative to the sporozoites inoculation, and  sporozoites less than 11 x 10[.sup]3[/] were not suitable for  making short-term relapse in animal model. No long term relapse  was seen in all the four monkeys until 400 days.    Under existing conditions, the relapse was generally  explained with hypnozoite assumption, the establishment of  animal model of short-term relapse could be tenable. The reasons  were: (1) P. cynomolgi from Vietnam, a parasite with  the biological characteristic of short-term relapse, was  recognized; (2) A series of studies for the relationship between  the parasite and monkey host was carried out and the  experimental basis of the model establishment was put forward by  the authors; (3) This study did not exclude the hypnozoite  assumption.    The significance of this animal model study at least  included: (1) to innovate the treatment countermeasure of the  short-term relapse of malaria; (2) to study the biology of the  short-term relapse; and (3) to test the antimalarial drugs for  the radical cure of vivax malaria. As for the animal model of  the long-term relapse, it will be necessary for study to select  the monkey parasite which has the biological characteristic of  long-term relapse. The verification of the relative problem,  hypnozoite assumption, will also be necessary.    Key words: Malaria, short-term relapse, animal model,  Plasmodium cynomolgi</p>

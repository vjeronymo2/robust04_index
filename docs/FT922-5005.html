			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS metal output lower than estimated, says report LEAD and zinc production in the states comprising the former Soviet Union has been nowhere near the level most western estimates suggest, claims the Commodities Research Unit, the London-based consultancy. It says lead mine output has been less than half the 490,000 tonnes widely estimated by western analysts. Zinc mine production has been less than two-thirds the previously estimated 870,000 tonnes. The CRU bases its estimates on fieldwork and personal contacts within the former Soviet Union. Metal production figures are still state secrets and are not published by official sources in Moscow. The consultancy's estimates suggest that the former Soviet Union was the third largest producer of mined copper in 1990, after Chile and the US, with an output of almost exactly 1m tonnes - not far short of figures given by other western analysts. 'In spite of a policy of self-sufficiency under the former communist regime, the Soviet Union was not self-sufficient in mine production of copper, lead or zinc,' says the CRU in a special report produced in association with Mekhanobr Institute, a technical research organisation based in St Petersburg. 'More than 100,000 tonnes of copper in concentrates were imported from Mongolia in 1988-90; imports of lead concentrates were recently as high as 12 per cent of smelter production, although they fell in 1991 because of the shortage of foreign exchange; imports of zinc concentrates were more than 8 per cent of smelter production in 1990, but have also fallen since then.' The CRU blames lack of investment in mine development and declining ore grades for the weak state of the Soviet industry. It suggests that pollution is of serious concern at all the Soviet copper, lead and zinc smelters and is now starting to restrict production. It suggests, however, that Russia and Kazakhstan, the republics dominating base metal production in the Commonwealth of Independent States, 'could become very attractive areas for investment by western mining companies.'

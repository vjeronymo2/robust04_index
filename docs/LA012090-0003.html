			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / STEVE HARVEY  </P> <P> Santa Monica has an official bird (the brown pelican) and an official plant  (bougainvillea), but lawmakers aren't sure whether there's an official song.  </P> <P> The shocking development came to light the other day when resident Lillian  Abelson submitted her composition, "That Santa Monica Feeling," to the City  Council, only to learn that five other city ditties also exist, including one  dating back to 1916.  </P> <P> Even Redondo Beach has a clear-cut song ("Redondo Beach for a Day or a  Lifetime") to go along with its official bird (the Goodyear Blimp).  </P> <P> Anyway, the matter has been turned over to the Santa Monica Arts Commission's  Henry Korn, who says a contest may be held to determine the winner.  </P> <P> For a city that's famous worldwide, Santa Monica has been virtually ignored by  pop composers. Residents probably don't get misty eyed over "You're the Reason  God Made Oklahoma," even though it contains the lyric "Santa Monica Freeway  sometimes makes a country girl blue-ooh-ooh-ooh. . . ."  </P> <P> Unlike Santa Monica, Reseda is the current subject of a tribute in song from  Tom Petty, whose "Free Fallin' " offers the tender line: "It's a long day  living in Reseda/ There's a freeway running through the yard."  </P> <P> Reseda native Bill Cartwright says he feels honored, except for one small  point.  </P> <P> "There's no freeway in Reseda," he pointed out.  </P> <P> Plenty of yards, though.  </P> <P> Donald Trump may yet build his tasteful 125-story smogscraper on Wilshire  Boulevard. But his monument won't be constructed in time to be included in  "American Highrise."  </P> <P> The 8-foot-long mural by Richard Daniel Clark depicts the nation's best-known  buildings, in shapes ranging from cylinders and pyramids to plain old  rectangles.  </P> <P> The artwork began as a doodle on a napkin a decade ago. "I was on a plane that  was circling above Manhattan and I just started sketching the skyline," said  Clark, a Canoga Park artist/writer who previously produced a live act called  the "Traveling Gong Road Show."  </P> <P> "Highrise" features a tiny, 28-story City Hall (crouching second from the left  in the mural), the 73-story First Interstate World Center (at the right edge of  the stars) and the Bonaventure Hotel (to the left of the Statue of Liberty).  </P> <P> Clark's work is subtitled "Land of Man-Made Wonders." Among the wonders, by the  way, is the fact that L.A.'s First Interstate stands taller than both the  102-story Empire State Building and the 110-story twins in New York's World  Trade Center. It's a shame there was no room to include L.A.'s best-known  structure, the Tail-O-the-Pup emporium, which stands two buns high.  </P> <P> Some people become nervous in a jury box. Jose Guzman sits there to relax.  </P> <P> Guzman, a court interpreter, meditates 20 minutes every morning and night. And,  if he has a morning date, he'll show up early and climb into the box, as he did  Friday in Division 55, Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Eyes closed, head tilted back, hands resting in his lap, he sat alone in the  box, listening to a tape player through headphones.  </P> <P> Meditation is necessary because his job is so stressful, he said.  </P> <P> "The defendants are tense," he explained. "They have very nervous vibrations."  </P> <P> Beware of congressmen bearing gifts? Lawmakers seem to be sensitive about their  lack of credibility.  </P> <P> The other day, Rep. David Dreier (R-Covina) presented the Diamond Bar City  Council with a 1-inch-by-1-inch chip that he himself removed from the Berlin  Wall earlier this month.  </P> <P> Just in case anyone doubted the authenticity of the chunk, Dreier added that he  had a photo taken of himself chipping off the piece.  </P> <P> Of course, he didn't have the photo with him.  </P> <P> But he promised to mail it to the council. . . .  </P></p>

Nearly 10,000 pro-democracy Nepal Students Union (NSU)  members gathered at the eastern corner of the city hall, where  the by- elections' vote counting was in progress.    The students shouted slogans against Nepalese Prime Minister  Girija Prasad Koirala, such as "Down with disruptionist  Koirala," and "Down with pro-India Koirala."    The students bitterly criticized Koirala for his "unhelpful  attitude" towards the Nepali Congress party president and  candidate, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, in Kathmandu during his  campaign for the by-elections on Monday.    The by-elections, held in Kathmandu and Jhapa districts  under  heavy security, were to fill two seats in the lower house of  parliament left vacant last year by the deaths of two communist  parliamentarians.    After raising anti-Koirala slogans for several hours at a  street corner in Kathmandu, several hundred of them headed  towards the prime minister's official residence in a procession.    Riot police followed the angry students' procession but did  not stop them, the witnesses added.    The students said the prime minister's bitter remarks last  week, broadcast over radio and television, against Bhattarai for  his anti-government remarks during his campaign had badly  affected the NC contender.    They said Koirala's criticism had played a negative role  that  led people to vote for Bhattarai's opposition.    Meanwhile, the country's main opposition party candidate in  Kathmandu is leading in the vote counts, the state radio  announced.    The announcement said the Nepal Communist Party-United  Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) candidate Bidhya Bhandari was  leading in Kathmandu late Tuesday by over 6,000 votes against  her ruling Nepali Congress party rival, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai.    But in Jhapa, 390 kilometres (243 miles) southeast of here,  the Nepali Congress candidate, Krishna Prasad Shitaula, was  leading over his NCP-UML contender, Lila Udashi Khanal, by over  1,000 votes.    Final results are expected to be announced Wednesday noon.    Election Commission officials said that in Kathmandu  elections, a total 95,978 ballots were cast out of the 136,655  registered voters. While in Jhapa some 44,981 voters exercised  their franchise out of the 67,896 registered.    Altogether, 24 candidates are in the election fray in  Kathmandu, and in Jhapa nine candidates had filed their  nomination papers. The winners in the by-elections will remain  in the lower house for two and a half years.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Plan drawn up for sweeping CIA reform TWO powerful congressional committee chairmen have drawn up plans for a sweeping re-organisation of the Central Intelligence Agency, including a potentially controversial merger of domestic and foreign counter-spying operations. Mr Robert Gates, CIA director, would become the new intelligence supremo under the proposed reforms which have been driven by the collapse of the former Soviet Union. The chief sponsor of the reform is Senator David Boren of Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, who shepherded Mr Gates' controversial nomination through the Senate last year. Congressman Dave McCurdy, also of Oklahoma, who chairs the House intelligence committee, is also calling for an overhaul of US intelligence gathering to meet post-Cold War needs. Mr Boren reportedly favours giving the CIA control over the FBI's counter-intelligence budget as part of the re-organisation, but this is likely to run into criticism because the CIA has traditionally been barred from operating inside the US. Americans have always been keen to stress the difference between the CIA and the KGB, the Soviet intelligence apparatus, which from Stalin to Gorbachev controlled spying at home and abroad. The FBI has acted as the domestic counter-spying apparatus, most notably under the long reign of Mr J. Edgar Hoover. According to congressional officials, the reforms also propose reducing the CIA's role in covert operations and handing responsibility to the Pentagon; moving the National Security Agency, the electronic eavesdropping agency, under the supervision of the CIA; and creating a civilian agency to handle spy satellites and photographic reconnaissance. These moves would enhance considerably the power of the congressional intelligence committees. Some legislators are already calling the plan a 'power-grab' by Mr Boren. Separately, Mr Gates is considering setting up a new electronic news network operated by the CIA which would offer news bulletins to an elite audience of US government officials. The Washington Post reported that a panel recommended the idea so government officials would not be so dependent on Cable News Network.</p>

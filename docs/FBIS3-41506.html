The Government's followup to the Rio Earth Summit, an  environmental action plan for the next 20 years, runs to four  documents--nearly 600 pages, announced by nine ministers in the  surroundings of Inigo Jones's Banqueting House in Whitehall.    The most controversial chapter of Britain's Sustainable  Development Strategy, on transport, says that ``costs of travel,  particularly costs of road travel, may well have to rise to  reflect environmental costs and to affect levels of future  demand for transport.''    Mr. Major, launching the strategy, said: ``Sometimes quite  painful political action may be necessary to meet environmental  objectives.'' He admitted he ``did not expect to see people  dancing in the street'' at the thought of road pricing.    He said that Britain's imposition of VAT [value-added tax]  on  heating and lighting, higher fuel prices and commitment to road  pricing had already gone further than most other countries, but  denied these would impose an intolerable burden on the economy.    An expansion of nuclear power might be necessary to meet  future environmental commitments, he hinted. Alongside the  overall environmental strategy, Major introduced the following  documents:    The UK Climate Change Programme -- sets out in detail how  Britain intends to meet its commitments to freeze carbon dioxide  emissions by the year 2000.    The document shows for the first time that Britain will  achieve a reduction in all gases that cause global  warming--including methane and CFCs [chlorofluorocarbons]--of  five percent. It commits Britain to setting targets after 2000  but not what they will be.    The Biodiversity Action Plan--sets out 59 specific  commitments to protecting wildlife and local distinctiveness .    The Forestry Action Plan--shows how Britain will increase  forest cover.    Mr. Major announced a new panel of five ``wise men'' who  will  advise him and monitor progress on ``green issues,'' chaired by  Sir Crispin Tickell, warden of Green College, Oxford, an  unofficial adviser at Downing Street.    The others are Lord Alexander of Weedon, chairman of  National  Westminster Bank, Lord Selborne, chairman of the Government's  statutory conservation watchdog, the Joint Nature Conservation  Committee, Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission  on Environmental Pollution and Dr. Anne Mclaren, vice-president  of the Royal Society    Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, announced that the  Government would be setting up a Round Table on Sustainable  Development which would bring together industry, local  authorities and environmentalists to discuss environmental  policies.    The Government also intended to stimulate a new ``citizen's  environmental initiative'' in consultation with local  authorities, churches and community groups.    Mr. Major's initiative received a chorus of criticism from  Opposition MPs and environmental groups. Mr. Chris Smith.  Labour spokesman for environmental protection, said the four  reports contained ``no vision and few firm commitments to  action.''    The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Simon Hughes said  the key Strategy document was ``full of `coulds', `ifs' and  `maybes' when what the country needs is `whys', `whats' and  `whens'.''    The Green Party complained the Government ``lacked the  courage of its convictions'' and the WorldWide Fund for Nature  described the announcement as ``a lost opportunity.''</p>

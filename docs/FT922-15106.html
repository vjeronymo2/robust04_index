			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's aluminium sector may soon grind to a halt RUSSIA'S ALUMINIUM industry, previously expected to bring in Dollars 1bn of foreign currency this year, is nearing collapse because of severe shortages of raw materials, according to western observers. They suggest that at the very least the industry can be expected to follow the pattern set recently by Russia's steel and coking coal sectors where output has plunged 40 per cent. Expert eye witnesses say that Russia's Siberian aluminium smelters have only four days stock of alumina, the essential raw material for aluminium production, and are virtually out of carbon coke and pitch, without which they cannot operate. They estimate that the smelters - at Bratsk, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, and Novokuznetsk, with a combined annual capacity of 2.5m tonnes or two-thirds of the Russian total - can operate for another four weeks at most before having to stop production. It would then take another four weeks to get them up and running smoothly again, once enough raw materials became available. No alumina is currently being shipped through Batumi in Georgia, the main port used by the Siberian smelters, because half the specialised handling system is out of action and railway links have been disrupted by fighting in the republic. Extreme measures are being taken to overcome these problems. For example, the Switzerland-based Marc Rich trading organisation is packaging alumina - usually shipped in bulk - into 5 kg bags and transporting them to Russian smelters from Rotterdam via Kokkola in Finland. All this is a serious blow to Russia, which at the end of last year hoped to export 1m tonnes of aluminium to the west in 1992 and to earn at least Dollars 1bn. Western observers suggest the decline in Russia's aluminium industry accelerated in the first quarter of this year. At first the industry was set the 1m tonnes export target, equalling last year's flow of the metal to the west which, coming on top of recession in key markets, caused the aluminium price to fall to its lowest level in real terms and the western industry to shut down about 10 per cent of its capacity. In January the Russian authorities caused turmoil domestically by imposing an export tariff of 500 Ecu a tonne. But after protests by the industry that it would have to close export capacity because of this cost increase, the authorities agreed last month that 615,000 tonnes could be exported free of tariffs. Raznoimport, the metals import-export organisation, has been allocated 80 per cent of the tonnage to swap in the west for alumina, observers suggest. They say that between 170,000 and 200,000 tonnes of aluminium is stockpiled at Russian ports ready to be shipped as part of these barter arrangements. Western observers suggest that Concernalumini, set up last year to include most of the former Soviet Union's aluminium industry, is close to disintegrating because it has failed to keep the smelters supplied with raw materials. Smelter managers complain that their costs are rising sharply. At Irkutsk production costs, Dollars 50 a tonne in January at the official rouble exchange rate, are now Dollars 500.</p>

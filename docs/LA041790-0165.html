			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: BRUNDAGE GETS TOUGHER; SO DOES THE COMPETITION  </P> <P> Jennifer Brundage, pitcher at Irvine High School, is used to a little success.  </P> <P> As a sophomore last season, she was selected The Times' softball player of the  year. This season, she has a 16-2 record and an 0.27 earned-run average.  </P> <P> Brundage, The Times' Athlete of the Week, was selected the most valuable player  of last week's Woodbridge tournament.  </P> <P> "It (the award) meant the most this year because of the quality teams that we  played," Brundage said. "The tournament has a reputation of being one of the  best."  </P> <P> In the tournament, Brundage won five games from Saturday to Wednesday. The last  two games went into extra innings.  </P> <P> In Tuesday's championship semifinal, Brundage allowed five hits, but struck out  12 and walked none in a 10-inning 2-0 victory over Upland.  </P> <P> Wednesday, Brundage struck out six, walked three and allowed five hits as  sixth-ranked Irvine defeated second-ranked Kennedy, 3-2, in 11 innings.  </P> <P> "I was getting tired from pitching so much," Brundage said. "When you get tired  it affects the speed and how the pitch breaks."  </P> <P> Brundage said it seems as if she's giving up more hits this year.  </P> <P> "I don't know if (batters) are getting better -- I know our team is hitting  better," she said. "I certainly don't think they (the batters) are getting  worse. I don't know if it's because of my year last year or because of  coaching, but I think teams are more aggressive to hit me this year."  </P> <P> Irvine Coach Lisa Limp said she is not sure if teams are doing better against  Brundage this season.  </P> <P> But, Limp said, Brundage is pitching better. "She has seven pitches and a real  good fastball and she's a real smart pitcher," Limp said. "But when you face  the same team (as in league) and they always have the same pitcher, as we do,  then that's a definite advantage for the other team."  </P> <P> Even so, Brundage has pitched three no-hitters this season. Her error in one  game and a walk in another kept her from having two perfect games.  </P> <P> "She keeps them (batters) off balance and, like I said, she has a real nice  fastball," Limp said. "I would guess she throws it about 65 (miles per hour)."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMER  </P> <P> Marla Pickard went three for three, including a home run, and had two RBIs to  lead Ocean View to a 3-0 victory over Bolsa Grande Wednesday in the consolation  final of the Woodbridge tournament. She went two for three, including a double,  and had two RBIs in a 6-1 victory over Mission Viejo Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jennifer Brundage  </P> <P> Irvine High School  </P> <P> * Position: Pitcher  </P> <P> * Height, Weight, Class: 5-6, 140, Junior  </P> <P> * Last week: Brundage won five games and was the most valuable player of the  Woodbridge tournament.  </P> <P> * Season: Brundage is 16-2 with 163 strikeouts and 20 walks in 131 innings. She  has pitched three no-hitters and has an 0.27 earned-run average. Brundage is  batting .438.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPER SEEKS LENDERS FOR LOW-COST HOUSING PROJECTS  </P> <P> Hoping to fill a gap in construction lending as Southern California's real  estate market slows, developer Donald H. Williams Jr. is trying to raise money  to finance construction of low-cost homes.  </P> <P> Williams, of Anaheim Hills, has filed a preliminary prospectus with the  Securities and Exchange Commission seeking approval to sell 400,000 limited  partnerships to raise up to $200 million under the name Hill Williams Secured  Income Fund.  </P> <P> Williams is especially interested in funding affordable homes -- in the range  of $120,000 to $190,000 -- in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, said David  Colton, president of Colton Financial Inc. of Newport Beach, whose firm is the  lead underwriter for the offering. Williams may also invest in other parts of  California, Colton said.  </P> <P> With real estate prices in the dumps, now may not appear to be the right time  to invest in home-building. But Colton said there is opportunity for home  builders even in a slow market.  </P> <P> "A lot of developers who would normally be developing cannot finance their  projects, but that's not because the projects don't make economic sense,"  Colton said. "It's the new regulations on financial institutions.  </P> <P> The limited partnerships are projected to pay a 12% return on the investment,  according to the prospectus.  </P> <P> In 1985, Williams formed Hill Williams Development Corp., which has built  homes, attached units, office buildings and shopping centers valued at $96  million, all in California.  </P></p>

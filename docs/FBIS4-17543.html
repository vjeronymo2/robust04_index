			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Ulyanov report under the "Problem" rubric: "From </F> Whom Will Peacekeepers Take Orders? Emergency Situations  Ministry and Defense Ministry vs State Duma Committee"]    [Text] The State Duma is continuing its discussion of a  draft federal law, approved in the first reading, "On the  Procedure of Providing Military and Civilian Personnel of the  Russian Federation for Participation in Operations to Maintain  or Restore International Peace and Security and in Other Types  of Peacekeeping Activities," prepared by the State Duma defense  committee.    Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian Federation deputy defense  minister, who spoke at the hearings, thus outlined the situation  that had taken shape in the wake of Russia's having carried out  its peacekeeping obligations to the United Nations and the  nearest neighbors. Since October 1973, Soviet, and later,  Russian observers participated in peacekeeping operations under  UN auspices in Egypt, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, in the Iran-Iraq  border area, Western Sahara, Cambodia, Mozambique, ex-Yugoslavia  and, besides, along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border and in  Abkhazia. Mr. Kondratyev reminded his audience that had Russia  not taken in summer 1992 "resolute measures in hot spots of the  `near abroad,'" without waiting for a legislative base to be  prepared, the flame of war could have spread to the territory of  Russia. At that time the Defense Ministry formed, within the  framework of the Russian Armed Forces, nine battalions of  Russian military men and sent them to South Ossetia, Georgia,  and the Dniester Region. A little earlier -- in April 1992 -- a  Russian battalion, which was later reinforced, was sent to  Yugoslavia under the UN flag. In Tajikistan there is the 201st  Motorized Rifle Division with reinforcement assets as part of  the CIS peacekeeping forces, and more than 16,500 Russian  servicemen are based on the territories of North Ossetia and  Ingushetia. Proceeding from the situation that had taken shape,  two motorized rifle divisions were detached from armed forces  personnel, whose servicemen are being trained in accordance with  a particular program specially designed for peacekeeping.    After such a thorough instruction of the scenario, the  Defense Ministry representatives passed over to the main part of  his address, which is still causing dispute among the deputies.  Let me set the record straight right away by saying that the  text of the draft federal law etches in stone the spontaneously  established norm under which peacekeeping operations are  conducted by the Defense Ministry. These functions are  entrusted to Russian Armed Forces line units. A spokesman for  the Duma Defense Committee spoke in favor of maintaining this  position, believing that a reassignment of the peacekeeping  troops and detaching them from armed forces personnel would call  for the creation of one more Russian army. The state budget has  no money to support such a decision.    Here is what General Kondratyev said in this connection.  "Among the Defense Ministry leadership there is worry about  distracting regular troops for the performance of missions  unrelated to their direct purpose. The personnel are charged  with police functions untypical for them. One should also take  account of the fact that the presence of Russian Armed Forces  units in conflict zones has a negative affect on the growing  anti-army sentiment among the local population. The use of a  regular army produces a negative reaction and gives cause for  systematic accusations of Russia's having an imperial policy."  Mr. Kondratyev remarked that these sort of functions should not  be performed by line units but by specially formed, trained, and  appropriately equipped military contingents, that is, by  "peacekeeping forces of Russia." The Defense Ministry spokesman  promised to turn over completely the special training bases set  up for the already mentioned two separate peacekeeping divisions  in the charge of the new separate peacekeeping organization.    The reason for such a demonstrative debarring of the  Defense Ministry from peacekeeping functions is simple. There  is a proposal from the Ministry of Emergency Situations to the  Defense Ministry on the transfer of the peacemaking functions  and the peacekeeping subunits to the Ministry of Emergency  Situations. The Defense Ministry, in the person of Colonel  General Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, agreed with this  proposal.    Neither did this Emergency Situations Ministry proposal  raise  any objections from many deputies. For example, Mr. Popov of  the Agrarian faction elaborated an entire conception on the need  to transfer the peacekeeping functions. Its essence is this:  Under Articles 77 and 78 of the current Constitution, the Armed  Forces can be put into action only owing to a threat of  aggression against Russia. But interethnic conflicts, which  call upon Russia to show firmness and toughness, do not belong  to such situations. As a rule, the Russian Federation president  imposed a state of emergency in zones of interethnic feuding,  and Emergency Situations Ministry representatives were the first  to start to settle the conflicts -- but after they proved to be  unmanageable, military subunits were brought in. Thus the State  Duma Defense Committee members' fears at the Emergency  Situations Ministry's little specific experience appear  far-fetched. Mr. Popov believes that the peacekeeping  contingent ought to be formed on a voluntary basis (this view is  backed by the "Women of Russia" faction and the majority of  deputies of the other factions), organized on different  principles and wear a uniform distinct from that of the Armed  Forces. Mr. Popov recalled that in the United States this type  of activity is in the charge of the National Guard, which is not  part of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the deputy's view, the main  distinction of the army from a peacekeeping contingent is that  the latter has no enemy image in carrying out of operations --  its functions are distinctly of a humanitarian nature.    The Duma's second hearings of the draft law and its approval  by the Federal Assembly are still ahead. Time will tell if the  clear contradiction between the main agents covered by the law  and its drafters will be removed or not. What causes amazement,  however, is the very fact that whereas the Duma Defense  Committee has talked about taking into consideration the Defense  Ministry and the Russian Foreign Ministry amendments (the latter  in its turn recommended to the committee to pay attention to  expert assessments of the Defense Ministry), it has not  reflected these amendments in any way in the draft law.</p>

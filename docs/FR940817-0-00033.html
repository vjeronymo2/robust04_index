			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the October 26, 1992, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final listing decision. Appropriate State agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspaper notices were published in The Oregonian paper, Portland, Oregon, on November 27, 1992, and The World paper, Coos Bay, Oregon, on November 25, 1992, which invited general public comment. Three letters were received. Two letters, both from private citizens, were in support of the listing. One letter, from a local government, questioned whether there has been enough study on the need to list the species, its habitat requirements, or whether habitat changes such as cranberry farming may actually benefit the plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service believes that the status review of the plant was very thorough. All known populations from historical herbarium collections were checked, and many were found to be extirpated. The restricted habitat requirements of the species are accurately known, and most suitable habitat has been searched. Additionally, the Service contacted all individuals knowledgeable about the species prior to proposing it for listing to assess the most current information about the status of the species. In response to the concern with the ability of the lily to grow in cranberry farms, a small population of lilies was found in 1992 in an apparently abandoned cranberry bog (Bruce Rittenhouse, Coos Bay District, Bureau of Land Management, pers. comm.). No populations have been found in active cranberry farms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  should be classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations promulgated to implement the listing provisions (50 CFR part 424) were followed. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Purdy (western lily) are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat or range. Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  existed historically at several sites above Humboldt Bay in northern California. These populations have been extirpated by development or, in some cases, encroachment by forest. From the 1940's to the present, conversion of bog habitat to cranberry farms, roads, and residential dwellings has eliminated suitable  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  habitat as well as some populations of the plant in the area from Bandon south to Cape Blanco, Oregon (Schultz 1989). This area contained perhaps the greatest concentration of the species in Oregon 40 to 50 years ago, according to native plant collectors and old-time residents of the area (Ballantyne 1980). In 1988, this area contained 6 small populations with a total of fewer than 125 flowering plants (Schultz 1989). Clearing and draining along the Elk and Sixes Rivers in Oregon for livestock grazing have eliminated many of the once numerous populations there (Ballantyne 1980). In the mid-1960's, the construction of a picnic area and restroom facility in an Oregon State Park destroyed another population. In the summer of 1987, trail maintenance by a crew from this same State Park destroyed the flowering shoots of six  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Schultz 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1984, the city of Brookings, Oregon, under an easement permit from the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), buried a sewer line along a powerline right-of-way through a lily bog that had contained up to 100 plants (Veva Stansell, U.S. Forest Service, pers. comm.) The fill eliminated all the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in a 20-ft (6.1 meter) wide strip, destroying almost half of the available lily habitat. The species that later colonized the fill, rushes and alder, were not the same as those found in the adjoining bog (e.g., sphagnum and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Drosera <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  sundews) (Schultz 1989). In 1991, the City of Brookings again obtained permission from ODOT to bury a larger sewer line in the site, widening the destroyed area to approximately 25 ft (7.6 meters). The project was completed without obtaining proper wetland fill permits (John Craig, Army Corps of Engineers, pers. comm., 1991). It is unlikely that the filled area will support  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the future (Stewart Schultz, University of British Columbia, pers. comm., 1991). The effects on the hydrology of the remaining bog are as yet unknown. At a second site, a private developer drained a lily bog that historically contained about 100 plants, without obtaining a State or Federal permit for the wetland activity. Two lilies were found remaining between two drainage ditches (Richard Mize, California Native Plant Society, pers. comm., 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Future development activities threaten the remaining sites where  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  occurs. The largest known population occurs partly on private land in Crescent City, California. This land has been surveyed and is platted as a subdivision in city records (Richard Mize, pers. comm., 1991). Other nearby populations are privately owned and the owner has expressed the desire to develop the land (Dave Imper, pers. comm., 1991). The ODOT is currently planning to widen Highway 101 at another lily site. After the proposed rule was published, ODOT modified their plans and will avoid the lily population. Such pressure to develop wetland sites occupied by this lily will likely increase in the future. The lily is limited to habitat very near the coast that is currently undergoing intense development pressure. The species' bog and coastal prairie/scrub habitat occurs on level marine terraces that are desirable for coastal development because of the gentle topography and proximity to the ocean.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is a showy, rare lily and the species has been collected by lily growers and for the commercial trade since before the 1930's. After the location of a California population of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was published in lily society yearbooks in 1934, 1955, and 1972, bulb collecting by lily growers and breeders decimated the population (Ballantyne, 1980). Overcollection continues sporadically at sites in Oregon and California (Schultz 1989). For example, in June 1987, seven bulbs were dug from an Oregon site. Lily breeders collect  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  seed regularly from several sites. Plants near trails and roads are occasionally picked: at least seven plants were picked in 1985, four to six in 1986, five in 1987, and two in 1988 at a site in Oregon (Schultz 1989).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was reportedly advertised for sale in western United States and British seed and bulb catalogues (Siddall and Chambers 1978). Overcollection currently threatens this plant and would likely increase, if specific locations of this plant were publicized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disease or predation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although a limited amount of grazing may be of benefit to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  if it prevents forest succession (see Factor E); overgrazing by cattle is considered a threat to this plant. Until recently, livestock overgrazing on the lily and surrounding vegetation was severe at three California ranch sites (Schultz 1989). The lily population at one ranch was reduced from over 100 flowering individuals in 1984 to fewer than 10 between 1985 and 1988. At another ranch, half of the fruits were grazed by deer and cattle in 1985. By July 1987, cattle had crushed 32 percent and grazed another 25 percent of 49 flowering shoots. Only 17 intact fruits remained in August (Imper et al. 1987). Deer and elk herbivory is severe at 3 Oregon sites; 50 to 60 percent of fruit in one population of about 60 flowering plants were browsed in 1987 and 1988 (Schultz 1989). Unknown vandals destroyed all flowering shoots at one site in 1980 (Ballantyne 1980).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Deer browsing continues to be a threat at the Oregon sites. The fences, however, are not deer-proof and deer are common at these ranches. Though occurring sporadically, browsing by deer can cause major damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

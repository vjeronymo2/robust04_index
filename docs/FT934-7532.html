			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (5): Standards give cause for concern - A look at prospects for the reform of existing requirements ACCOUNTING STANDARDS may seem abstract and obscure, but to the leasing industry, they could spell life or death. Current reforms under discussion are causing considerable concern within the sector. The existing standard on leasing is Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 21 (SSAP 21), which was introduced in 1984. It echoed Financial Accounting Standard 13, first issued in the US in the mid-1970s. Pressure for the development of the standard was driven by concerns over financial collapses involving leases in the past. 'Leasing was very much a means of off-balance sheet financing, leaving you with very healthy gearing and disclosure of the commitment in a note to the accounts,' says Mr Paresh Mashru, a partner with accountants Arthur Andersen in London and head of the firm's asset finance practice. The standard defined two types of leases: Finance leases, which were purely financing transactions with contracts at the end of which the lessee had paid for most of the value of the asset. In the lessee's accounts, the asset is treated as a purchase, with the asset shown on the balance sheet, and both the costs of borrowing and the depreciation of the asset shown in the profit and loss account. Operating leases, which are allowed to remain off-balance sheet, meaning that the lessee is not required to show any impact in the balance sheet of the lease, but merely has to show a charge to the profit and loss account on servicing it. As a rule of thumb, both FAS 13 and SSAP 21 drew the distinction between the two types of leases with an illustrative figure that a finance lease was any in which the present value was at least 90 per cent of the asset's fair value - the so-called '90 per cent test'. But the legal and financial industries seized on the figure, and devised mechanisms to ensure that the lease contracts drawn up would be just below the limit. 'The industry mushroomed - especially for big ticket leasing,' says Mr Mashru. 'Investment bankers spent a lot of time engineering leases to be off-balance sheet at 89 per cent. A whole industry grew up doing clever structuring to get what would normally be on, off.' In general, the two accounting requirements of the two types of leases are the inverse or mirror image for the leasing company itself: placing operating leases on and finance leases off-balance sheet as merely income. But similarly complex structures have also evolved so that even the lessor can remove the impact of the lease from the balance sheet. The strategies used include introducing a third party which also takes part of the risk. 'That keep the lease off-balance sheet of all three parties, so it floats somewhere around between them,' says Mr Mashru. 'Nobody claims ownership.' Now this cosy two-way split in the accounting standard is under threat - partly because the standards-setters believe this manipulation does not truly reflect the obligations of a company in a variety of financing arrangements. Suddenly there are two principal challenges to the existing structure: Financial Reporting Exposure Draft 4 (Fred 4), which deals with all off-balance sheet instruments and stresses the importance of recording the true nature of transactions - emphasising a portrayal in companies' accounts of their real economic substance, not simply their legal form. This would destroy the tactic adopted by the avoidance industry in exploiting the 90 per cent test. The statement of principles, the basic framework that underlies the new financial reporting standards being developed. This clearly defines the nature of assets and liabilities, which should be adhered to in all the specific standards that spring from it. While both specifically exclude leasing, they contradict SSAP 21, raising the argument that the standard will need revision to bring it into line. That said, the industry has been on considerable notice: the proposals have been around for some time - and represent the evolution of two previous exposure draft standards produced by the old Accounting Standards Committee (ASC). But the Finance and Leasing Association argues that the changes would be extremely harmful to the industry. Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the association, says: 'Companies will find leases less attractive. They will move to other forms of financing. That will be a negative move.' He also dismisses the focus as 'irrelevant', and stresses that there have been no significant leasing scandals related to the off-balance sheet presentation since the collapse of Court Line in the mid 1970s. Mr Mallin argues that far more important is the need to develop standards on income recognition, to ensure that leasing companies do not recognise profits too early during a leasing contract without adequately assessing the residual value of an asset at the end of a lease. 'Traditionally, companies front-end profits,' says Mr Mashru. 'That works in a bull market when there are new leases being arranged. But in a downturn, there is less income and more bad debts.' The FLA argues that it is these issues which have triggered most of the financial collapses and difficulties in recent years such as Atlantic Computers. The association has issued its own guidelines on the topics, urging conservatism. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), which replaced the ASC three years ago in the UK, acknowledges that SSAP 21 is inadequate. The same message of limitations in their own requirements came from a group of standards-setters from around the world who gathered in London earlier this month. But it is likely to be a number of months before the ASB begins to tackle a project comprehensively to revise SSAP 21. In the meantime, the only prospect of reform is likely to be through a pronouncement from the body's urgent issues task force, which deals with relatively-narrowly defined matters of public concern - notably in the abuse of existing standards. The question is whether the leasing industry can develop proposals on these grounds or will have to wait for more fundamental reform at a time when it can be squeezed into the ASB's current frenetic activity.</p>

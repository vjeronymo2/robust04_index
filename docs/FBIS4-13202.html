			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Political Bureau of the Hamas; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] Since he took office, the terrorist Yitzhaq Rabin  has been pursuing repression against all sections of our  Palestinian population and ordering the occupation troops to  shoot at our people without discriminating between armed and  unarmed or young and old people. He has also unleashed armed  gangs of settlers to terrorize and kill our people and profane  their holy sites. Unprovoked and ongoing killings carried out  by the occupation troops and settlers have targeted women,  children, and the elderly.    Despite Rabin's peace protestations, the launch of the  Madrid-Washington process, and the signing of the Oslo accord,  the Rabin government's crimes against our people have doubled as  have the draconian security measures, including collective  punishment, and the closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    In response to these criminal policies, our people have  stepped up their resistance to occupation and their  confrontations with its tools represented in the troops and  settlers, which is the same strategy of Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement].    The Rabin government's repressive measures have gone too far  and climaxed when his soldiers colluded with the settlers in the  hideous Hebron massacre against kneeling worshippers at dawn  prayers.    Moreover, soldiers opened fire on pregnant women while at  home or standing in their doorways, thus spurring our people to  escalate their resistance to occupation and to avenge the  martyrs of the horrific Hebron massacre.    To honor the martyrs' blood, the martyr 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam  Battalions active across our country decided to take revenge for  our martyrs' blood. Two of our heroic mujahidin carried out two  acts of martyrdom in 'Afula and Hadera against soldier and  settler targets. The operations were mounted in the face of the  strict security measures instituted by the Rabin government to  attend celebrations marking the anniversary of the theft of our  country.    The failure of the Rabin government's measures to preempt  our  heroic mujahidin on the eve of launching an implementation of  the Oslo accord and against the backdrop of his promises of  security and tranquility for the Zionist public as a result of  that accord and the disgraceful PLO concessions, coupled with  rising Likud opposition to his policies, has left him frustrated  and feeling a sense of doom and confusion.    Hamas would like to make the following points:    First: The terrorist Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has issued  a threat to brother Jordan, claiming that the Movement maintains  its headquarters on its territories. Rabin demanded that Jordan  crack down on Hamas in a wretched attempt to capitalize on a  confirmation by the Movement's representative in Amman that  al-Qassam Battalions were responsible for the heroic operations  in 'Afula and Hadera.    Rabin and his criminal government colleagues know only too  well that the planning, execution, and announcements on the  battalion's operations all originate in the occupied territories.    Using a combination of his inability to forestall these  operations and the exposure of his deceptiveness in the  settlement process, Rabin issued the threat to Jordan to advance  the following goals:    1. To shift attention away from the failure of his draconian  security and repressive measures to thwart the heroic acts of  martyrdom executed by al-Qassam Battalions and our people's  resistance throughout the land.    2. To use the clout of the United States to press Jordan  into signing a unilateral peace agreement with his government on  the Oslo accord model. This threat fits in with the inspection  of merchant vessels bound for the Port of al-'Aqabah as a lever  of pressure on brotherly Jordan and the retention of Syria on  Washinton's list of nations sponsoring terrorism as a tool to  press the Syrians into backing down on their demand for a  universal settlement on all fronts.    Hamas is not unaware of what the enemy hopes to reap from  peace -- the Arab parties' capitulation to its demeaning terms  and a consolidation of its dominance over our region, while it  stays in our territories. Rabin and his government's  allegations are false and groundless. Our Movement's  single-minded purpose is resistance to occupation until victory  and liberation.    Hamas hereby underlines its concern for the security and  stability of all the countries where it has political and media  representatives who observe their respective laws. Hamas  strives to deny any grounds for the occupying enemy to apply  pressure on any of these countries.    Second: Hamas' established policy had been that 'Izz al-Din  al-Qassam Battalion's operations should be directed exclusively  at occupation troops and its military agencies, as well as the  settlers as army reservists. Al-Qassam Battalions had taken  pains to spare civilians in their anti-occupation action.    However, the Rabin government's strong-arm tactics running  counter to the most basic human rights and the failure of the  enemy military and settlers to distinguish between fighter  mujahidin and unarmed civilians prompted al-Qassam Battalions to  adopt the principle of reciprocity, which has been sanctioned by  temporal and divine laws alike.    The 'Afula and Hadera attacks that targeted concentrations  of  troops and settlers and hit some civilians were meant as a  deterrent for the savage Zionist aggression on our people and a  legitimate revenge for the blood of the martyrs of the hideous  Hebron massacre. The actions were not a constant policy for  al-Qassam Battalions, but an exception dictated by the enemy  government.    Hamas is prepared to reconsider this exception, provided the  enemy prime minister, his government, and army undertake to stop  killing unarmed civilians of our people. Our objective is to  guarantee the security and safety of our people and deter  killers so that our people are not made easy targets for enemy  soldiers and unrestrained settler gangs. Hamas will adhere to  its policy of resistance as long as occupation remains.    Third: The quickened pace of jihad and heroic operations by  our mujahidin in al-Qassam Battalions fits in with the  Movement's game plan of resistance until occupation is routed  and our sacred land liberated.    To cover the abysmal failure of the Rabin government to  thwart our mujahidin's heroic operations, this government claims  that the Hamas' actions are designed to undermine or abort the  peace process, in an attempt to discredit Hamas in the eyes of  the internationaal community.    We want to make an oft-repated statement that Hamas is not  adverse to the principle of peace. However, the kind of peace  offered by the enemy government is not peace; it is a  consolidation of occupation and the iniquity to which our people  are subjected. We are aware that the Oslo operation is one of  humiliating surrender by the PLO leadership and capitulation to  the Zionist and American terms and dictates. The operation  carries the seeds of its own destruction; built on unjust and  false foundations, it is destined to crash.    The right beginning lies in the following steps:    1. A full Zionist withdrawal from our Palestinian land and  the dismantlement and removal of the settlements.    2. Free and fair general elections in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip in which our peole would choose their representatives and  leadership.    3. It is the elected leadership that reflects the hopes and  ambitions of our people and decides on the next steps and the  future of the Palestinian cause.    This is to shed light on Hamas' stands and to expose the  lies  and frivolities of the enemy prime minister. In the meantime,  Hamas promises our people to sustain the jihad and martyrdom  until the liberation of all of Palestine.</p>

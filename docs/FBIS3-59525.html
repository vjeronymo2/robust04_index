			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Telecommunications: Mannesmann Keeps </F> Up the Offensive"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS  Database]    [Text] The Mannesmann Group is keeping up its attack on  the German telecommunications market, already fully liberalised  ahead of the 1998 European deadline for opening up voice  telephony markets. Having already won the licence to run a  private cellular phone network in Germany, which went commercial  in June 1992, Mannesmann has just announced a strategic alliance  in the company telecommunications field with number one German  bank the Deutsche Bank, and RWE [Rheinisch-Westfaelisches  Elektrizitaetswerk], the leading German energy producer.    Having posted net losses of 467 million German marks for the  first half of 1993, brought on by disastrous results in all  sectors, Mannesmann has everything to gain by strengthening its  activities in "a new market with growth prospects". In August,  the German giant's D2 mobile phone network already boasted  300,000 users, and could pass break-even point next year if it  reaches a total of 400,000 subscribers.    A joint company, to be held 50&percnt; by Mannesmann, with  Deutsche  Bank and RWE Energie each taking a 25&percnt; stake, is likely  to be  set up early in January 1994 to tap the market for private  company telecommunications networks. The new venture will  establish a system for the German and the wider European market,  comprising voice telephony, and image and date transmission,  within a closed network of subscribers. This kind of service  would allow, for example, figures to be automatically read off  calculators, electronic mail and also financial data to be sent.  Germany's deregulated market, likely to represent a turnover  running into billions of German marks, is only awaiting approval  from the European Commission's competition authorities before it  takes off in 1994.    Mannesmann has already announced its intention to apply,  through subsidiary Mannesmann Eurokom GmbH, for Germany's first  licence for data transmission for mobile radio-telephones.  Licenses will be required until full deregulation in 1998, and  the group is expected to ally itself with powerful and  experienced partners to corner this particular market. The  consortium will again include Deutsche Bank and the  communication network experts from RWE Energie, but also energy  firm Schwaben AG [Aktiengesellschaft], the Swedish data  radio-telephony experts Telia International, and the French  diversified utility company Generale des Eaux. Potential  customers in this huge market are not only the obviously mobile  transport firms, bus and taxi operators, and security and  surveillance services, but also banks and commercial enterprises  of all kinds.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Further talks on East Timor Indonesia and Portugal agreed yesterday to hold further talks over the disputed territory of East Timor after their foreign ministers met UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Reuter reports from Rome. Foreign Ministers Ali Alatas of Indonesia and Jose Manuel Durao Burroso of Portugal both said they were still far apart on the main question of East Timor's right to self-determination. The former Portuguese colony was annexed by Indonesia in 1976 but the UN does not recognise the annexation. Their next meeting was scheduled for September 17 at the United Nations in New York.</p>

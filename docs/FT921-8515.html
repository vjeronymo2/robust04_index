			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Greeks come under attack in Albania GREECE is to protest to Albania over reports of attacks against the Greek minority in the southern town of Saranda, the Foreign Ministry said, Reuter reports from Athens. The ministry said yesterday that since Saturday in Saranda Greek people, shops and the offices of Omonia party representing the Greek minority had come under attack. Albanian police 'have not taken the necessary measures to stop the incidents . . . which are part of the intensifying anti-Greek climate in view of the upcoming elections,' Greek officials said. Albania has banned Omonia, which holds five seats in parliament, from running in next month's general elections. Greece says says 400,000 ethnic Greeks live in Albania. Albania puts the number at 57,000.</p>

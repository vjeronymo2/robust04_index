			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Pride of place in French wallets It might seem a little strange to commemorate an unassuming piece of plastic, but the French can be justly proud of a pioneering payment system that has just turned 10 years old and remains far ahead of its equivalents in other countries: the carte bancaire system. While the British still struggle with rival and incompatible banking networks, and the US has only recently begun to move towards a single system, for a decade the French have been able to withdraw cash from the dispenser of any bank around their country - and in many other places around the world. For longer still - since 1967 - they have been used to paying for their purchases in shops electronically with a plastic card, in stark contrast to the 'Switch' system in the UK, for example, which has only just started to make progress against cash. The history of the banking card and the development of the inter-banking system represent a uniquely French blend of co-operation over competition and an obsessive interest in developing new technology. Many of the French refer to the plastic bank card in their wallet as the carte bleu. In fact, until a decade ago, this was the trade name for only one of three intensely competitive and incompatible systems with different cards, procedures and equipment. Twenty-seven years ago, the carte bleu charge card was launched jointly by Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale, Credit Industriel et Commercial and Credit Commercial de France. Within a year, 25,000 merchants were accepting the 265,000 cards for payments for goods and services. Four years later, in 1971, magnetic strips were added to the cards, allowing withdrawals from cash dispensers at banks around the country. Rival national systems were established by Credit Agricole and Credit Mutuel. While the carte bleu network began to add new member banks and sign an agreement internationally with Visa, Credit Agricole launched a 'Contact' card - renamed the carte verte in 1978 - and linked up in other countries with MasterCard. The battle between the 'green' and the 'blue' cards and with Credit Mutuel's rival network came to a head in 1984, when the three groupings agreed to co-operate with a single national network. The new name was 'CB' - for carte bancaire - with both colours diplomatically included in the design of the card. At that time, there were 315,000 merchants and 7,200 automatic teller machines accepting 13.8m cards. Ten years later, the figures have shot up impressively: 530,000 retailers and 19,000 ATMs accepting 22m cards. There are more than 2.2bn transactions involving payments of FFr511bn (Pounds 61bn) and withdrawals of FFr624m in 1993. 'Success was not guaranteed,' recalls Mr Claude Menesguen, chairman of the Groupement des Cartes Bancaires, the association of the banks that administers the system. 'Getting institutions with different views and interests to work together was not clear-cut.' Innovation did not stop with co-operation between the banks, however. Back in 1983, the banks were experimenting with 'memory cards' which included microprocessors. By 1990, all the banks had incorporated these chips into 'smart cards', and introduced a four-digit security code to authorise payments. The result has been a substantial reduction in card fraud, which has fallen from 0.27 per cent of all transactions in 1987 to 0.04 per cent last year - which the French claim to be among the lowest proportions in the world. As Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said in a speech recently to commemorate the first decade of the inter-banking system, the carte bancaire allows the best of both worlds: co-operation to offer customers a universal service, and competition for banks to continue offering their own services to enrich the value of the card.</p>

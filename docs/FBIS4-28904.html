			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  and U.S. President Bill Clinton discussed over the phone Tuesday  North Korea's reported decision to pull out from the United  Nations' nuclear watchdog, Japanese officials said.    The conversation, which lasted about 18 minutes, followed  Pyongyang's announcement Monday that it has decided to withdraw  from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) due to  "unreasonable sanctions" imposed by the agency.    The punitive action was taken for North Korea's rejection of  inspections of its nuclear facilities suspected of being used  for nuclear arms development.    The Vienna-based IAEA says it has not received any word from  Pyongyang about the reported move.</p>

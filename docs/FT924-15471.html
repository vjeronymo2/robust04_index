			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE FALL in sterling as hopes of interest rate cuts in Germany and the US evaporated depressed derivatives markets yesterday, although trading activity was at a low ebb, writes Terry Byland. In stock index futures, the December contract on the Footsie lost much of its fair value premium on this week and also for the new equity account which opens on Monday; fair value is the premium against the cash market after allowing for dividend flows and financing costs on the underlying stocks. The December contract had an erratic session, opening lower and then moving higher, only to turn sharply downwards at the end of the day. At its best level of around 2,636, the contract could not match the best of the previous day. In after hours dealings, the contract traded around 2,575, a premium of 26 to cash and at a discount of around nine on next week's estimated fair value of 35. Total volume was extremely low at 9,827 Traded options was steadier, at 35,791, with the FT-SE contract trading 9,046 contracts and Trafalgar House (3,272) also active. Glaxo headed the list of stock options.</p>

			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Less than ecstatic Sir, Your travel writer, Kate Bevan, tells us in her article 'A sharp eye on the clouds' (November 5/6) that Santa Barbara is 'blessed with a wonderful beach'. Our experience in July 1992 left my family rather less ecstatic. The beach was dirty, the sea smelt of ammonia (perhaps as a result of the oil derricks dotted across the horizon) and the only other sun-worshippers were a handful of winos slumped under the trees. While my husband and son braved the hazards for a short dip, my daughter and I were not prepared to take the risk. I can only presume that the town's cleansing department has performed a miracle in the last two years. Barbara Coultas, 20 Tewit Well Avenue, Harrogate, North Yorkshire, HG2 8AP</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEAN TIMES FOR FOREIGN MOVIES  </P> <P> In "Lean Times for Foreign-Language Films" (Feb. 25), both Calendar writer  Sheila Benson and Gary Meyer, owner of Landmark Theaters, complain that college  students do not appreciate foreign cinema and are frightened off by subtitles.  </P> <P> I am a 20-year-old student and have seen more than half the films that Benson  warmly recalls.  </P> <P> Perhaps if Mr. Meyer did not charge $6.50 or $7 a ticket in his theaters, he  would see a larger college crowd. Offer a substantial student discount, Mr.  Meyer. I guarantee more students will have the chance to cultivate a taste for  films from "over there."  </P> <P> ANDREA MILLER  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

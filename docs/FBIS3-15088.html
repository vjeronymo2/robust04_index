The ministry's press secretary Ivars Embrekts, who told  Interfax this, said: "We hope that the Russian authorities will  understand that the Latvian government never approved of such  activities and will do its best to make their repetition  impossible."    He said that the investigation would be carried out by the  criminal police and the prosecutor general's office in  cooperation with officials of the Russian army and the Skrunda  station.    Embrekts thought that the explosion could have been  "organized either by those who want to obstruct the  Russo-Latvian talks or common thugs who did not even know that  important strategic assets of the Russian army were nearby. In  any case the perpetrators will be punished in compliance with  the Latvian law."    According to Embrekts, this was the essence of what Vladimir  Ionkin, first secretary of the Russian embassy in Riga who  handed a protest note to the Latvian Foreign Ministry, had been  told.</p>

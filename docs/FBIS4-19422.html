			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] At a restricted cabinet  meeting this afternoon, the political green light for the  withdrawal of the Belgian UN soldiers from Rwanda was confirmed,  despite the fact that the UN Security Council met last night but  did not come to a decision on that issue. Foreign Minister  Willy Claes explained to the press this afternoon that, despite  the fact that the Security Council has not made an official  decision on the desire of the Belgians to withdraw from UNAMIR  [UN Mission in Rwanda], its members have told the Belgian  Government that they acknowledge and fully understand the  Belgian decision. For Willy Claes, it is important to act  quickly. We do not have any time, he said. Listen to him. He  spoke to Gerard de Saigne:    [Begin recording] [de Saigne] I would like to ask you two  questions. The first one is this: You said that we do not have  any time. But why so much haste? The second: Have there been  any precedents....    [Claes, interrupting] I do not understand your first  question.    [de Saigne] You said that we do not have any time to  repatriate our troops. This means that it is important to act  quickly. I am asking you: Why so much haste? Why so fast? Why  right now?    [Claes] I still do not understand your first question. What  do you mean?    [de Saigne] You said: We do not have any time. This means  that we have to act quickly. Why do you want to repatriate our  troops so fast? Is it not clear?    [Claes] If I understand you, you are saying: Stay a bit  longer.    [de Saigne] I am not saying that. I am asking you why.    [Claes] You are intimating....    [de Saigne, interrupting] I am not intimating anything. I am  asking a clear question.    [Claes] For me, it is not clear because I have already  explained four times why. I did not speak in double Dutch, but  I will have to explain things once more for your benefit.    Chaos is increasing by the minute in Kigali and in the rest  of the country. Since yesterday -- and a colleague of yours  showed it in pictures -- the Rwandan Armed Forces have even been  using the most modern multiple rocket launchers. This means  that, any moment now, even the airport runway, which is  considered as the most strategic point in the whole country, is  in danger of being destroyed.    If you want your troops to have an unthinkable fate -- they  are like rats in a trap -- it is your responsibility. We will  not accept it. Moreover, I would like to remind you that the  anti-Belgian climate has meant that the UN soldiers have been  running extra risks for several days now. The others do not  seem to be running these risks for the time being. We even have  information from reliable sources according to which the Rwandan  Armed Forces are getting ready to attack the Belgian UN soldiers  as soon as the Belgian paratroopers leave. [end recording]  [passage omitted]    An increasing number of refugees are flocking to the border  countries, including Zaire. About 1,000 of them are stuck at  the Zairean border at the moment, since the Rwandan authorities  have decided to close that border. Many of these refugees are  Tutsis.</p>

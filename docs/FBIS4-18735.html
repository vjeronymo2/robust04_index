			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 9 (AFP) -- Western governments joined  forces Saturday [9 April] to prepare an operation to evacuate  around 3,000 of their nationals from Rwanda.    According to information to hand, there are 1,500 Belgians,  600 French, 350 Germans, about 100 Britons, 255 Americans, 198  Italians, 200 Canadians, 175 Swiss, 135 Spaniards and some 100  Dutch nationals in the former Belgian colony. Several countries  began arrangements to airlift their citizens from the  crisis-ridden country on Saturday.    Two hundred and eighty French paratroopers arrived from  bases  in the Central African Republic early on Saturday morning and  took control of the airport at the Rwandan capital, Kigali.  Another 120 troops and a medical contingent are due to arrive  towards close of day, bringing the total French military  presence in Rwanda to 400.    In addition, 330 U.S. Marines belonging to a force stationed  off the coast of Somalia arrived in the Burundian capital  Bujumbura on Saturday, while two Belgian C-130 Hercules  transport planes took off from military bases near Brussels to  take part in the evacuation.    Belgian paratroopers were due to leave Brussels at Saturday  afternoon and make a stopover at Nairobi before flying on to  Kigali.    Some 2,400 men from 24 countries are already serving as part  of a UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda. They were sent after an  October 1993 Security Council resolution to oversee the run-up  to general elections scheduled for 1995.</p>

The contribution of these three new members will bring  something new and different into the EU even as the nations  making up the hard core of the Union search for a political  initiative which remains the essential objective to be pursued,  Andreatta said in commenting on the outcome last night of the  enlargement talks.    Andreatta voiced satisfaction over the fact that the  necessary compromises reached, especially in the agricultural  sector, did not lead to any conservation of frontiers or of  customs controls. The understandings with Austria with regard  to road transit, while not leading to immediate liberalization,  as hoped, nevertheless broke the bottlenecks in Italian traffic  flow, he said.    However, for Andreatta, the most important aspect of EU  enlargement (which could well be extended soon to Norway, as  well) was the movement towards a truly European dimension for  the Union which does not coincide merely with West Europe but  which is heading for the shape and configuration imagined for it  by thinkers back in the pre-World War period.    This enlargement is a political gesture, he said, because it  should serve as a prelude to the inclusion in the Community of  the former Communist states of East and Central Europe, whose  participation in the continent's process of integration is today  the biggest question facing the European Union, in his view.  "If we do not manage to give European citizenship to the  inhabitants of these countries, Europe will have lost one of  those golden opportunities that history rarely offers," he said.    With these new members, Europe acquires a wealth of "diverse  experiences, new men and new sensibilities," he went on.  However, he saw as being necessary a political initiative on  the part of a hard core of four or five nations which, due to  their importance, should together forge a foreign policy. For  this reason, a federal form within the center may be necessary,  according to the diplomatic chief.</p>

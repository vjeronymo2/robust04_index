			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW, TAKE REGGIE JACKSON FROM TELEVISION, PLEASE  </P> <P> I want you to know that I tried, really tried, to learn to tolerate Reggie  Jackson as the color man on KTLA's Angel telecasts, but it just can't be done.  The guy never shuts up, with every inane pronouncement handed down as if from  Moses coming off the mountain.  </P> <P> Reggie Jackson was a fine ballplayer, but as a broadcaster he is a disaster.  </P> <P> TOM CHAMBERS  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

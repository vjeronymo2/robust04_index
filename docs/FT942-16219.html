			<p>940412 FT  12 APR 94 / Hawke attacks media head Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media owner, has been accused by Mr Bob Hawke, former Australian prime minister, of not telling the truth about his claim that the government had encouraged him to lift his stake in the Fairfax publishing group to 35 per cent. Mr Hawke, testifying before a Senate inquiry into foreign ownership of Australian newspapers, said: 'The simple fact is that Conrad Black does not tell the truth.' The inquiry, which started in December, is investigating Mr Black's claim that Mr Paul Keating, Mr Hawke's successor, had told him he would be allowed to buy a 35 per cent share in Fairfax in exchange for 'balanced coverage' by the group's publications during the election in March last year. It aims to establish whether Mr Keating had sought to influence the decision of the Foreign Investment Review Board.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Standard fees for criminal legal-aid work THE Lord Chancellor's plans to introduce standard fees for criminal legal-aid work in magistrates' courts would result in a 'significant reduction in the availability of criminal legal-aid services to the public', the Law Society warned yesterday. The society, the solicitors' ruling body, said that a survey of law firms in England and Wales involved in criminal legal-aid work showed that 32 per cent of the 1,021 firms that responded would scale down their commitment to criminal practice if the proposals were introduced in their current form. Fourteen per cent said they would permanently withdraw all their staff from 24-hour duty solicitor advice schemes at police stations and 11 per cent said they would withdraw some of their staff. In addition, 15 per cent would withdraw all staff from magistrates' court duty schemes. The society said the impact of such withdrawals would threaten the viability of some schemes and could force others to collapse.</p>

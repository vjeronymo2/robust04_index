			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cala cuts loss to Pounds 980,000 BY FOCUSING on its core housebuilding activities Cala, the Aberdeen-based builder and developer, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 6.94m to Pounds 980,000 in the year to June 30. However, with the housing market having suffered a further setback and the outlook 'obscure' the company is proposing to cut its final dividend from 2.25p to 1.15p leaving the total at 2.3p (3.4p). Mr Geoffrey Ball, chairman, said that firm management controls had been reimposed on its south of England housebuilding side and losses had been significantly reduced as they had been in the Midlands. In Scotland its activities were still profitable. The pre-tax figure was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 1.25m of which Pounds 628,000 related to discontinued activities. It included commercial property writedowns of Pounds 840,000 and housebuilding land writedowns of Pounds 8,000. Gearing increased from 40 per cent to 56 per cent at the year end as a result of investment in land. Turnover was Pounds 66.2m (Pounds 93.3m). Losses per share were 3.44p (15.09p).</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the presidential election  runoff scheduled for 19 June.    Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana has accused  President Gaviria of breaking the principles that require his  impartiality in electoral matters, asserting that Gaviria has  clearly acted to expressly promote the candidacy of Liberal  Party candidate Ernesto Samper. Pastrana said: "The political  guarantees necessary for this campaign to take place under  conditions of equality and impartiality do not exist." (Santa  Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p 6A)    Ernesto Samper asked former Envigado Mayor Jorge Meza, who  faces a scandal as a result of presumed links with drug  traffickers, to abstain from participating in campaign  activities to promote his candidacy. Samper welcomed a  statement by Bishops Conference President Pedro Rubiano, who  said that the Catholic Church does not favor any candidate. He  added that he "did not deem appropriate the strategy used by the  other candidate to establish religious differences among  Colombians." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 9 Jun 94  p 6A)    On 9 June, Ernesto Samper said that Pastrana has adopted an  unnecessarily aggressive and intolerant position that does not  benefit Colombian democracy. According to Samper, Pastrana "is  thoroughly exploiting" the media "his family owns" to attack him  politically and personally. President Cesar Gaviria yesterday  told Pastrana that no actions by his government have sought to  favor, openly or tacitly, any of the presidential candidates or  to influence the current electoral contest. (Santa Fe de Bogota  EL TIEMPO in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p 6A)    Ernesto Samper and vice presidential running mate Humberto  de  la Calle rejected on 10 June what they called a "dirty war" on  the part of Andres Pastrana, whom they accused of seeking to  provoke a "religious clash" in the country. During a news  conference, he noted that "Pastrana's campaign, by resorting to  the old slander policy, has spread accusations of all types that  have made some prelates disregard the instructions made at the  Bishops Conference." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish  11 Jun 94 p 7A)    According to two polling companies cited by local media,  Pastrana appears to be the favorite to win the 19 June  elections. The figures created confusion among voters, because  they contrast with the results obtained during the 29 May  elections when Samper beat Pastrana by a narrow margin.  (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1825 GMT 11 Jun 94)    On 10 June, a telephone tap was discovered in Ernesto  Samper's office. Samper said: "This is an unprecedented  action, and whoever did it is a scoundrel." (Santa Fe de Bogota  Inravision Television Canal A Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 11 Jun  94)    Regarding the alleged telephone spying against Samper,  Pastrana said: "That is not my style nor that of my campaign. I  believe that the security organizations must clear up this  situation and that, if there are any accusations, they must be  made through the pertinent organizations." (Santa Fe de Bogota  Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 13 Jun 94)    Ernesto Samper ended campaign activities today to begin the  last week of meetings with fellow Liberal leaders. Samper  called attacks by Monsignor Dario Castrillon unfair, adding:  "Liberals are also Catholics, and we will not accept having a  conscientious veto among Colombians, because of an act of  religious fanaticism inspired by Pastrana's campaign." Pastrana  is also preparing to close the last week of his campaign.  Pastrana stated: "I seek to govern for all Colombians, not just  for a minority." (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television  Canal A Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 13 Jun 94)    During the weekend of 11 June Monsignor Dario Castrillon  rejected Samper's alliance with Protestant groups and asked  Catholic Liberals not to vote for Samper because, according to  him, Samper promotes abortion and denies the rights of most  Catholics. Pastrana denied any favoritism by the Church and  said: "Colombians do not want a candidate such as Samper, who  encourages violence. Colombians are weary of violence; we want  peace. Nobody is stirring any clashes. Samper is the only one  who has invented this war." Samper's campaign denied 14 June  that their presidential program includes promoting abortion or  denying the rights of Catholics. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision  Television Canal A in Spanish 0000 GMT 15 Jun 94)    During an interview, Samper said he believes Pastrana does  not have enough political experience because he has not occupied  a post at the national level. He added: "I am willing to give  Pastrana a ministry so that he may complete his training." The  country wants changes and new spaces, which we are willing to  open. The new country is the one that supports me, the blacks,  Indians, independent sectors, and demobilized guerrillas, Samper  concluded.

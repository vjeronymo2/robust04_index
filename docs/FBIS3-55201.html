			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Chuprin: "What Will Christmas Sunday Be </F> Like in Moscow?"]    [Text] There are attempts to blow up the comparative  political quiet in Moscow since the events of 3-4 October last  year. Representatives of a number of opposition movements --  the "Russian National Union," the "National Salvation Front,"  and "Working Moscow" -- have stated their intention to hold mass  protest actions 9, 11, and 12 January "against the 21  September-4 October coup d'etat" and also to show their negative  attitude toward the start of the new parliament's work.    Your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent was told at the Moscow  city hall state and law administration that whether the  demonstrations will take place will be decided 5 January at 1200  hours at a meeting between the city's executive power and the  opposition leaders.    Will these politicians not turn the 1994 Christmas holidays  into a 1905 "bloody Sunday?"</p>

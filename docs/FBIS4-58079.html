			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Nasir al-Shahri: "Saudi Arabia-Yemen: </F> Sanaa Requests Postponement of Border Talks"]    [Excerpts] Riyadh -- The eighth session of the Saudi-Yemeni  Experts Joint Borders Committee, scheduled to be held in the  Saudi capital today, has been postponed at the request of the  Yemeni Government.    AL-HAYAH has learned from reliable sources that the Yemeni  Foreign Ministry instructed its ambassador in Riyadh to convey  to Saudi officials Sanaa's wish to postpone the meeting until a  later date "perhaps to be announced after the current pilgrimage  season." The sources attribted the Yemeni request to the  intensifying differences between Sanaa and Aden, particularly  after the failure to implement the reconciliation agreement  between the Yemeni president and his deputy. [passage omitted]    This is the fourth time Yemen has requested postponement of  committee meetings since they started in July 1992.    Saudi Arabia still insists on its position, calling for the  implementation of al-Ta'if border agreement signed by the two  countries in 1934. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Opposition gives Keating's Labor a leg up in the polls: Conservative reform manifesto played into economically beleaguered Australian government's hands A YEAR after Mr Paul Keating moved into the prime minister's office, Australia's Labor government should be in its death throes. Unemployment is at a post-war record of 11.4 per cent, economic growth is sluggish, and the country is being swept by a wave of politically inspired industrial unrest. Yet far from slipping towards inevitable defeat in a general election due before June next year, the government's popularity has surged in recent opinion polls, putting Labor within reach of an historic fifth consecutive victory. Suddenly, Mr John Hewson, leader of the conservative Liberal/National party coalition, is facing the prospect of defeat in an election that looked unloseable a few months ago. Paradoxically, the roots of the government revival lie in the release in November 1991 of the opposition's Fightback programme for government  - a detailed manifesto commitment to wide-ranging economic and social reform. The proposed mix of labour market deregulation, tariff reductions and tax reform was carefully designed to present a coherent programme building on Labor's own reforms since 1983. The centrepiece was a switch to taxing consumption rather than production by replacing six taxes, including payroll tax and wholesale sales tax, with a 15 per cent goods and services tax (GST). At first, Fightback was a success. Mr Bob Hawke, the then prime minister, appeared confused by the detailed opposition proposals and the government seemed unable to identify a convincing weak spot. Fightback helped trigger a Labor leadership battle in December last year which led to the replacement of Mr Hawke by Mr Keating, a former treasurer (finance minister), who had languished on the back benches for six months after failing in an earlier challenge. Since then, Mr Hewson has been outmanoeuvred by Mr Keating, who has cleverly focused debate on the alleged inequities of the proposed GST, assisted by criticism from religious and social welfare groups. At the same time, Mr Keating has diverted the attention of voters away from pressing economic problems through uninhibited use of the government's ability to manage the news. This technique has been used to prompt anguished debate on emotional issues such as the abolition of the monarchy, sex on television, the removal of British symbols from the Australian flag, and exploitation of Aborigines. The federal government has also been helped by conservative election victories in Tasmania and Victoria, where conservative governments are implementing radical changes in labour law. The reforms have provoked widespread industrial action, in particular in Victoria, and appear to have caused a backlash against the more restrained labour market changes proposed by the federal opposition. However, Labor strategists are well aware that the polls may be misleading. A federal election is more like a series of regional elections than a national poll, and Labor is vulnerable to local problems in some states. The government has hopes of picking up three or four seats in the eastern seaboard states, and may win two or three seats in Victoria if the anti-conservative backlash there continues. But Labor is defending four marginal seats in Western Australia, where its prospects could be damaged by the impending trial of a former premier and a difficult state election in February. In South Australia, up to five marginal Labor seats could be in danger because of the unpopularity of the state Labor government and changes in electoral boundaries. Mr Keating implicitly acknowledged these problems last month by ruling out an election before Christmas. On the face of it, delay looks like a dangerous strategy against a background of economic growth of about 2.1 per cent a year, compared with a required rate of about 4 per cent if unemployment is to be significantly reduced. But if the polls are right, the electoral impact of slow growth and continued high unemployment may be diminishing, perhaps because of 'compassion fatigue' among the 89 per cent of voters who are in work. If the trend continues, Mr Keating may be tempted to plump for a quick election, possibly as early as mid-February. Labor's pollsters and advertising advisers were called in last week to advise the prime minister on timing. Mr Hewson is expected to try to recapture the initiative tomorrow by announcing modifications to Fightback, including exempting food from the GST and postponing cuts in unemployment benefits. Surveys suggest that such changes would weaken opposition to Fightback and make it more difficult for the government to continue to divert attention from the failures of its economic policies. Nevertheless, Mr Keating has shown that it is too early to write off the government. Labor may not win the election, but it no longer fears a landslide defeat. That is more than many Labor MPs expected when the prime minister took office a year ago.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  Zhu Rongji stressed today that to mobilize the whole nation to  give firm support to and take an active part in the country's  current reform is one of the major tasks of the ideological and  media workers.    Zhu, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political  Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party  (CCPCC), made the remark at an on-going national conference on  ideological and media work in Beijing.    He urged those working on the ideological and media front to  serve the overall needs of "seizing opportunities, deepening the  reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting economic  development and maintaining social stability".    He said that ideological and media work should give correct  guidance and have a clear-cut stand supporting reform.    Ideological workers must have a good understanding of the  party's range of policies and make full, correct and timely  reports on economic development as a whole, he said.    The vice-premier pointed out that the principle of "telling  the truth, bringing the initiative of the masses into full play,  and achieving actual gains" should be carried out to promote a  sustained, fast and sound economic development.    It is a bounden duty for the ideological and media workers  to  maintain social stability and to give the broad masses a clear  explanation of the party's policies in the course of reform, he  said.    Zhu fully affirmed the great achievements made by the  ideological and media workers in the reform and economic  development over the past decade, and he also briefed the  conference participants on the national economic development in  1993.    Speaking of the current favorable climate of reform and  opening to the outside world, he said that the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics has struck root  in the hearts of the people after a decade of reform.    And the party and the government have accumulated a wealth  of  experience, he said, adding that China's economic development  has been encouraging since the publication of Deng Xiaoping's  important speech in 1992.    He said that some problems that occurred on the way forward  have been solved by taking a range of macro-economic control  measures.    The framework of a socialist market economic structure  worked  out by the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress  of the CCPCC has laid a solid ideological foundation for  implementing the current reform policies, Zhu said.    Zhu emphasized that the current rare historical  opportunities  should be seized firmly and valued highly "to do what we wanted  to do in the past, but could not do."    When talking about the reform program for this year, Zhu  said, "the preparatory work is adequate and we are quite ready  to overcome the difficulties before us."    The vice-premier quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying "the whole  party and the whole nation must be told that it is a hard task"  and "there are no perfect policies or methods."    He noted that the main risk, currently, does not lie in the  reform itself, but in the overexpansion of investment in fixed  assets, which has gone beyond the capacity of the nation to  build on the investment.    The agricultural problem remains outstanding, he pointed  out,  adding that some people are keen on creating a larger scale or  faster speed or high consumption.    "They are not interested in the economic returns, practicing  of economy, making profits, and taking care of the well-being of  the broad masses," he said.    He stressed that this situation must be changed.    The vice-premier said that great efforts should be made this  year to cut down on the scale of fixed asset investment and to  continue the development of the rural economy.    He stressed that party committees and governments at all  levels must pay still more attention to the reform and the  leading cadres must stand in the forefront of carrying out the  reform program in the new year.</p>

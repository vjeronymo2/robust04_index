			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Mikhail </F> Melnik]    [Text] Kiev May 4 TASS -- G-7 countries understand  Ukraine's concerns about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but  have not made any commitments to extend much needed financial  support, a Ukrainian high-ranking official said.    In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday,  Mikhail Umanets, chairman of the Ukrainian State Committee for  Nuclear Power Engineering, said that Ukraine is ready to shut  down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in return for financial  assistance.    A Ukrainian governmental delegation met with a group of G-7  officials in Kiev today to discuss the issue. The Ukrainian  side said it needs over 3 billion U.S. dollars to go ahead with  the plan of closure.    However, there has been no response from G-7 officials yet,  Umanets said. He said that the matter has been handed over to a  special working group set up today.    Detailed reports on the problem will be submitted to the  upcoming G-7 summit meeting in Naples. Umanets did not rule out  the possibility that "the sides will reach a consensus" in  Naples.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Eurotunnel pessimistic on share inquiry Eurotunnel's investigation into the alleged downward manipulation of its share price ahead of the pricing of its Pounds 858m rights issue is likely to prove unsuccessful, according to the company. Its efforts have been hampered by French secrecy laws which mean details of any market manipulation are unlikely to emerge. 'I don't think we will ever find the smoking gun,' said Mr Stephen Walker, Eurotunnel's company secretary. Last month the company issued Section 212 notices to British and French financial institutions to discover if underwriters had sold shares they did not own to buy them back later more cheaply. Eurotunnel believes any large-scale shorting was done in Paris but the details that several French-based institutions have given in their 212 returns are very limited. Banque Worms, for example, stated it did not own or have an interest in any Eurotunnel shares but held about 9.5m on behalf of approximately 2,000 clients. 'French law imposes banking secrecy obligations which prevent us from giving you further information in the absence of authority from our clients,' Banque Worms said. Exact movements of shareholdings in the run-up to the rights issue announcement on May 26 will emerge in about six weeks once NatWest Registrars has computed all Eurotunnel share trading details. However summaries of the 212 replies from UK underwriters indicate the report is unlikely to yield many clues. SG Warburg, for example, states it had a short position in Registered Units at various times from March 1 to June 9, but over the period its holding was broadly level. Only amongst non-underwriters is there evidence of large-scale shorting and selling in London. NatWest securities reveals it was a large seller of Eurotunnel shares over the rights issue period. In its 212 reply dated June 23 Morgan Stanley declared that it had a 'short nominee interest' of 7.6m shares. The 212 notices were issued after the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French stock market regulator, began an investigation.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by UCA (Central American University): "The </F> Fiasco of the Century"]    [Text] The 20 March elections, which naive optimists  considered of such great importance that they called them the  elections of the century, turned into a great fiasco. The number  and gravity of the election irregularities make it difficult to  speak of free and clean elections. The dignity of the Salvadoran  people has once again been disregarded by the officials in  charge of the process.    While the political parties, the magistrates of the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal, and President Cristiani himself insistently  yet pleasantly urged the people to vote in these elections, many  citizens lost patience after having to wait for over two hours  to enter their polling place. A still unknown number, despite  having a voter registration card, were unable to vote either  because they were not listed in the registry or because the  information on their registration card did not agree with the  registry data, or even worse, because someone else had voted in  their place earlier. In large cities, where there were few  voting centers and they were organized alphabetically, forcing  people to travel for considerable distances, the citizens'  efforts to vote were impeded by lack of transportation; a  similar situation prevailed in rural areas for the same reason.  Polling places opened late because of the inefficiency and  disorganization of the boards of election officials that were to  receive votes; at 1700, people still waiting in line to vote  were turned away from some polling places, disregarding the  instructions that had been given. Throughout the course of the  day, the election boards demonstrated a lack of preparation and  experience in controlling voting procedures, and the vote  counting and preparation of the official election returns were  slow and complicated. After 2200, the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal, despite having preliminary results from almost the  entire country in its possession, began to read these return  documents in a very unprofessional manner, amidst accusations  from the opposition about impeding the presence of its  representatives in the vote computation center.    In the end, the blind were able to vote, but it is clear  that  all this expensive and inefficient election machinery is  designed for a citizenry whose literacy level by far outstrips  El Salvador's. In fact, with an officially acknowledged  illiteracy rate of 45 percent, not including functional  illiterates, it is practically impossible for an average  Salvadoran to find his name in the registry and identify the  right table, or one who can clearly identify the destination of  each part of the ballot and his party choice, as well as sign  the electoral registry.    In a word, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal prevented a good  number of citizens from voting. But in the end, it was the  political parties themselves that were responsible for this  fiasco, as this tribunal is in their hands. So the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal demonstrated the inefficiency and lack of  responsibility of the political parties. It is a good thing that  they conducted voting tests; what might have happened if the  system had not been tested!    The first results revealed a high rate of abstentions: 47  percent of the citizens did not vote. That was due in part to  obstacles the citizens encountered when trying to vote; it was  also partly due to the fact that 400,000 citizens were listed in  the registry whose names should not have been there, and that  150,000 did not remove their voter identification card, but it  was also caused by the citizens' lack of interest, apathy, and  lack of confidence in the electoral process. Many did not want  to be deceived once again and decided to stay home. In 1989,  Cristiani won with an abstention rate of a little over 50  percent. This time the abstention rate might be a little lower,  but in any case the massive voter turnout that the politicians  had hoped for still did not materialize. It should not be hard  to determine how many citizens were not allowed to vote, and how  many did not want to vote. So the civic festival the politicians  were expecting was tarnished by the low turnout of the invited  guests.    The fiasco of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front] is also evident. It trusted that what were called the  rules of the game were going to be respected, without paying  proper attention to the context in which the electoral process  was taking place. It is interesting to compare its optimistic  statements on Sunday morning with its critical attacks issued  that night, when it was faced with the harsh reality. In the  morning it had allowed itself to be deluded by the number and  appearance of the crowds who were going to the polls,  disregarding the warnings that we in PROCESO and ECA had been  making on the limited historic scope of these elections as well  as on their restricted freedom and their dubious transparency.  The FMLN had been forewarned, but the illusion of political  power counted for more. What appeared impossible actually  happened. That is how the hard lessons of history are learned,  lessons that are never forgotten.    The preliminary election results indicate that the citizens  did not give the party now in office the votes it needed to win  the presidency in the first round or a comfortable majority in  the legislative assembly. So the official party has been dealt  an unpleasant surprise; the triumph it had expected slipped out  of its hands. Its performance in office does not enjoy absolute  support from the citizens, nor are its facile promises extremely  credible. Cristiani was also hoping for a massive approval of  his record in office, to the point of thinking that even the  impunity which human rights violators have enjoyed during his  presidency was going to be approved at the ballot boxes.    ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] undoubtedly does  have  considerable support, but this support is not sufficient to win  the presidency in the first round and obtain a majority of the  deputies. ARENA's dominant position has now been abolished. This  is good for EL Salvador since, despite its short time in office,  this party's officials and members already consider themselves  the lords and masters of the government.    The coalition of the left won an honorable second place, but  not enough to challenge the ruling party on an equal footing. Of  course, it has become the country's second political force, but  it still has much to learn and improve if it is to maintain that  second place and move toward the presidency. One clear  consequence shown by the election results is the need to  strengthen the coalition internally. Even as the opposition, it  is essential that it be strong and coherent.    Christian Democracy continues to lose votes in relation to  its performance in past elections, and now occupies a rather  uncomfortable third place, as the IUDOP [University Public  Opinion Institute of the Jose Simeon Canas Central American  University] polls had already predicted. The polarization of the  elections and its internal leadership crisis led to Christian  Democracy's collapse. If this party wants to remain in the  national political scene, it has to renew its leadership, as it  is doing very poorly when its candidate for mayor of San  Salvador wins a higher proportion of votes than its candidate  for the presidency of the entire nation.    There seemed to be no surprises in the smaller parties,  despite the religious pressures of some ministers who had urged  their congregations to vote for one of them. Therefore, the 20  March elections confirmed the objectivity and professionalism of  the IUDOP polls. The politicians who so frequently challenged  them during the campaign should now, in a spirit of ethics and  honesty in relation to reality, publicly admit that these polls  were on the right track.    The results of the elections should not be allowed to  overshadow the existence of grave irregularities, many of them  caused by the scandalous shortcomings of the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal and of the state apparatus as a whole. Independently of  whether or not the election results are favorable or unfavorable  to a specific party, the electoral system needs to be totally  revised and its failings corrected. It does a severe disservice  to the democratization of the nation when it is simply said that  the elections took place normally and the results are  acceptable, for those statements tend to cover up the electoral  system's antidemocratic defects.    The 20 March elections exposed with crystal clarity, for  anyone willing to see the facts, just how far the  democratization process in El Salvador is from its goal. What  happened should be analyzed in relation to the situation of  noncompliance with the peace accords. It is appropriate to  demand a cleaner second round, but it is not very realistic to  think that in two weeks the political parties are going to  correct what they did not do in two years. So it will be hard  for the second round to be any different from the first. Still,  not everything is negative; at least there is now awareness of  the electoral system's structural defects.    We sincerely hope that the illusion of power does not again  blind the political parties, particularly those who only protest  when the results are unfavorable to them. The 1994 elections  could become a first step toward strengthening the  democratization process if measures needed to begin to reform  the electoral system are adopted.</p>

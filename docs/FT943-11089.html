			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Berlusconi prepared to change Fininvest plan Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, is willing to consider changes in the proposals he has made on avoiding a conflict of interest with his Fininvest business empire. Hints of flexibility came as he prepared for today's important debate in parliament on recent incidents when his business interests have clashed with those of his role as prime minister. The debate is not a formal vote of confidence, but Mr Berlusconi is expected to use the occasion to try to recoup some of his battered prestige before the parliamentary summer break at the end of the week. It will also be an important test of the unity of the right-wing coalition government. Mr Berlusconi's proposals for avoiding a conflict of interest were unveiled on Friday and were based on advice from three lawyers who had originally been asked to report by the end of September. However, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has already ensured that part of the plan will have to be rewritten. He said that the president could not be asked to help nominate a five-person commission to monitor any conflict of interest, as suggested by Mr Berlusconi. That was outside the president's constitutional authority, he said. Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, a coalition partner, has promised to introduce new proposals during the debate. The League leader, who has been a constant thorn in Mr Berlusconi's side, says he is determined to prevent the prime minister having any influence over the management of Fininvest, Italy's second largest private company. Mr Berlusconi has let it be known that his own proposals can be reconsidered. But he is adamant about retaining ownership of Fininvest, albeit at a distance. Mr Bossi said over the weekend that ownership should be placed in a foundation, but did not elaborate. The former communist Party of the Democratic Left has said in the past that the problems can only be solved by Mr Berlusconi selling Fininvest. But most now recognise this is easier said than done. Any proposal will have to pass through parliament as a law, with discussion beginning in September. The League has the power to undermine the legislation, and Mr Bossi's partners in the right-wing coalition were nervous yesterday that he might threaten sabotage or an alliance with the opposition. However, Mr Bossi was thought likely to want to keep Mr Berlusconi guessing. Also influencing today's debate will be the nomination of a new chairman for Italy's anti-trust authority, following the death at the weekend of Mr Francesco Saja, a former head of the constitutional court. Mr Saja had played a significant role in trying to introduce the concept of anti-trust rules to cartel-ridden Italy. The nomination is controlled by the speakers of both houses of parliament, who have also been proposed to nominate Mr Berlusconi's conflict of interest commission.</p>

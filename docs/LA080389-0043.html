			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN COMES TO L.A.;  </P> <P> RECIPES HELP CELEBRATE NISEI WEEK IN LITTLE TOKYO  </P> <P> Nisei Week, which starts Saturday and continues until Aug. 13 in Little Tokyo,  will take you to Japan without having to fly there.  </P> <P> There will be a full week of street food-tasting that will match any on a  country road in Japan. Imagawa yaki (fried bean cakes), sushi and yaki-tori  (fried kebabs) are but some of the typical foods of the festival.  </P> <P> You may also find kushi-age, which is much like yaki-tori, except the foods are  breaded before frying and are served with dipping sauces or lemon juice.  </P> <P> Nisei Week, a celebration created by second generation Japanese (Nisei means  second generation) to foster good will and good business in their community, is  packed solidly with events, ranging from cooking demonstrations, art exhibits,  a car show, karate, kendo, aikido and iaido as well as other Japanese martial  arts demonstrations, a 5-K run and musical entertainment, including the Fujika  Quintet. There is no Nisei Week, however, without the coronation of the Nisei  Week Queen and ball -- which kick off the festivities on Saturday -- or the  parade at 4 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> But the food traditions are direct copies of those in Japan. Most of the street  foods are considered fast food because they are generally made on the spot.  </P> <P> For instance, yaki-tori, skewered bits and pieces of meat, fish or poultry, are  marinated for several hours but cooked to order by the street vendor (or  restaurant chef). Maki sushi (rolled sushi) is made on the spot to customers'  order, as is temaki sushi (seasoned rice and other foods wrapped in seaweed).  </P> <P> You will find imagawa yaki vendors preparing little flat cakes filled with soy  bean paste in cylindrical vats, much as one would make waffles. Then there is  the cooling taste of shaved ice cones topped with strawberry or lime syrup that  delight children and adults alike.  </P> <P> Nisei Week began 49 years ago in Little Tokyo to help second generation  Japanese Americans generate business in the Little Tokyo community. The first  festival included a poster contest, essay contest, some radio broadcasts, a  fashion show and various exhibits including a parade through the streets of  Little Tokyo. The following year, a beauty pageant, with a queen chosen by vote  was added.  </P> <P> Today's princesses are nominated by community organizations. The festival  ceased when Japanese-Americans were interned in camps during World War II but  resumed in 1949. Today hundreds of volunteers from community organizations help  promote and work in the Nisei Week program. The program of the week's events is  available at most shops, restaurants and banks in Little Tokyo.  </P> <P> If you can't get to the festival, here are a few recipes to make you think you  are there.

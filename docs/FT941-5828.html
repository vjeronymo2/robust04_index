			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Rumbled in bumbledom This is getting serious. The British government is being shown to be a bad liar. Worse, it begins to look as if Albion has forgotten the rules of perfidy. These are: do not get found out, have a plausible explanation ready just in case, and, finally, be honest and open whenever you possibly can. The latter rule is placed third, but do not be misled. It is of the essence of the matter. Poker players whose bluff is called cannot easily bluff again. Properly applied, the above three precepts might have kept Mr John Major and his cabinet out of the mire into which they have fallen. It is important not to be naive about this. All governments lie; many are treacherous; some cheat. A few polities, of which the American is the most outstanding, contain many checks and balances. These do not prevent corruption, but they make its detection possible. In continental Europe, backroom deals are not unheard of, but the most able administrators manipulate events with the greatest aplomb. For some reason, France springs to mind. The present British government would not recognise aplomb if it tripped over it. If it has read Machiavelli, it has failed to understand him. Our political masters lie like schoolboys. When caught, they point the finger of blame at one another. They invent hugely improbable excuses. They squeal and protest and whine that it was just this once. They shuffle words about, hoping that dextrous use of the infinitely flexible English language will deceive us. In short, they are incompetent with the truth. The degree to which this matters varies. At the election of April 1992 the Tories promised not to increase income tax or national insurance. They also said that they would not extend the scope of value added tax. To top it all they intimated that the economy would start to recover the day after they were returned to power. In fact, taxes have been increased by the greatest amount in peacetime history. The recession is over, but recovery did not begin until a year after Mr Major's victory. The government is paying dearly for its deceit. Usually supportive popular newspapers, aware of the disillusionment of their readers, have turned against the Conservatives in general and Mr Major in particular. The tabloids will probably return to the fold, but the Tories' fate at the next general election, due in 1996 or 1997, depends in large part upon the elector-ate's memory. Some concealments are justified. During much of last year the government led us to believe that it was not in communication with the Irish Republican Army. It chose its words carefully, referring to negotiation rather than communication. Yet the implicit message was that there would be no contact with terrorists. In November it emerged that the Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, had used an intermediary to establish whether there was anything in the proposition that the IRA was ready to declare a ceasefire. He was obliged to publish the relevant documents. There was a passing flurry of critical comment. Titch. Most of us accept that in this instance the government was right. If subterfuge is required to bring peace to Ulster, let us have more of it. Just do it better. Some breaches are winked at by Conservative backbenchers. Take the celebrated promise to build a dam at Pergau in Malaysia to offset the cost, to the Malaysians, of purchases of British arms. Sweeteners may be an inevitable part of the armaments trade. Where they come from is controversial. The permanent secretary of the overseas aid administration, Sir Timothy Lankester, regarded the Pergau project as an abuse of the aid budget. He demanded a written instruction before he would proceed. His fellow officials have silently ap-plauded, hoping that they would have done the same. One solution to the aid problem would be a separate sales-promotion slush fund for armaments deals. Another would be to look for different ways of making a living. That would be best. The weapons business is ultimately unprofitable. The Labour party rightly proposes a change to industries producing non-lethal goods. To most people, these are fine arguments. What sticks in the throat is that the government broke its own rules and then hid behind half-truths. One rule is that aid and arms sales should not be linked. This week Mr Douglas Hurd sat before a parliamentary committee to confess that, for three months in 1988, they were. It was a 'temporary and incorrect entanglement', he said. When it ended, the then defence secretary wrote to the Malaysians to say that an aid-arms link was not possible. The British high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur wrote to the same minister on the same day offering the same amount of aid. On Wednesday Mr Hurd argued that the two strategies - promoting defence sales and using aid to get civil contracts - were thenceforth separately followed. There was no link. He was as convincing as a bigamist protesting that his two marriages are separately enjoyed. Such malarkey can spoil a government's reputation. Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the sales of arms-manufacturing machinery to Iraq could blow this government apart. We must await the report to see whether it does. The evidence to date suggests that, however much they may deny it, some ministers seem to have felt obliged to risk the unjust imprisonment of three businessmen, merely to protect papers the government wanted to keep secret. A few of these documents should be secret; most of them should not. There is also the little accusation that the rules on arms sales to President Saddam were breached, and Parliament misled about it, but the politically explosive potential of that one is limited. What would anger people in all parties would be a finding by Lord Justice Scott that politicians were prepared to sacrifice individuals in the government's own interests. In sum, the underside of what was once universally regarded as a smooth, silken administrative machine has been exposed. Departments that thought they knew best now do not even know how best to measure what is and is not proper, let alone what Parliament should and should not be permitted to know. Whitehall and Westminster, which in good times work well together, are without camouflage. What is revealed is the kingdom of bumbledom.</p>

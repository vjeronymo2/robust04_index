			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage-related buying gives Nikkei late boost ARBITRAGE-related buying helped to push the Nikkei average into positive territory late yesterday, after drifting lower earlier due to a lack of fresh news, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index finished 56.91 ahead at the day's best of 20,854.59 after moving to the day's low of 20,627.02 in the morning session. Volume increased slightly to 200m shares from 180m on arbitrage-related trading. In spite of the rise in the Nikkei, other statistics reflected the overall weakness of the market as declines led advances by 618 to 287 at the close, with 203 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 7.64 to 1,494.79, falling below the 1,500 support level for the first time since November 1986. In London trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.42 to 1,136.58. Fears that arbitrageurs will unwind cash positions held against the March Nikkei index futures, which expire tomorrow, have been alleviated by a steady roll-over into the June contract. Traders said the weakness in the Topix index stemmed from worries that investors were not rolling over positions on the Topix futures. In addition, light selling by investment trusts and corporations depressed prices of large-capital issues and blue chips. A total of 224 stocks hit new lows since January last year. Traders said some investors are worried that a discount rate cut may not materialise this month. Bank of Japan governor Mr Yasushi Mieno re-turns from Europe today. Miss Caroline Stone at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said: 'Many people feel that a half-point cut has already been discounted by share prices, and they now expect a 75 basis points cut to help boost activity.' Drug-related stocks were actively traded by short-term investors. Okamoto, the day's most active issue, rose Y90 to Y1,330 and Mochida Pharmaceutical surged Y500 to Y4,430. High-technology issues continued to lose ground on selling by corporations. Hitachi receded Y15 to Y760 and Sony Y50 to Y3,900. Power suppliers, sensitive to interest rate movements, were sold on the weakness of the yen against the dollar, with Tokyo Electric Power falling Y40 to Y2,880. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone weakened Y4,000 to a new all-time low of Y674,000. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 70.58 to 22,248.60 in turnover of 147m shares. Heavy cross-trading ahead of the March year-end book closing lifted volume. Tokkin, or specified money trusts, and companies were seen liquidating holdings. Roundup THE PACIFIC Rim was mostly higher yesterday. Seoul was closed for a holiday. HONG KONG rose sharply in light trading as bargain hunters returned to the market after Monday's sell-off. The Hang Seng index gained 70.32 at 4,918.95 but turnover dipped to HKDollars 1.69bn from HKDollars 1.83bn. HSBC Holdings recovered HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 42.50 as rumours of a rights issue faded. It published 1991 results after the close. Banks turned in the day's steepest gains, followed by property counters. NEW ZEALAND rebounded after five days of declines. Carter Holt Harvey picked up 4 cents to NZDollars 2.26, after Monday's 18-cent fall on news of a big rights issue. The NZSE-40 index rose 15.35 to 1,461.24. AUSTRALIA gained ground in lacklustre trading, as selected buying of certain stocks helped to push up the market. A firmer futures market also gave support. The All Ordinaries index put on 7.2 to 1,605.4 in turnover of ADollars 148.6m. Among leading stocks, News Corp jumped 26 cents to ADollars 17.70, BHP added 18 cents at ADollars 13.44 and CRA rose 8 cents to ADollars 13.92. TAIWAN was little changed in thin trading as investors stayed on the sidelines due to a dispute within the ruling Kuomintang party over the election for the presidency. The weighted index edged forward 3.17 to 4,926.20 in turnover of TDollars 17.2bn. SINGAPORE chalked up modest gains in dull trading. Some buying of bank shares came in the wake of better than expected 1991 earnings from DBS Bank. The Straits Times Industrial index firmed 3.02 to 1,432.67. KUALA LUMPUR ended modestly higher after light bargain hunting, but investors were remaining cautious until the year-end company reporting season is over. The KLSE composite index added 2.94 at 586.95. MANILA climbed in a technical correction, but political uncertainty ahead of the May 11 polls kept volume low. The composite index improved 10.33 to 1,116.71 in combined turnover of 51.1m pesos, against a previous 90.8m. BANGKOK finished unchanged as losses in large-capital issues offset gains in other sectors. The SET index was just 0.28 up at 797.90 in turnover of Bt3.22bn, the smallest in two months. Bangkok Land lost Bt4 to Bt208 and Bangkok Bank also shed Bt4, to Bt684. BOMBAY retreated from Monday's record high after state-owned investment houses sold heavily to cool what they saw as an overheated market. The BSE index fell to 3,261.00 before closing at 3,316.03, down a net 231.58.</p>

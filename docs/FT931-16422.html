			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / US budget casts Clinton's goal into doubt PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton cannot fulfil his campaign promise of halving the budget deficit within four years without imposing strict controls on popular 'entitlement' programmes such as federal health care, according to Mr Richard Darman, the Bush administration's budget director. On unchanged policies, the budget deficit would not fall substantially below Dollars 300bn (Pounds 194.8bn) for the foreseeable future, a final skeleton budget from the Bush administration indicated yesterday. Mr Darman's figures show the deficit rising to Dollars 327.3bn this fiscal year, declining modestly to Dollars 266.4bn in fiscal 1996 and then rising again to Dollars 319.8bn in fiscal 1998. This compares with projections in last year's budget that the deficit would decline to just over Dollars 200bn by 1996. The difference reflects much less optimistic revenue projections in this year's budget, partly as a result of more realistic growth assumptions. Projected revenue over five years is more than Dollars 200bn lower than assumed last January. However, Mr Clinton's advisers said Mr Darman was still underplaying the extent of the fiscal deterioration by assuming that discretionary domestic spending would be frozen in cash terms from 1995 onwards, an unrealistic assumption. They said prospective deficits were Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn higher than assumed at last month's economic conference in Little Rock and unless checked could soar above Dollars 400bn towards the end of the decade. Mr Darman warned that efforts to curb the deficit by stimulating growth were doomed to fail. On his figures, in the absence of tax and spending measures, a halving of the deficit to about Dollars 150bn by fiscal 1996 would require four years of real growth averaging 4.4-4.8 per cent a year, a 'heroic' assumption. Mr Darman noted that Mr Clinton had also promised not to raise taxes on people earning less than Dollars 200,000 a year and to use any savings from health care cost controls to extend benefits for millions of uninsured workers. Health care savings thus could not be used to cut the deficit. These constraints created 'a circle that cannot be squared'. In the absence of tax increases on middle-income families, deficit reduction required a cap on all mandatory 'entitlement' programmes, such as health care for the elderly and poor, with most of the savings allocated to deficit reduction. If increases in mandatory spending were restricted to inflation plus an allowance for population growth, Dollars 409bn could be saved over five years and nearly Dollars 2,000bn over a decade, according to Mr Darman's figures. There was no scope for similar savings in any other part of the budget. In a carefully phrased reaction yesterday, Mr Clinton said the 'endless pattern of rising deficits must stop. . . . We must make the difficult choices that will allow us both to close the budget deficit and the investment deficit that together threaten our future.' However, the latest gloomy figures underline his fiscal dilemma. He wants to increase federal investment spending sharply without raising taxes on the middle classes. Yet he has not yet shown any appetite for curbing popular entitlement programmes. The two fastest growing are Medicare and Medicaid, the health care programmes for the elderly and poor. According to yesterday's budget, Medicare spending is set to rise from Dollars 129.9bn this year to Dollars 235.8bn by fiscal 1998; Medicaid from Dollars 80.5bn to Dollars 156.4bn. Mr Darman was at pains yesterday to emphasise the strength of the economy the Republicans were handing over. Real output had risen for seven quarters and was set to grow 3 per cent this year. Inflation would be just over 3 per cent and unemployment would fall to 7 per cent by year end.  ----------------------------------------------------- BUDGET DEFICIT PROJECTIONS*  ----------------------------------------------------- Year                 Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------- 1992**                    290.2 1993                      327.3 1994                      292.4 1995                      272.4 1996                      266.4 1997                      305.0 1998                      319.8  ----------------------------------------------------- * Assuming unchanged policies ** Actual  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

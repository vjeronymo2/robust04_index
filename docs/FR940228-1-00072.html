			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) The institution would divide the number of students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined in item (3) of this section by the total obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under item (2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The institution must maintain documentation that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student described in item (3) above, obtained gainful employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an occupation for which he or she was trained or in a related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupation. Examples of satisfactory documentation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student's gainful employment include, but are not limited to_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A written statement from the student's employer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Signed copies of State or Federal income tax forms; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Written evidence of payments of Social Security taxes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that requiring institutions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collect this data will help curb abuse by institutions that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overstate their placement rates in order to achieve and maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility for short-term programs. Furthermore, to further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid potential abuse, the Secretary proposes that in certifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the accuracy of an institution's placement rate, as required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under &sect;668.8(e)(2), the institution's auditor should review the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above types of documentation collected by the institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verify each student's inclusion in the placement rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute provides that the Secretary may prescribe other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to determine the quality of these programs. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;668.8(e)(1)(iii), to be eligible, programs less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 600 clock hours in length may not exceed by more than 50 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the minimum number of clock hours required for training in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized occupation for which the program prepares students, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by the State in which the program is offered, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State has established such a requirement. For example, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State requires security guard students to complete only 300 clock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours of training, a security guard program in that state will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be eligible if it exceeds 450 clock hours. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes this regulation will help curb abuse of the programs by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventing institutions from providing unnecessary training to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students in order to receive additional Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;668.8(e)(1)(iv) requires that to be eligible,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs less than 600 clock hours must have been in existence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for at least one full year. The Secretary believes that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time frame is necessary so programs may demonstrate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate completion and placement rates. Institutions will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under 34 CFR 600 to apply for eligibility of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs after the one-year requirement is satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> English as a Second Language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the elements already in place in the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations regarding English as a Second Language (ESL)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, &sect;668.8(j)(2) proposes that in order for an ESL program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be eligible, the institution must test each student at the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the program to substantiate that the student has attained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate proficiency in written and spoken English to use already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing knowledge, training or skills. The institution will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also be required to identify the test it gives to the students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the basis for the judgment that the student has attained the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate proficiency. This proposal, based on California law,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was suggested during the negotiation process as a method to stem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuse by institutions which offer ESL programs. As established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the current regulations, ESL programs which qualify as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible programs are eligible for purposes of the Federal Pell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grant program only. This provision remains unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B_Standards for Participation in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.12&blank;Application Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to add a new &sect;668.12 to codify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's current practices with regard to applications to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. This section also would include proposed procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whereby the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications to participate or to continue to participate in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 498(b) of the HEA requires the Secretary to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a single application form to be used by an institution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wishes to apply to participate or to continue to participate in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program. The statute requires that this form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for the collection of various information and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation. First, the form must require an institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide sufficient information and documentation to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the requirements of institutional eligibility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accreditation, and the capability of the institution are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the form must require an institution to describe the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between a main campus of an institution and all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its branches. In particular, the form must require an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to include a description of the student aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing that is performed by the main campus and that which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed at its branches. Third, the form must require an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to describe all third-party servicers of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution and supply a copy of any contract with a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer. Finally, the form must require an institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide any other information that the Secretary determines will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to eligibility, accreditation, administrative capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and financial responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

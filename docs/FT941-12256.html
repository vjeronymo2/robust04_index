			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Economic Diary Other economic news Monday: The week is dominated by a string of important economic indicators from the US. But today the focus turns to France where Insee, the statistical office, releases its business survey and December unemployment figures. The upward spiral of the jobless total paused in November and economists expect only a small increase in the rate for December. Tuesday: Another increase is expected for US construction spending in December. Economists believe that regardless of what the latest figures show, the construction industry should perk up in the first quarter when the rebuilding of Los Angeles begins. Wednesday: If, as expected, the US leading economic indicators for December rise, this will be the fifth successive increase in the series. Thursday: The focus will remain fixed on the US where figures for factory orders, car and truck sales, plus the weekly jobless and money supply figures are released. Friday: Markets will wait for signals from US unemployment data as to how strong the economy is growing. Minutes from the last FOMC meeting are also released.</p>

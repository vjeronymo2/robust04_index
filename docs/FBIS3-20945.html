			<p>Language: <F P=105> German, </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wolfgang Baier, VDI/VDE-IT GmbH (Association of </F> German Engineers and Association of German Electrical Engineers  - Information Technology Ltd)]    [Text]  TOU-ASSISTANCE  Tools and Implementation    1. Professional Support    To each enterprise founder the TOU-project carriers assign a  team consisting of an industrial manager and an engineer or  natural scientist. This team advises the founder during  conception of the enterprise, during work on implementation of  development plans, and during product marketing or production  setup. The consultations are free of charge, but cannot be made  available on an unlimited basis. The team members moreover  arrange contacts with actual customers, potential customers,  partners for joint projects, suppliers, and financial investors  while also doing, if necessary, research on technical and  marketing problems. Besides providing those free consultations,  the TOU-Project carriers also conduct seminars which are  specially planned to deal with problems relating to given  enterprises and which require payment of a fee for custodial  service.    2. Financial Support    Phase I. Conception. Work involved in conception of an  enterprise is supported with nonrepayable grants-in-aid, toward  expenses for necessary studies (market scope, technical  feasibility, etc.) and for certification of operations  management. The assistance covers 75% of these expenses  up to  45,000 DM maximum. The enterprise need not yet be established  during this phase.    Phase II. Development. The enterprise must have been  established and its founders must be fully devoted to carrying  out the development plan. Also during this phase they are  assisted with nonrepayable grants-in-aid covering up to  80% of  the expenses, but not exceeding the 800,000 DM maximum. A  marketable product should be ready at the end of this phase.    Phase III. Marketing. During this phase the BMFT can  underwrite TOU loans. The maximum amount of such a loan is twice  the large as a concurrent loan from a Home Loan Bank, but will  not exceed the 500,000 DM maximum. These loans do not require a  collateral and are not subject to an interest markup so that the  rate of interest on them is 3% below the market rate.    3. Implementation of Support    The application for support of an enterprise establishment  is  informally submitted to a TOU-Project carrier. The application  must include a brochure containing all ideas and describing  essential facts about the proposed enterprise. Following an  examination of these brochure (which takes about four weeks),  the TOU-Project carriers coordinate with the applicants the  further enterprise conception procedure. This includes a time  schedule, requirements for phase-I assistance, key items in the  conception work, etc.    After completion of the conception work (within about six  months), the application can be submitted for phase-II  assistance. A decision by the BMFT is then reached within six  weeks. Following the development phase (2-3 years), the  enterprise concept is to be checked out and prepared for  realization. Enterprises often require a second round of  financial support, for preparation of product marketing. When  necessary, TOU loans can now be applied for at the German  Equalization Bank.    4.

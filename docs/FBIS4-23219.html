			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page; article published in </F> English]    [Text] The uproar over the transfer of KwaZulu communal or  tribal land to a trust headed by His Majesty the King of the  Zulus is a dramatic illustration of the perverted morality that  pervades our country's propaganda organs.    For decades politicians have told us that the land issue was  at the root of the opposition to racial discrimination and  Apartheid.    Even the most politically illiterate politicians or  journalists bewailed the fact that only 13 percent of South  Africa was available for use and occupation by the African  people.    These were the miserable bits of land that remained after  the  conquest of the African people. These were the so-called  "Reserves", "scheduled areas" or "homelands" of the various  tribes.    Even the most oppressive White governments promised not to  take away these lands from the King, Paramount chiefs, and  chiefs who administered the lands in accordance with the  hallowed principles of African customary law.    Throughout the negotiations politicians of all parties gave  "assurances" that the communal land system would be safeguarded  and that the position of traditional leadership would be  preserved. Any doubts expressed by anyone were met with  indignant and vehement denials combined with hypocritical  expressions of respect for traditional rulers. Numerous  meetings were held in which traditional rulers were told that  their interests would be safe under the government of national  unity.    When His Majesty the King of the Zulus demanded actual legal  and constitutional guarantees it was alleged that His Majesty  was acting as a pawn of Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, President of  the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. Expensive advertisements  presented the so-called "offer" of "power" to the King. It was  pointed out that His Majesty did not want anything personal but  that the issues were those of the Kingdom, communal lands and  judicial powers in terms of customary law. Much verbal  propaganda and even abuse followed the rejection of the  inadequate ANC "offer".    The KwaZulu Legislative Assembly in the exercise of its  legitimate constitutional powers transferred the KwaZulu  communal lands to a Trust with His Majesty the King as the sole  Trustee.    This is not only in accordance with modern law but  represents  the position in indigenous customary law. The law passed by the  KwaZulu legislature was submitted to the then State President  for signature and became law. In this way the communal lands  continued to be the property of the Zulu people and the status  quo on land was preserved.    The furor that has broken out has been extremely revealing.  We are now told that the object was to place communal lands in  the hands of the state for purposes of distribution! We had all  along believed that distribution meant taking land from the rich  and giving it to poor black farmers.    State land is governed by Roman-Dutch law principles.  Communal land is governmed by African customary law. At a  stroke of the pen the World Trade Centre negotiators by  "sufficient consensus" gave all the communal lands in South  Africa to the central state.    We all owe a debt of gratitude to the members of the KwaZulu  Legislative Council for doing their utmost to safeguard the  communal lands. In so doing they have exposed the hollow  hypocrisy of those who have shouted from the housetops that they  respect the King of the Zulus and all other traditional rulers  and chiefs.    The wholesale movement of millions of people to the cities  that would follow state manipulation of communal lands would  render the impractical Reconstruction and Development Programme  even more difficult to fulfill.    Instead of the partisan castigation of KwaZulu and its  leadership all reasonable politicians and commentators should  avoid superficial generalities and recognise the need not only  to safeguard the existing communal lands but to greatly increase  them as an essential feature of land reform.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The European trade unions expect  decisive stimuli in combatting mass unemployment and in other  fields of European social politics from Germany's [European]  Council presidency, to begin on 1 July. In view of double-digit  unemployment figures, the European Trade Union [ETU] Federation  delegation's talk with FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl focused on  employment policies, Austrian ETU President Friedrich  Verzetnitsch later told journalists in Bonn.    The implementation of the proposals on combating  unemployment  that are contained in Commission President Jacques Delors' white  paper will also increase employees' preparedness to deal with  Europe, Verzetnitsch said. According to Government Spokesman  Dieter Vogel, Kohl also affirmed that the planned guidelines for  the establishment of European works councils, part-time work,  and limited employment are a major priority for Bonn.    ETU Secretary General Emilio Gabaglio; Dieter Schulte, newly  elected chairman of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB);  Roland Issen, chief of the German Salaried Employees Union  (DAG); and FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem (Christian  Democratic Union) also participated in the discussion. The  European Union unionists's visit to Kohl, planned a long time  ago, took place on Schulte's first working day in his new  office. Because of the traditional character of this meeting  before the takeover of the Council presidency, which changes  every six months, Schulte said he did not assess his visit to  the chancellor's office as his first formal visit there.</p>

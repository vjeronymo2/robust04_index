Without Equal Access. Would Reduce Competition for Cellular Interexchange Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The crux of the BOCs' original waiver application to the Department, seeking the removal of equal access and the unrestricted removal of the interexchange prohibition on their wireless businesses, the BOCs argued that ``competition in radio services is extremely robust,'' that ``competition is flourishing in mobile service markets,'' and that ``without a showing of market power, the bell companies are plainly entitled to the relief they seek.'' <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Memorandum of the Bell Companies in Support of their Motion for Removal of Mobile and other Wireless Services from the scope of the Interexchange Restriction and Equal Access Requirement of Section II of the Decree, pp. 6, 16 (Dec. 13, 1991). Contrary to that last claim, the burden is on the movant  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> to show a lack of market power. Rufo. 112 S.

BOC Mem. 45 (Dec. 13, 1991); BOC Reply Mem. 21&hyph;26 (Aug. 3, 1992); BellSouth Mem. 22&hyph;23; Southwestern Mem. 27. To support this logic, it must be shown that the cellular duopoly is competitive. The facts, however, are just the opposite. Cellular duopolists plainly have market power in cellular service, and the major premise of the BOCs' argument therefore fails. It follows inexorably that if the BOC has market power in cellular service, and can exclude competitors in long distance, it can exclude the benefits of competition that those competitors bring. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cellular Exchange Service Markets are Not Competitive Today. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These cellular systems have substantial market power.

Southwestern, which argues that ``wireless markets today are vigorously competitive'' (SWB Mem. 11), observed in 1991_the year it and the other BOCs filed for this waiver_that there was an ``absence of significant price competition'' in cellular, and that the market is ``highly attractive'' for that reason.

Southwestern assessed that threat of new entrants as ``medium,'' and the bargaining power of buyers as ``low''_recognizing that the ``threat of substitute products or services [is] low'' and that ``extensive time periods for regulatory determinations, license awards and infrastructure construction will occur prior to the emergence of effective competitors.''

This enables direct cellular competitors to improve margins *&blank;*&blank;*. In fact, the most significant element of this structure is the probability that profit margins for all competitors would tend to increase under prolonged restricted competition.

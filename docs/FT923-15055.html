			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Observer: Panic move The rump, unrecognised new Yugoslavia of Serbia and Montenegro is much smaller than the old Yugoslavia. But its new leaders still think big. First there is Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic's vision of a Greater Serbia. Next is Dobrica Cosic, 'elected' president of the new Yugoslavia last month. He drew the blueprint for a greater Serbia in the 1980s when Milosevic was rising to power. Now there is Milan Panic, 62, just chosen as the first prime minister. A US citizen as well as erstwhile cycling champion of the old Yugoslavia, Panic is not one to hold back his fantasies. Among other things, he has tried to promote an anti-Aids drug through his Californian company ICN Pharmaceuticals, and bought a chunk of Hoffmann-La Roche only to sell it again. When not harassing western companies, Panic works out of Belgrade, where ICN flogs pharmaceuticals to eastern Europe through the Galenika company. Guess who is one of Galenika's representatives? William Scanlon, former US ambassador to Belgrade. That may seem a somewhat uncomfortable position, especially now America's policy on the area has changed.</p>

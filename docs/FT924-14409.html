			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Labour attack on public spending cuts MR JOHN SMITH, Labour leader, yesterday accused the government of preparing to use the sterling crisis as an excuse for cuts in public spending. In a letter to Mr John Major, he renewed his demand for the prime minister to spell out the events leading up to sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. 'I understand your keenness to draw a line under these events, but these are questions which must be answered,' he said. 'We have a right to know the truth because Black Wednesday is clearly going to be used by you and your ministers as the scapegoat for the imminent abandonment of Tory election pledges on public expenditure - pledges which you were always intending to abandon. Indeed, the round of ministerial discussions on spending cuts began well before the sterling crisis.' Labour later demanded that the prime minister outline an immediate 'national recovery programme' in his speech to the Tory conference tomorrow. The challenge was issued at a news conference by Labour's economics team led by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor.</p>

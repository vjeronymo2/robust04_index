			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRANK FORMALLY REPRIMANDED FOR ETHICS LAPSE  </P> <P> After three hours of uncommonly rancorous debate, the House of Representatives  voted overwhelmingly Thursday to formally reprimand Rep. Barney Frank  (D-Mass.), one of two openly gay congressmen, for ethics violations stemming  from his relationship with a male prostitute.  </P> <P> The 408-18 vote to reprimand came after the House easily turned aside an  attempt by Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) to expel Frank, a liberal  who is widely regarded as one of the brightest members of Congress. The House  also rejected a motion to censure, which is one step above a reprimand.  </P> <P> "I think I had a decent chance to present my case," Dannemeyer said after his  motion to expel failed by a 38-390 vote. Although the tally was "less than I  had hoped for," the Orange County conservative said he did not have his eye on  vote totals when he moved against Frank. "I did it because it was the right  thing to do," he said.  </P> <P> Reps. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who  represents southern Orange County, joined Dannemeyer in voting to expel Frank.  Reps. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach),  who represents northeastern Orange County, voted against expulsion but for  censure.  </P> <P> In an emotional speech on the House floor, before the vote to reprimand, Frank  apologized to his colleagues. "These mistakes were mine. . . . All mine," he  said. "I should have known better. Now I do. But it's a little too late."  </P> <P> Frank, 50, attributed his ethical problems to a 34-year effort to keep secret  his homosexuality, an effort that he abandoned three years ago with a public  announcement that he is gay.  </P> <P> "Three years ago I decided that concealment did not work," Frank told members  who packed the House chamber. "I wish I had decided it earlier."  </P> <P> After the votes, Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House  ethics committee, told reporters, "I'm very pleased the (House) stayed with the  committee."  </P> <P> Of Frank, Dixon said, "I think he indicated he made a serious mistake, but he  wanted to let people know why he had done so, and that is because he is a gay  person."  </P> <P> The ethics committee, formally known as the House Committee on Standards of  Official Conduct, recommended a reprimand for Frank last Friday in a 57-page  report that capped a 10-month investigation of Frank's relationship with  admitted prostitute Stephen L. Gobie, whom Frank had placed on his personal  staff at his own expense.  </P> <P> A reprimand is the least serious of three punishments that the full House can  administer, followed by censure and expulsion. Reprimand and censure require  majority votes, while it takes two-thirds of the House to expel a member.  </P> <P> Only four representatives ever have been expelled, three of whom were rebel  sympathizers at the outset of the Civil War. The House has censured 22 members  and reprimanded six.  </P> <P> The ethics committee found that Frank acted improperly by fixing 33 parking  tickets, largely accumulated by Gobie while he drove Frank's car on personal  business. In addition, the committee found that Frank wrote a 1986 memorandum  on Gobie's behalf that contained "misleading statements" about Gobie and his  relationship with Frank. The memorandum ultimately wound up in the files of a  Virginia prosecutor.  </P> <P> Specifically, Frank wrote that he met Gobie through mutual friends, when in  fact, their relationship began in 1985 after Frank contacted Gobie through a  male escort service. And Frank said that Gobie was adhering to the terms of his  probation on drug and sodomy charges, when Frank knew that Gobie continued to  work as a prostitute.  </P> <P> But the committee rejected charges that Frank knew that Gobie was using his  Capitol Hill townhouse as a base for a prostitution ring.  </P> <P> That assertion was disputed by Dannemeyer, one of the most severe congressional  critics of homosexuality and homosexual activism.  </P> <P> "What's going on in America is a cultural war," Dannemeyer told his colleagues.  "Do we tolerate, do we condone a member of this body who knowingly permits a  house of prostitution to be operated out of his residence?"  </P> <P> Dornan was among the members who joined in the attack on Frank.  </P> <P> "My brother's a high school teacher. . . . This would have destroyed his  career, anything even remotely resembling it," Dornan told Frank. "My prior  careers: As an Air Force officer -- Out! Finished! As a broadcaster on  television, if I wouldn't resign, I'd be fired. . . . I am going to vote for  expulsion because you didn't have the honor and decency to resign."  </P> <P> Dannemeyer's assertion that the ethics committee had ignored evidence that  Frank knew Gobie was using his home for prostitution brought an emotional  response from Dixon.  </P> <P> "You have just heard the most edited, selected garbage that has ever been put  forth, in my opinion, in this House," Dixon said, his voice rising. Dannemeyer  "insults the intelligence and literacy of the members . . . who have read the  (committee's) report."  </P> <P> Dixon also complained that Dannemeyer, in a letter circulated Wednesday to  members of the House, had revealed the names of several "innocent witnesses"  involved in the Frank case, names that Dixon's committee had attempted to keep  secret.  </P> <P> "Mr. Dannemeyer, you have done a mean and evil thing," Dixon said.  </P> <P> At a press conference after the votes, Frank said he believed Dannemeyer's  attempt to expel him was due largely to the fact that he is a homosexual.  </P> <P> "There is something about homosexuality that sets Mr. Dannemeyer to vibrating,  I don't know what it is," Frank said. He added later, "I think that there is a  growing sentiment in the House of Representatives that Mr. Dannemeyer and  reality only rarely coincide."  </P> <P> After Dannemeyer's motion was defeated, the House turned down 141-287 a motion  by House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) that would have had the effect  of censuring Frank. Despite Gingrich's call for tougher sanctions, he termed  the proceedings "tragic" and said Frank "has been one of our brightest and most  energetic members."  </P> <P> Cox said he voted for censure rather than expulsion because "I think censure is  the appropriate sanction. The standard for expulsion over the last 200 years  has been conviction of a criminal offense."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher said only the voters in Frank's district have the right to turn him  out of office. "I believe it's up to us (in the House) to set standards for the  way our body operates, but it's not up to us to decide who will sit."  </P></p>

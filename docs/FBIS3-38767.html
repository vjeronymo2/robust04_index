			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview yesterday on Luxembourg Radio and  Television, Simone Veil (UDF) [Union for French Democracy],  minister of Social, Health, and Urban Affairs, said yesterday  she felt "shame" and "utter powerlessness" as far as the war in  Bosnia is concerned. She insisted that if it is decided to  intervene in Bosnia, it is necessary to "make sure -- using  threats if necessary -- that the Russians do not take action."  With regard to the appropriateness of a military intervention,  she noted that she was not a military expert, but that she  listened to what was being said and trusted the decisions of her  government. In this respect, she remarked that there is a real  risk of remaining stuck in this part of the world, which was,  she added, "the only region of Europe the Germans failed to  subdue" during World War II.    As for her wish to see Prime Minister Edouard Balladur  elected president of the republic, she indicated that all she  had been saying was that she believed Mr. Balladur would make a  good president, and not that he must run for office.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Exemption for Pump-out Units From 15-pound Limit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System-Dependent Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 82.156(c) prohibits the use of system-dependent equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with appliances normally containing more than 15 pounds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerant. This prohibition was intended to cover small,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portable system-dependent equipment, which is not designed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recovery of large quantities of refrigerant. As noted above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, some large chillers are equipped with built-in pump-out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units that could also be considered ``system-dependent equipment,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but that are designed to be used for the recovery of large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantities of refrigerant. EPA did not intend to prohibit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of such pump-out units for recovery. Thus, EPA is revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;82.156(c) to read ``System-dependent equipment shall not be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with appliances normally containing more than 15 pounds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerant, unless the system-dependent equipment is permanently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attached to the appliance as a pump-out unit.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Applicability Solely to Equipment Containing More Than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 Pounds of Refrigerant of Leak Repair and Associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recordkeeping Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 82.156(i), the leak repair requirement, contains two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subparagraphs that apply to owners of different types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. The first subparagraph, &sect;82.156(i)(1), applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``owners of commercial refrigeration and industrial process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration,'' specifying no lower size limit for covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. The second subparagraph, &sect;82.156(i)(2), applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``owners of appliances normally containing more than 50 pounds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerant and not covered by paragraph (i)(1).'' EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received numerous inquiries regarding whether or not it intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to include a lower size limit in the first subparagraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although EPA did not explicitly restrict the scope of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leak repair requirement for commercial and industrial process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration to equipment containing more than 50 pounds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerant, EPA intended this requirement to cover only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment containing at least 50 pounds. The definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial refrigeration includes a note that ``[a]ll of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment contains large refrigerant charges, typically over 75  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pounds,'' and the discussion of industrial process refrigeration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that appears in the preamble to the rule includes a note that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``charge sizes can be very large, ranging from 750&hyph;3000 lbs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ice rinks, and rising as high as 20,000 lbs for built-up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> centrifugal units.'' (No other charge sizes are mentioned.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preamble also notes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 50-pound cut-off is intended to exempt smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment where the cost of repairing the leak is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order of magnitude higher than the environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit of repairing the leak (RIA). The 50-pound cut-off is also consistent with guidance found in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASHRAE Guideline 3&hyph;1990 (58 FR 28680).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rationale applies to commercial and industrial process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration as well as to other large appliances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to clarify that only commercial and industrial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process refrigeration equipment containing more than 50 pounds is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by the leak repair requirements, EPA is now specifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this limit in &sect;82.156(i)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Equipment Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Measurement of Recovery Rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 82.158(b)(6) requires manufacturers of recycling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery equipment to have an approved equipment testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization measure the liquid and vapor recovery rates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment as part of the equipment certification process. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required measurement and publication of these recovery rates in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to ensure that technicians would not inadvertently purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment whose recovery rates were too low for the intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application; the Agency was concerned that a technician  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchasing underpowered equipment would be tempted to interrupt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the resulting lengthy recovery process before it was complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, some types of equipment do not have inherent liquid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and vapor recovery rates. For instance, the recovery rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system-dependent equipment depends upon the compressor of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual appliance from which it is recovering refrigerant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intended to exempt this equipment from the requirement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have its liquid and vapor recovery rate measured. First, system-dependent equipment certified pursuant to &sect;82.158(b) typically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has a higher recovery rate than self-contained equipment, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appliance compressors are usually larger and therefore faster  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than recovery equipment compressors. Second, the use of system-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependent equipment is limited to appliances normally containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than 15 pounds of refrigerant. Thus, low recovery rates are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not a concern for such equipment. EPA is therefore amending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 82.158(b)(6) of the rule to clarify that equipment with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no inherent liquid or vapor recovery rates need not have these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates measured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Technician Certification <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Additional revisions to &sect;82.161 have been proposed by EPA. (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  published 8&hyph;15&hyph;94) These proposed changes will more clearly delineate who is required to be certified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 82.161(a) requires that technicians be certified. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempted from this requirement technicians that are disposing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small appliances, room air conditioners, and MVACs because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technicians are only recovering the refrigerant prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal of this equipment. As discussed earlier, persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposing of this equipment were exempt from the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the nature of this work is straight-forward. As outlined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, EPA is extending this exemption to MVAC-like appliances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Throughout the rule, EPA states that since MVAC appliances and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MVAC-like appliances are similar in nature and design, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for these technicians to be treated in a similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fashion. In &sect;82.161(a)(5), EPA provides a method for those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicing MVAC-like appliances to be certified by attending a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program designed and approved under section 609 for training and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifying MVAC technicians. Therefore, to maintain consistency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as discussed in Section A of this rulemaking, EPA will extend the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption from the certification requirement to technicians that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are disposing of MVAC-like appliances. In addition, since ``room  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air conditioners'' are considered a type of small appliance, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small appliances are already excepted from the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, EPA will delete ``room air conditioners'' from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list of exceptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

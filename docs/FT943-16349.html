			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Arts: A desirable 'Manon' - Opera The first sign that something was wrong came when Manon cried out, 'I hear the voice of my cousin approaching'. The trouble was that she did not. A gaping silence ensued and in the following scene singers found themselves addressing an empty space where the missing baritone should have been. The unfortunate singer was Anthony Michaels-Moore, who had collapsed backstage, leaving the opera without one of its three principals. It is the regular practice of opera-houses to dismiss understudies on the morning of the performance if all looks well, but the Royal Opera might consider a new arrangement after this unhappy experience - the only blight on an otherwise fine revival of Massenet's Manon. Everything that was dear to Massenet can be found in Manon. The composer had a fondness for beautiful women and beautiful sopranos in particular, which finds its highest form of expression in his portrayal of the Abbe Prevost's siren of femininity, the shallow but dazzling Manon Lescaut. So intimate was his love for her that the opera seems like an amorous conversation secretly overheard. At one point the Royal Opera production captures that feeling to perfection. As Manon and Des Grieux are swept away with uncontrollable desire, entwined on the floor of the vestry at St. Sulpice, some of the clergy look on with barely-disguised delight. It is hard to see anybody resisting the charms of Leontina Vaduva's Manon. Sparkling, fragile, singing with sensitivity and unabashed sexual dynamism, she is near ideal for the role. These days, Vaduva could carry the opera by herself, but she is partnered by a more than worthy Des Grieux. Giuseppe Sabbatini's stage persona may be uncharismatic (a smile would help) but his singing makes up the lost ground. He has enough reedy tone for the big moments and turns on the poetry for the soft ones: a floated high A in his Dream solo melted into the air. Although Sabbatini's French leaves a lot to be desired, there were signs of schooling among the smaller roles. Robert Lloyd plays the Comte des Grieux with aristocratic paternal authority. Richard Van Allan made a distinguished De Bretigny and Philip Doghan a suitably fussy Guillot, while the three good-time girls of Rosemary Joshua, Yvonne Barclay and Leah-Marian Jones play their parts with zest. After so many spartan productions of late, the old-fashioned sets for this Manon, courtesy of Fragonard, look almost lavish. It is amusing, too, to see the crowd at the Cours-la-Reine buying lottery tickets (a crafty in-house plug for the Royal Opera's case for lottery money?) Nevertheless, the architect of this revival's success was not to be found on the stage. After a lifetime's championing of Berlioz, Colin Davis showed that this cultivated opera thrives on the same kind of precision and energy  -no sloppy rhythms allowed. It might seem a backhanded compliment to commend Davis as a master of Massenet style, but there are precious few conductors who are. On the first night this tender and passionate Manon was an (almost) complete performance. Further performances until July 21</p>

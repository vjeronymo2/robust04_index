			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / City security tighter after bomb find POLICE are likely to be more vigilant in checking people entering the City of London today following an attempted bombing in Bishopsgate on Saturday. Terrorists breached the security ring and planted what police called a 'small device' behind a hoarding in Wormwood Street. Police were alerted to the attempted bombing by a call from a man with an Irish accent who used a recognised code word. The bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion. There were no injuries. The latest attempt follows the setting up last month of checkpoints around the City, and the blocking of many entrances to it, in response to previous terrorist explosions. The alert will intensify a debate over the effectiveness of the measures which are considered too disruptive by some critics and as a propaganda coup for the IRA by others. Saturday's explosion came just 48 hours after a warning from Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, that the area was still at risk from hand-carried bombs. 'Clearly it would be rash to claim that we have 100 per cent security, but I do know that we have reduced drastically the risk of another large vehicle-borne bomb getting into the financial heart of the City,' Mr Kelly said. He added: 'Hand-carried bombs may in the future be planted in the zone and the less well-informed will claim that our arrangements have failed. 'Of course we have never claimed that we could ever detect or prevent any one of the hundreds of thousands of people who come into the City daily, most of whom carry bags or cases of some sort, from bringing in a bomb.'</p>

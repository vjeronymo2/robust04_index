			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 15 (CTK) -- Tomas Jezek is a brilliant  economist and honest man, President Vaclav Havel commented on  the speculations about Jezek's dismissal from his post of the  chairman of the National Property Fund (FNM) in connection with  his alleged mismanagement. Speaking today in his regular radio  programme "Talks in Lany", Havel said that it was not up to the  government, the political parties, let alone the president, to  decide whether Jezek should remain in his post. The decision is  in the powers of the FNM leadership, he added.    The bankruptcies of little banks can be a sort of appeal to  those who quickly, and perhaps too quickly, have entered the  world of the market economy, Havel said about the critical  situation of the Bohemia a AB Mlada Boleslav banks. He  expressed his conviction that the Czech bank sector was healthy  as a whole.    Havel said that all the work of previous four years to  improve the image of the Presidential Office and Prague Castle  collapsed within two days because all the media have reported  "how we steal here." This has created the situation when it will  be difficult to find new sponsors, he said. "However, the  articles are not based on real knowledge of the ruling by the  inspecting office," Havel stated.    He said he considered this "a certain disaster." Havel said  that the administrative mistakes (in the management of the  Presidential Office) had not robbed the taxpayers of a single  crown.    Asked whether journalists should be blamed for the  misinterpretation of the report on management, Havel replied  that the current situation has not been caused only by  journalists. "The very unfortunate way of presenting the ruling  without the relevant protocol," i.e. without an analysis or  commentary, must be taken into account, too, he added.</p>

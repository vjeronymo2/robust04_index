			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / EBRD calls for scrapping of the rouble currency zone THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday called on the former Soviet republics to abandon the rouble currency zone. Introducing the bank's first annual economic review, Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD president, said establishing separate national currencies or smaller currency zones could improve the prospects for production and trade among the republics. The bank, set up two years ago to help former communist states develop into democratic and market-oriented states,said the rouble zone was already crumbling. Ukraine and the Baltic states have left the zone, while Belarus and Azerbaijan have issued coupons for most domestic cash transactions. The review argued strongly that the remaining members should not try to keep the zone together. The EBRD said the rouble zone had been undermined by inadequate control of credit and cash creation which had brought its members to the brink of hyperinflation. The absence of co-operation between members of the zone had also generated 'enormous pressure to restrict exports and capital outflows, leading to near anarchy in trading arrangements.' By contrast, the introduction of separate national currencies could improve the prospects of production and trade. The EBRD suggested that some republics, once outside the zone, would opt for more prudent fiscal and monetary policies. The EBRD's call reflects deep concern at the bank about the deterioration of economic conditions in Russia and other republics. It estimates that real gross domestic product declined by about 20 per cent in Russia last year while inflation averaged 1,450 per cent. Elsewhere, output declined by between 14 per cent (in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) and 40 per cent (in Armenia), with inflation ranging between 700 per cent in Latvia and Uzbekistan and 1,600 per cent in the Ukraine. The bank forecast that output in the republics would decline further this year - although possibly at a slower rate - with the disintegration of old economic links continuing to harm performance. The bank is more upbeat about conditions in eastern and central Europe. Output in the region declined last year by about 5 per cent with inflation averaging 60 per cent. The EBRD said the countries of central Europe 'seem poised for moderate economic growth in 1993' and singled out Hungary and Poland as likely to experience increases in gross domestic product. Mr Attali said exports to the European Community from Hungary, Poland and the Czech republic and Slovakia were rising strongly. In the final quarter of last year, industrial production in Poland was 3 per cent higher than in the previous three months and up 1.7 per cent and 1 per cent in Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia. He called for more open trade policies and lower interest rates in western Europe to help eastern and central Europe overcome their economic problems.</p>

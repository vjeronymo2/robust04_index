			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov, </F> conducted by Yelena Dikun: "He Who Has Understood Life Does Not  Hurry to Moscow"]    [Text] According to the results of the rating polls,  Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov is regularly among the  hundred most influential politicians in Russia. This is the  second year that he has been included in the "who's who" of  promising young leaders who will determine world policy in the  next century. Does Mr. Nemtsov not feel cramped in his one  individual province? Is he not being pulled closer to the  Kremlin?    [Nemtsov] No, I say without any coyness: I want to be a  governor. I have started an undertaking, maybe with some  mistakes (I do not know if they are from youth or from  stupidity), but some things have begun to work out. And now it  would be madness to drop everything and move to Moscow. I do not  exclude the possibility that in the future, but not very soon, I  will be able to work in the government. However, I do not intend  to participate in the presidential elections--neither in the  upcoming ones, nor in the ones after that.    [Correspondent] The things that have "begun to work out" in  Nizhegorodskiy Oblast, are they very difficult to superimpose  onto an all-Russian scope?    [Nemtsov] The main all-Russian problem is the declining  economy. The orthodox methods--to stop giving credits to  everyone, to limit expenditures by any means, even if it is at  the price of impoverishing the people--are unacceptable to  Russia. It would be more correct to isolate specific promising  sectors and to implement a rather harsh structural policy.  Moreover, the criterion of promise should be determined not by  whether some bureaucrat likes a certain sphere, but by where  private capital is going, where the people are investing their  own money. Since this is associated with a great deal of risk  and is done very cautiously, then, as a rule, this is an almost  unerring choice. And the state has merely to support it from its  own side. In this regard it plays a secondary role. If, for  instance, today private capital is going for the development of  service and to trade, then the state must also direct its money  there. If private capital goes, for example, to construction,  and a construction boom is becoming clearly outlined now, then  state money should follow.    For example, the processing of agricultural production is  very profitable. Last year we supported entrepreneurs, including  also kolkhoz [collective farm] farmers who wanted to build  private mills and sausage-making shops, to organize the  production of cheese, yogurt, etc. There were 123 processing  plants built with "mixed" money. As a result, we were able to  kill three birds with one stone: We increased the profitability  of agriculture, saturated the market, and broke up the monopoly  of the processing sector.    Or here is another example. This year, conversion credit  will  be granted only to those enterprises which have found the funds  for investment in their own production, either in domestic or in  Western banks. In short, I look to see where the large banks are  "diving." I find out what investment programs they have and, if  there is a little money in the oblast treasury, I try to get it  into the promising projects.    The second thing that may be imitated from us is the method  of "tying up" the free public funds. The idea, which Yavlinskiy  and I worked out in Nizhniy Novgorod, consists of issuing loans  which are rather attractive to the citizens, and using the money  obtained from the public for capital investments. At one time,  loans uplifted the economy of Japan. On one hand, this is a  struggle with inflation, since the "hot" money goes out of  circulation, and on the other--it is an organization of  investments. Unfortunately, it is difficult to offer loans on a  federal level, since the population does not trust the  government. But at the local level, judging by what is happening  here in Nizhniy, this is still possible. The "Yavlinskiy loan,"  for example, was snapped up literally in a few months. Recently  we offered a telephone loan. The citizens receive a certificate  which guarantees them the installation of a telephone within  half a year. For every overdue day, the telephone network must  pay one percent. Therefore, naturally, we are interested in  building the telephone station as soon as possible. Today we are  trying to implement a housing loan.    [Correspondent] Your oblast is always being cited as an  example. You are constantly being visited by high-level guests  and government delegations. This is reminiscent of the model  kolkhoz or plant which formerly served the leadership as a  propaganda aid.    [Nemtsov] The only difference is that no one gives us money  for "leading experience." We do not have any privileges as  compared with others. In fact, everything depends on the  political will of the governor: If he wants to do something, he  does it. If he does not want to--he does not. As for the  attention of well-known people, that is not a bad thing at all.  First of all, we ourselves receive a certain stimulus. Secondly,  often our experience becomes the property of all Russia, and  sometimes even the CIS countries. And finally, such a situation  is advantageous to me as governor. It is much better than having  the image of a man who is constantly displeased with Moscow.    [Correspondent] You do not like to quarrel with the  leadership, or is there no need for this?    [Nemtsov] I simply try not to conduct myself in a  challenging  manner. The concern for the interests of the region force the  governor to be a pragmatist. If I am unhappy about something, if  I feel that personal relations are starting to get in the way of  the cause, I will express this in a personal conversation, and  not in a newspaper interview. As long as I live in Nizhniy  Novgorod and do not get involved in the Moscow shuffle, I will  have normal relations both with the Kremlin, and with the  government, and with parliament. But if I suddenly got the  desire to engage in politics in Moscow, I believe that a number  of conflicts with all the institutions of power would arise  immediately.    Yet for now, when I need the support of the president or the  prime minister, I get it. But I turn to them only in the most  extreme cases. For example, when the government wanted to stop  the privatization of cargo transport. At that time, we sold  trucks at open auctions and created a very strong sector in this  sphere, which resolved the problem of supplying the city with  milk, bread, petroleum products, etc. But the Ministry of  Transport offered very strong resistance. I had to go to  Yeltsin, and the problem was solved in about 15 seconds. While I  was there, Boris Nikolayevich called the transport authorities  and said: "If you impede the governor, you will deal with me."  Recently I had a conflict with the mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod. It  was necessary to remove him, since he was impossible to work  with.    [Correspondent] A strange story. After all, you and Mayor  Bednyakov were of the same mind, almost friends. What happened?    [Nemtsov] It is a very simple story. If a person brings to  referendum the question of city sovereignty, if his main goal is  to bring to the point of absurdity the idea of separating the  city from the oblast, then I believe that it is impossible to  work with such a mayor. Because this is a direct threat to the  entire system of power which is rather fragile, and which may  lead to anarchy. I cannot work under conditions of conflict. In  this, evidently, I differ from many Moscow leaders, who cannot  imagine themselves under any other conditions. I need if not  mutual understanding, then at least a tolerant attitude toward  one another. Otherwise, nothing will get accomplished. Let us  take land reform: If the leadership holds noisy discussions on  this topic, public clarification of attitudes, then the cautious  peasants will never in their life follow the reformers.    Unfortunately, it has worked out in these two-and-a-half  years that the mayor and I had no mutual understanding, and  especially no tolerance in our relations. Maybe I too am at  fault in this. We began in the era of romanticism. Everyone  greeted us: "Go ahead and work, you boys from Nizhniy Novgorod,  and we will support you." Then the paradise apples ended, and a  mass of problems arose: There is no money, the plants are  stopping work, there is growing public discontent, and the  prestige of authority is falling. When we go uphill, we must  help each other. But sometimes one thinks that he can get to the  top first, leaving all the others behind. And then the struggle  for personal precedence begins. Then I suggested to Boris  Nikolayevich that he remove Bednyakov from his duties. He had  appointed him, and he removed him. Bednyakov is a civil servant,  just like me. The only thing that distinguishes me from a civil  servant is that I have been popularly elected, receiving 70  percent of the votes.    [Correspondent] Do you have any opposition in Nizhniy  Novgorod, and does it hinder you in your work?    [Nemtsov] There is, and it is rather powerful: The  communists  from "Trudovaya Rossiya," the national-patriots and the  radicals. However, they lost in the local elections. I cannot  say that the opposition hinders the reforms. However, it keeps  us from napping, all the time trying to find mistakes and  pointing them out most persistently. In that sense, the  existence of the "street" opposition is even beneficial--it  forces us to keep our form.</p>

The United Nations Organization should be persuaded to  recognize the fact of Latvia's occupation by Russia in 1940.  The adoption of the country's foreign political concept is  another urgent task, the committee said.    Latvia also created problems to Estonia when it promised  Russia to guarantee the rights of retired Russian servicemen.  Estonia has already adopted a law on aliens which does not  forsee an option of social guarantees for Russian military  persons, said committee head Alexander Kirsteins. The committee  decided to send a member of the Latvian team for talks with  Russia to Estonia in a bid to coordinate stances.    Commenting on the appeal to the parliaments of U.N. member  states, committee member Indulis Berzins said that a Russian  diplomat said officially that Russia was unlikely to recognize  Latvia's occupation in 1940.    The committee concluded that its members should meet with  the  head of the Russian parliament Foreign Committee, Genadi Lukin,  to discuss Russia's attitude toward Latvia's occupation.</p>

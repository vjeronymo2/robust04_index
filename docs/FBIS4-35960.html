			<p>BFN     [Text] Salah-al-Din, Iraq, June 4 (AFP) -- More than 600  people are believed to have died in ongoing clashes between  rival Kurdish groups at Halabjah in northeastern Iraq, a member  of the opposition Iraqi National Congress said Saturday.    The source who asked not to be named said the clashes had  left "probably more than 600 dead," most of them members of the  Kurdistan Patriotic Union (KPU) [PUK] of Jalal Talabani.    The KPU said however that it had suffered few casualties.    Clashes erupted at the beginning of May in various parts of  Kurdistan mainly between the KPU and its biggest rival the  Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Mas'ud al-Barzani. After a  rash of ceasefires, hostilities died down at the end of May  except in Halabjah and Qal'at Dizah near the border with Iran  where the KPU is fighting a pro-Iranian group, the Kurdistan  Islamic League (KIL).    The KIL led by Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Uthman has allied  itself  with the KDP.    According to sources from all sides, the KPU has lost  control  of Halabjah after taking the village at the beginning of May.    A delegation including members of the INC and leaders of the  warring factions is due to visit Halabjah to try to arrange a  new ceasefire.    The Iranian news agency IRNA said Tuesday that since May  about 4,000 people had been killed and hundreds injured in the  fighting between Kurds.    The KDP and the KPU accused each other of executing  prisoners  taken during the fighting. The KDP gave the INC a list of 51  names, saying they had been captured by the KPU and killed, INC  sources said.    Amnesty International said in a recent report that the KPU  had submitted 49 names of prisoners it said the KDP had executed.</p>

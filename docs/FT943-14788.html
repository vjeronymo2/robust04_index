			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Outcry as regulator moves to company Members of the group of investors complaining about Knight Williams, the independent financial adviser, have written to the Treasury and to City regulatory bodies expressing concern that a senior regulator has joined the company, Alison Smith writes. Knight Williams has recently appointed Mr Colin Pinnell to oversee its legal and compliance department. Mr Pinnell was formerly head of legal services at Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has already discussed with Fimbra a number of complaints against Knight Williams. Disgruntled investors are seeking assurances that the government and regulators are satisfied there is no 'leak' of information from Fimbra to Knight Williams about cases raised by complainants. Past complaints have centred on the company's high charges and on investment performance. Mr John Williams, Knight Williams managing director, said yesterday that while he had previously dealt with compliance matters he was increasingly spending his time on other issues, and so Mr Pinnell had been appointed. Both parties had agreed that there must be 'utter confidentiality' about matters with which Mr Pinnell had been involved during his time at Fimbra, he said.</p>

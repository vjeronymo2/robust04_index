			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Foreign investment in UK not all positive Sir, Andrew Baxter presents an accurate account of the recent annual report of the Invest in Britain Bureau ('Foreign groups create record total of jobs', July 22). Unfortunately, the IBB report itself presents a totally misleading picture of the employment effects of inward direct investment in the UK. The employment data quoted in the report cover jobs promised by inward investors rather than jobs actually created and take no account of the jobs lost as a consequence of foreign investments from the UK. Furthermore, to argue that 30,000 jobs were saved as a consequence of BMW's acquisition of Rover is surely difficult to substantiate as it assumes that all of these jobs would have been lost if the acquisition had not taken place and that there will be no job losses post-acquisition. I would agree with industry secretary, Michael Heseltine, that 'thousands of people are at work today because of our success at attracting inward investment'. However, I would also point out that thousands of people are out of work today because of foreign divestments from the UK, and numerous examples could be quoted. I would also point out that the job security of thousands of people is being threatened as a consequence of the recent wave of foreign acquisitions in the UK. Since 1985, there has been a total of 1,278 foreign acquisitions in the UK, valued at Pounds 31bn. Many of the UK's largest industrial and commercial enterprises have passed into foreign ownership as a consequence of being externally acquired - Rover, Midland Bank, Beecham, Rowntree, Jaguar, Pearl Group, Yorkshire Bank etc. Preliminary results of research being conducted by SIBU suggest that the employment effects of inward investment in the form of acquisitions may be negative. The British government is unique in viewing such foreign takeovers as a sign of confidence in British competitiveness and, given the scale of acquisition activity, there is an urgent need for detailed study of the long-term effects on the British economy of external takeovers.

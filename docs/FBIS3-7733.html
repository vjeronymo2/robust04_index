			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the  republic of Kosova, gave a news conference in Prishtina today.  Let us go to a report by Leke Musolli:    [Musolli] In today's news conference Ibrahim Rugova,  president of the republic of Kosova, first welcomed the attitude  of U.S. President Bill Clinton for not leaving the question of  Kosova out of the ultimatum addressed to Serbs. With this, it  is seen that Kosova and the Albanian question will take their  rightful place in the final solution to the crisis in former  Yugoslavia.    Rugova then briefed reporters on the present reality in  Kosova, characterized as it is by Serbian police violence and  terror. Recently, the Serbian courts convicted dozens of  Albanians to more than 100 years of imprisonment on trumped-up  charges. President Rugova said that this violence by the  Serbian police aims to imprison Albanians and compromise their  peaceful policy for resolving the question of Kosova.    Rugova illustrated the intensity of the police violence with  the closure of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the republic  of Kosova. However, in spite of this, the Academy of Sciences  and Arts of the Republic of Kosova will continue to exist and  will continue to work and cooperate with all the foreign  academies, as it has been doing for many years. This shameful  act and the recent police repression have increased the tension  in Kosova. That is why president Rugova invited the public and  international diplomats to take steps to prevent any possible  conflict in Kosova.    Speaking about the recent initiatives on solutions to the  problems in former Yugoslavia, Dr. Rugova concentrated on that  of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Rugova said that we would  not like this to replace the initiative for a global solution of  the problems in former Yugoslavia and that we do not want  another Yalta in the Balkans. Mr. Rugova said that we would not  like the role of the Russian factor in this region to be  one-sided. President Rugova said that the Balkans should not be  considered as a region of spheres of interest. On the contrary,  it should be seen as a sphere of integrating processes.    At today's news conference, President Rugova welcomed the  visit of Albanian President Dr. Sali Berisha to Brussels and  added that signing the Partnership for Peace agreement will be  important not only for Albanians but for the whole region. He  also greeted the report by the special envoy of the UN secretary  general, Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, which objectively described the  violation of human rights and freedoms in Kosova.    At the news conference, Mr. Rugova answered many reporters'  questions.</p>

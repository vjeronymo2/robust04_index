			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Walker squares up to theft charges Mr George Walker, the former chairman of the Brent Walker Group accused of fraudulently inflating his company's profits, yesterday stepped into the witness box at the Old Bailey to give evidence in his defence. In two hours of questioning by his barrister, Mr Walker outlined his rise from boxer to head of the property and leisure group. He said he was the ideas man and deal-maker but trusted others to carry out the detailed work of building up the company. Mr Walker and his former finance director, Mr Wilfred Aquilina, are accused of fraudulently inflating the profits of the Brent Walker group by Pounds 19.3m between 1984 and 1987. The prosecution alleges this was achieved through bogus film deals which enabled the company effectively to fund its own profits. The markets were therefore given a much healthier picture of the company's fortunes than was actually the case, it is alleged. Mr Walker denies four charges of theft totalling Pounds 17m, two charges of false accounting and one of conspiracy to falsify the Brent Walker accounts to overstate profits. Mr Aquilina faces one charge of the theft of Pounds 4.5m, three of false accounting and one of conspiring to falsify accounts. Questioned by Mr Colin Nicholls QC, Mr Walker explained how, from helping run his wife's family garage in the late 1950s, he built up his business empire. Milestones in the development of the company included the 'Billy's Baked Potato' fast-food chain in the 1960s, the development of the Brent Cross shopping centre in the 1970s and the creation of the Brighton marina in the 1980s. The expansion into film production with films such as The Stud and The Bitch took place in the early 1980s, he told the court. Asked if he was ever concerned with the accounting of the film division, Mr Walker said his mental arithmetic might have been 'better than most', but he lacked the necessary basic accountancy skills. 'I would not have the ability to do it,' he said. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, Yuriy Serhyeyev, head of the [Foreign  Ministry] Information Directorate, reported at a Defense  Ministry briefing that the Foreign Affairs Ministry is once  again asserting that Ukraine does not need the mediation of a  CIS representative to represent its interests at the United  Nations. Ukraine's positions, which Volodymyr Handohiy  [Ukraine's acting permanent representative at the United  Nations] related at a plenary session of the UN General Assembly  -- that a CIS representative can only represent the interests of  those states that have signed the CIS Charter -- remain  unchanged. As Ukraine has not done this, and also does not  consider the CIS to be a subject of international law, but only  a regional organization, Ukrainian diplomacy is in favor of  direct and not mediated relations with the United Nations.</p>

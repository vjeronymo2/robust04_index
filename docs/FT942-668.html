			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest burden helps Lister cut loss Lister, a textile maker with interests in engineering and insurance broking, sharply reduced pre-tax losses in the year to March 26, from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 851,000. The improvement was helped by an absence of restructuring costs, compared with a charge of Pounds 1.16m, and a reduction in interest charges to Pounds 491,000 (Pounds 694,000). Losses per share were 5.55p (17.69p); there is an unchanged dividend of 0.1p. The group, which has been in the red for five successive years, said improved efficiency and product repositioning helped it reduce operating losses to Pounds 430,000 (Pounds 1.16m). Textiles incurred a loss of Pounds 285,000 (Pounds 926,000), engineering suffered from weak demand and lost Pounds 168,000 (Pounds 242,000), while insurance broking reported profits of Pounds 23,000 (Pounds 5,000).</p>

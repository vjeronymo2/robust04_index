			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Technology: Gemini's exchange rate hope The future of the Gemini Project, an international astronomy collaboration, could depend on foreign exchange rates. Gemini aims to be the first of a new generation of large, eight-metre diameter mirror telescopes needed to take infra-red astronomy into the next millennium. Two telescopes are required to scan the entire sky and the proposed sites are at Mauna Kea on Hawaii and Cerro Tololo in Chile. Both telescopes should be operational by 2000. Half of the Dollars 176m (Pounds 89m) in funding for Gemini has been contributed by the US, 25 per cent by Britain and 15 per cent by Canada, leaving 10 per cent to be found. Chile has sent a letter of intent offering another 5 per cent, but the remainder still needs to be raised. While several countries have expressed interest none has so far committed. In view of previous successful joint ventures, a formal invitation has been issued to Australia which is still deliberating over whether to accept. Even if no new parties come forward, the project could be rescued by the weak dollar - a suggestion proposed by Lawrence Randall, Gemini's project manager. As the project is budgeted in US dollars, Canada and Britain between them would have sufficient funds to buy the remaining share simply by taking advantage of the relative strength of their currencies. However, Geoffrey Moore, head of public relations at Britain's Science and Engineering Research Council, said: 'We are confident that another country will take up the shortfall. If we did take advantage of the exchange rates we would have to bear the cost if future rates became unfavourable and we cannot take that risk.' The new telescopes will have four times more light-collecting capacity than their predecessors so that known objects can be surveyed in a quarter of the time and new, fainter objects become visible. The viewing range has been considerably increased, extending from ultraviolet through visible to infra-red light at wavelengths well beyond those used previously. Also, the mirror arrangement within the Gemini telescopes allows larger measuring instruments to be installed.</p>

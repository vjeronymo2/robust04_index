			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Profligacy postponed Mr Kenneth Clarke's second Budget can easily be criticised as dull. But, as far as financial markets are concerned, that may be no bad thing. The fall in public spending projections - in line with lower inflation - and consequent drop in the public sector borrowing requirement were widely expected. The Budget was essentially neutral. This will not cause celebration, but there should at least be some comfort that the chancellor has not done anything foolish. One hope is that the Budget will play well abroad. Foreign investors may focus on the fact that the UK's public finances are in relatively good shape compared with those of many of its peers. That could lead to some further narrowing in the yield gap between gilts and US Treasury bonds. Nevertheless, with the yields on Treasuries again rising above 8 per cent yesterday, gilts will be hard-pushed to make headway in the short run. The stock market should be mildly pleased that there were no measures to control dividend payments by reducing the tax credit received by tax-exempt investors. Nor was there any attempt to crack down on the potential tax breaks associated with share buy-backs. So regional electricity companies and other under-geared groups may still be able to hand back cash to their shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. The big worry remains that this year's fiscal prudence will be followed by profligacy next year. If economic growth is stronger than the 3.25 per cent forecast for 1995, the PSBR will drop more rapidly. Mr Clarke would then have a ready-made excuse to bribe voters with pre-election tax cuts. Nothing he said yesterday has reduced the likelihood of this course of action.</p>

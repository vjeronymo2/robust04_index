			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA estimates that 217 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD, that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts will be provided at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $47,740, or $220 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER LINE IS UNVEILED BY MOTOROLA  </P> <P> Motorola Inc. on Monday introduced a line of office computers aimed at helping  the high-technology company become a major contender in a market in which it  has received little recognition.  </P> <P> The new computers are designed to be operated in a network with machines made  by other companies, such as IBM and Apple. They are based on the Unix operating  system, which is becoming the industry standard.  </P> <P> Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., has made computers for years, but they  primarily have been sold to the federal government or to other computer  companies that resell them under their own names.  </P> <P> Edward Staiano, president of Motorola's general systems sector, which includes  cellular phones and computers, said the company intends to become one of the  major players in the computer business over the next five years. He says it  will build on its expertise in computer-chip technology and high-quality,  low-cost manufacturing.  </P> <P> "For the first time, we've come out with a set of products that are right on  the leading edge," said Wayne Sennett, general manager of Motorola's computer  systems division.  </P> <P> However, some analysts expressed skepticism at Motorola's goals.  </P> <P> "Motorola is doing so many great things in other parts of the company, you hate  to be negative about their computer effort, but I don't think it has too much  prospect for success," said analyst Richard L. Whittington of Kidder, Peabody  &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The new computers are "file servers," an increasingly popular form of desktop  or side-of-desk machine that serves as the central data repository for a  network of desktop terminals.  </P> <P> Motorola said the computers undercut the price of a similar line of IBM  machines by 35% or more while offering comparable or better performance. The  IBM computers, which were introduced with great fanfare last month, were  praised by experts for their low price relative to performance.  </P> <P> Motorola's machines, called the MultiPersonal Computer line, range in price  from $23,985 for the MPC100 to $59,985 for the top-end MPC300. Each comes with  three desktop screens and a side-of-desk processing unit.  </P></p>

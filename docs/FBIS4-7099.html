			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Leave Administrative Reform to the </F> Bureaucrats"]    [Text] Even as the leader of the coalition government is  changed from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata, the need to implement political, as well as  administrative reform -- which the people expected the coalition  administration to accomplish at the time of its inauguration --  remains unchanged. We hope that under the new administration,  the political authorities will not be influenced by bureaucrats,  and will take the initiative in promoting administrative reform.    After the bursting of the bubble, Japan's economy is facing  structural problems amid a prolonged recession. The yen  continues to appreciate due to Japan's huge trade surplus; Japan  is losing its industrial competitiveness with the rapid  industrialization of other Asian countries; and the phenomenon  of "hollowing out"--with factories being moved overseas--is now  taking place.    Furthermore, due to the overwhelming export surplus, no  solution is forthcoming in Japan's economic friction with  Western countries. Under the circumstances, reducing the trade  surplus to rectify the trend of excessive yen appreciation  through the expansion of domestic demand and market  liberalization has become an urgent task.    In this connection, it is important to abolish in principle  various regulations obstructing participation of new businesses  in the market and those restricting the daily operations of the  business sector, and to give full play to the spirit of  entrepreneurship. Under the Hosokawa administration, the  Economic Reform Study Council, in its interim report of November  1993, already came up with the concept that the economy "should  be free in principle, and regulated only in exceptional cases."    Therefore, the new cabinet should work for the  implementation  of this principle. It should set a deadline, perhaps three to  five years from now, for the complete abolition of economic  regulations. If the bureaucrats want some exceptions, they  should explain the reasons to the people, and exceptions should  only be allowed in cases agreed upon by the people.    A total of 94 deregulation measures were included in the  emergency economic package announced in September 1993. They  represented a negligible number of deregulation measures which  were acceptable to the bureaucrats. We do not want a repetition  of such phony deregulation.    In administrative reform, a drastic reduction and  rationalization of administrative organs, including public  corporations, and laying off unnecessary personnel are as  important as deregulation. If sectarian administration is  rectified, outdated regulations are abolished, and economic  regulations are eliminated in principle, a small government will  certainly be quite enough.    The private sector is struggling amid the storm of  restructuring, resorting to such measures as prompting voluntary  retirement, or reducing new recruitments. It will likewise be a  matter of course for the government to undergo restructuring,  since its revenue income is diminishing. By merely reducing the  number of new recruits by half from now on will result in the  elimination of unnecessary tasks and organizational  rationalization in the long run. There will also be less  "amakudari" [the practice of retired senior bureaucrats taking  up lucrative positions in semi-government or private  organizations].    By implementing such reforms, fiscal spending will surely be  reduced substantially. The Finance Ministry has no scruples  about asking for a tax increase to rehabilitate government  finances even without doing anything about expenditures. Such a  way of thinking is putting the cart before the horse.    The problem is, administrative reform may end up  half-finished under a bureaucrat-led political regime, as in the  case of the Hosokawa administration. The bureaucrats cannot be  expected to collaborate in instituting reforms that will  undermine their own interests.    For Japan's long-term interest, administrative reform has to  be implemented even at the cost of eliminating the bureaucrats'  resistance. We hope the new administration will make this  difficult choice.</p>

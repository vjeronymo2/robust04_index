			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy by Krzysztof </F> Skowronski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of  Radio Zet" program--live]    [Text] [Skowronski] Radio Zet's guest today is Sejm  Speaker Mr. Jozef Oleksy. Good morning to you, Sir.    [Oleksy] Good morning.    [Skowronski] Are you in favor of amendments to the Small  Constitution that would limit the president's powers?    [Oleksy] No, I think that right now, there is no situation  where one would have to think about this as something very  urgent. Work on a new constitution is going on, and I am of the  view that the longer it takes to complete work on the new  Constitution, the more often we can have situations--in these  times, full of tension--where one can be tempted to make  corrections to the Small Constitution now in force. The problem  is that the Small Constitution's provisions are somewhat unclear  on certain points that require interpretation, or that, for  democracy's sake, require extensive interpretation. We have had  such motions coming from the president regarding the  Constitutional Tribunal and the ultimate nature of its powers.  That is a very major amendment to the Constitution and also a  change in the legal system and in the courts' verdicts and the  judicial system. There have also been such cases pertaining to  other issues, and, as we know, today a motion by Sejm deputies  was submitted to have Article 68 changed precisely so as to  define with greater precision situations in which there are  deadlocks such as we are having now. The coalition wants to  change something in the Council of Ministers, and the president  is of a different view, and there is no further [words  indistinct].    [Skowronski] Will Article 68 be changed?    [Oleksy] I beg your pardon?    [Skowronski] Will Article 68 be changed?    [Oleksy] I do not know because it is just a proposal. It  will be debated like any other proposal. I do not think there  is a chance for that at the next session, but, when it comes to  May... [Oleksy pauses] As usual, we think constitutional issues  are a priority and the issue will be debated. Constitutional  procedures require a big majority--two-thirds--so, knowing the  president's position...[Oleksy pauses] One must assume that he  will refuse to sign the amendment. We will perhaps be able to  take a stand on the president's veto. It is quite a lengthy  procedure and it does not happen immediately. The excitement  that was created surrounding this issue, which I encountered on  my return from Japan, is out of proportion compared to the  initiative's essence and nature.    [Skowronski] Where were you when the news broke that the  president said that, if parliament attempts to limit his powers,  he would try and dissolve it?    [Oleksy] That was a shocking piece of news; we were on our  way home from Japan. I must say I began thinking deeply about  the president's statement because it is dangerous for the  essence of democracy in Poland.    [Skowronski] And instrumental attempts to amend the  Constitution are not dangerous to democracy in Poland?    [Oleksy] If that is the way you interpret it....    [Skowronski, interrupting] How else could one interpret it?    [Oleksy] If one interprets it as some kind of revenge by the  coalition or its attempt to fight the president or to limit his  powers, there is indeed a source of emotion. But this is not  how I perceive this. As I said, I perceive it to be an attempt  to make constitutional provisions more specific so as to prevent  deadlocks and dead-end situations when the coalition and the  president may differ on personnel changes. But if one  interprets this the way the propaganda currently has been  portraying it for two or three days--namely, that it is a field  for a coalition-presidential battle--it is really no surprise  that there are all these emotions around.    [Skowronski] But, in the end, it really is the field of a  battle between the coalition and the president.    [Oleksy] I think not. I think it is just an attempt to  overcome the deadlock in a situation of a very tough position  vis-a-vis [words indistinct] an important post in the government.    [Skowronski] Why is the coalition not capable of giving up  on Dariusz Rosati?    [Oleksy] I am not sure whether it is not capable of doing  that. From what I hear, it is a question of talks with the  president, and I do not think there is anyone in the coalition  who thinks along the lines of forcing the president to change  his position. The president has a constitutional right not to  sign a proposed nomination. So I do not make the assumption  that this is some attempt to force the president to sign a  nomination, but it could be an attempt to force him to initiate  talks. In that regard, all I can do is make an appeal that  these talks take place. Otherwise, all this will begin getting  ridiculous in Poland.    [Skowronski] You often meet with Lech Walesa. Why can you  not lead up to a coalition-president meeting? Is that so hard?  From where does the main resistance come?    [Oleksy] I have not taken this kind of responsibility upon  myself, even though I have conducted such talks with the  president. Moreover, I cannot see resistance to talks on the  part of the president.    [Skowronski] So who resists then?    [Oleksy] There is resistance with regard to just one  situation. The president has talked to me about it, too, so he  is persistent in that regard--namely, that he refuses to talk  about the specific candidacy. The coalition knows that. But,  for its part, the coalition wants the talks to be of a wider  scope--that is, going beyond just this one issue. As far as I  know, the coalition fears that the president wants to discuss  just the finance minister nomination and nothing else. But, in  my mind, and in all the efforts I have been making since I  became Sejm speaker, the point is to have talks as an obvious  mechanism of cooperation among the state's supreme agencies. If  the talks were to be just about filling one post, not a lot  would be accomplished through them. So the point is whether  these talks, which I consider absolutely necessary and that they  should take place as soon as possible--if these talks are to  make sense, they have to be in the form of some permanent  practice of talking to each other, face-to-face, without  television cameras. I mean talks among the state's supreme  agencies and organs. Otherwise, we just have an isolated case  and that is it.    [Skowronski] What do people in Japan say about Polish  issues?    [Oleksy] There is a lot of interest in Polish issues in  Japan. We were even quite amazed to see that is the case. The  visit was very tiresome because of the climate and also because  of certain rigid ways of thinking that continue to....    [Skowronski, interrupting] When you say climate, do you mean  the weather?    [Oleksy] Exactly.    [Skowronski] What was the weather like in Tokyo?    [Oleksy] It was terribly exhausting.    [Skowronski] Was it worse than today's Warsaw weather?    [Oleksy] It was better, from a temperature standpoint. But,  as a parliamentary delegation, we were very much determined to  make permanent Poland's presence, the knowledge of Poland, and  the awareness of a need for good Polish-Japanese relations.  This also applies to Japan's presence in Central Europe,  including Poland. I mean its presence in terms of capital,  investments, and the economy. At all levels, perhaps with the  exception of my conversation with the Japanese emperor, both  during the talk with outgoing Prime Minister Hosokawa and with  the finance minister, the trade and industry minister, with the  leadership of a fund for regional and international assistance  that has the sum of $70 billion at its disposal, and also with  the leadership of (EximBank), Japan's largest bank fostering  foreign cooperation, we raised the issue of unblocking financial  and credit relations with Japan, which, to our surprise, are  accompanied by very rigid reservations by Japan, some of which  are philosophical [words indistinct].    [Skowronski] What is the essence of this Japanese  philosophy?    [Oleksy] It goes back to the time of the reduction of our  debts in the Paris Club. Japan thinks that, at the time, it was  forced by a debtor to give up its claims. Apparently, under  Japanese philosophy, once somebody fails to return a loan, he  can never again expect to be offered beneficial terms of  cooperation. We were told that bluntly. We tried to overcome  that because it is a very important issue: Japanese,  government-guaranteed credits are an absolute precondition for  Japanese companies to enter the Polish market. It seems that  their responses varied a great deal. In some cases, the  responses were tough, but, in others, there was a lot of  readiness to change the state of affairs. Two important  meetings will take place in Warsaw in May: There will be a  meeting by a Poland-Japan working group for new economic  initiatives between the two countries, and a meeting of  East-West foreign trade ministers, the so-called ministerial  initiative....    [Skowronski, interrupting] So you mean you were partially  successful in changing Poland's image....    [Oleksy, interrupting] I think we were definitely successful  in creating the right atmosphere and in convincing some  interlocutors...[Oleksy pauses] We talked with party chiefs,  chiefs of parliamentary factions, the leadership of the House of  Representatives--the upper chamber--and also with former  Japanese prime ministers and former foreign ministers.    [Skowronski] What was the meeting with the emperor like?    [Oleksy] It was very exotic to me because it was my first  conversation with him.    [Skowronski] What kind of protocol was there?    [Oleksy] It was very complicated. We were taught various  gestures and moves, but that is a usual thing. Let me remind  you that, at the end of Emperor Hirohito's term, the emperor of  Japan was regarded as a god. So that has an impact on protocol,  but I managed to deal with it. The conversation was very nice.  The emperor turned out to love Chopin's music, he has read the  novel Quo Vadis, he is sponsoring subsequent editions  of works by [Polish author] Sienkiewicz in Japan, and he was  very interested in a Polish-Japanese cultural center in Krakow,  which will open in November under Andrzej Wajda's auspices, with  a substantial Japanese contribution. We talked about cultural  exchanges, about relations with Russia, relations in Central  Europe. The scope of the emperor's interests was wider than I  would be willing to admit before my visit there.    [Skowronski] So you met with the emperor, and, recently, you  also met with Boris Yeltsin. What happened during the other  meeting, I mean the one with Boris Yeltsin? This is also  something we have not discussed at the Radio Zet studio yet.    [Oleksy] Well, this was a face-to-face conversation, so it  also included issues I cannot publicize. I conveyed the  conversation's results and what happened during it to President  Walesa.    [Skowronski] So you cannot share it with our listeners?    [Oleksy, hesitating] Not everything. I can say that Boris  Yeltsin [hesitating] does not see everything the same way we do,  when it comes to Central Europe--and this is not about  Partnership for Peace, on which Russian politicians presented  their country's position to us in wide-ranging terms. Whereas,  we kept saying our thing--in terms of Poland's persistent  striving....    [Skowronski, interrupting] And what are the most important  differences of views?    [Oleksy] But Boris Yeltsin looks at Poland as a country that  [hesitating], while severing its ties to the region in a  definite manner, wants to be a member of an arrangement in which  Boris Yeltsin does not believe. He called it an arrangement of  old structures established for West Europe's security and  convenience. There is a difference between us on that. By the  way, there were many themes full of disappointment with the  West, which also prove that Russia feels alone and surrounded.  This is the blunt way it was put. But, as I said, these were  incidental themes, kind of in the background of conversation.    [Skowronski] Russia's position of being alone is one fact,  and is Boris Yeltsin also alone in the Kremlin, as a politician?    [Oleksy] I must say, I heard a lot before the meeting about  the state of his health and about the weak shape he is in. I  must say I had in front of me a man of absolutely superb  health--of both psychological and physical strength--and also  with an enormous determination to remain in power. Stories told  by diplomats and politicians about what bad shape Yeltsin is in  proved untrue.    [Skowronski] What [hesitating] will happen in the Sejm this  week?    [Oleksy] This week, the Sejm's proceedings will be very  intensive. The agenda has already been adopted by the Sejm  Presidium. That happened before my trip. Two issues will be  debated. As I said, I do not think that the Sejm deputies'  constitutional initiative will be placed on the agenda, but that  has to be decided at Wednesday's [20 April] session of the Sejm  leadership. There is the issue of the popiwek, or neopopiwek  [wage-control legislation], which was submitted also in the form  of a Sejm deputies' initiative, and it does not come from the  government. So that defines the initiative's essence from the  standpoint of time requirements....    [Skowronski, interrupting] It will take longer?    [Oleksy] Yes, it will, and consequently....    [Skowronski, interrupting] But do we need the popiwek at  all?    [Oleksy] There are different [words indistinct] on that.  Myself, I do not express my view because I prefer to base what I  say on the opinions of professional experts, who deal with  calculations and forecasts, rather than on the easy-sounding  views of politicians. This is what I want to base it on. But  first of all, there is no government initiative; instead, there  is one coming from Sejm deputies. This changes the proceedings  and intensity of the measures. It is happening on a very  immediate basis. There is also a whole range of issues on the  agenda. The session will last two days, and I doubt that [words  indistinct].    [Skowronski] Will you try to alleviate the conflict between  the coalition and the president?    [Oleksy] That depends on the will of both parties. I am  ready, and this is the way I see my role in the state, but, if  the parties do not want that, I have no intention of imposing  myself on them.    [Skowronski] Who will it be harder to convince, Aleksander  Kwasniewski or Lech Walesa?    [Oleksy] One does not have to convince Aleksander  Kwasniewski to do anything because he is a politician with a big  picture of the totality of the political situation....    [Skowronski, interrupting] What about Lech Walesa?    [Oleksy, hesitating] I think he probably also does that,  but, in his case, he is more stubborn sometimes than....    [Skowronski] And what about Aleksander Kwasniewski?    [Oleksy] I think he is less stubborn and more flexible.    [Skowronski, laughing] So you are kind of a party to the  conflict because you think Aleksander Kwasniewski's stubbornness  is smaller?    [Oleksy] It is not smaller. It is just that it is easier to  make him flexible, but this is just for the purposes of a radio  interview, and, currently, I play no role in the conflict.    [Skowronski] Thank you very much for the conversation.    Radio Zet's guest today has been Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy.</p>

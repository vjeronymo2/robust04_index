			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Guido Rodriguez Alcala entitled: "Sovereignty of </F> the Corrupt"]    [Text] To allow U.S. troops to enter the country, the  government demands to know how many, what weapons they will  bring, where they will be, how they will work, etc. This  information is needed, according to the government, to defend  national sovereignty.    Instead of saying the government, I should say the executive  branch which sets the conditions although, according to the  Constitution, Congress makes the decision.    But let us not be pedantic. The division of power here goes  along with the confusion of power. What I mean is this: The  government defends national sovereignty by taking a hard stand  against the North Americans.    It seems fine to defend national sovereignty, but it should  not be defended just once a year and only from the North  Americans. It should be defended throughout the year, no matter  who complains.    Not just U.S. soldiers should be asked how many weapons and  of what kind they carry. Arms traffickers should get the same  treatment. As "most favored nation," however, the smugglers of  Ciudad de Este sell bazookas, submachine guns, and all kinds of  stuff. The UZI submachine gun costs less than a deputy.    The same strictness should be enforced with the people who  smuggle logs. These people carry Army "notes" when they cross  the border at will, carrying the fruit of their work. The  clandestine lumbermen like the clandestine hunters both steal  and destroy nature. For these reasons they should be treated  like U.S. soldiers.    Precise information should also be demanded from those who  launder money. The Army can probably actively cooperate on this  moralizing task because several exchange houses, banks, and  finance companies are owned by the Armed Forces members.    In sum, the law should be the same for all: Not just when  dealing with imperialism, which this time wants to give what  Paraguayan nationalism does not have: $12 million. (with 92  percent of the national budget allocated to pay salaries, the  government does not have the money to build a latrine in San  Pedro).    Inevitably, when charity is too generous even a saint  becomes  suspicious. This sudden government nationalism is bewildering.  If there is one sin of which the government is not guiilty, it  is that of being nationalist. It is neoliberal, therefore it is  cosmopolitan. It is capitalist and the capital is stateless.  Yet it is not a savage type of capitalism it is a parochial  [given in Guarani] capitalism.    Under such circumstances, it should be seen if, through its  intransigence, this government defends national sovereignty or  the sovereignty of the corrupt    I am referring to all those who -- if the soliders come --  will find themselves having to explain why instead of growing  mate they are growing marijuana. It is known that even the last  square meter of marijuana has been photographed from the  satellites. It is one thing is to know something in general  terms and another to run into it headon. Any movement in the  zone of San Pedro, even to collect yaguarete ka'a [a medicinal  herb] will highlight the zonal and national problem: drugs. As  the government cannot stop it, it prefers to play the hero.</p>

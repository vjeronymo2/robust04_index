			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Money Markets: More ERM pressures MONEY MARKET interest rates in both Spain and Denmark rose sharply yesterday as both the peseta and the Danish krone came under renewed pressures inside the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. The creakiness of the ERM continues to be the dominant theme in interest rate markets, despite recent easing in German monetary policy. Yesterday the Spanish authorities were forced to nudge 1 month interest rates up to 20 per cent, as the peseta slipped to around Pta73.00 against the D-Mark. Later in the day, the Bank of Spain hiked its intervention rate by 71 basis points to 15.32 per cent. One month Danish krone were also quoted as high as 23 per cent, as the currency fell below DKr3.85 to the D-Mark in late European trading. One London-based dealer said this augured badly for the Danish authorities, since they had only just cut the discount rate by 100 basis points to 10.5 per cent. The problem for the authorities in both countries is that a policy of raising interest rates to support the currency carries little political credibility. In Spain, unemployment is hovering around 20 per cent, and the government faces a general election in October. In Denmark, the chances of the country voting Yes in its second referendum in Maastricht next month may also be damaged by the punishingly high level of interest rates. In France and Germany, dealers continued to scale down hopes for lower rates. The March Euromark contract yesterday closed down 8 basis points at 91.87. Dealers are now assuming that 3-month money will be at 8.13 per cent by the middle of next month, only 17 basis points below yesterday's level. Two Bundesbank money market interventions and a council meeting are due over the next two weeks. Many dealers think that an easing in rates is possible over this period. However, the March French franc contract closed down 19 basis points, at 88.30, on expectations that pressure on the currency will remain intense until after next month's parliamentary elections in France. One month French interest rates were up at 12 1/8 per cent yesterday from 11 7/8 per cent the day before. Sterling markets were quiet. Three-month sterling cash closed a little softer at 6 1/8 per cent following the small shortage of Pounds 1bn forecast by the Bank of England.</p>

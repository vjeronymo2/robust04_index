			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 23 (ATA) -- Also on the second day of  the census in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM],  Albanians did not accept to take part in the census because the  minimum indispensable conditions for a normal and unbiased  development of this process have not been met.    Internal sources report that in the great centres inhabited  by Albanians, the latter have not taken part in the census,  except for the Macedonians.    The chairman of the representatives of the Geneva Council,  Ambassador Gert Ahrens, said at a press conference in Skopje  that lack of nationality, the main concern of the Albanians of  that republic, should not prevent them from taking part in the  census, because this is an act which will not verify the  Macedonian nationality. According to Mr. Ahrens, persons who  have not been granted the nationality but have the old identity  card before 1993 may take part in the census.    In the meantime, none of the senior Macedonian authorities  made any public statement to confirm this.    The Party for Democratic for Prosperity [PDP] branches in  towns with Albanian population in western Macedonia continue to  receive various complaints on obstacles encountered by the  Albanians to be included in the census process within schedule.    The deputy chairwoman of the PDP centred in Tetove, Nexhibe  Palloshi, and the chairman of this party's branch in Skopje,  Adem Hyseni, told ATA that in Tetove, Skopje, and its suburbs,  over 50 percent of the Albanians have so far been unable to  receive the nationality document.    In the course of finding compromising facts on the  manipulation of the census and denigration of the Albanians,  they said that among the persons of Albanian origin who have  made the request for nationality since 1993, more than 2,000  have their documents "lost" in the labyrinths of the Macedonian  administration.    The interior minister of Macedonia, Lubomir Frckovski,  stated  earlier that the nationality status for 98 percent of the  population is guaranteed, but the chairman of the PDP, Arben  Xhaferi, in reply to his statement, says that perhaps, Frckovski  had said this bearing in mind only the Macedonian population of  this republic.    Although the number of the Albanian officers in the  Macedonia  Army is extremely small, only 63 out of 3,700, who are  Macedonians, many of them have not yet been able to receive the  nationality document, while they are the defenders of the  territorial integrity of this republic. The same is also  happening with many youths of Albanian nationality who carry out  military service in the Macedonian Army.    The second day of census in Tetove, Gostivar, Skopje,  Struge,  Kumanove, Kercove, and Diber closed without the participation in  the census of the Albanians who demand reexamination of the law,  which they consider disfavouring and of deliberate aims for  political manipulation.</p>

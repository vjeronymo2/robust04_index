			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: London The UK government bond market continued its rally at the year-end and is likely to be buoyed by interest rate speculation this week, especially as all the European bond markets will be focusing on the Bundesbank Council meeting this Thursday in the hope of seeing a cut in the key German interest rates. Hopes are high of a cut in the UK base rate - currently at 5.5 per cent - early on in 1994, and dealers say a 50 basis point cut has already been discounted by the gilt market. Although trading was quite thin over the Christmas and new year break, the gilt market still made some headway and was the best performing government bond market in the week ending December 30, according to Salomon Brothers bond data. Much of the focus was on the index-linked sector and the Bank of England took advantage of the interest, announcing four index-linked tap stocks on Thursday. The Pounds 750m of stock available consisted of Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2001; Pounds 250m of 4 3/8 per cent index-linked stock due 2004; Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2013; and Pounds 200m of 4 1/8 per cent index-linked stock due 2030. Although the market was only open for half the day on New Year's Eve, the Bank sold out of the first two tap stocks.</p>

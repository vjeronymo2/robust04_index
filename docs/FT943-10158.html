			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Russia's Gasprom offers stake to western investors Gasprom, the world's largest gas company and the 'crown jewel' of corporate Russia, took the first concrete steps yesterday towards selling a significant minority of its shares to international investors. The company, which controls 35 per cent of the world's known natural gas reserves, appointed Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, as its adviser for the sale of 9 per cent of its shares. 'This is one of the most prestigious jobs the company has ever done,' said Mr Philip Lambert, a Kleinwort Benson director. He declined to give details on the timing, pricing or structure of the deal, although 'substantial progress' is expected by the end of the year. The offering is likely to attract the interest of a wide range of western energy companies, some of whom already have co-operative agreements with the company. Financial investors are also expected to be attracted to Gasprom, because it is Russia's largest company and one of the few to be considered creditworthy by international banks. However, it could further stir the debate in Russia between reformers, who argue that foreign investment is crucial if Russian oil and gas companies are to be competitive on the world market, and conservatives who say that national assets should not be sold off. In this struggle Gasprom holds a powerful political trump card in Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who, as the former head of Gasprom, is sympathetic to the company's needs. Gasprom now joins the growing ranks of big Russian companies which have decided to tap international capital markets, including Lukoil, Russia's biggest integrated oil company. The shareholding to be sold is owned by Gasprom itself. In addition, the Russian government will retain a 40 per cent stake in Gasprom, 15 per cent of which is owned by its employees. A third of the company was sold in the spring this year to the public for privatisation vouchers. Gasprom, which is the largest exporter of gas to western Europe, will need to invest heavily in coming years if it is to expand its share of the growing European market for natural gas. Part of the money raised from the planned share sale is expected to be used to help fund a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) 4,000km pipeline from the gas fields in the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia to Germany, via Belarus and Poland. That task will be complicated by the vast debts owed to Gasprom by much of Russian industry and former Soviet republics, such as Ukraine. Corporate debt threat, Page 2</p>

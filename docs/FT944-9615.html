			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television Two things stand out tonight: Barbara Windsor (the Carry On mode is inescapable). The busty cockney sparrer has little of interest to say, but that's to be expected from Without Walls: The Obituary Show (C4 9.00), with one of those fearsomely humourless commissioning editors who persistently pronounce obiter dicta on humour. On tonight's showing you might think she's been rather lucky. So perhaps has Muriel Gray, extolling (or not) the Range Rover in Ride On (C4 8.00): a figure no less grotesque but rather less self-knowledgeable. From sex, albeit self-parodying, to our other preoccupation, money. How to Win the Lottery (BBC1 9.30) is also a lesson in how to survive that sometimes pyrrhic victory. Inane purchases, litigious relatives, the quest for wealth sliding effortlessly into the slot once occupied by organised religion. Those who remember the young John Pilger's blend of righteousness, theatrical anger and occasionally woolly thinking can skip Network First (ITV 10.40) with a clear conscience. Some of that youthful hysteria would be welcome in this plod through the British arms trade.</p>

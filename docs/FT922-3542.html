			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Bolivia puts 60 companies up for first privatisations BOLIVIA launched its privatisation programme this week by ear-marking more than 60 enterprises, ranging from cotton mills to cement factories, for sale. Mr Samuel Doria Medina, planning minister, said he hoped the first stage of the privatisation - which will involve selling 33 of the 60 - will bring in some Dollars 60m. The privatisation bill was before the legislature for two years. The launch of the programme follows a decision of the Bolivian supreme court that privatising state enterprises, some of which have been in state hands since nationalisation after the 1952 revolution, was constitutional. The confederation of Bolivian trade unions is threatening widespread industrial action in a bid to halt the process. Mr Doria said several privatisation mechanisms would be used, including employee share offers, asset sales, leasing, private capital investments and share offers on Bolivia's small stock exchange. The minister added: 'The state does not have the resources to invest in these companies. The only criteria which will determine their sale will be price. Mechanisms will be put in place to avoid doubtful practices and corruption.' The government has shrunk from privatising the country's most attractive assets, which are in its natural resources of metals and oil. Privatising these sectors remains unconstitutional and the government has opted for joint-venture exploration and exploitation. The first Bolivian enterprise to go under the hammer is an edible-oil factory at Rafael Deheza, now operating at 6 per cent capacity and losing money. Mr Doria believes the plant could be turned around with an investment of less than Dollars 1m. The government acknowledges that many of the 60 or so enterprises for sale are already closed for want of adequate investment; others are functioning at far below maximum productive capacity. Despite the modest expected revenues, the privatisations are seen as having symbolic importance, as a start in the attempt to diminish the size of the state sector while convincing Bolivia's foreign creditors that the government is firmly wedded to a liberal economic policy.</p>

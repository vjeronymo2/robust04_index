			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Agricultural Products Purchase </F> Prices May Rise"]    [Text] Purchase prices for 1994 agricultural produce in  the Russian Federation may almost triple, Ministry of  Agriculture price policy board experts believe. Calculated on  the basis of current market prices and on the expected level of  inflation, purchase prices will amount to: about 220,000 rubles  [R] per one tonne of wheat; R350,000 per one tonne of sunflower;  R70,000 per one tonne of sugar beet; and R200,000 per one tonne  of potatoes. According to the experts' count, these prices will  ensure profitability of wheat and sunflower (121 and 125 percent  correspondingly). Potatoes (with profitability at 24 percent)  and sugar beet (at 8 percent) are proving to be unprofitable.  The document underlines that prices of agricultural produce  will be determined by those who sell and buy it, and their  regulation by state organs is not permitted.</p>

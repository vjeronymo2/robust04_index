"I can tell you officially and I repeat what  was said on Tuesday eighth March by the spokesman of the French  Ministry of Foreign Affairs that none of them is present in  Bakassi", Garrigue-Guyonnaud said.    Garrigue-Guyonnaud told newsmen at a press conference that  France had historical ties and cooperation agreements with  Cameroon and that it was in response to a request by the  Cameroonian Government that it had sent two helicopters and 15  military assistants to Yaounde on what he called a "logistics  mission." He said that the level of French assistance to  Cameroon had not been increased since the crisis began three  weeks ago, with a reported shoot out between Cameroonian  gendarmes and Nigerian troops in the peninsula, a border area of  1,000 square kilometres disputed by the two countries.    On the French frigate reported to have arrived in Douala to  reinforce French presence in the peninsula, Garrigue-Guyonnaud  said it was part of a routine visit carried out all year round  along the Atlantic coast of Africa. He said the frigate, the  Vendemiaire, left Douala on 6 March and is no longer in Cameroon.    The ambassador said another warship, the "Jacoubet, arrived  in Douala on 7 March as part of a long-standing agreement and is  expected to leave today. "These visits are not related to the  present situation. A scheduled visit of the vessel took place  in Accra a few weeks ago," he said.    Commenting on the five-day joint military exercises between  France and Benin, which are to end today, he said they took  place west of the Couffo River, near Togo and bear no relation  whatsoever to the territorial dispute between Cameroon and  Nigeria. Benin lies on Nigeria's western border.    "The men and equipment are being transported back to France  today and tomorrow, at the end of the manoeuvres to which  Nigeria sent two military observers," he said. The ambassador  said France has relations dating 20 years with Nigeria despite  its historical links with Cameroon, and for this reason,  supported a peaceful solution to the crisis. "Our position is  clear and has been consistent. We seek a peaceful settlement  and we have informed the Nigerian authorities at the highest  level," he said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Block on new Peru loans lifted THE InterAmerican Development Bank has lifted a block on new loans for the Peruvian government imposed when President Alberto Fujimori suspended the constitution in April, writes Stephen Fidler. However, although loans for Dollars 221.8m (Pounds 129.7m) were signed last week to provide balance of payments support for reforms in the country's financial sector, the bank will not disburse funds until after the government has met conditions related to a return to constitutional rule. The loans were approved by the IADB board on March 18, but the signing, due to take place at the bank's annual meeting in April, was postponed after Mr Fujimori's move. It was not clear yesterday specifically what conditions had to be met before the loans would be disbursed. The bank wants to encourage further economic reform in Peru, but is unwilling to send too strong a signal of support to Mr Fujimori until there is hard evidence of a return to constitutional rule. Peru cleared its arrears to the IADB a year ago, allowing the bank to resume lending. However, the IMF and World Bank are unable to lend, since Mr Fujimori's actions jeopardised a multinational support operation designed to bring Peru out of arrears with the two institutions.</p>

This proposal would require modification of the sidewall panels in the passenger cabin. This proposal is prompted by a report that inadequate venting between the cabin and the compartments beneath the floor could occur during rapid fuselage decompression. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent collapse of the floor and subsequent injury to passengers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by March 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93&hyph;NM&hyph;203&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Transport Canada Aviation advises that, during a post-certification review of the design for cabin venting between compartments, the manufacturer discovered that the cabin and the compartments beneath the floor could be inadequately vented during rapid fuselage decompression of these airplanes. This condition is the result of movement of the sidewall panels in the passenger cabin, which may partially block the vents along the bottom edges of the panels. This condition, if not corrected, could result in collapse of the floor and subsequent injury to passengers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> De Havilland has issued Service Bulletin No. 8&hyph;25&hyph;53, dated August 4, 1989, that describes procedures for modification of the sidewall panels in the passenger cabin (Modification No. 8/1339). The modification entails bonding spacers along the lower edge of the cabin sidewall panels to provide support. Installation of the spacers will ensure that intercompartmental venting is maintained in the event of rapid fuselage decompression. Transport Canada Aviation classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive No. CF&hyph;90&hyph;26, dated November 29, 1990, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

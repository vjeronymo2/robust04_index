			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / World Trade News: High duties against Japan - EU tackles imports of broadcasting cameras The European Union has imposed definitive anti-dumping duties of as much as 96.8 per cent on imports of broadcasting cameras made by five Japanese electronics companies. The duties are among the highest in any recent EU anti-dumping action against Japanese imports. The duties were imposed after an investigation by the European Commission of complaints by BTS, part of Philips of the Netherlands, and Thomson Broadcast of France, which are Europe's only makers of studio video-cameras. The investigation found that Japanese exporters had increased their share of the EU studio camera market from 52 per cent in 1989 to 70 per cent in 1992, while the share of European producers fell from 48 per cent to 30 per cent. The Commission said the market share gains were due to unfair pricing by the Japanese companies. It put at 21 per cent to 60 per cent the 'dumping margins' on the products - the gap between prices in the EU and Japan. It said none of the Japanese companies disputed this finding. However, Sony, one of the Japanese companies affected by the EU action, accused the Commission of failure to take into consideration price differences due to varying product specifications and service provisions. It said the duties would result in 'significant' price increases. The dumping duties on Sony cameras have been set at 62.6 per cent; those on products by Ikegami Tsushinki and Hitachi Denshi are 82.9 per cent and 52.7 per cent. Duties of 96.8 per cent have been imposed on products by Matsushita and JVC, which the Commission said did not co-operate in its investigation. Sony, the leader in the world broadcasting camera market, said many of its customers had lobbied on its behalf during the EU investigation. The Commission said several users of broadcast cameras had said European products were inferior to those from Japan, but had not substantiated this claim. The Commission also rejected users' objections that the duties would force them to switch to European cameras which were technically incompatible with Japanese ones. Capital Group Studios, a London indpendent television production studio which lobbied against the duties, said yesterday that the decision would put it at a competitive disadvantage by raising the prices it had to pay for equipment. The company said the most sophisticated broadcast camera technology had long come from Japan, though BTS had recently launched a range of technically advanced products.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Eagle Star Australian unit sold for Pounds 130m EAGLE STAR, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, has announced the sale of its Australian Eagle Insurance subsidiary. The sale, for about Pounds 130m, will boost a capital base battered by recent losses on domestic mortgage indemnity business and other recession-related losses. Mr Michael Heath, executive director, said book profits of Pounds 75m from the deal would lift the group's solvency margin (the yardstick which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premiums) by 7 percentage points to 46 per cent. Australian Eagle underwrote non-life premiums of about ADollars 150m (Pounds 65m) and about ADollars 180m in life premium income in 1991, contributing profits of Pounds 5m when Eagle Star reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 394m. QBE Insurance will acquire the non-life business, while Lend Lease Corporation, which owns MLC Life, the country's third biggest life office, will acquire the life business. Mr Heath said that scale was an important ingredient of success in the fragmented Australian market. 'We would have been prepared to make more investment in Australia if we had been attempting to develop a global approach to non-life business,' said Mr Heath. Instead Eagle Star would concentrate on building its life and personal lines business in the UK and rest of Europe, he added. The sale marks a further restructuring in the competitive Australian market. Last month Guardian Royal Exchange, another UK composite company, agreed to merge its Australian operation with that of Zurich Insurance. Australian Eagle's general insurance business is concentrated in Victoria. It has a particularly strong presence in the agricultural risks market.</p>

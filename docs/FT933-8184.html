			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Restructuring enables Saab Auto to trim deficit SAAB AUTOMOBILE, the Swedish car group jointly owned by General Motors of the US and Saab-Scania, yesterday announced a second-quarter loss after financial items of SKr423m (Dollars 51.8m). This is a 17 per cent improvement on the SKr507m deficit for the same 1992 period. The result helped the company maintain its first-quarter progress and took its first-half loss after financial items to SKr561m, compared with SKr800m last year. However, there was an SKr123m extraordinary charge covering start-up costs for the Saab 900 model which is to be introduced in the autumn. This left the first-half deficit before appropriations and taxes at SKr684m, against SKr782m last year. Saab said the improvement reflected the benefits of its ongoing restructuring programme, rather than any market upturn or benefit from the depreciation of the Swedish krona. First-half sales were down 4 per cent to SKr7.75bn from SKr8.06bn, although the fall in the second quarter was 9 per cent. A Saab official said market conditions remained very tough in the group's key Nordic markets. He added that although there had been some improvement in the UK, sales were also falling in Germany and the US market was 'not that strong'. First-half retail sales fell to 36,000 cars from 46,000. The company said this was because it stopped making the old 900 series in March and took its holiday period, when production is stopped, earlier than usual. It is sticking by an earlier forecast of 80,000 sales for the whole of 1993, pinning its hopes on strong demand for the new Saab 900 in the last few months of the year. The company expects a substantial improvement on the SKr2.69bn deficit it sustained for the whole of 1992 but it says it will remain in the red.</p>

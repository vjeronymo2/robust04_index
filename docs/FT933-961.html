			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Presidential contender flies home to Lagos THE battle for the leadership of Nigeria was set to resume yesterday as Chief Moshood Abiola flew back to Lagos to a hero's welcome to press for recognition of his victory in the country's annulled presidential poll of June 12. News agencies reported that he was met at Lagos airport off a flight from Paris by a huge crowd of supporters who defied security arrangements aimed at limiting the size of the reception. Thousands of people, many dressed in the green and white colours of his Social Democractic Party, lined the roads from the airport and cheered the waving Chief Abiola as he was driven the two miles (three km) to his Ikeja home. He made no public statement at the airport but his return is likely to boost the tempo of the crusade to have him sworn in as president. 'All we are saying is give MKO a chance,' his supporters sang to the tune of the popular John Lennon song, refering to Chief Abiola by his popular nickname. 'MKO is our man]' the crowds chanted, waving placards saying 'We want MKO for president.' In a statement marking the end of a self-imposed six week exile and released in advance of his departure yesterday morning, Mr Abiola called for a 'peaceful' response to his return. 'Nothing should be done to wipe off the positive achievement,' of the June elections, said the statement. In spite of the warm welcome in Lagos, the heart of Mr Abiola's political stronghold, many of his supporters fear he has missed the boat. A general strike failed to shift the new military-led government which succeeded General Ibrahim Babangida from its plans to hold fresh elections next March. Many of Mr Abiola's supporters have also been disappointed by his extended absence, which began when he fled Lagos in his private jet, fearing for his life. He nevertheless has the capacity to revive protest in the south, where his support is considerable. Mr Abiola's tactics, however, will depend on the outcome of recent exchanges between him and the interim government led by Chief Ernest Shonekan. In a statement sent to the Financial Times shortly before his departure, Mr Abiola said that he had delayed his return in response to a request by Mr Shonekan, relayed by the British foreign office. Mr Shonekan had been expected to come to London for discussions 'and return with me to Nigeria', said Mr Abiola. 'Unfortunately this promise remains unfulfilled, and the suspicion now seems justified that the delay is designed to keep me out of Nigeria.'</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / City considers permanent security cordon THE Corporation of London, the City's local authority, is expected to publish a set of proposals tomorrow designed to reduce the risk of further bomb attacks by the IRA. The most controversial measure being considered is the creation of a permanent security cordon around the City. This would involve maintaining the road blocks and checkpoints that it installed temporarily last month. The corporation believes that the predominant acceptance by the public of the temporary cordon strengthens the case for making it permanent. The corporation will also propose a range of surveillance measures to improve security within the City. These include an increased number of security cameras, neighbourhood watch schemes and greater co-ordination of companies' security staff and camera systems. The corporation also proposes removing all litter bins and rubbish bags from the streets. It has already taken away 1,000 litter bins following the Bishopsgate bomb in April. Other measures include the introduction of a pager alarm system to alert people to bomb warnings. This would be offered to City workers at a cost of about Pounds 150 a year each. In the Bishopsgate bomb, some workers were unable to hear police loud hailers telling them to evacuate buildings. City businesses and other interested parties will be consulted in the next few weeks. The consultation document will be widely distributed and the corporation will also hold a series of public meetings. The proposals have been drawn up in consultation with a steering committee on security set up in early June, composed of the City police, the Bank of England and various securities houses. The corporation has also held meetings with representatives of more than 400 City businesses. The measures come in the wake of the recent City bomb attacks. The latest estimates of the cost of the Bishopsgate bomb is about Pounds 500m, while the cost of the St Mary Axe bomb a year earlier was about Pounds 350m, according to the Association of British Insurers. The Bishopsgate attack increased the pressure on the Corporation of London to take visible anti-terrorist measures. The new proposals are designed to restrict the extent of potential bomb damage - the corporation acknowledges that it cannot prevent hand-carried devices being brought into the security area. It has put aside for the time being suggestions that the City should be made a pedestrian zone because this would involve a lengthy public inquiry. However Mr Michael Cassidy, who heads the corporation's policy and resources committee, said that if existing measures worked well there was 'a very real justification to move forward to pedestrianisation'. The corporation has written to Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, asking him to consider giving the police powers to search vehicles. At present the police can do so only with the owner's permission. The Home Office has agreed to bear half of the cost of an extra 57 police to improve security in the City.</p>

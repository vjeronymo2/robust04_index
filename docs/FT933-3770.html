			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: News in brief ALLIED Dunbar has launched a distribution bond, a unit-linked investment where income is paid in the form of more units. The bond is structured into two funds: Capital, split between equities, property, and gilts; and Cash. Twice a year, the income on the Capital fund is transferred to Cash. Withdrawals are then taken mainly from the latter. Investors can take withdrawals as a fixed percentage each year; as a fixed amount of cash each year; or simply the amount distributed from Capital to Cash. Payments can be monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly. Minimum investment is Pounds 5,000; investments of more than Pounds 15,000 get an extra 1 per cent allocation of units. The initial charge is 5 per cent and the annual management charge is 1 3/8 per cent. * * * LEEDS &amp; Holbeck building society has launched a Guaranteed Equity bond which offers investors who are basic-rate taxpayers 75 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE over five years, or a minimum rise of 25 per cent. The return equates to 60 per cent of the rise in the Footsie for top rate-payers and 100 per cent for non-taxpayers. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000 and withdrawals can be made after two years. * * * ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester building society is launching a five year 'step-up' investment bond where the rate of interest grows annually. In year one, it will pay 6.25 per cent gross (4.69 per cent net); year two, 6.5 per cent (4.87 per cent); year three, 6.75 per cent (5.06 per cent); year four 7.25 per cent (5.44 per cent);and year five, 8 per cent (6 per cent). Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 2,500 for those who want monthly income. No withdrawals are allowed during the term, but closure is permitted subject to the loss of 180 days' interest. * * * CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester building society is offering two new mortgages for the first-time buyer. One option is a 4 per cent discount off the society's variable rate until June 30 1994, resulting in a rate of 3.99 per cent (APR 8.1 per cent). The fixed-rate option over the same period is 4.95 per cent (APR 8.1 per cent). After June 30, the loan reverts to C&amp;G's variable rate; those redeeming within three years will be charged a fee equivalent to four months' interest. Both options are available to buyers with a 10 per cent deposit and seeking a loan of less than Pounds 70,000.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / CDU just ahead in German state poll Both Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats claimed a moral victory yesterday in the state elections in east Germany's Saxony-Anhalt, and demanded the right to lead the next government. Only one seat separated the two leading parties, with 37 seats for the CDU and 36 seats for the SPD, after the final results were announced. In the event, they may be condemned to govern together, thanks to the 21 seats gained by the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the reformed former Communist party, with which neither will countenance any form of coalition. Mr Kohl said the results were a good omen for a clear victory for his party and his ruling coalition in the general elections on October 16. The biggest losers in the state elections, the latest in Germany's 19-poll election marathon this year, were the minority Free Democrats, the junior partner in coalition with the CDU in both Bonn and Magdeburg, the state capital. They received only 3.6 per cent, 9.9 points less than in 1990, and therefore fell below the 5 per cent threshold needed to enter the parliament. Final results, with a turnout of 54.9 per cent, gave the CDU 34.4 per cent of the vote, 4.5 points less than the 1990 state elections, while the SPD gained 34 per cent, up 8 points. Mr Christoph Bergner, the CDU prime minister of Saxony-Anhalt, declared himself in favour of a grand coalition, claiming the right to lead it as the head of the largest group. However, Mr Gunther Verheugen, secretary general of the SPD, said the result was a clear defeat for the ruling coalition, and his party would consider forming a minority government. The Bundnis 90/Greens party, with five seats, or 5.1 per cent of the vote, down 0.2 points from 1990, said it would do 'everything possible' to support Mr Reinhard Hoppner, the SPD's leading candidate, in forming the next government. A minority SPD/Green government, having a total of 41 of the 99 seats, would have to depend on support from either the CDU or the PDS. Mr Kohl played a big part in the party campaign, holding a string of rallies across the state and attracting bigger crowds than any of the opposition politicians. He said that only six months ago the CDU was dismissed as a certain loser in the state, but it had recovered to maintain its role as the biggest single group. The embarrassment for both Mr Kohl and the SPD is the continuing strong showing of the PDS. If the party wins seats in the Bonn parliament in October, it could force them into a grand coalition at national level, as well as in state parliaments such as Saxony-Anhalt.</p>

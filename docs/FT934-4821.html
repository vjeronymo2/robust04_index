			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Benefits fraud rises to Pounds 20m Detected fraud against local authorities has risen from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 25m over the past three years, the Audit Commission says today in a report. Most of the fraud is committed by people abusing the benefits system, particularly for housing and local tax benefits. Benefit fraud accounts for 96 per cent of the 54,000 cases, and now makes up Pounds 20m of the total. Corruption is relatively rare, with only 143 proven cases in the past three years. But the commission stresses: 'Even the suspicion of corruption can damage trust in authorities, and all suspicions must be rigorously investigated.' The commission is setting up a fraud unit to spread information on how to fight the problem and has published a management paper for authorities. It recommends wider use of information technology to cross-check information held by different authorities. Mr Andrew Foster, controller of the commission, said: 'At present people are right to have confidence in the administration of local government funds. But local government is facing many changes and today's high standards could be at risk.'

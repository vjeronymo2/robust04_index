			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally on heavy auction bidding US Treasury bonds rallied across the yield curve yesterday after the government's monthly auction of five-year notes generated unexpectedly aggressive bidding. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 1/4 higher at 100 7/16 , with the yield falling to 6.212 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/8 ahead at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.184 per cent. Early in the session, the market was content to remain in its pre-holiday torpor, with no fresh readings on inflation to drive sentiment. The commerce department's upward revision of third-quarter gross national product was largely ignored. The market had been anticipating possible difficulties in absorbing the Treasury's offering of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes, as most institutional buyers have locked up their positions until the new year. However, a last-minute surge in demand developed before the auction's bidding deadline, pushing the five-year yield down to 5.19 per cent, two basis points less than expected. Prices rose further after dealers who had sold borrowed notes in anticipation of replacing them cheaply at the auction had to scramble to cover their 'short' positions. Canadian government bonds rallied strongly as the appointment of a new central bank governor dispelled jitters about future monetary policy. Rumours swept the market early that Mr John Crow planned to resign from his position as governor of the central bank, leading to an initial decline in bond prices. However, the actual announcement of Mr Crow's resignation, and the appointment of an internal candidate - Mr Gordon Thiessen, the senior deputy governor - to the top position cheered the market, which expects to see the central bank stick to its low-inflation policy. Bond prices climbed across the range of maturities. The release of better-than-expected inflation figures helped German government bond prices to nudge up in thin trading. The state of Hesse reported a 0.1 per cent rise in the month to mid-December, giving a year-on-year increase of 3.7 per cent, against a 3.8 per cent rise in November. Hesse is the second of the big four western German states to release its December CPI figures. Bavaria's annual inflation rate, released on Tuesday, was unchanged from November at 3.4 per cent. The bund futures contract traded in a narrow range of 100.71-100.80 on a volume of about 13,000 contracts. Italy and Spain, Europe's high-yielding bond markets, both saw new buying interest from foreign investors, gaining nearly half a point. Dealers said expectations of an imminent interest rate cut propelled the Italian government market, with progress on the approval of the 1994 budget and the release of good inflation figures this week contributing to the buoyant mood. UK government bonds ended the day little changed, as the gilt market wound down for the Christmas holiday.</p>

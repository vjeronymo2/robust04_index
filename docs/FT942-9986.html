			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Aegon net advances 13.2% to Fl 260m Aegon, the second-largest Dutch insurer, said net profit rose by 13.2 per cent to Fl 260.3m (Dollars 139m) in the first quarter from Fl 229.9m in the same quarter of last year. Premium revenues jumped by nearly 50 per cent to Fl 4.59bn from Fl 3.13bn, reflecting the first-time inclusion of results from Scottish Equitable of the UK and from Diversified Investment Advisors of the US. Total revenue, which includes realised and unrealised gains and losses from investments, rose by a more modest 3.1 per cent to Fl 5.09bn. 'Investment income for the risk of policy holders is lower than last year due to unrealised losses in line with the downward trend of international financial markets,' the company said. Aegon said results in the Netherlands showed a 'clear' rise while those in the US, the group's second biggest market, saw strong growth.</p>

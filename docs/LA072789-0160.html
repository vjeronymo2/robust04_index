			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE FEARS AIR RULES COULD HIKE POWER COST  </P> <P> Stringent new air quality regulations on electrical power production in the Los  Angeles Basin could cause record increases in utility rates to consumers,  Glendale city officials warned this week.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District next week is expected to adopt  rules that could force Glendale to double the city's bonded indebtedness by $50  million and boost residential electric rates by 13.6%, according to a report  presented Tuesday to the Glendale City Council by W. E. Cameron, city public  service director.  </P> <P> Mayor Jerold Milner accused the district of attempting "to become a super  government" by imposing rules that may force the city to abandon its power  production plants altogether.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growing Animosity  </P> <P> The criticism demonstrated an apparent growing animosity among officials in  Glendale and other cities over the state agency's efforts to clear the air in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Glendale Councilman Carl Raggio said Tuesday: "Sometime this tea party is going  to have to have some different people sit at the table. We can't let the Tom  Haydens of the world continue to be responsible."  </P> <P> The rules scheduled to be adopted at a AQMD hearing Aug. 4 would require all  electrical producers to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from gas turbine  engines and steam boilers by installing expensive catalytic reduction  equipment, Cameron said.  </P> <P> The new equipment would cost Glendale more than $50.4 million -- double the  city's total present debt of $50 million, said Brian Butler, city finance  director.  </P> <P> The rule would apply to Glendale, Burbank and Pasadena -- which produce a  relatively small amount of supplemental electrical power -- as well as to the  giant Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Southern California  Edison Co.  </P> <P> Glendale officials said they are considering abandoning the city's power plant  or joining Burbank and Pasadena to develop a new plant outside the AQMD's  jurisdiction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Review Energy Policy  </P> <P> "We might have to review our entire energy policy before we spend the money,"  Cameron said.  </P> <P> However, air quality district officials said the proposed rules on power  production are part of a wide-ranging plan to reduce nitrogen oxide levels in  the basin, which they said is the last region in the nation to meet federal  ambient air quality standards.  </P> <P> District spokesman Tom Eichhorn said the cost of the proposed new rules can be  measured in two ways: Residents can "either pay for it with clean air or pay  for it with their lungs."  </P> <P> Steven A. Broiles, an attorney representing Glendale, Burbank and Pasadena in  their fight with the district, called the proposed new regulations "the most  expensive that the South Coast Air Quality Management District has ever  adopted." He maintains that they are unworkable, unfeasible and unnecessary as  a solution to air-pollution problems.  </P></p>

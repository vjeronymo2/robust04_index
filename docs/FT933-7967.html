			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Deficit at Navistar after Dollars 513m charge NAVISTAR International, the Chicago-based truck and engine manufacturer which recently negotiated a landmark agreement to cut workers' post-retirement benefits, reported a net loss of Dollars 312m, or Dollars 9.99 a common share, for its third quarter. The loss reflected a one-time charge of Dollars 513m related to the new benefits plan. Excluding the charge, the company's operating results improved in the third quarter. Before the special charge, pre-tax operating income rose to Dollars 11m, up from a loss of Dollars 49m in the third quarter of 1992. The 1992 quarter included a Dollars 24m charge related to a vehicle recall. Consolidated sales from the company's manufacturing and financial services operations totalled Dollars 1.12bn, up 22 per cent from Dollars 917m in the 1992 third quarter. Mr James Cotting, chairman, said: 'The improvement in year-over-year operating results is the result of increased demand across the board in all of our businesses.' The company said that shipments of mid-range diesel engines increased 30 per cent in the quarter, while retail sales of medium and heavy trucks rose 28 per cent, to 80,600 units. Navistar on July 1 implemented a new post-retirement benefits plan, which it expects will reduce its liability for retiree healthcare and life insurance to about Dollars 1.1bn worldwide, down from Dollars 2.6bn.</p>

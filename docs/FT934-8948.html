			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Inco to take charge for output cuts INCO plans to take a USDollars 70m pre-tax charge against first-quarter 1994 earnings to cover the costs of recently-announced cutbacks by the Toronto-based nickel producer. At an analysts' meeting, Inco officials painted a mildly encouraging picture of the international nickel market, predicting a drop in Russian supplies to the west and a significant decline in inventories early next year. While Inco's 1994 earnings will be hit by lower output and the shutdown charge, the company is giving high priority to further cost-reduction. Its break-even nickel price is expected to fall below the Dollars 3.13 per pound projected in 1993, down from Dollars 3.19 last year. Capital spending will be cut to Dollars 150m in 1994 from Dollars 193m this year and a recent peak of Dollars 573m in 1990. Inco predicts that world nickel supply, excluding eastern Europe, Russia and China, will fall to 320m lbs in the first quarter of 1994 from 385m lbs in the final quarter of this year. London Metal Exchange stocks, which have risen steeply over the past three years, are expected to drop to 220m lbs from 270m lbs. Inco plans to cut its own output by 16 per cent next year.</p>

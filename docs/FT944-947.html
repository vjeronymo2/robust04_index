			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / World Bank agrees Dollars 40m emergency loan for Haiti The World Bank has approved a Dollars 40m emergency loan for Haiti, the first of an estimated Dollars 663m in various credits expected over the next 12-18 months, as the international community attempts to assist the poorest country in the western hemisphere. The first Dollars 20m could be distributed 'in a matter of weeks to get the machinery of the private sector going again', according to Mr Rainer Steckhan, director of special operations. The so called 'fast disbursing' loan is from the World Bank's soft-loan arm, the International Development Association. It will be used to provide emergency supplies, such as medicine, spare parts and oil. This will be the first new lending for Haiti since the military overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. The World Bank board gave its approval after Haiti on Monday paid its arrears to the multilateral institutions with Dollars 82m in aid contributed from 10 countries. Haiti's Congress was expected to approve the package yesterday. The donors included the US, Japan, Switzerland, France, Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Also contributing were Argentina, Mexico and the Dominican Republic, 'an expression of solidarity in the hemisphere', which World Bank officials said they found encouraging. The IDA on Tuesday also unfroze funds for six projects under way in Haiti when lending was cut off. The balance - about Dollars 104m - will go towards the projects to develop water supplies, industry, power, transport and health. With no real precedents for rescuing a country so poor, newly returned to democracy, the banks are moving swiftly but cautiously. Disbursements will be closely monitored.</p>

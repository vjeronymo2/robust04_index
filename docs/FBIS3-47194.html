			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] China is becoming a leading player in the world  economy. The real economic scale of the "great China sphere,"  encompassing Hong Kong and Taiwan, will probably exceed that of  Japan and even the United States in the 21st century.  Economically depressed advanced countries are queuing up to  converge on China with its huge potential market of 1.2 billion  persons. Japanese enterprises might miss the opportunity for  growth if they are late in starting. China is swaying the world.  <H3>  Restraining Measures Ineffective--Even Universities Enter  Joint Ventures </H3>   To prevent economic overheating, the Chinese Government set  forth in May 1993 a policy to not only control establishment of  development zones in regions but to strictly examine the  soundness of project plans and fund procurement of development  zones below the county level and, in some cases, to abolish  them. However, it appears that local entities are ignoring the  government policy.    Presently, Songjiang County, adjoining Shanghai, is becoming  the focal point of foreign capital attracted to China. Land  prices (usage rights) in Shanghai City have risen considerably,  but are still cheap. Moreover, the expressway linking Shanghai  and Hangzhou City, which is under construction by the nation,  will pass through this county. Tahui "xiang" (equivalent to a  town), located about 10 km west of the center with the county  offices, is a typical farming village with vast paddy fields  seen in the outskirts of Shanghai. At present, this town is  trying desperately to sell its development zone. The area of the  development zone is 2,700 mu (1 mu is 666 square meters), or  approximately 15 percent of the town's agricultural land. A  20-meter road was built in the middle of the paddy fields and  land on both sides is being sold.  <H3>  "Local Countermeasures to Central Government  Policies"--Expediency Measures Increase as Restraints Are  Tightened </H3>   The population of this town is 17,000. Since it is close to  Shanghai, there are many branch factories of state-owned  enterprises and 63 of them are in this town. It is a  "semi-agricultural, semi-manufacturing" town with factories now  contributing more than 50 percent of the town's total output of  400 million yuan (approximately 7.4 billion yen). To further  increase cash revenue, the buildup of the development zone is  being promoted.    As its name implies, this town has old pagodas built during  the Tang dynasty and a Taiwanese enterprise is now engaged in a  development project with total investment of 40 million yuan  (approximately 740 million yen) to build a comprehensive resort  area with golf courses and hotels. Chen Jinrong, secretary of  the CPC Tahui Town Committee, says, "Even if the present  development zone is completely sold out, there are other sites  we can offer. We would greatly welcome the entry of Japanese  enterprises."    Xinping Town, located about an hour's ride west of Tahui,  has  converted 10,000 mu of agricultural land into a development zone  and started a full-scale program to attract foreign capital.  With a population of 33,000 persons and an area of 45,000 mu,  this town is the largest in Songjiang County but relatively few  factories have entered because of difficult accessibility. Even  today, it takes over two hours from Shanghai but, as early as  next spring, the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway might open and an  interchange will be built nearby, so, using the claim, "only 35  minutes to Shanghai" (Wang Yougen, town mayor), as the selling  point, efforts to attract foreign capital were started in  earnest. The mayor says, "If the contract is concluded this  year, we will sell you 1 square meter for $30.00."    Of course, Songjiang County, which administers these towns,  is operating its own development zone. In July 1992,  agricultural land was converted and an "Eastern Economic  Development Zone" was newly established. The size is 30,000 mu,  equivalent to about 30 percent of the county area, and 160  million yuan (approximately 2.9 billion yen) were spent on  infrastructure buildup, including roads, electricity, water  supply, etc.    So far, the entry of 40 companies from 11 countries is  certain. Among them are eight Japanese companies, including  Yakult and Toyo Denso Co. (Minato-ku, Tokyo), an automobile  parts manufacturer affiliated with Honda Motor Co.    Wang Min, deputy director of CPC Songjiang County Propaganda  Department, nonchalantly makes a comment that would surprise  Pudong officials: "If you are planning to enter national-level  development zones, such as Shanghai's Pudong area, you have to  go to Beijing to obtain permits each time and the procedure is  cumbersome. You can enter easily here and the prices are less  than half of other places. We are very anxious for Japanese  enterprises to come."    Actually, land prices (50-year usage rights) are $40-$50 per  square meter, including infrastructure expenses, so the level is  less than half of that in Shanghai's Pudong area or Shenzhen  City.    Taking the case of Songjiang County alone, most of the  county's 19 towns and villages have established development  zones and are competing for foreign capital.    Furthermore, the inducement methods might be called  versatile. Recently, an increasing number of Japanese firms have  been contemplating entries into local development zones, seeking  low-priced lands, but the Chinese business methods are  complicating their decisions.    A certain town is encouraging investments through a type of  expediency measure, i.e., "to make it a joint venture in form  only; in reality, independent financing (full capital  subscription) is acceptable." As compared with independent  financing, a joint venture has many advantages, such as lenient  export requirements, payment of subscription in installments,  etc.    On the other hand, through independent financing, foreign  capital enterprises can freely conduct business operations as  they wish. In other words, the towns are encouraging the clever  method of having the towns formally register the incoming  foreign capital as a joint venture and do all the required  paperwork until the factory opens, but, in reality, permit free  operation through independent financing.    Also, leaders of other towns say, "There is government  guidance, but we can make arrangements for prices and methods of  establishing companies without regard to it." If factories are  built, cash revenue can be readily earned as compared with  farming, which is burdened with extremely low purchase prices  for crops. Once the benefits of factory management are enjoyed,  it becomes difficult to backtrack.    As revealed in the statement, "there are local  countermeasures against central government policies," local  actions are difficult to restrain. As control measures become  tighter, expedient methods, which have a stronger element of  "human politics" than legal rule, become more active. This  technique is very difficult for Japanese firms to understand.    Onoda Cement Co. established the Dalian Huaneng-Onoda Cement  Co., Ltd., in Dalian City, Liaoning Province, as a joint venture  with a local enterprise. Dalian Onoda started full-scale  production of cement in July 1992, but the company has been  concerned recently about pressure being applied to maintain  product prices at a certain level though there is no such legal  provision.    Production capacity of the company's plant is China's  largest  at 1.37 million tons per year. Investments totaling 26 billion  yen are among the largest of Japanese firms.    At present, approximately 60 percent of the output is  exported to the United States. The export ratio set when the  contract was drawn was 70 percent but, because "demand for  high-quality cement became urgent with the construction boom in  China and domestic shipments were increased sharply" (So Kojima,  general manger), the level below the quota is being permitted.    That is not a problem, but Dalian Onoda's headache is the  administrative guidance for minimum export prices from Dalian  City.    There are other state-operated cement manufacturers in  Dalian  City. If Onoda exports too cheaply, the sales of state  enterprises might decline, so the minimum price instruction was  issued that "shipments below this price are not permitted."    For the present, sales are somehow being made, but  competitive power will be lost eventually if prices remain high.  There is also fear that the minimum price might be raised in the  future. There is no legal basis, but if not obeyed, export  permits will be suspended, so the company must comply.    Increase in materiel costs, without consultation, is another  source of concern. There was an occasion when the fees for  electricity provided by the city were raised sharply by over 20  percent, without advance notice, and calculation of  manufacturing costs was thrown off badly. There was an upsetting  experience, too, when the water supply was cut off abruptly.  <H3>  "Inability To Estimate" Plant Construction  Costs--Japaneses-Style Feasibility Studies Are Useless </H3>   Also, even with plant constructions, there were problems  that  could not be imagined in Japan. Construction costs could not be  estimated accurately and were inflated substantially.    In China, there are no business practices like the full  turnkey contract, whereby a plant is constructed at a set cost  and turned over to the owner. For this reason, construction had  to be started without detailed plans. Through discussions with  individual state and private sector officials, after  construction was started, construction costs finally become  known. In Onoda's case, investments exceeded the budgeted amount  by over 20 percent.    Honda Motor Co., too, was troubled by the "inability to  estimate." In July 1993, as a joint venture with the state-owned  munitions manufacturer, China Jialing Industrial Co., Ltd.,  Honda established the Jialing-Honda Motor Co., a two-wheeled  vehicle manufacturing firm, in Chongqing City, Sichuan Province.    In Chongqing Economic and Technological Development Zone,  located in Nanping on the south bank of the Yangzi River,  construction began this June on a plant with production capacity  of 300,000 vehicles a year.    The first problem that arose was the financing of the costs  to prepare the site. There were a hill, 10 meters high, and four  lakes at the site.    According to the land-use contract, preparatory costs were  to  be borne by the city's development zone, but costs doubled  because work did not proceed smoothly and the development zone  ran out of money. Since there was no way out, Jialing-Honda had  to cover the deficiency.    Even with the electric supply contract with the power  generation bureau, the contracted rate had been 460 yuan per  kilovolt-ampere (kv-amp) but the rate actually jumped to 760  yuan. In the case of Jialing-Honda, usage is to 10,000 kv-amp so  the increase meant an additional charge of approximately 55  million yen. Yuji Yamahata, director and manufacturing division  chief, says resignedly: "It seems the rate was raised because  they had to install a new large-capacity transformer. We are  building the plant with the spirit of cooperation to build the  infrastructure of the development zone."    Marubeni Corp.'s Beijing branch is worried about the  unexpected jump in rental rates of foreigner-use apartments  which are occupied by its resident employees.    Rates increased by about 35 percent over last year to $35-40  per square meter a month. Since an apartment is about 100 square  meters because of larger floor space for foreigners, the monthly  rent is approximately $4,000. Converted to Japanese yen, that  exceeds 400,000 yen.    Until early 1992, there was a renter's market for  foreigner-use apartments and rents were declining. Subsequently,  however, as the number of resident employees increased with the  steady advance of foreign capital, demand exceeded supply and  rates began to rise.    When unforeseen events occur, the Japanese-style feasibility  study (FS/corporate research) is not useful.    Akira Sera, senior director of Nisshin Oil Mills, which  started to operate a joint-venture oil plant in September 1990  in Dalian, states that "a thorough FS was conducted over five  years but it was not very useful."    During the FS stage, edible oil was rationed and supply  continued to be limited in China but, after the plant started to  operate, large quantities of imports from other countries,  including the United States, began to flow in with  liberalization of sales, and selling prices fell. Moreover, raw  material prices soared because of inflation and profits could  not be earned for a while.    Situations might also arise where counterparts, which cannot  be imagined in Japan, become candidates in a joint venture.    Located along the middle reaches of the Yangzi River is the  city of Wuhan of Hubei Province. Japanese firms investing in the  joint Japan-China software development company, Wuhan Anluo  Computer Systems, Ltd., which has its main offices in this city,  are software development subsidiaries, Yaskawa Information  Systems (Kita-Kyushu City) and Y.E. Data, of Yaskawa Electric  Manufacturing Co. The Chinese subscriber is Wuhan Dongluo New  Technology Research Institute but it is the Wuhan University  which is providing the capital in full. It is under the direct  jurisdiction of the State Education Commission of the State  Council and an important university in which only the top  performers in entrance exams can enter.    It is inconceivable for a national university in Japan to  establish enterprises but it is a government policy in China.  Various departments in Wuhan University have started businesses  and at present, the number has reached over 20 companies. Of  them, five are joint ventures with foreign firms.    Zhang Yumin, general manager of Wuhan Anluo, also serves as  an assistant professor in Wuhan University's computer science  program (equivalent to a department). It would the same as if,  in Japan, an assistant professor of a famous national  university, supposedly far removed from businesses, were to take  on the dual role of running a foreign capital-affiliated  enterprise. Business profits are used to supplement shortages of  academic departments and are also distributed among professors.  At the most, there is nearly a threefold differfential in pay  among departments.    The biggest earner is the university's economic institute.  Trainees are accepted from state and city governments as well as  stock brockerages and insurance companies and lectures are given  on market economy. In other words, a "Chinese-style business  school" is being operated. In addition to running the joint  venture, the computer science department, too, is teaching  computer technologies to approximately 100 trainees from outside  the school. The professors' salaries rank fifth among the  university's 33 departments.    The method of raising capital is also unique. Of the capital  subscription of $100,000, Wuhan University invested $45,000. For  this investment, funds were allocated to build a departmental  research institute. Shi Quangchao, assistant general manager and  Wuhan University lecturer, explains the reason for the budget  transfer as follows: "The technological level can be elevated  faster by receiving the newest technology from foreign companies  in a joint venture than by building a research institute and  exchanging technologies with foreign universities. Moreover,  profits can be expected."    In Chinese corporations which are growing rapidly, there are  many customs and systems that are beyond the comprehension and  commonsense of Japanese corporations.    Business operations are carried out without strict adherence  to laws and regulations and in such cases, personal contacts  play an important part.    These Chinese business practices appear to present big risks  to Japanese companies. If one has to say, "we cannot know the  costs until we try," he probably cannot even bring the subject  up at a board meeting in Japan.  <H3>  Inadequate Land-Air Routes and Communications  Facilities--Infrastructure Problem Poses an Obstacle </H3>   The infrastructure problem is another big risk concern of  Japanese corporations.    Yukio Seki, chief researcher and head of Asia Research  Office, Economic Research Division, Nomura Research Institute,  points out: "Production in mining and manufacturing industries  is increasing at a double-digit annual rate but the railroad  transportation capacity is growing at only about 3 percent. At  this rate, economic growth will be constrained." The fact is  that "railway freight transport in 1992 was able to meet only  about 60 percent of demand" (Tadao Nishi, head of Research and  Publications Division, Association for the Promotion of  International Trade, Japan).    When employees of Yamaha Motor Co.'s joint company in  Chongqing leave by plane on domestic business trips, they depart  without setting an anticipated return date. Fumiaki Kamiya,  administrative department chief of the joint company, states  matter-of-factly: "Passenger aircraft are always filled and only  tickets for outgoing trips can be obtained in Chongqing.  Employees must remain at their destinations until they can make  reservations for the return trips, so I send them out thinking  they should return in 10 days."    Road conditions are not good, either. The main highways  leading out from big cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and  Chongqing, are heavily congested all the time. Trucks and busses  fill the roads and there is constant honking of horns. It seems  as though there are no traffic regulations. There is a steady  stream of cars rushing by at high speeds. Pedestrians and  bicyles weave through them.    In fact, when a trip was made to a plant in the suburbs  about  30 km from Chongqing, an allowance of two to three hours had to  be made one way. En route, a truck that had broken down was  abandoned in the middle of the road. There was an occasion when  we were stalled for nearly two hours in a traffic jam. Car  performances are still unpredictable and vehicles that overheat  or that do not restart worsen the congestion. For a simple  business transaction in the suburbs, one or two days are wasted  in getting around.    Communications facilities are poor, too. Even in big cities,  during the company's business hours, telephone calls jam the few  circuits and long-distance calls are difficult to make.  Construction of relay facilities is moving slowly and portable  telephones are often not serviceable.    In Wuhan, power outages occur almost daily in the summer  when  air conditioners are turned on all at once during the day and in  the evenings when meal preparations begin. NEC Corp.'s joint  company, Wuhan-NEC Optical Communications Co., Ltd. (Wuhan  City), will prepare for outages by installing its own generator  in the optical communications equipment plant being built with a  March 1994 completion target date.    Deficiencies are also noticeable in the legal system. Kenji  Hattori, chief of Information and Research Section, Japan-China  Association on Economy and Trade, states: "There are criminal  laws and criminal litigation laws but there are no systematic  codes of civil and commerlcial laws which serve as the legal  basis for corporate activities. The legal system is a big  problem, too."    The Japan-China Investment Promotion Agency, which has  expertise in handling problems related to investments in China,  recommends that time be spent on negotiations before concluding  contracts, draw up detailed contract agreements and do not carry  over matters to post-contract negotiations. After contracts are  concluded, it is also necessary to check whether all of the  contractual items are being carried out faithfully.  <H3>  Only Risks Stand Out, But There Is No Other Growth Market  Like China </H3>   Masanada Hirano, assistant secretariat chief of the above  agency, advises that: "To conduct business smoothly in China, it  is important to wine and dine persons in key positions. Japanese  companies should understand this and should not be stingy with  social expenses." In China, where prices are cheap as compared  with Japan, the social expenses of a certain Japanese general  manager soared to 3 million yen in one year.    However, if attention is paid only to risks, another aspect  of China will be overlooked.    Izumi Hara, chief of the Project Development Section, China  Committee, Industrial Bank of Japan, makes this statement: "The  aim of the recent economic tightening is to stop inflationary  practices such as land speculation. In essence, the entire  economy will not be stalled because of this move. There is no  other developing country with as abundant manpower as China and  also, there is no other economy with so much waste. If the  manpower is used and waste is eliminated, there is limitless  room for growth."    The economic environment differs greatly from the time of  the  Tiananmen incident in 1989. Consumer goods are plentiful and  there is no panic-buying of goods as happened then, while the  harvest last year was rich enough to record record crop  production.    The move to restrain overheating, led by Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji, Deng Xiaoping's protege, is achieving results: "Before  August, one-third of the loans by financial institutions to  companies had been recovered" (a senior official of the State  Council). At the least, money is no longer available for  speculative real estate investments.    It is true that there is great risk in the Chinese market.  Political aberrations occur constantly. There is the observation  that "China is like the battleship Yamato. Unlike maneuverable  Japan, China is not easily stirred into action but, once it  begins to move, it is difficult to stop, so extreme measures  must be taken" (Ryoichi Kawai, chairman of Komatsu, Ltd.).    However, for Japanese companies troubled with recession,  entry into China, a huge market nearby, has become an important  operational issue. Nevertheless, as compared with European and  U.S. firms, the hesitancy of Japanese companies is noticeable.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Worth keeping in the glove box: Commission's Strategic Programme for the Internal Market The European Commission's 65-page Strategic Programme for the Internal Market, published yesterday, launches the next phase of the barrier-free single European market. There is no doubt about the European Union's commitment in principle to the single market - which is still the most successful legislative and public relations exercise it has ever undertaken. In the communique issued after last week's Brussels summit, EU leaders described the internal market as 'a major asset of the European economy' which 'must be fully exploited'. But as the Commission itself admits, successfully maintaining the impetus of the market will be more difficult, and less rewarding than the first phase, in which Brussels proposed 282 to set up the single market. Phase two could also prove more expensive than phase one, with the European Union having to pay for constant monitoring, enforcement and evaluation, to prevent member states lagging behind or undermining benefits of the market. The most detailed part of the strategy document deals with the development of the single market. The Commission stresses that this is not a new legislative programme. That would risk intimidating EU citizens, who became suspicious of the quantity of legislation in the 1985 strategy. The Commission says it will legislate where necessary, but only after full and open consultation with the interested parties. Among its suggestions, the Commission is promising to look at how to eliminate obstacles to EU-wide protection of intellectual and industrial property; to examine how to improve the legal framework for companies which set up in several EU countries; and to produce, by the end of next year, proposals for a definitive system of value added tax, and for the elimination of double taxation on companies. The Commission also pledges to publish during 1994 measures to lighten the administrative burden on small companies and to improve after-sales service for cross-border shoppers. Separately, the Commission is promising a green paper on how to co-ordinate EU legislation on advertising, marketing and sponsorship. Finally, the Commission is to look in detail at how to encourage private investment in trans-European networks, the extensive and expensive telecoms, energy and transport infrastructure projects backed by last week's summit. For certain groups - including consumer associations and the European Parliament - the strategic programme may not be tough enough. It promises much reflection, and little immediate legislative action. Its more ambitious proposals, such as continuing liberalisation of energy monopolies, can be easily diluted or blocked by member states. But the Commission does not want to be tough for the sake of it. The strategic programme describes itself modestly as a 'road-map' of the future development of the barrier-free Europe. Like most maps, it is not a thrilling read. Unlike most maps, many of the routes which it describes have yet to be built. But the programme should be worth keeping in the glove compartment, if only to measure the Commission and the Union's progress in achieving some tough goals over the next two to three years.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Institutions' confidence rises - Surveys show that equities expected to remain stable or rise INSTITUTIONAL investors are expressing overwhelming confidence in the stock market, according to two surveys published yesterday. Godwins, the actuarial consulting company, in its monthly survey of investment attitudes, has found that 98 per cent of investment managers surveyed expected UK equities to either remain stable or rise during the next 12 months. Minet Consultancy, the independent financial advisers, found that its own Investor Confidence index at the end of December 1992 was the highest since the index was first compiled in December 1987. The index had surged 60 per cent to a peak of 152.5 from the previous figure of 95.1 at the end of September. The Minet index is compiled from an analysis of the liquidity positions of 12 large life insurance and pension fund managers. The average cash holding of the firms surveyed fell to 2.96 per cent at the end of December, compared with 4.74 per cent three months earlier. The range of cash holdings, not including those who normally hold very little cash, ranged from 0.9 per cent at Abbey Life to Legal &amp; General's 5.8 per cent. Mr Ian Chalmers of Minet, who compiles the index, said that while institutions had been responsible for driving up the market, their present low liquidity levels meant that future gains in stock prices were likely to have to come from private investors. One source of fresh funds into the stock market could be the equity investment products with capital protection features now being marketed aggressively by building societies to their own depositors, Mr Chalmers said. The Godwins 'Cityscope' survey found that overall, institutions were far more optimistic about the economy's prospects over the next 12 months than they were even a month ago. Two-thirds of those surveyed said they expected conditions to improve, up from 44 per cent in December, while 85 per cent said they expected the prospects for corporate earnings to improve over the next year, up from 71 per cent. In foreign markets, UK institutions were showing less confidence in the US stock markets, with 74 per cent of those surveyed expecting a rise from present levels. In December the figure had been 85 per cent. But Europe was looking more attractive with 82 per cent of those surveyed expecting equities prices to rise, compared with 70 per cent.</p>

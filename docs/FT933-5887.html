			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Arts: Bill T. Jones dance - Edinburgh SUPERFICIALLY, the American dancer-choreographer Bill T. Jones has plenty going for him. He has striking stage presence; great good looks; he can present a programme of five works in largely different moods; his company includes dancers black and white, slim and obese; his choice of music includes classical, jazz, minimalist; his dance vocabulary, includes chunks of ballet, medieval and various modern styles; he has women partnering men; and men partnering men too. But Jones's work does not show you the catholic, liberal, inclusive world view that the above would suggest. For all his magpie mix of dance material, dance is not the point of his choreography. From the time of Jones's first London appearance (1981), right through to this last weekend in Edinburgh, it has been clear that his work is all about attitudinising. OK, some of the attitudes that Jones &amp; Co strike could not be more politically correct - pro-gay, anti-racist, etc. But they are designed simply to win applause. By 'attitudinising', I mean that Jones is, literally and metaphorically, a poser. See, for example, his own big solo, Last Night on Earth , where (dressed in only his underpants, the better to show you his famously gorgeous physique) he delivers signs and poses in monotonously bash-bash patterns - and then explains to you what he thinks the signs and poses mean. Though Bill T. has severe limitations as a dancer, he gives himself such guarded exposure that you may well not notice that his phrasing is monotonously harsh, that he lacks the strength to sustain a shape in the air while jumping, that he cannot support leg extensions from the centre of his body. In his fellow-dancers, however, these and other failings are grossly apparent. He gives them whole wodges of rigorous Cunningham technique (in Fete), and delicate, fiddly, balletic petits battements (in D-Man in the Waters), and anyone can see that rigour and delicacy are what they lack - that these dancers cannot do these steps with any true precision. The point, I guess, is that Jones wants his troupe to look loveably fallible. Hey, if we want to do Cunningham technique or petits battements, if our fattest obese dancer wants to try jumping in grand jete, then why not go ahead? This would be less creepy if Jones dared to present himself that way too. Yet his co-dancers enjoy failing. In D-Man in the Waters, which is set to Mendelssohn's wonderful octet, they get so out of hand that they talk, laugh and finally yell at each other over the music. Nor have I ever seen an American dance company (not even Lar Lubovich's troupe) employ so much facial mugging. You can make weak dancers still dance seriously if you give them real phrasing, but Jones prefers to have them pull facial expressions at the audience, cueing us how to react. Need I go on with this catalogue? I have loathed everything I have ever seen Jones &amp; Co. do. La danse, c'est une question morale, said Balanchine; and I find Bill T. Jones &amp; Co. morally repugnant.</p>

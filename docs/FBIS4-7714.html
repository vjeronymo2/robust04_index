			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 4 April (Tanjug) -- President of the  Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic and Srpska republic army Chief  of General Staff Major General Manojlo Milovanovic received the  UNPROFOR commander for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Britain's  General Michael Rose, in Pale today.    Their talks focused on the obligations of the Srpska army  and  UNPROFOR; General Milovanovic and Rose made press statements  following the talks.    "We met today to improve the initiated peace process on the  territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. We discussed many  issues including obligations for the army of the Srpska republic  as regards the peace process, but also UNPROFOR obligations in  the restoration of peace in this area", Milovanovic said.    "We also had talks on the so-called safe areas and the  obligations that UNPROFOR has to fulfill in Srebrenica and Zepa.  We dwelt on the problem of Gorazde, which is also one of the  safe areas according to UN Security Council resolutions,"  Milovanovic said.    He stressed that they also discussed the issue of Sarajevo  as  regards building on what was agreed on 9 February, saying that  the implementation of the agreement was proceeding well.    General Rose said that at the meeting today they discussed  the principles of defining the territories and borders of the  safe areas. Commenting on the situation around Gorazde, Rose  said that reports coming from that area were scanty, but he  thought that there had been no important changes on the ground.    "We must not rely on media reports alone, CNN for instance.  Military observers are on the spot, and I agreed with General  Milovanovic that I should go to Gorazde on Wednesday [6 April]  and see for myself what is really happening there", Rose said.    Their meeting was also attended by the speaker of the  people's assembly of the Srpska republic, Momcilo Krajisnik, and  vice president of the Srpska republic Nikola Koljevic.</p>

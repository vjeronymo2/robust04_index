			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (13): Fleet renewal may need foreign capital - Domestic taxation is causing distress signals among shipowners Norway is one of the few nations that can boast a long maritime tradition, but the industry is undergoing the kind of restructuring not experienced since the 1970s. Maritime activities account for 15 per cent of gross exports, making shipping the country's third biggest export industry, and employs 61,000 people. The maritime environment consists of everything from shipowners to brokers, shipyards, ship classification, maritime research, design and engineering, specialised law firms and banks geared towards ship-financing. The country's insurers and underwriters form the second biggest marine insurance markets in the world, after London. Last year gross freight revenue for the Norwegian-controlled merchant fleet, the fourth largest in the world, rose to an estimated NKr45bn from NKr42bn in 1992, after hitting NKr50bn in 1991. Even the shipping sub-index on the Oslo bourse is recognised as one of the most comprehensive shipping lists in the world, consisting of 38 foreign and domestic shipping companies with a combined market capitalisation of around NKr35bn. After a period of difficult market conditions, the shipowners are cautiously optimistic about prospects for 1994. According to RS Platou Shipbrokers there was an improvement in tonnage balance in 1993 - despite disappointingly weak growth of OECD countries - thanks to strong economic expansion in China and massive oil stock building. 'Without these two components, tonnage balance would most likely have deteriorated with falling freight rates and ship values as the consequence. Instead, there was a moderate increase in freight rates,' according to Platou. Platou says that, given the uncertainties of economic development, the over-dimensioned shipbuilding industry and a life span of the fleet built in the 1970s that is constantly being extended, the potential for the dynamics on the supply side of shipping are enormous. 'This environment generates a more unpredictable and more exciting market structure than perhaps ever before,' the Olso-based shipbroker believes. Given the uncertainty over markets and increased competitive nature of the industry, Norway's shipowners argue that the domestic tax regime is forcing them to resort to flags of convenience and is inhibiting renewal of the fleet. The shipowners that stay in Norway are forced to seek foreign capital, causing the ownership structure of the shipping firms to change dramatically as the internationalisation process picks up momentum. If this development continues, Norway's maritime environment may be in danger of becoming a historical reference if shipowners follow through on threats to relocate elsewhere in the world in the pursuit of taxation regimes which do not undermine competitiveness. Seven years ago, Norway's shipping industry experienced a major revival with the establishment of the Norwegian International Ship register (NIS) which worked as an explosive catalyst for attracting Norwegian ships back to a Norwegian flag. According Mr Ole Jacob Libaek, chairman of Oslo shipbroker O-J Libaek &amp; Partners: 'It was the first positive signal ever for Norwegian shipping of acceptance by Norwegian society and politicians.' The primary reason for the establishment of NIS was to stop the flood of Norwegian owners to the flag-of-convenience or 'open registers' such as Bermuda and Panama by offering broadly similar savings on crew costs. Just before NIS was established, the fleet sailing under the Norwegian flag had dwindled to around 9m deadweight tonnes (dwt). The NIS register peaked three years ago when it became the register of choice for 917 ships comprising 40.6m (dwt). By this year, the NIS fleet had, however, been reduced to 790 ships of 33.3m dwt. Mr Libaek believes that the success of NIS, in spite of uninspiring global market conditions, led to the 1992 tax reform, the timing of which could not have been worse because it coincided with a new global recession. Under the previous tax regime, shipowners had up to eight years to reinvest profits. Almost overnight taxes for investors buying second-hand tonnage became payable 'up front'. Needless to say, the second-hand market all but disappeared, shutting off an important source of risk capital needed by shipowners. Consequently, according to Mr Libaek, only a doubling or tripling of ship values could rescue Norwegian shipping. The market never improved to the extent that this was to happen, and the new tax law therefore led to a new depletion of the Norwegian fleet with sales abroad - mostly to the Greeks - becoming the order of the day. The Norwegian Shipowners Association (NSA) estimates domestic shipowners need to raise between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 30bn over the next decade to maintain their 10 per cent share of the world fleet and to finance fleet renewal. By comparison, the current market value of the Norwegian owned fleet is about Dollars 17bn. Mr Rolf Westfal-Larsen, a former NSA president, estimates Norwegian shipowners must earn at least 25 per cent more than their competitors in order to accumulate the capital needed to renew the fleet. The average age of the Norwegian owned fleet is around 13 years - younger than the world average - but there is nevertheless the need for renewal. 'Norway's shipping industry is in a period of transition. Although a number of shipowners are optimistic about the future, a question nevertheless remains over where activities will be conducted in future. This is a result of Norway's corporate tax structure and the pressures of globalisation. The taxation issue probably would not have become so important an issue were it not for the need to renew the fleet,' said Mr Rolf Saether, managing director of the NSA. Mr Saether believes the 'right' corporation tax could lead to a new revival of the industry. 'What we need is the possibility to reinvest profits in new tonnage without being penalised by taxes. This would help the industry enormously and this change is needed urgently. Norway's 28 per cent corporate tax is still far above that of our competitors,' he argues.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hanan 'Ashrawi by unidentified </F> correspondent in Rome; date not given: "Green Light for Italian  Observers in Hebron" -- first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA  introduction]    [Text] Rome -- The cabinet yesterday approved an executive  order concerning Italy's participation in the peace mission to  Hebron on the West Bank. Italy will send 35 soldiers to the  town as observers.    Speaking over the phone, Doctor Hanan 'Ashrawi, a lecturer  at  the Palestinian University of Bir-Zeit [as published], known to  the general public as the spokesperson for the PLO delegation in  the peace negotiations and currently committed to defending  human rights, was skeptical about the role and effectiveness of  the 100 or so Norwegian, Danish, and Italian observers who,  unarmed, will safeguard the rights of Palestinians in Hebron for  the next three months. The PLO asked for these observers to be  sent in the wake of Hebron mosque massacre on 25 February, when  30 Palestinians were killed.    [Correspondent] How do you view the arrival in Hebron of the  foreign observers?    ['Ashrawi] Their presence is purely symbolic and formal.  Operationally, they serve no purpose. They are few in number  and their role is limited. They cannot monitor all the places  where there is a potential for flare-ups between Palestinians,  Jewish settlers, and the army. Besides, it is a partial  solution given that similar conflicts exist in the rest of the  occupied territories.    [Correspondent] What is the Palestinian reaction to the  suicide attacks carried out by Hamas? Do you fear for the peace  process?    ['Ashrawi] Clearly, the peace process is resting on a knife  edge after these attacks. We, the Palestinians, are a people  who are aware of reality and the political side of things. We  condemn the killing of innocent people, but the Israeli deaths  are set against the general background of the violence that is  taking hold in the occupied territories. The Israeli victims  must be viewed in the context of attacks and reprisals that have  also led to dozens of deaths among the Palestinians. They are  also a consequence of the slowdown in negotiations which, on the  contrary, must be accelerated if we are to achieve autonomy.    [Correspondent] What do the majority of Palestinians think  of  Hamas? Do you think that public support for the PLO and its  leader, Yasir 'Arafat, is waning?    ['Ashrawi] You would have to carry out an opinion poll. My  personal impression is that the credibility of the PLO and  'Arafat's prestige have been eroded, and similarly I believe  that people are losing confidence in the peace process.</p>

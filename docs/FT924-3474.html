			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Nuclear Electric is hopeful on profits NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned generator, is on course to make a profit without help from the nuclear levy, Mr John Collier, its chairman, said yesterday. Reporting the latest six-monthly results, he said the company 'has been able to point to clear evidence that we are making nuclear power in this country a commercial success'. The results come as the company is fighting suggestions that it should be cut back to make more room in the energy market for coal. The row over pit closures and the government review of energy policy have raised questions about the level of the nuclear levy. In the six months to September, the company made an operating profit of Pounds 255m, an increase of 21 per cent. That included Pounds 632m from the levy on electricity bills to help finance decommissioning costs. Removal of the Pounds 1.2bn-a-year subsidy to the nuclear industry and the sale of coal stockpiles at below market prices were advocated yesterday by the Liberal Democrats in their response to the government's review.</p>

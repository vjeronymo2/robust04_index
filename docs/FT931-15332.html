			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Savimbi prepares for battle MR Jonas Savimbi's Unita rebel movement was yesterday massing troops near four Angolan cities to counter-attack a government offensive, diplomats said, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. A government communique said Mr Savimbi had fled his headquarters in Huambo for an unknown destination. Angolan state radio said Mr Savimbi was in Zaire. But the rebel leader told Portugal's TSF radio he was still in Huambo. He offered to meet Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in Geneva for talks as suggested by UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali. The government communique said Unita forces were grouping near the coastal cities of Lubito and Benguela and the provincial capitals of Lubango and Cuito in central and southern Angola. A western diplomat said Unita's aim now was to launch counter-attacks against government troops after its forces were forced to withdraw from Huambo. He said Unita was also massing around Huambo, despite Mr Savimbi's declaration it was still in Unita hands, and Luena, capital of the western province of Moxico. There was considerable confusion over events in central and southern Angola, with each side contradicting the other in reports of fighting. Angolan rebels have destroyed five oil wells owned by Fina Oil, Angola's state-run radio said in a report monitored by the BBC.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Premafin shares hit by warning of losses SHARES in Premafin, the Italian holding company controlled by property magnate Mr Salvatore Ligresti, fell by more than 8 per cent following the forecast of heavy 1992 losses and a big rights issue. The group announced the promotion to executive deputy chairman of Mr Giorgio Cefis, a former Morgan Grenfell banker, and the appointment of Mr Carlo Ciani, managing director of the Coin department stores chain and previously with Mediobanca, as executive deputy chairman of Mr Ligresti's privately-owned Nuova Finanziaria Moderna holding company. Premafin's shares plunged to L4,330 from L4,685 on Tuesday as investors digested the group's L294bn (Dollars 185.4m) rights issue and expected 1992 loss of L50bn. In 1991, the company made net profits of L61.9bn. The group will not pay a dividend this year and plans a three-for-one rights issue at L1,000 a share. Mr Ligresti, who owns 70 per cent of the group, will take up his full rights. The fortunes of Premafin, which controls Sai (insurance) and Grassetto (building), have suffered from debts of about L1,500bn, the downturn in construction as a result of the political corruption scandal and weak property markets. Matters have been exacerbated by doubts about Mr Ligresti's future. The Sicilian financier spent more than three months in jail last year on charges of alleged bribery and corruption. The Ligresti group is to re-organise other parts of its business, with the concentration under the non-quoted Nuova Finanziaria Moderna holding company of activities previously held under the Fin. G. It holding company and other subsidiaries. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Italian Treasury-owned bank, saw a 17.1 per cent rise in consolidated group profits to L96bn last year from L82bn in 1991. Assets rose 13.6 per cent to L163,341bn.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Bekker: "Boris Fedorov Tortures Central Bank </F> in the English Manner"]    [Text]  <H5>  Central Bank Will Not Refuse To Keep an Eye on Commercial </H5> Banks    The Duma Subcommittee on Policy and Activity of the Central  Bank held a second round of hearings on the operation of the  Central Bank. Their initiator, Boris Fedorov, as agreed with  Viktor Gerashchenko, intends meeting with heads of various  Central Bank departments during the summer in order to, in the  words of the subcommittee chairman, "obtain as much information  as possible" about the bank. Twice a week Room 838 in the State  Duma will turn into "a torture chamber," when the dialogue  between Russian deputies and the bankers will take place in the  rigid fashion of the British parliament. No reports, only  questions and answers. "We are not going into discussions," Mr.  Fedorov observed, as if underscoring a strictly practical  interest, free of confrontation. The final outcome of the  meetings is seen by him to be the compilation of a full  shorthand record and elaboration of practical recommendations on  the development of the banking business in the country.    At yesterday's hearings the principal respondents were  Dmitriy Tulin, deputy chairman of the Central Bank, and Nadezhda  Ivanova, deputy chairman of the Department of Banking  Supervision. That department engages in the licensing of banking  operations, analysis of bank reporting procedures, elaboration  of standards, supervision of banks to prevent bankruptcy,  preparation of clearing operations, and liquidation of  commercial banks. The last function was defined by Mr. Tulin as  "not peculiar to the Central Bank," explaining its necessity as  being due to the transition period and the establishment of a  new banking order. Work on perfection of the taxation system was  also mentioned by the deputy chairman of the Central Bank as  being outside the operational profile of the Central Bank.    Issuance of licenses is considered to be the main task of  the  main bank. At the local level the main administrations of the  Central Bank appear as their issuers. According to the  assurances of Mrs. Ivanova, territorial administrations do not  abuse their right, and refuse licenses for commercial banks only  in rare cases, limited by law. As Mr. Tulin added, the laws of  the Russian Federation do not allow rejection of a candidate for  the post of chairman of a commercial bank. Even though there are  Central Bank methodological instructions on the evaluation of  professional qualities, neither they, nor the term of three  months allowed for confirmation, permit the revelation of all  there is to know about a manager, who, as Boris Fedorov said,  could have a record of "two defunct banks and theft of  customers' money."    The Central Bank, of course, is not completely defenseless.  In 1993 it used its right and canceled licenses of 19 commercial  banks, while this year licenses were taken away from 21  commercial banks. In addition to its own criteria for steep  measures, the Central Bank also responds to requests from  customs and tax services. It is true that the Central Bank does  not work logically in this case either and tries not to cancel a  license until a decision is reached by an arbitration court  regarding bankruptcy, while the court needs a license  cancellation in order to recognize bankruptcy. The Central Bank  does break this closed circle, but according to Mrs. Ivanova,  "orders concerning the closing of banks are strictly individual."    In order to avoid such an extreme outcome the Central Bank  worked out a number of norms for the commercial banks. One of  the risk limits is determined by the norm of capital  sufficiency. Evaluative indices of current and long-term  liquidity and maximum amount of risk per borrower are outdated  and will probably be repealed. But as of last year the open  currency position is being restricted, and a standard was  introduced limiting the investment of their own capital by  commercial banks in the charter funds of other commercial  organizations--a limit of 10 percent exists for capital invested  in one enterprise, and 50 percent "for the entire circle" of  firms. In the opinion of Mr. Tulin, "Banking supervision earns  no laurels for the Central Bank," inasmuch as it makes up 90  percent of the load. But "it is not yet time" to remove that  burden. Despite the existing conflicts with commercial banks  "we, like no one else, understand their problems and are helping  to protect their interests," concluded the deputy chairman of  the Central Bank.    That debate developed in connection with proposals to  withdraw the Department of Banking Supervision from the  structure of the Central Bank. Similar discussions, by the way,  are under way in the United States with respect to the Federal  Reserve System. Konstantin Lubenchenko, director of the Legal  Department, is convinced that in Russia such a "divorce" is at  the very least premature inasmuch as "only the Central Bank has  at its disposal all the information on operations being  conducted by the commercial banks." He also cited the following  fact to prove his point: According to the International Monetary  Fund, banking supervision services "are included" within the  structure of their national banks in 80 percent of the countries.    Confirming the thesis of Mr. Tulin concerning protection of  the interests of commercial banks by the Central Bank, Mrs.  Ivanova said that "it is necessary to change the entire order of  their taxation." According to her, banks are currently paying  around 30 forms of taxes and the ratio of payments to net profit  amounts to 58 percent, which is "excessively high." "Commercial  banks lack the profits to create reserves for covering shaky  credit, and that could lead to the collapse of the entire  banking system", declared the deputy chairman of the department.  She also said that proposals calling for a review of the  commercial bank taxation system were forwarded to the Federation  Council.</p>

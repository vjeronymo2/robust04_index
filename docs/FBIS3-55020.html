The continuing story of Lithuanian oil terminal construction  proves that Lithuania's energy system is still dependent on  other countries, he said.    Landsbergis said energy prices in Estonia are going down  because it imports fuel from the West, while Lithuania makes up  the "Lucoil myth" to justify the absence of alternative fuel  sources.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / French fingers crossed as the economy shows signs of revival FRANCE'S economy minister is cautiously optimistic. Despite the steady rise in unemployment the French economy is beginning to show signs of revival from one of the deepest recessions since the second world war. 'It is clear that take-off has still to take place,' says Mr Edmond Alphandery. 'But the economic climate is moving in the right direction.' He bases his view on a series of statistics released over the past 10 days showing encouraging trends from industrial production to exports to consumer spending. The figures lend weight to Mr Alphandery's argument that the economy has stabilised after a sharp contraction which set in at the end of last year. But the big question is whether the improvement in economic indicators is sustainable, and whether it is strong enough to lift the economy from its slump. The biggest surprise in the latest batch of data has been consumption, the Achilles heel of the economy in the first six months of 1992, but which rose by 2.1 per cent in the third quarter over the second. 'The pattern of consumption was stronger than had been expected,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Bros. Most economists had forecast that an increase in social security contributions which took effect in July together with a rise in indirect taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and petrol, would persuade consumers to keep their hands in their pockets. Industrial production, too, has been stronger than forecast. In July and August, lumped together because of the relatively quiet holiday period, it rose by 1.3 per cent over June. A survey of French business leaders by Insee, the national economics institute, revealed confidence that production at their companies had also increased in October. On the international front, French industry is resisting the effects of recession in many of its principal markets and the increased competitiveness of rivals in Britain, Italy and Spain, which have benefited from currency depreciation. Trade statistics announced last Friday showed a surplus of FFr10.4bn (Pounds 1.21bn) in July, including a surplus of FFr4bn with EC trading partners. Total exports in the month amounted to FFr96.8bn, compared with FFr94.9bn in June. 'If you take all these indicators together, the effect is encouraging,' says one merchant bank economist. 'But I wouldn't open the champagne yet.' The French government is similarly guarded. 'The economy is ripe for recovery,' said Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, last week. 'But it is better to err on the side of caution than be too optimistic.' Such caution is justified by the uncertain prospects for the current quarter. Economists are divided about whether the improved indicators will be repeated or whether they are merely a blip. Salomon Bros' Mr Mercier believes a double dip recession, with a contraction in the fourth quarter, remains a possibility. He expects gross domestic product to expand by just 0.5-0.6 per cent next year; the government is forecasting 1.4 per cent growth. Some economists are more optimistic. Mr Robin Hubbard at Paribas Capital Markets, for example, thinks a 1.5 per cent rise in GDP next year is 'eminently feasible'. The principal factors in the economy's performance over the next quarter are likely to be the strength of consumer spending and exports. According to the optimistic scenario, household consumption will be sustained by a rise in real disposable income and a fall in the savings ratio. This view is supported by the low level of inflation and the rise in labour productivity, increasing by about 2 per cent per annum, and by the historically low level of interest rates which reduce the incentive to save. Such forecasts, however, are weakened by the continued impact of the rise in unemployment. In addition to reducing disposable incomes among the proportion of the population with the largest propensity to consume, the prospect of joblessness has a powerful psychological effect on spending. With unemployment forecast to breach 12 per cent by the end of this year and to continue to rise through the first quarter of 1994, any recovery will be constrained. On the external front, exports will be boosted by the weakening of the franc, on a trade-weighted basis, since the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism in the summer. But recession in Germany, France's largest trading partner, and the slow pace of recovery in the UK and US will continue to depress international demand for French goods. The overall result is likely to mean a gradual but fragile rise from recession. It is unlikely to mean a shift from existing economic policies. French economic officials argue that the benefits of a strong franc policy are evident in the competitiveness of industry and are illustrated by the latest trade figures. An aggressive cut in short-term interest rates now, they claim, would simply raise long term borrowing costs. This would threaten, rather than nurture, the first shoots of recovery.</p>

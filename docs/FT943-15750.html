			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (10): Conflict is giving way to conciliation  -Trade unions St Valentine's Day this year was the tenth anniversary of measures that reduced the monthly cost of living allowance by about L27,000. As well as hitting pay packets, the modification of the scala mobile (escalator) indexation mechanism in 1984 also fractured relations between Italy's three main trade unions: CGIL, CISL and UIL. It was the end of an era in which labour always seemed united, organised and ready for the frontline. Flames of worker solidarity and trade union power now seem to flicker rather less brightly than in the 1960s and 1970s. Action is rarer, both in the workplace and on the streets. 'Clashes at Fiat in the 1970s were the high point,' says Mr Stefano Micossi, head of the research department at Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation. He notes, however, that difficulties in public sector labour relations peaked more recently, at the end of the 1980s. As the present decade reaches its mid-point, there appears to be a different, easier climate. 'Attitudes at Confindustria have changed in several important respects. There has been a softening, and this has allowed us to discuss and do many things with the trade unions,' claims Mr Micossi. Mr Bruno Trentin, who has just retired as general secretary of the leftwing CGIL, notes that there is a desire to avoid conflict. But he seeks to deflect charges that his trade union has sold out. 'There is confrontation, but it is well-behaved.' And tensions still run high in some sectors. Mr Trentin reports difficulties in dealing with Confindustria's affiliated associations that represent small and medium-sized enterprises, Confapi, and construction companies, Ance, and also with the agricultural employers. However, conflict has generally given way to conciliation. Mr Sergio D'Antoni, general secretary of the centre-right CISL trade union (linked to the former Christian Democrat party), talks about reaching understandings with employers' organisations. 'It is the best way of safeguarding workers' interests,' he affirms. Last July's labour agreement, reached under the Ciampi government, illustrates what the dialogue during the early 1990s has achieved. First, the agreement contains a framework for incomes policy. Formal consultations between government, labour and employers are to be held twice a year, before economic policy measures are decided. Trade unions and employers have undertaken to act consistently with the objectives set as a result of the consultations. Second, it lays down a new structure for collective bargaining, industry-wide contracts at national level and local negotiations having different timings, procedures and bargaining items. Trade union representation at company level has been redesigned and mechanisms introduced for cooling off disputes. 'This new system of industrial relations is very important,' says Mr Micossi, who considers that labour's agreement is evidence of realism. 'Wage bargaining is much simplified, with only two negotiating levels and a four-year contract period. National contracts are under negotiation this year and next, and local contracts will follow in 1996 and 1997,' he explains. Enthusiasm for last year's agreement is not one-sided. 'It was a great step forward, establishing a single system across the board, including the public sector, and creating a new approach to trade union representation at plant level,' says CGIL's Mr Trentin. Are there dangers that the new bargaining structure and the economic upturn now under way will cause inflationary wage settlements? With the complete abolition of the scala mobile mechanism in July 1992, wage indexation is no longer the inflationary element that caused damage in the past. Wage inflation, if it occurs, will arise from agreements at national and local levels. Confindustria's Mr Micossi is optimistic. 'Industrial relations are good and the trade unions are reasonable. We do not foresee an imminent return of wage inflation. There is no possibility of real wage increases before 1996.' The industrialists' confederation is concerned, however, about wage drift in the public sector. The CGIL also considers that risks of wage inflation are low, though inflationary seeds may be taking root. Mr Trentin notes that the purchasing power of workers' pay packets has declined over the past two years. 'The problem lies in the retail sector. Even with falling factory gate prices, shop prices increased.' However, the latest statistics show that inflation is at its lowest in 25 years. Trade union attention is focused most on unemployment, and there is awareness that moderation on wage claims can help job creation. Moderation is one of several new words that have broadened the vocabulary of Italian labour relations over recent years. Flexibility is another. 'Modern trade unions must be open and flexible,' says CISL's Mr D'Antoni. He believes that flexibility on working hours should be used more widely as a means of creating employment. 'Employers have dragged their feet on this,' he alleges. Mr D'Antoni warns that employees' rights must be protected. And he says that increased flexibility of existing workforces must not lead to fewer or temporary jobs, but to stable new employment. 'We do not make a demon of flexibility. But it needs to be managed carefully. Old certainties must be replaced by new certainties, not by uncertainty. A fundamental principle, won after a long fight, is that equal work should be rewarded by equal pay,' says Mr Trentin at CGIL. With youth unemployment a serious problem, one of the issues under discussion is starting wages. Mr Trentin says that the CGIL does not oppose differentials for young people, provided that their pay packets are adjusted when their skill levels and productivity reach those of older workers. Another issue is the south, where unemployment is twice the national rate. One proposal to deal with this problem is a north-south differential (gabbie salariali - wage cages), with lower southern pay packets to encourage the creation of jobs. 'It was tried before, and does not work,' says Mr Trentin, who adds that differentials exist in practice as many employers in the south disregard national wage agreements. Italy's high jobless figure has had an impact on trade union membership. The CGIL's working membership has fallen significantly: last year it was 2.5m against 3.6m in 1977 and 3.1m in 1983. Indeed, the number of pensioner CGIL members last year (2.7m) exceeded those in employment. The other two confederate trade unions (CISL and the centre-left UIL) have also experienced ageing in their ranks, though not as marked as the CGIL. This partly reflects corporatist consensus-seeking that is strong in the conservative and Catholic parts of Italy's trade union movement. 'We must be involved in policy choices. This important role for trade unions is in the interests of those in work,' says Mr D'Antoni. Have Italy's trade unions lost their way or the will to fight that they showed in the 1960s and 1970s? Certainly the situation is different from the time when Luciano Lama headed the CGIL and Mr Trentin led the heavy brigade of its engineering section, the metalmeccanici, with fraternal backing from CISL's and UIL's engineers. However, Mr D'Antoni believes the need for trade unionism and support for it from workers remain intact. As the trade unions come to terms with a rapidly evolving economy and the radical changes in Italian politics, a major development is in sight for them. Ten years after the split on the scala mobile, the prospects of unification seem bright. 'CISL's doubts and reservations have lessened considerably,' says Mr D'Antoni. And CGIL wants to accelerate the unification process. 'There has been great progress in relations, and there will be a joint congress of the three confederate trade unions at the end of this year. Next year offers prospects of unification,' says Mr Trentin.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Union membership (in millions)*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              WORKING          PENSIONERS          TOTAL  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Union     1983     1993     1983     1993     1983     1993 CGIL       3.1      2.5      1.4      2.7      4.5      5.2 CISL       2.4      2.2      0.6      1.5      3.0      3.7 UIL        1.2      1.2      0.1      0.5      1.3      1.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Membership of confederate trade unions Source: CISL  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

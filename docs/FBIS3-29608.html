Existing plans call for the government to invest 430  trillion  yen in public works in the period.    The sources said the proposed increase in public works  spending is intended to appease the U.S. tension has been rising  between the two countries following the breakdown of the  bilateral framework trade talks earlier this month.    The increased investment would help expand Japan's  infrastructure, such as national communications networks,  housing and parks, boost domestic economic demand and cut  Japan's chronic current-account surplus with the U.S., the  sources said.    In the framework talks, Japan had pledged efforts to sharply  reduce the surplus in the medium term.    The government had earlier said it would announce next month  a voluntary four-point program for cutting the surplus and  opening its markets to imports.    But that and other programs announced in the past would not  be enough to satisfy the U.S. Government, the sources said.    An advisory panel for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the  Council for Economic Restructuring, called in December for an  expansion of the public works investment program, and Hosokawa  himself told a new year's news conference he agreed with the  proposal.</p>

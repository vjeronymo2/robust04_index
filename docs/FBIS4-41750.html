			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1620 GMT on 27 June carries in its "Details" program  an 8-minute recorded interview with Viktor Gerashchenko,  chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, conducted by anchorman  Nikolay Svanidze.    Asked to comment on the present priorities of the Ministry  of  Finance, Gerashchenko says: "The Ministry of Finance will have  to be rather strict in its budget spending and to allocate  credits only to those industries whose survival -- with help or  subsidies from the state -- is dictated precisely by state  interests."    Asked to qualify the financial policy carried out at present  by the Central Bank, Gerashchenko says: "Well, first of all,  there must be a certain degree of firmness in the light of the  constant barrage of requests from various industries, who  sometimes stick to old habits and keep on asking for money from  both the government and the Central Bank. At the same time we  must be aware that in certain instances there are industries  which must be supported by our economic policy, and that it  would be unwise for us to leave our traditional distribution  markets in both near abroad and other countries. This requires  certain measures of encouragement, the introduction of certain  protectionist measures or subsidies.    "The Directors' Council took a decision as early as last  year  to limit to 12 percent the share of foreign capital within the  capital of commercial banks operating on the Russian territory.  Certain protectionism is needed here."    Asked how the bank's policy corresponds to the presidential  edict, Gerashchenko says: "Completely."    The program concludes with a lengthy comment by Nikolay  Svanidze on the need for a certain cohesion between the bank's  "elegant" financial policy and the elegance of its premises.  The bank is now in the process of a complete revamp of its  so-called small conference room in an "imperial epic style".  Painter Ilya Glazunov has been approached and he proposed to  paint a huge portrait of Czar Aleksandr II signing a decree on  the establishment of the Central Bank of Russia. The bank had  its doubts and has backed off from the project.</p>

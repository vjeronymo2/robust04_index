			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Adams squares up for US campaign: Unionists outraged at decision to grant travel visa Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, will today turn his back on the furious row which has erupted over his visit to the United States and launch a concerted 48-hour campaign to press home the republican case for a political settlement in Northern Ireland. The US decision to grant Mr Adams a visa was met with outrage by unionists in the province, who warned that the Sinn Fein leader would fully exploit the visit for propaganda purposes. Some Ulster politicians now expect Mr Adams to use his visit to hold out the prospect of a temporary ceasefire by the IRA in order to extract maximum publicity from his short trip and to cast Sinn Fein as the peacemakers. British government sources in Northern Ireland, however, made it clear that any such gesture would be regarded as meaningless and that only a full renunciation of violence and a permanent ceasefire would help the peace process move forward. But the decision was given a cautious welcome by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said the visit was acceptable if it helped bring closer the prospect of peace. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and representatives of the Alliance party are also expected to attend today's conference called by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy. Unionists said the decision meant the US had relinquished any right to act as an intermediary in any efforts to bring peace to the province. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party, accused the US administration of 'kow-towing' to the Boston Irish lobby. He will meet Mr Ray Seitz, the US ambassador in London, later this week to discuss the US decision. Mr Jim Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, accused the Clinton administration of 'presidential wobbling'. But Mr Adams claimed the decision to grant him a visa would advance the entire peace process in Northern Ireland. Before leaving for New York he said he thought the US could play an influential role in resolving the Ulster conflict. 'They can encourage the British without taking sides, and move the situation on,' he said. Asked whether he now renounced violence - one of the stipulations originally laid down for a visa - Mr Adams replied: 'My attitude is quite simple and straightforward - I want an end to violence.'</p>

The formal signing will be Kuala Lumpur in  the middle of July after they have received approval at a  special municipal assembly session at the end of June. With  prospects good for securing the raw material, the city will  start on construction of a receiving base in Sendai harbor,  aiming at introduction of LNG in 1997.    The details of the "confirmation of intent" that will be the  premise of the sales contract agreed between Sendai city and  Malaysia LNG are 1) the contract period will be for a 20-year  period beginning in 1997, and the total import amount will be  2.9 million tons; 2) Malaysia LNG will build a special tanker  and Sendai city will assume the obligation for that; and 3) the  place for transfer of the LNG will be the base in Sendai harbor.

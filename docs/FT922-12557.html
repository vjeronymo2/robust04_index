			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Boost in business spending forecast BUSINESS confidence has been enhanced by the result of the general election, members of the Finance &amp; Leasing Association said yesterday, David Barchard writes. Mr Tony Mallin, association vice-president, said: 'Members are encouraged by the results of the general election. The return of a strong, stable government should mean that businesses will now feel able to commit themselves to positive investment decisions.' The latest internal economic survey among association members, which account for more than 30 per cent of UK fixed investment, predicts that companies will now be willing to invest more. The association's optimism contrasts with a poor performance by the leasing and business finance sectors last year. The association says that leasing business fell by 1 per cent to Pounds 10.2bn, while other forms of business lending were down by 26 per cent at Pounds 4.3bn. Investment in plant and equipment was down 10 per cent in cash terms. Several sectors which did badly last year, however, say they expect an increase in business volumes in the next three months. Motor finance business is expected to do better in this quarter by more than 70 per cent of members, and about half believe there will be an improvement in the Pounds 1m to Pounds 5m range of lease and hire-purchase business.</p>

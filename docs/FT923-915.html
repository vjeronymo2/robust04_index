			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Norman Hay turns in Pounds 393,000 deficit Despite directors' 'best efforts to contain losses', Norman Hay, the engineering group, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 393,000 for the six months to end-June. The outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 85,000 last time and with a loss of Pounds 2.16m at the December year end. Turnover fell to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 5.56m). The company said the loss had resulted from difficulties encountered in combining its Heathrow operations with the Coventry businesses during 'the most prolonged and severe recession in living memory'. Directors added that they were unable to view the economic outlook for the country with any degree of optimism and expected the loss reported to increase for the full year. Losses per share came out at 1.8p (earnings 0.4p). The directors consider it imprudent to pay an interim dividend - 0.5p was paid last year - but said they would review the circumstances at the year end.</p>

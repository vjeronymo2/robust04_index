			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Poll where parties count for nothing: The Peruvian president's campaign for re-election President Alberto Fujimori of Peru is expected to declare within a few days his candidacy in next year's presidential elections. His chances of a second term look good. Mr Fujimori - who in 1990 took over a country devastated by economic mismanagement and terrorism - now heads the fastest-growing economy in Latin America. Growth is expected to reach 9 per cent this year. Annual inflation is likely to fall below 20 per cent, from 7,500 per cent in 1990. The guerrilla movements which then seemed on the verge of taking over the state now look broken. With this record behind him, Mr Fujimori is popular: polls suggest that 65 per cent of Peruvians think he is doing a good job. He is also popular among businessmen - privatisation is moving ahead and the economy, including its mining sector, has been thrown open to foreign investment. Closer to home, things are trickier. He is so unpopular with his estranged wife, Ms Susana Higuchi, that she is threatening to sabotage her husband's expected attempt at re-election in next April's elections. Alleging widespread corruption in the Fujimori regime, she has decided to run for president too. Backed by a newly-created 'Harmony Twenty-First Century' movement, she must first win a ruling from a constitutional court to overturn a legal bar - created by the Fujimori-dominated Congress - that bans relatives of the head of state from standing for the presidency. She is just one of the challengers to Mr Fujimori, who has changed the constitution to allow for his re-election. Last month, the 74-year-old former UN secretary-general, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, announced his intention to seek office. Mr Alejandro Toledo, a respected economist, is also running as head of a new 'independent movement of professionals and technocrats', calling itself 'Peru Possible'. With a host of lesser-known figures, there are already 15 declared candidates, and by the October 11 deadline there could be as many as 24 presidential hopefuls. Mr Perez de Cuellar and Mr Toledo have both spent many years outside Peru, the former as a career diplomat, the latter as a consultant and visiting professor at eminent universities. Ms Higuchi is an engineer who founded and ran a successful construction company, until becoming first lady. All three have features in common: none has any experience of government and none is associated with any political party. They even steer clear of the word 'party' in describing the groups that support them. Lack of political experience is almost a sine qua non for electoral success in today's Peru. The biggest drawback is to be dubbed a 'traditional politician'. It was such politicians who, culminating in the 1985-1990 presidency of Mr Alan Garcia, succeeded in bringing hyperinflation, corruption and terrorism. Political party structures have been hierarchical and unresponsive to popular needs. Now the parties are making efforts to polish their image  - consulting members over candidacies, bringing in younger faces and co-opting women to their male-dominated organisations. But their standing remains low. Four out of five Peruvians describe themselves as independents with no party allegiance. This development has been encouraged by Mr Fujimori. He came from nowhere to win the 1990 elections over the leading candidate - author Mario Vargas Llosa - who had allied himself with the political parties thinking such a move would secure him support. Since then, through skilful manipulation - largely via well-managed revelations of earlier scandals - Mr Fujimori has ensured that the reputations of the traditional parties have remained low, while enhancing his own image and that of his military backers. Reluctant to transform his own makeshift political alliance into an organised party, Mr Fujimori has preferred to emphasise the direct link between president and people. He spends much of his time travelling the country, fostering the impression that he is the source of state munificence. He has eschewed ideology, and made a virtue out of pragmatism, or - as he would say - 'deeds not words'. He has outmanoeuvred his political opponents. In April 1992, with the backing of the army, he suspended congress and the constitution. Two of the main parties refused to take part in the congress that he then set up with the main task of agreeing a new constitution, leaving him a majority which passes any law he sends before it. Mr Fujimori, a self-confessed authoritarian, has also concentrated power in Lima. Grass-roots movements, whether of peasants, workers or shanty-town dwellers, have seen their influence eroded; in country areas recently reclaimed from the guerrillas, Mr Fujimori's military allies have replaced elected civilian governors. This, argue his opponents, is unhealthy in a country where there is little history of democracy. It has undermined the country's political and judicial institutions, they say, leaving Peru, with all its ethnic and economic divisions, as far away as ever from becoming a cohesive nation. For these reasons, Mr Fujimori's achievements remain superficial, they believe, offering room for successful opposition. Mr Perez de Cuellar said, when launching his candidacy, that going through Peru he found 'vast areas of poverty and systematic ill-treatment of institutions'. He would perfect 'what had already been achieved', but with 'democracy, genuine stability, development and jobs'. From Mr Toledo, the opening campaign message was: 'Changes and achievements need to be institutionalised. It is extremely dangerous to leave the country in the hands of one person, however capable he may be.' The need for mature institutions and political parties and a decentralisation of power may well be pressing. But matched against Mr Fujimori's successes on the economy and against terrorism, it may prove hard to turn that into a campaign slogan.</p>

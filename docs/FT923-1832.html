			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / City jitters sour Tesco's share price: The UK's second biggest grocery chain is believed to have suffered more than its rivals The City of London is convinced something is awry at Tesco. The problem is no-one is sure exactly what. Over the past few months, the share price of the UK's second biggest grocery chain has fallen more than 15 per cent relative to the market as a succession of ugly rumours has swept through the City. Tesco's market value is now more than Pounds 3bn, less than Sainsbury's Pounds 7.6bn. All food retailers have had a difficult summer because of sticky sales volumes, consumer uncertainty caused by the lingering recession and sharp food price deflation. But it is widely believed Tesco has suffered more than most. 'The industry numbers have been lousy. The Institute of Grocery Distribution figures have been slightly negative with everybody else saying they are up. There has to be a big loser for the sums to add up and the fear is that it is Tesco,' says Mr Nick Bubb, retail analyst at stockbrokers Morgan Stanley. Tesco's interim results presentation tomorrow will therefore be viewed as a crunch moment for the company and - perhaps - for the industry as a whole. Although Tesco's figures are likely to be perfectly respectable with margins widening and pre-tax profits climbing from Pounds 229.6m to between Pounds 245m and Pounds 255m, the City's attention will focus rigorously on the company's trading performance since the beginning of August. Are there signs of the company's prodigious growth record - which has seen profits grow over the past five years from Pounds 219m to Pounds 546m - beginning to stall? Is the company's near-Pounds 1bn a year capital spending programme - most of it on new stores - in danger of faltering? 'My feeling is that either Tesco will say something that will knock all the rumours on the head and send the share price 10 per cent to 15 per cent higher or their reputation will take a knock that will endure for some time to come,' says Mr Paul Smiddy, food retailing analyst at Kleinwort Benson. The jitteriness is understandable given the vast sums at stake. In February 1991 Tesco tapped the stock market for Pounds 572m to help fund its development programme. Its move was followed by rights issues from J. Sainsbury, Argyll Group (owners of Safeway), Wm Morrison and Asda. Between them they took Pounds 1.8bn from their shareholders. What returns these funds will generate is clearly a matter of great concern. Analysts argue that Tesco's sales are under more pressure than those of its rivals for a variety of reasons. Tesco, they say, is more exposed to sales of low-margin petrol and non-food items, such as clothes. Its normally aggressive marketing promotions have been suspiciously quiet. Its stores, many far bigger than those of its rivals, are located in some of the economically worst-hit areas of the country. The shopping habits of some of its customers - dubbed Thatcher's Children - who live in outer-metropolitan areas have proved more fickle than those of Sainsbury's and Safeway's more steadfast shoppers. However, analysts will be most interested in the performance of Tesco's newly opened stores, which anecdotal evidence suggests have been trading below expectations. Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite, says: 'In the long view Tesco is a superb company with superb prospects. But if it really is the case that it has difficulties with sales progress at its new stores then that is potentially a very serious problem.' Over the past few years, the big supermarket groups have developed highly sophisticated computer modelling techniques to predict a new store's sales patterns. By using a mass of demographic information - such as the local population's size, age, income and levels of car and home ownership - they were able to forecast the likely turnover of any store. Until recently it was Tesco's proud boast that its sales forecasts were never wrong by more than 5 per cent. And with such a high degree of accuracy, the company was happy to spend up to Pounds 35m on a new superstore, confident it could rely on a predictable stream of cash to generate its investment returns and provide funds for future expansion. Tesco's plans envisaged the addition of 25 new superstores a year for the next four years. But the widespread suspicion in the City is that for some - as yet unaccountable - reason Tesco's 'holy grail' has been poisoned. New store sales are believed to have been disappointing and even a small reduction in the expected volume can have a disproportionate effect on a store's profitability because of its high and rigid fixed operating costs. Tesco has been unable to dispel such fears because it has been bound by the normal Stock Exchange conventions which prevent it from commenting ahead of its results. But its reaction tomorrow will be keenly awaited. The company may simply press ahead aggressively with its store opening programme arguing that the sales hiccup is simply a temporary recession-induced aberration - which may be eased anyway by sterling's effective devaluation and a slowing of food price deflation. Alternatively, Tesco may begin to scale back on its site development programme and look for more attractive investment opportunities elsewhere either by expanding its Metro chain of high street stores or moving into another retailing sector altogether. It has also been intensively investigating opportunities abroad. 'It will be fascinating to see how Tesco reacts to its recent problems. The astonishing quietness on the marketing front implies that there has been a pause for serious thought,' says Mr Bubb of Morgan Stanley. No-one can yet be sure whether the recent sales malaise is merely a temporary phenomenon caused by recession and the sharp price deflation for food or a symptom of more ominous industry trends. Tesco's combative chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin can certainly be relied upon to come out tomorrow with all guns blazing. But it will be more than normally interesting to see in which direction the barrels will be pointing.</p>

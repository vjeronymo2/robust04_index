			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Technology: Financial data on time Tenfore, a Danish-Swiss company, has begun marketing a satellite-based, real-time information system which gives companies access to the same financial information as the banks carrying out their financial transactions  -and at a price which should make the system attractive. 'The customer no longer has to find himself in the position of having less information at his disposal than the bank which is disposing of his money,' says Henrik Hvidtfeldt, managing director of Tenfore's Danish development company. Two factors have enabled Tenfore to launch its system - the falling price of transmitting data via satellites and the development of PC screeen software which gives Tenfore's customers exactly the same news and financial information as banks and brokers, but at a much lower price than the systems used by the banks, says Hvidtfeldt. The service, using a Windows-based system, provides six news services (not including Reuter or AP-Dow Jones), real-time data on 30 stock, derivatives and commodity markets (including the London Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange and Seaq International) and foreign exchange quotes from international banks. The service is available only in Europe, but Hvidtfeldt says he expects to launch it in North America and Asia next year. Tenfore's software enables a company to filter only the information relevant to the firm and provides calculations for exactly how prices at any time will affect its profit margins. The cost to subscribers includes a DKr19,000 (Pounds 1,900) investment in a satellite dish and modem link to a personal computer, while the monthly subscription cost, including the fee for using the software, varies from DKr3,000 to DKr7,000 depending on which services are required. Hvidtfeldt says Tenfore has about 150 subscribers in Denmark and as many again in the rest of Europe, where it has sales representatives in 13 countries. Tenfore was developed in Denmark, where the database facilities and satellite transmissions take place, but the company is incorporated in Switzerland and backed by Danish and international investors.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Land Securities Unlike most of its peers, Land Securities has not put a foot wrong in recent years. But the defensive qualities that stood it in good stead in the recession may be a handicap in a rising market. Land's conservatism has stopped it making mistakes, but has also prevented it from seizing opportunities. Its modest spending on acquisitions has left it with a sizeable chunk of unspent funds at a time when competition from institutions is particularly intense. Restarting its development programme will take up some of the slack, but on too small a scale to make much difference. With its low gearing and safety-first approach, Land Securities will find it hard to keep up with its more nimble rivals. The company remains a well-tuned rent collecting machine, with a secure income and good quality, well-let properties. But since most of its tenants pay above-market rents, it will be several years before it reaps the benefit of rising rents in its rent reviews. Flat or declining earnings mean Land Securities may thus only maintain steadily rising dividends at the expense of running down its dividend cover.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The American Grip"] </F>   [Text] A fortnight after his mischievous letter about  Punjab, President Clinton has written a mischievous letter about  Kashmir now. He has written the last letter to Ghulam Nabi Fai,  the president of the Kashmiri American Council who supports  terrorists in Kashmir. This letter is addressed to Gary Condit  in response to a letter written by 15 U.S. lawmakers. In this  letter he had agreed with the concern expressed by these  legislators about Punjab and had supported a resolution of the  Punjab problem in which the human rights of the Sikhs are  protected. When the letter from Clinton to Ghulam Nabi Fai was  shared, the U.S. administration had tried to clarify that there  has been no change in the U.S. stand and it was not necessary to  dwell too much on the letter written to Ghulam Nabi Fai. It was  said that this letter was just a formality and not a  specifically written letter. However, the recent letter about  Punjab does not leave any room for reassurance about Bill  Clinton's designs.    Thus, the Indian Government had no alternative but to take  these negative signs coming from the United States of America  seriously. It is imperative that it mobilize its ambassador in  the United States to object to the U.S. stand and state that  such actions will adversely effect U.S.-India relations.  However, doing this will not be enough. This is not the first  time that Bill Clinton and his government have shown such an  aggressive attitude toward India. We have already seen U.S.  actions such as laws relating to intellectual property and the  NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. This U.S. policy is pushing India  toward the wall using the so-called human rights issue which the  United States is using in the context of Kashmir and Punjab.    The fear that a democratic president, once elected, would  increase pressure on India was expressed in the circles that  sympathize with India before the presidential elections in the  United States. This fear was based on the fact that democratic  presidents are very active on human rights and the NPT, and the  anti-India lobbies have been very active over these two issues  for some time. At the same time, it is believed that the United  States will impose its economic policies very aggressively in  order to fight the economic recession at home. In this context,  it will exert a lot of pressure over the laws relating to  intellectual property. Keeping in mind these old fears, the  anti-India attitude of the U.S. President and his administration  was not taken seriously.    However, the attitude of Bill Clinton and his administration  cannot be ignored as the expected attitude of a Democrat  President. Another reason is that the United States is now  ignoring all the Pakistani activities to encourage terrorists in  India. Second, Bill Clinton's attitude about Kashmir and Punjab  is also directly encouraging the terrorists in Kashmir and  Punjab. Obviously, Bill Clinton cannot be unaware of the results  of his actions. We have to conclude that the United States is  deliberately increasing pressure on India and trying to weaken  it. In this situation, India cannot be satisfied just be  registering its objection at diplomatic level. It must see and  understand how it can counter this anti-Indian attitude of the  United States.  *</p>

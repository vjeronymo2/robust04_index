			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The raid on a UNHCR camp at Vahun in Liberia on  Christmas day by ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy  in Liberia] forces loyal to Alhaji Koromah is being taken  advantage of by Koromah's political opponents. Reports said  ULIMO forces commandeered trucks at gun point, looted supplies,  and stole medicines and vaccines. Alhaji Koromah said nothing  like that happened, that the trucks had been taken into  safekeeping, and that the whole thing had been stirred up by  Medecins Sans Frontiere. Well Madison Wion of the rival ULIMO  wing called us up and Robin White asked him what he had to say  about the events at Vahun:    [Begin recording] [Wion] We strongly condemn the situation  in  Vahun and we want to dissociate ourselves from it; and these are  the fears that we've been having, looking at Koromah hijacking  leadership, and we have been saying that Koromah is not the  leader. And so, the problem in Vahun, we are not surprised. We  knew that the elements who are loyal to Koromah would have  caused us this problem.    [White] Now Alhaji Koromah says that his men were not  responsible for any serious trouble there.    [Wion] Robin, we will never believe Alhaji Koromah.    [White] But you don't have any power any more.    [Wion] In term of what sir?    [White] I mean Alhaji Koromah is the leader of ULIMO.    [Wion] Koromah is not the leader of ULIMO. We don't know  what justification he has to back his claim. We need to say  that because he had the support of the military. From our  assessment we know that it is not all of the military give  Koromah the support. He has his elements that he is using.    [White] Yes, but do you have any armed men any more?    [Wion] We have armed men both in Liberia and Sierra Leone.    [White] How many armed men do you have?    [Wion] We are talking about in term of more than 5,000 to  6,000. We have almost everybody that is in Liberia.    [White] Except for those with Alhaji Koromah?    [Wion] Except for those elements that Alhaji Koromah brought  in who are not... [pauses] who quarrel with ULIMO's disciplinary  measures.    [White] Now, you know, what do you think should happen in  Liberia now?    [Wion] In term of what sir?    [White] In terms of the future.    [Wion] What is needed to be done, looking at the trend of  events, is that let there be a national conference, because you  cannot give power to warring factions. Why not call in  everybody to include the political parties, the religious  leaders, the various interest groups, and you name it. Call  them to the conference table; let everybody come out with a  platform, how we all should get to the rightful solution of our  country.    [White] Could I ask you what attitude the Sierra Leone  Government takes toward you operating in Freetown?    [Wion] I mean, the same attitude. They know that we have  been fighting to protect our position, to protect our people.  We still have thousands of refugees all around the country, and  we cannot sit here for Foday Sankoh or Alhaji, I mean....  [pauses] how do they call him? Charles Taylor people to come  and consume our people unnecessarily. [sentence as heard] So,  we have to also take that position all of the time. So, we are  both here in Sierra Leone and Liberia.    [White] Are your men fighting alongside the Sierra Leonean  Army against Foday Sankoh rebels?    [Wion] The objective is not to fight against Foday Sankoh  rebels, but what we are saying here is Foday Sankoh is not just  Foday Sankoh. It is Charles Taylor that is causing the trouble.  He is creating the whole problem. It is not merely Foday  Sankoh and we will not allow Charles Taylor to come and cause  damage to our people and even our host!    [White] So, can I take that you are fighting alongside the  Sierra Leone Army against Foday Sankoh?    [Wion] That is not a question to ask. We will continue to  fight for our own protection in the first place. [end recording]</p>

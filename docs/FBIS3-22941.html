			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Fernando Barrantes] </F>   [Text] Lima, 13 Feb (AFP) -- Analysts said on Sunday that  peace negotiations between government envoys and imprisoned  Shining Path leaders are classified as top secret and only the  National Intelligence Service has access to the meetings. The  police, therefore, can only offer contradictory reports that  confuse public opinion." [quotation marks as received]    The government disclosed the "secret nature" of the talks in  a written response to a request for information by conservative  Congressman Antero Flores Araoz.    Antiterrorist police believe that Shining Path Leader  Abimael  Guzman's calls for peace from jail have gained "the support of a  significant portion of the organization. The rebel group is  about to present the call at a clandestine congress to take  place somewhere in Lima in April." The same source indicates,  however, that Guzman managed to bypass the strict controls at El  Callao Naval Base, where he is serving a life sentence, and  delivered a document to rebel leader Martha Huatay ordering  Shining Path to continue the 13-year-old war.    The official government reports state that the terrorist  leader met with other imprisoned leaders of the organization,  including Huatay, "to get them to submit to his command and join  the plea for peace." Huatay, according to the police, hid the  message in her underclothing. She managed to pass the message  on after she and Osman Morote, Shining Path's second in command,  were returned to the Puno Penitentiary in the Andean mountain  plains. Police found the message when one of Huatay's relatives  was trying to smuggle it out of the facility, probably using the  same way of concealing it.    Press reports say that for weeks the government has been  moving those rebel leaders who support the peace process from  one detention facility to another so they can freely promote the  idea.    According to documents circulating within Shining Path, the  movement is divided into two factions: the "pacifists," who  swear loyalty to Guzman, and "the hard-liners." The latter  formed the "new reconstituted direction" that replaced the  leader following his arrest in September 1992.    The "hard-liners" deny that Guzman wants peace. Police  sources reported that their rivals are Oscar Ramirez and Teresa  Durand -- nicknamed the "porfidios or perfidos" which was  derived from the aliases of Feliciano and Doris. They were tried  for rebellion and sentenced to life in prison by a military  court in 1993.    According to the "hard-liners," Elena Iparraguirre (Guzman's  companion), Edmundo Cox, and Maria Pantoja, who are also serving  life sentences, are the current leaders of the "pacifists."  During a recent visit to one of the jails in Lima, President  Alberto Fujimori and Edmundo Cox shook hands before reporters.    The Peruvian opposition has repeatedly demanded that the  government inform the people about the negotiation process in  order for public opinion to stay abridge of the developments and  thus clear all doubts surrounding the talks and deny the growing  rumors that state "Guzman is trying to secure a pardon and his  release into exile."</p>

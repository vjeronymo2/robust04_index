			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Tax change to hit Coca-Cola THE Coca-Cola Company warned yesterday that a recent revision of the US tax code would reduce its full-year earnings by 4 cents a share. The Atlanta-based soft drinks company said its effective consolidated tax rate for 1993 would increase by one-half of one percentage point on an annualised basis, to 31.3 per cent. It estimates its effective tax rate for 1994 at 32.5 per cent. The higher 1993 tax rate will reduce Coca-Cola's net income by about Dollars 55m. Most of the charge against earnings is to be reflected in third-quarter results, scheduled for release on October 21. Analysts had forecast 1993 earnings per share at Dollars 1.70 to Dollars 1.71, or about 18 per cent higher than last year's Dollars 1.43. The higher tax rate would reduce earnings to about Dollars 1.66. Mr Terry Bivens, who follows the company for Argus Research of New York, said that the impact of the tax changes was in line with expectations. Last week, PepsiCo announced that the new federal tax legislation would reduce its 1993 earnings by about 5 cents a share. Coca-Cola also said that it expected its worldwide unit-case sales in the third quarter to grow by between 4 per cent and 5 per cent over the year-earlier period, down from the 6 per cent growth attained in the second quarter of 1993. Third-quarter growth in US unit-case sales, perhaps the best indicator of strength at the retail level, was estimated at between 5 per cent and 6 per cent. On Wall Street, Coca-Cola closed down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 43 7/8 .</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE NEWS;  </P> <P> STEPPING DOWN MEMORY LANE WITH AILEY  </P> <P> Alvin Ailey spent his adolescence and early adulthood -- from the ages of 12 to  23 -- in Los Angeles. The choreographer, former dancer and founder of the  three-decade old Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater remembers his years as  member of the Lester Horton company -- "Sometimes, I drive by our theater,  still there, on Melrose Ave. -- it's a male porn house now." He also remembers  downtown Los Angeles in the late '40s and early '50s as "a really special  place."  </P> <P> In the elegantly refurbished Olive Street lobby of the Biltmore Hotel, the  58-year-old Ailey reminisces about places long gone: the Biltmore Theater,  Philharmonic Auditorium, the Orpheum theater, the nightclubs of Central Avenue.  He ticks off names of performers he remembers seeing in those years: Martha  Graham, Tommy Dorsey, Alexandra Danilova, Billie Holiday, Katherine Dunham. . .  .  </P> <P> "The first time I saw Dunham was right here, in this building in the (long-ago  razed) Biltmore Theater," Ailey says.  </P> <P> The influence of the pioneer choreographer -- whose heyday was the 1930s and  '40s -- on generations of dancers and choreographers of all stripes cannot be  overestimated, Ailey says.  </P> <P> His tribute to her, "The Magic of Katherine Dunham," mounted at a cost of more  than $500,000, was given its first performance at City Center in Manhattan in  late 1987. Since then it has been danced, by the Ailey company, in Washington,  Boston and Paris.  </P> <P> It should also have been part of the latest Ailey engagement in Los Angeles,  which, under auspices of the UCLA Center for the Arts, takes place Tuesday  through next Sunday at the Wiltern Theatre.  </P> <P> "But it would have taken extra funding -- between $25,000 and $35,000 over the  cost of the engagement," said Pebbles Wadsworth, director of the center. "Given  more time to raise those funds, I think we can expect to see the Dunham show  when the Ailey company returns next," probably 1990-91, she added.  </P> <P> "It broke my heart not to be able to bring the Dunham evening here," Ailey  said, pointing out that two cities on the company's current January-May tour of  the United States will get to see that program, which offers 14 pieces from the  Dunham repertory. Those cities -- St. Louis (near where Dunham now lives) and  Minneapolis -- are on the eastern leg of the tour. Dunham, 79 this year, and  some members of her former company helped re-create these works for the 1987  revival.  </P> <P> Reminiscing about his career beginnings, Ailey talked about going to New York  with his colleague, Carmen de Lavallade, in 1954 -- after the death of his  mentor, Lester Horton -- dancing on Broadway, and starting his own company.  </P> <P> "Little did I know, when I started, first with one concert in 1958, then with  two the following season, that I would be chasing funds for the rest of my  life."  </P> <P> Fortunately, he says, "I like what I'm doing."  </P> <P> And, though he says European audiences appreciate his work and his company more  fully than do North American audiences, "When I'm depressed, I think how much  we have done in these 30 years." From his headquarters in New York, Ailey  manages the future of two Ailey companies, the touring one and a junior troupe,  oversees a school where 2,000 students receive dance training, and makes  dances.  </P> <P> "Because of funding, we can have only one long rehearsal period every year,"  the choreographer said, "So it is not possible for me to be able to create more  than two new works a year. That's frustrating. And, of course, having a company  means having a whole lot of problems all the time. This is a stress business."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME RELIGIOUS DISPLAYS OKD BY HIGH COURT  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, continuing to fuzz the line at which religious displays  cross the boundary between church and state, ruled Monday that local  governments may not support displays that appear designed to promote certain  faiths but that they may sponsor religious symbols as part of broad holiday  celebrations.  </P> <P> On a 5-4 vote, the court said that a prominent display of a Christian nativity  scene inside a county courthouse in Pittsburgh was unconstitutional because it  had the "effect of promoting or endorsing religious beliefs."  </P> <P> But the court, with three liberal justices dissenting, also agreed to permit a  Hanukkah menorah on the front steps of another Pittsburgh government building  because the overall display, which included a Christmas tree and a sign  saluting American liberty, simply recognized "different traditions for  celebrating the winter-holiday season."  </P> <P> Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the narrow majority that struck down  Allegheny County's Christian creche depicting the birth of Christ, said that  the nativity scene violated the constitutional separation of church and state.  "Nothing in the context of the display detracts from the creche's religious  message," Blackmun held.  </P> <P> By contrast, Blackmun argued that the display of a large menorah, a  nine-branched candelabra used during the celebration of the Jewish holiday  Hanukkah, may be acceptable because, "in this particular context, the menorah's  display does not have an effect of endorsing religious faith."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Unjustified Hostility'  </P> <P> Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the minority's opinion, which blasted the  court's majority for an "Orwellian rewriting of history" that "reflects an  unjustified hostility toward religion." He was joined by Chief Justice William  H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.  </P> <P> The full outcome appeared to satisfy only two of the justices, Blackmun and  Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor wrote in a separate opinion that the display  including the menorah along with a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty  was acceptable because it "sends a message of pluralism and freedom to choose  one's own beliefs."  </P> <P> Three of the liberal justices who helped form the majority that struck down the  creche contended that the menorah display also should have been ruled  unconstitutional.  </P> <P> Justice William J. Brennan Jr. argued that both displays contained a strong  religious message. "I cannot agree," Brennan wrote, "that the city's display of  a 45-foot Christmas tree and an 18-foot menorah . . . shows no favoritism  towards Christianity, Judaism, or both."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Explains Various Views  </P> <P> Blackmun, in announcing the decision, acknowledged that "the court is  fractured." After explaining the views of the various factions, he said: "I  hope that's correct. It reminds me of the vendors at the ballpark selling  programs listing the names of all the players."  </P> <P> Religious leaders were sharply divided over the court's decision.  </P> <P> "Thank God for the Supreme Court," said Charles Saul, a Pittsburgh attorney  representing the Jewish group that owned the menorah. "The court is saying that  when you put a menorah and a Christmas tree and those kinds of things together,  that all faiths are welcome."  </P> <P> The court's ruling also satisfied John V. Stevens, a Seventh-day Adventist  Church official in Westlake Village, Calif., who said that the decision makes  it clear that a specifically religious holiday display by itself violates the  church-state separation principles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prefers Secular Symbols  </P> <P> "If the creche stands alone, the (religious) message is too strong," said  Stevens, who is also president of the non-sectarian Council on Religious  Freedom. He added, however, that he would prefer to see only secular Christmas  symbols, such as trees and Santa Clauses, in government-sponsored displays.  </P> <P> But the American Jewish Committee, which opposed both displays, expressed  disappointment over the ruling.  </P> <P> "I'm gratified the court struck down the creche and distressed it did not also  strike down the menorah," said Samuel Rabinove, the Jewish Committee's legal  director. "Neither belongs in public spaces. There are plenty of private places  for them."  </P> <P> The court's decision to permit a Jewish menorah to be part of a larger civic  display was similar to recent court rulings in California that allowed the  Hanukkah symbol to coexist with a Christmas tree in Los Angeles City Hall.  </P> <P> The nation's high court "vindicated our position," said Rabbi Shlomo Cunin,  West Coast director of the Chabad Lubavitch movement in Judaism.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Relies on 1984 Decision  </P> <P> Monday's Supreme Court ruling, handed down along with the eagerly awaited  abortion decision on the final day of the court's 1988-1989 session, relied  heavily on a 1984 decision in which the court upheld the constitutionality of a  creche in Pawtucket, R.I.  </P> <P> In contrast to that creche, which was surrounded by secular symbols such as  Santa Claus, reindeer and snowmen, the Pittsburgh nativity scene was displayed  by itself.  </P> <P> Justice Department lawyers had urged the court to allow both Pittsburgh  displays, arguing that "use of the creche as a symbol of the holiday does not  constitute a government endorsement of the religious content of that symbol"  and contending that government "is not required to surround it with candy  canes, reindeer or other purely secular symbols."  </P> <P> Blackmun acknowledged in his decision that the 1984 ruling, written by former  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, was "none too clear."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calls Context Important  </P> <P> But Blackmun's new guidelines may not help much in sorting out the confusion.  "The government's use of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the  effect of endorsing religious beliefs," he wrote, "and the effect of the  government's use of religious symbolism depends upon its context."  </P> <P> Blackmun's opinion in the case (Allegheny County vs. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU,  87-2050) was joined by O'Connor, Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul  Stevens.  </P> <P> Staff writer John Dart in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

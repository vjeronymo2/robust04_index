			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Nato plans 50,000 Bosnia deployment NATO is developing a plan to send about 50,000 peacekeeping troops to Bosnia, up to half of them Americans, if agreement is reached to end the civil war, Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, said yesterday. At a meeting in Brussels before flying to Rome to discuss the proposal with US military officials, Mr Aspin confirmed for the first time the number involved but said the US Congress was likely to veto American participation unless European allies provided half the troops. 'We are talking overall numbers of around 50,000 total - that would be US and western allies,' Mr Aspin told a meeting of the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) in Brussels. Separately, Germany is lobbying to appoint a German national to head a European Community team to restore order to the ruined Bosnian town of Mostar, in the event of a peace deal between Moslems, Croats and Serbs in the Bosnian conflict. German officials confirmed the Bonn government's interest in taking a high profile administration role in Mostar if the warring parties resolved their differences in peace talks in Geneva. 'It would be one of the first examples of a common European security and foreign policy,' said one. Germany's ambiguous constitutional restrictions on the deployment of military force overseas and its involvement in atrocities in Yugoslavia in the second world war makes it impossible for Germany to take part in a UN/Nato peacekeeping force in Bosnia. Appointment of a German national to help restore basic facilities in Mostar would show the Bonn government is anxious to 'do its bit' in former Yugoslavia, an EC official said. Lord Owen, EC negotiator, suggested during an upbeat presentation on Saturday to EC foreign ministers meeting in eastern Belgium that an agreement might only be weeks away. But this depended on all three parties showing flexibility and he was not yet ready to reconvene peace talks. Talks are focusing on encouraging the Croats to guarantee Bosnian Moslems access to the Adriatic Sea. Ministers are also trying to persuade the Serbs to open up safe corridors between Bosnian-held territory. It is understood Greece is being used as an intermediary, passing the message that Serb concessions would lead to a swift lifting of EC sanctions. General Jean Cot, commander of UN peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia, was attempting yesterday to mediate a truce between Croat and Serb forces to end four days of clashes in Croatia, UN officials said, Reuter reports from Zagreb. In earlier talks with the Croatian army chief, Gen Cot stressed that Croatian troops should withdraw from three villages in southern Croatia captured in a snap offensive on Thursday. The rebel Serb command in the Krajina enclave threatened to use new weapons in 'massive retaliation' unless Croats pulled back.</p>

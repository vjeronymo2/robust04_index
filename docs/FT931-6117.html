			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Top 3i executive assures on policy after flotation THE CHIEF executive of 3i, the UK's biggest venture capital group, sought yesterday to reassure investee companies (companies in which 3i has taken an equity stake) that a possible Stock Exchange flotation for 3i would not threaten their future wellbeing. Addressing the first meeting of the 3i Communication Club, an independent organisation formed to represent investee companies' interests, Mr Ewen Macpherson said flotation would not change 3i's policy of long-term investment. He told representatives of 50 3i investee companies in Newcastle upon Tyne that a review was imminent of 3i's possible flotation, postponed further last year because of the recession. Should 3i decide to float, he said, it would be as an investment trust, the success of which would be measured partly by long-term growth. No pressure would be placed on investee companies to increase their dividend payments. Mr Macpherson will today address a similar 3i Communication Club meeting in Birmingham, and tomorrow in London. In total, representatives of around 450 3i investee companies are expected to attend the meetings. The formation of the club last November was prompted by fears that flotation would induce an attitude of short termism by 3i towards its investments. There was also criticism of alleged lack of communication by 3i, and calls for preferential treatment for client companies in any 3i share issue. Asked yesterday who would benefit from flotation, Mr Macpherson said he expected some of the funds raised, should it proceed, would go to 3i's main shareholders, the clearing banks. He hoped some proceeds would be ploughed back into 3i.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Ofwat warns on efficiency WATER COMPANIES which are inefficient will face tighter price controls in future, the industry regulator Ofwat said yesterday. Ofwat's consultation paper said it would look favourably on water companies which controlled costs and had high standards of customer service when it conducts its periodic review in 1994 - a wide-ranging assessment of the industry's pricing structure. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said yesterday: 'I am concerned about the rising level of water and sewerage bills.' The water companies' 10-year modernisation programme to bring water standards in England and Wales into line with European Community directives could eventually cost about Pounds 45bn. Ofwat's paper said the rate of price increases 'must bear some relationship to the costs incurred but the relationship need not be a mechanical one. Companies which are shown to be less efficient will be set tighter price limits.' The paper added that increases in water charges would allow water companies to make a 'reasonable' return on capital and that it would not try to 'claw back retrospectively any savings companies have made above the efficiency targets initially assumed'. Mr David Luffnam, finance director of Thames Water, said: 'There are a number of positive things such as being able to retain efficiency gains for a good period. But this is just one step towards the periodic review, and the crunch clearly comes with the next part - the assumptions about what are acceptable financial ratios.' Lex, Page 22</p>

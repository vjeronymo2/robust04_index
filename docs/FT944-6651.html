			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Eurosceptics bend to finance bill whip The lobbies of the House of Commons were echoing last night to the sound of Conservative Eurosceptics explaining away the near-collapse of a threatened backbench rebellion against the European Communities Finance bill. The repentant rebels all had cogent reasons for backing down: some feared deselection; others accepted the government's promises on EU fraud; many were keeping their powder dry for the 1996 inter-governmental conference. But the result was the same: with the exception of a handful of die-hards, the rebels' courage failed in the face of Mr John Major's decision to make the bill an issue of confidence. It was the culmination of a government operation that began last week with the threat of a general election if the bill was defeated or substantially amended. Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, backed that with a clear threat that any rebels either voting against the government or abstaining would lose the Conservative whip - a which equals suspension from the parliamentary party. This is a serious punishment which bans MPs from taking part in the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, from sitting on backbench Tory committees, or voting on party issues such as the election of a new leader. The lengths to which the government was prepared to go to avoid defeat became clear on Friday, when leading rebels started to complain that they had been threatened with deselection if they failed to support the bill. Conservative central office says constituency organisations were merely reminded that party rules do not allow MPs who have lost the whip to be adopted as candidates at a subsequent election. Some of the rebels saw it differently. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, said her constituency chairman had been warned that the local party organisation would be closed down and replaced unless she were dumped. Mr Ryder's troops were still at it as MPs prepared to vote, pointing out to the most hardline Eurosceptics that there was little point in rebelling because the government was no longer in danger of defeat. But the collapse of the rebellion became clear long before the vote when only a handful of MPs turned up for a meeting of the rightwing Fresh Start group intended to make a final decision on tactics. In the end the rebel hardcore was reduced to half a dozen MPs, including Mrs Gorman, Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip, Northwood) and Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), a veteran MP who last year threatened to resign and cause a by-election after falling out with Mr Major. Mr Christopher Gill said he was resigned to losing the party whip, but had the backing of his Ludlow constituency. 'If the constituency wants to be represented by a sheep then they can go down to Ludlow livestock market and buy one,' he said. Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North), said the vote was 'concerned with whether we want to waste any more money in Europe or not'. The rebellion might have been a lot bigger. A further 12 Tory backbenchers joined the six hardliners last week in signing an amendment opposing the bill. The amendment was not called by the Speaker. They 12 were: Mr Bill Cash (Stafford); Sir George Gardiner (Reigate); Mr Edward Leigh (Gainsborough and Horncastle); Mr Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton SW); Mr Toby Jessel (Twickenham); Mr John Carlisle (Luton N); Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield); Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton); Mr Vivian Bendall (Ilford N); Mr Bill Walker (Tayside N); Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills) and Mr Rupert Allason (Torbay).</p>

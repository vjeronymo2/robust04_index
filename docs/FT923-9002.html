			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Observer: Recharged President Boris Yeltsin, a no-show in Barcelona, has written to International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch apologising for his absence and adding that he hoped the two of them could play tennis soon. Yeltsin, a tennis buff and member of Moscow's Petrovsky Park tennis club, was due to play Samaranch in Moscow in January this year but the match was rearranged for the summer after the IOC chief issued an invitation to the Olympics. Yeltsin's change of mind surely can't have anything to do with his tennis form - George Bush presented him with a battery-powered tennis machine earlier this summer.</p>

The explosive charge  planted in Safut was discovered and defused, he noted.    In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, PETRA, the  interior minister added: Muhammad 'Ali Shihadah, alias  Abu-'Abbad, a construction worker aged 26 years, and 'Id Salih  al-Jahalin, a plumber aged 31 years, have admitted that they  committed these crimes. They are part of a group that will be  uncovered later.    Hammad went on to say that the apprehension of these two  criminals was the result of remarkable and persistent efforts by  the Public Security organs since these crimes occurred. He said  that investigations are continuing to unearth the details of  plans to undermine the homeland's security and stability.    Hammad said that these two criminals who perpetrated these  crimes, which aimed to undermine the citizens' security, have  connections with some persons who have returned from Afghanistan.    Concluding his statement, Hammad said: We take pride in our  inspired leadership, which has always rendered us loyal soldiers  of the homeland, eager to perform our duties. We pledge to this  leadership to remain, as King Husayn has always known us, people  who have faith in the message, and who will keep the trust.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong growth at US insurer The Prudential, the US insurance group, reported a Dollars 869m increase in its capital during 1993, to Dollars 10.7bn, as most areas of its business grew strongly. Changes in its capital base are the best indication of the insurer's performance - as a mutual, it does not report conventional profit figures. The growth came despite a move by Prudential Securities, the broking arm, to set aside Dollars 430m to cover the costs of settling thousands of claims from investors in limited partnerships sold by the firm in the 1980s. After these charges, Prudential Securities still managed to maintain after-tax earnings at Dollars 145m, down only slightly from Dollars 150m the year before. Mr Robert Winters, Prudential chairman and chief executive, said the results of the securities arm showed that customers had not lost confidence in the broker. Following the widely-publicised limited partnership problems, which continue to dog it, the broking firm has embarked on an extensive advertising campaign to try to rebuild investors' trust. The increase in Prudential's capital base compared with a rise of only Dollars 80m the year before, when the insurer suffered losses from Hurricane Andrew. Among individual insurance lines, the Prudential said sales of property and casualty insurance sales had fallen slightly during the year, to Dollars 441m in new premiums, reflecting efforts to cut its exposure to catastrophe losses. Sales of life insurance and annuities in North America climed to Dollars 2.7bn in annualised premiums, up from Dollars 2.1bn the year before. Sales in the Far East and Europe rose by around a third, though from a far smaller base. Bank of Boston is to acquire privately-held Pioneer Financial, a co-operative bank, for Dollars 118m in cash, Reuter reports from Boston. Bank of Boston said Pioneer Bank, with Dollars 773m in assets and Dollars 720m in deposits, is the largest co-operative bank in Massachusetts. The acquisition is expected to close this autumn.</p>

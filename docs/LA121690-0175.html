			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNTY'S CENTRAL JAIL;  </P> <P> OVERCROWDING AND AGE BURDEN FACILITY  </P> <P> Full-time burglar and narcotics dealer Stephen Berkley can remember the good  old days, way back in 1963, when the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail  first opened and a crook could almost see his reflection in cement floors so  new that they shined.  </P> <P> "Look at these scuff marks," said Berkley, 49. "Look at all these people. This  place sure ain't what it used to be."  </P> <P> A 1-million-square-foot hunk of concrete sandwiched between the paved banks of  the Los Angeles River and the rusting warehouses of lower Chinatown, the jail,  or "CJ" as it is known, is a metaphor for the plight of criminal justice in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Aging and overcrowded, it and other county jail facilities also are the damper  on the local criminal justice system.  </P> <P> While Los Angeles County's jail system is the largest in the nation, there  simply is not enough space. Overcrowding has forced judges, prosecutors and  police officers to juggle priorities that largely determine who should go to  jail and how long they should remain.  </P> <P> Built for no more than 5,276 inmates, the Men's Central Jail today houses  nearly 6,800. Inmates line up for meals, showers and sick call.  </P> <P> "Take it now . . . take it now," a jail nurse drones as she hands Tylenol  capsules and paper cups of water to one cold-suffering inmate after another.  "Take it now."  </P> <P> Like the men they guard, deputies assigned to the jail have few kind words to  say about conditions that were once state-of-the-art.  </P> <P> "A jail, in my opinion, should sparkle," said Sheriff's Capt. Lee Davenport,  who runs the jail's Inmate Reception Center. "We don't sparkle. Just keeping  our heads above water is a major task."  </P> <P> It is through the conveyor-like reception center that all male inmates enter  incarceration (females are processed in East Los Angeles at the women's Sybil  Brand Institute).  </P> <P> A sign near the entrance advises officers to "Leave all knives, saps and ammo  with control deputy." As the two steel doors open and clang shut, incoming  arrestees find seats on wooden benches until called by the next available  filing clerk.  </P> <P> Separated by a glass window, a clerk asks each arrestee 52 questions, typing  the answers into a computer -- his name, address, birth date, color of eyes,  observable physical oddities, whether he has venereal disease. . . .  </P> <P> Those picked up on minor charges usually are released within minutes. To thin  the jail population, the sheriff will not hold anyone arrested on a misdemeanor  if his bail is less than $7,500.  </P> <P> Those who remain are frisked by deputies, ordered to strip and shower, issued a  towel and jail clothing, then given a meat and cheese sandwich and Kool-Aid.  They are fingerprinted, photographed, X-rayed for tuberculosis and seated in  front of a television monitor to watch a 45-minute videotape on jail routine.  Then they are ushered into the general population.  </P> <P> Inside the jail, there is a dreary, institutional cast that cannot be masked by  colorful murals of western vistas and wagon trains painted by inmates. Some  walls are so thick with layers of green paint that they flex at the push of a  fingertip.  </P> <P> A chill wind literally howls through many corridors, thanks to an imbalanced  and antiquated air-conditioning system that works all too well in some areas  and not at all in others, deputies and inmates say.  </P> <P> For many repeat offenders like Stephen Berkley, the discomforts and  inconveniences of jail life are nothing new.  </P> <P> "Three hundred times," he laughed when asked how often he had been jailed  before. "This is my job." His most recent arrest came after he broke into a  warehouse filled with suede jackets.  </P> <P> Not only has the jail itself gone downhill, Berkley observed, but so have the  people in it. Many are gang members bent on killing each other and anyone who  stands between them.  </P> <P> "I got two nephews in here right now, one's a Blood; the other's a Crip," he  said. "They're all crazy, crazy. You're dealing with a new breed now. These  kids got no respect for the law."  </P></p>

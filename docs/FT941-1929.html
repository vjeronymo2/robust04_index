			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cost-cutting helps UDO advance 32% to Pounds 1.85m UDO Holdings, the supplier of drawing office equipment and reprographic services, yesterday hailed a cost-cutting programme and emphasis on high margin products as the main factor behind a 32 per cent increase in interim profits. In the six months to January 31, pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 1.4m). This was despite reduced turnover of Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 23.9m) as the group's traditional businesses continued to suffer the effects of recession. Mr Mike Wright, chairman, said the improvement reflected savings achieved by a redundancy programme and renewed emphasis on higher margin products. The workforce has been cut by 10 per cent to 900, and Mr Wright said he had been encouraged by growing demand for the group's colour imaging equipment. 'The colour imaging centres, established last year and representing a very substantial investment, are now contributing to group profits,' he added. Earnings per share rose to 4.25p (3.22p), and the interim dividend is up to 2.22p (2.07p). The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 14.4m and said it was considering acquisitions.</p>

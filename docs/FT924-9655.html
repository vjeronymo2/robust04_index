			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (6): A wood trader with polish - Profiles of three forward-looking companies with eyes on Europe THE IMAGE of a Greek industrial company is often that of a jealously guarded bastion of family interests, prevented from competing in the broader European market by its unwillingness to surrender even a modicum of control to outside managers or shareholders. Yet the experience of Balkan Export, which started out as a timber trading company owned by several northern Greek families, demonstrates that modernisation can be worthwhile. Balkan Export is now Greece's second-largest wood-processor, with a widening product line, increased exports and a profitable subsidiary that produces furniture and fittings. It is also among only a handful of northern Greek companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. Three years ago, 35 per cent of the company was floated, raising Dr5.5bn (Pounds 17m) in fresh capital. 'We were one of the first Greek exporters going into the Middle East markets. From that experience, we realised we had to grow, regardless of the changes involved,' says Mr Tasos Kyriakides, marketing manager. 'Taking the decision to go public was a turning point. Bank interest rates were crippling, and we were planning large-scale investments which would enable us to stay competitive for a decade.' Balkan Export now runs seven product lines, manufacturing different types of chipboard, plywood and blockboard. Its most recent investment was a Dr3.5bn chipboard production line installed last year. The company has also boosted production of sawn timber from imported tropical woods, and strengthened distribution of imported red woods from Scandinavia and white woods from eastern Europe for making floors and window frames. 'We've become a sort of supermarket in wood products. But the test of staying competitive will be our ability to keep up with demand for better quality products,' says Mr Kyriakides. The other side of the coin is that Balkan Export is now more susceptible to the effects of recession. The pace of new construction in Greece slowed by about 15 per cent last year. The building industry is particularly sensitive to any decline in economic activity. Sales increased by only 7 per cent last year, to Dr13.4bn. However, exports surged by 32 per cent to Dr2.8bn, the result of a successful marketing drive in Germany and Holland. This year sales are forecast to rise by around 10 per cent, assuming that exports can be sustained. 'We're in a very volatile environment at the moment. On the on hand timber costs are coming down, but on the other we've been affected by the war in Yugoslavia. We can't pass on extra transport costs to our customers in Germany, because the market there is so competitive,' says Mr Michael Kefalopoulos, export manager. At the same time, the international trade embargo against Serbia, formerly a major customer for Greek wood products, will deprive Balkan Export of about 15 per cent of projected export sales this year. Fortunately, the company's furniture subsidiary, Eldoor, seems immune to recession, having increased sales by 46 per cent in 1991 to Dr2.8bn. Another 40 per cent rise is forecast this year. Eldoor makes floors, doors and window frames and kitchen furniture, and also imports a wide range of household fittings. With showrooms proliferating around Greece and no direct competition, it is steadily taking business away from hundreds of small joinery and furniture-making companies. Eldoor will also lead the company's efforts to establish new joint ventures in eastern Europe. 'There are delays and difficulties, but Romania and Bulgaria are a promising market for us. We plan to start on a small scale, opening an Eldoor shop in Bucharest as a joint venture, and then another in Sofia,' says Mr Vasili Takas, managing director. Fast food, soft lighting and tasty profits THE fastfoodzadiko is now as much a part of the Greece eating scene as the traditional taverna or souvlaki stand. However, McDonald's and Burger King, both fairly recent arrivals in Greece, have some way to go before they can rival Goody's, a Thessaloniki-based restaurant chain with over 60 outlets and aggressive plans for expansion. Mr Achilleus Folias, managing director of the Goody's group, says: 'Everyone associates this business with America. It may sound a bit surprising, but we are the second-largest European hamburger chain, after Quick in France and Belgium.' Goody's introduced franchising to the restaurant business in Greece 10 years ago. But growth has speeded up recently as American hamburger and pizza chains have started opening there. From this year, Goody's plans to open 10 new restaurants a year. Its outlets in 19 Greek towns and cities serve standardised menus of hamburgers, chicken and fish, supplied from its catering and warehouse complex outside Thessaloniki. Group profits last year reached Dollars 3.1m on turnover of Dollars 31.4m. Its production arm, Hellenic Catering, contributes most to overall earnings, with profits last year of Dollars 1.9m on turnover of Dollars 10m. For 1992, the forecast for Hellenic Catering is a 50 per cent increase in turnover, and earnings of Dollars 2.6m. This year, Goody's baking subsidiary is launching new production lines to make what Mr Folias calls 'the extra-soft white bun that goes best with a hamburger.' Meat and fish are imported from western Europe for preparation to European Community food processing standards, he says. 'We keep a close check on quality control at every stage - processing, distribution and points of sale. Everyone employed by a new franchisee comes to Thessaloniki for training.' Goody's has recently altered its strategy, to meet what could be intense competition from the American quick-service chains in the next few years. At new outlets, neon-glare and metallic surfaces are replaced by softer lighting and indoor plants. The menu is broadening to include more salads and, in major cities, salad bars. 'We want to get away from the harsh look. Greek consumers are getting more demanding and more health-conscious,' Mr Folias says. Though quick-service restaurants in Greece are frequented mostly by the 17-24 age group, the new Goody's look is attracting a much wider range of customers. Moving upmarket is also bringing more tourists into outlets in resort areas. The first Goody's franchisee on the island of Crete is the owner of a chain of first-class hotels, in partnership with the managing director of the island's biggest shipping line. The restaurant itself is part of an architecturally ambitious shopping complex on the waterfront at Rethymnon, on the north coast. The company is also preparing to expand abroad. Its first Bulgarian franchise has been agreed, with a restaurant due to open in Sofia in the next few months. Cyprus will come next, while a feasibility study is under way for opening a restaurant in Istanbul. 'The Sofia outlet will be very much a pilot project. There are so many uncertainties in the Bulgarian market - pricing is going to be difficult, for example. On the other hand, Cyprus is an obvious market for us, with a lot of potential.' While franchising will remain the key to growth, Goody's catering service to schools, factory canteens and summer camps is to expand. A Dollars 2.5m investment programme, including a series of satellite kitchens, will raise capacity to over 100,000 meals a day. The other growth area is in confectionery and ice-cream. Floca, an old-established Athens confectionery business acquired by Goody's five years ago, is making profits again. Mr Folias is keen to transfrom it into a nationwide cafe chain on a franchise basis, selling high-quality ice-cream and a restricted range of confectionery. 'The sticky Greek pastry belongs to the past. Lighter confectionery is much more in demand, and at this point we probably have both the infrastructure and the distribution network to support a parallel chain,' he says. New bank has its roots in the north TAXI-DRIVERS in Thessaloniki like to joke about Egnatia Bank, because its biggest branch is in a field near the airport - hardly a promising site for attracting customers. The building in question houses the bank's Dollars 8m computer system, one of the most advanced in Europe and the key to Egnatia's plans for becoming an international bank based in Thessaloniki. Egnatia, which opened its doors late last year, is one of a series of new Greek private banks established by prominent local personalities in shipping, insurance and industry. But it is the only one to have made its headquarters in northern Greece. 'There was clearly room for a bank that could develop a branch network giving priority to the north of the country - though we certainly aren't ignoring Athens,' says Mr Stathis Potamitis, vice-president. The bank's major shareholders are a group of northern Greek businessmen interested in broadening their activities. Its senior managers are Greeks who were persuaded to leave jobs in London, New York or with foreign banks in Athens by the prospect of launching an innovative Greek bank. Egnatia Bank's capital base amounts to Dr6bn (Pounds 18.5m), well above the Dr4bn minimum required for a banking licence in Greece. By the end of this year Egnatia will have 14 branches in operation. It plans to open a representative office in Sofia and add another 10 branches next year 'before we sit back and take stock,' Mr Potamitis says. The emphasis on rapid expansion reflects Egnatia's view that a Greek bank must have a strong deposit base if it is to compete effectively. But this does not mean acquiring an imposing set of assets. 'We haven't spent a drachma on bricks and mortar. All our premises are rented, and that isn't likely to change. The bank is being created around the computer system,' says Mr George Michelis, head of the bank's economic intelligence unit. In addition to keeping costs down by reducing back-office paperwork to a minimum, the computer system is intended to provide a standard of customer service new to a country where cheque books are rarely used and a statement sent by post is a novelty. The system will also be used to design new banking products, taking advantage of each new stage in the liberalisation of Greek banking. 'We want to be able to exploit deregulation as it happens. We aim to have any new product ready within one week,' says Mr Andreas Yiannacopoulos, the bank's automation manager. The system, which uses an IBM mainframe with a software package provided by Hogan, is able to produce on line real-time balance sheets, and can operate in over 20 different currencies. According to Mr Yiannacopoulos, the system is designed so that Egnatia can open a branch in Greece or abroad within two hours of defining the base currency and which reports the branch can produce. However, Egnatia's managers dismiss the suggestion that their technology might be unnecessarily sophisticated for a small and relatively undeveloped banking market. 'We chose the best available technology so that we don't find ourselves in the position of other Greek banks - having to spend a lot more money upgrading the system after two or three years,' Mr Michelis says.</p>

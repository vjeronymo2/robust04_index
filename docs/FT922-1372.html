			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Tax increase cuts Macquarie profits 11% MACQUARIE Bank, the unlisted Australian merchant bank, yesterday revealed that a higher tax charge led to an 11 per cent fall in net profits to ADollars 47.21m (USDollars 35.4m) for the year to March 31, Reuter reports from Sydney. However, Mr Tony Berg, managing director, said the bank expected an increase in earnings in the current year because of growth in its businesses through better trading conditions and new products and services. Macquarie is 16 per cent owned by Hill Samuel Bank, the UK merchant bank which is part of the TSB group. Mr Berg said Hill Samuel was going ahead with plans to sell its stake in Macquarie Bank by December 31. Macquarie said pre-tax profit for the year to March 31 rose 4 per cent to ADollars 76.39m. Tax expenses rose to ADollars 29.18m from ADollars 20.59m. Mr David Clarke, chairman, said: 'The 12 months ending March 31 1992 were difficult for Australia and even more difficult for its banking sector. 'While the recession has affected several of the bank's businesses, it has given us the opportunity to make gains through capitalising on difficult market conditions to increase our market share,' he said. Total assets were steady at ADollars 2.36bn at March 31, while group shareholders' funds rose to ADollars 272.8m during the year from ADollars 236.5m. Provisions for bad debts, mostly on property loans, fell to ADollars 10.2m, from ADollars 16.2m in 1990-91. Mr Berg said he expected moderate growth in the Australian economy in the current year, but there was unlikely to be significant growth in corporate or financial market activity. Macquarie said 27.6 per cent of its income came from trading businesses in the year to March 31, 34.6 per cent from fees and commissions and 37.6 per cent from interest margins.</p>

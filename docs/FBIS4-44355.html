			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Press Release No. IP/94/39: "Russia and European Union </F> Reach Historic Agreement To Deepen Trade and Political Ties"]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The European Union and the Russian Federation have reached a  major agreement that will boost their economic and political  ties, increase trade and hold out the prospect for a free trade  area between Europe and Russia. Now that the final obstacles  have been removed, the way is clear for the new partnership and  cooperation agreement to be signed in Corfu by Boris Yeltsin,  the leaders of the Twelve EU member states and the European  Commission on June 24-25. It marks the most ambitious agreement  ever signed between the Russian Federation and one of its major  world partners.    The agreement, negotiated over one and a half years by the  European Commission will gradually draw the economies of Russia  and the European Union closer together by lifting trade  barriers, offering greater certainty to traders and investors  and promoting the direct investment that the Russian economy  needs. It also paves the way for negotiations on a free trade  area after 1998, while establishing regular political contacts  at all levels and promoting respect for democracy and human  rights.    Welcoming the signature of the agreement, Sir Leon Brittan,  European commissioner for external economic relations, issued  the following statement:    "By creating a relationship between the European Union and  Russia rooted in friendship, cooperation and mutual economic  interest, this agreement marks a milestone on the road towards  greater economic and political stability across the entire  continent. It builds a solid framework based on mutual respect.  For European companies particularly, it will encourage  investment in Russia by ensuring they are treated as fairly as  domestic companies while guaranteeing them the right to  repatriate profits earned on the Russian market. And it will  help cement reform in Russia by offering the prospect of free  trade in the next century if Russia's reforms are sufficiently  advanced by 1998."    On this occasion Hans van den Broek, commissioner for  external political relations, stated:    "This agreement will set the European Union's political ties  with Russia on a far sounder footing by ensuring that heads of  government, ministers and officials meet regularly and  systematically rather than on an ad hoc basis as at present. It  will establish a regular political dialogue enabling the two  sides to consult whenever the need arises. This should  contribute to overall security and stability in Europe. At the  same time, the agreement, which is based on a shared commitment  to human rights and fundamental freedom, will reinforce  political reform in Russia."  <H5>  The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement Covers Three Main </H5> Areas:     -  Political dialogue    -  Trade relations    -  The investment  and business environment.   <H5>  Significant Areas of Agreement Include: </H5>    -  Substantial  elimination of restrictions on Russian exports to the European  Union    -  Rules on trade in nuclear materials    -  Steps to open up the  flow of capital and improve conditions for business    -  Agreement on  arrangements to allow banks and other financial services  providers from the European Union to operate in Russia    -  A  provision that the agreement could develop into a free trade  agreement covering cross-border trade in services, the freedom  of establishment of companies and capital movements.     One of the bases of the agreement is the commitment by both  sides to respect the rule of law, to safeguard ethnic  minorities, and to uphold human rights and multi-party  democracy, while stating that the establishment of a market  economy in Russia is of paramount importance.  <H5>  The Details of the Agreement </H5> <H5>  Political Dialogue </H5>   The agreement seeks to strengthen political links between  the  EU and Russia by establishing a regular political dialogue  between the two sides. The Russian president will meet the  president of the European Council and Commission twice a year,  besides regular meetings between ministers and civil servants.  Dialogue will also be encouraged at parliamentary level. In  addition, a cooperation council has been set up to monitor the  agreement, also enabling the two sides to seek to bring together  their positions on international issues of mutual concern, and  cooperate more closely to ensure that the principles of  democracy and human rights are respected.    Trade Relations    The agreement provides a framework which will allow Russia  to  become integrated into a wider European economic area. 1998 has  been set as the date when the parties will meet to review  progress in economic reform and decide whether to move towards a  free trade agreement. The agreement does not seek to remove all  tariffs right away, for Russia currently has a far higher tariff  wall against EU imports than vice-versa, (the average weighted  Russian tariff to the EU [European Union] is currently 12-14  percent while the average EU tariff to Russia is under 1  percent) suggesting that Russian industry would need time to  adjust before tariffs were removed altogether.    The partnership and cooperation agreement also supports  Russia's future accession to the General Agreement on Trade and  Tariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a move  actively supported by the EU. It does this by already referring  to certain GATT provisions while setting up a reviewing  mechanism which will allow the agreement to be adapted to  accommodate Russia's progressive adoption of various articles of  the GATT.    The partnership and cooperation agreement confirms the  removal of all quotas and other quantitative restrictions on  Russian exports to the European Union, with the exception of  certain textile and steel products. Russia does not currently  impose any quantitative restrictions on European Union imports.  however, the partnership and cooperation agreement recognises  that Russia may need to introduce certain restrictions, given  the extensive restructuring of the Russian economy. Russia  therefore may under certain circumstances introduce some  restrictions in sectors which are curently being restructured,  or where there are serious social problems, or where Russian  companies face near elimination of market share or where new  industries are emerging.    These restrictions, however, can only apply for limited  quantities of goods and for a limited time. Any proposed  restrictions will be discussed between Russia and the European  Union before they are applied.    Under the agreement, both sides agree to consult one another  before increasing tariffs on each other's imports. This is an  important provision. In 1993, Russia exported ECU14.8 billion  ($17.4 billion) of goods to the member states of the European  Union, representing almost 50 per cent of its total exports. In  the same period European Union exports to Russia were worth  ECU11.5 billion ($13.5 billion). Since Russia is not yet a  member of GATT, Russia is largely free to impose tariff  protection. It is therefore necessary to ensure that there is  adequate consultation on any proposed increase in tariffs.    The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement also includes a  safeguard clause, similar to that in the GATT, which protects  against substantial injury to domestic producers. This means  that before curbing imports in a given product, Russia or the EU  must show that there has been both a surge in imports and  substantial injury caused to domestic competitors as a result --  either through loss of market share or a fall in profits, for  example. The agreement also clarifies the terms on which  defensive measures may be used against unfairly subsidised or  "dumped" imports. In fact the impact of EU safeguards and  anti-dumping measures has had only a negligeable economic  impact. Only seven products from ex-USSR have faced  anti-dumping duties, while a further eight cases are under way.  Even if these led to anti-dumping action, the total volume of  EU imports from ex-USSR affected would be a mere one percent.    The agreement also contains rules on the trade in nuclear  materials -- both enriched and natural uranium - an issue which  had significantly delayed the negotiation process given the  concern of some EU countries about the impact of increased  Russian imports on their producers. Trade in nuclear materIals  is now covered by the agreement. The two sides will seek to  negotiate a separate agreement covering nuclear fuels by 1997.  A special safeguard provision will apply to trade in nuclear  materials under which the EU will have to show that imports of  Russian uranium have either increased greatly, or are causing  injury to EU uranium producers, before invoking safeguard  restrictions on those imports (i.e. the terms of the previous  1989 ex-USSR agreement)  <H5>  Investment and Business Environment </H5>   The partnership and cooperation agreement introduces some  important initiatives which will improve the ability of  companies from the European Union to operate in Russia and also  improve the climate for direct investment -- a critical issue  given the vast investment needs of the Russian economy. The  first steps in opening up the flow of capital have been taken.  Direct investment in Russia by companies or individuals from  the EU will be freely allowed, as will be the repatriation of  such investments and the profits from them, removing one of the  major disincentives to foreign companies investing in Russia.    As a general principle, European companies will be able to  set up in Russia under conditions at least as favourable as  other foreign companies, and once set up will be treated at  least as favourably as Russian or other foreign companies. The  same will be the case for Russian companies in the European  Union. Once established in Russia, a European Company cannot be  subjected to more restrictive legislation which comes into force  up to three years afterwards.    Russian banks will be able to establish a subsidiary in the  European Union and in return, the Russian market will be  progressively opened up to European banks. This is a  significant step, given that most foreign banks are currently  prohibited from any activity with Russian clients. Moreover,  Russia has agreed to abolish a decree by 1996 which would have  maintained curbs on foreign banks, while assuring that this law  will not apply to those five European banks - Dresdner Bank,  Credit Lyonnais, Generale de Banque of France, Ingbank and ABN,  AMRO of the Netherlands -- which had already been granted  licences to operate in Russia.    The agreement also establishes a framework for insurance  companies in the European Union who wish to enter the Russian  market and also for Russian insurance companies who wish to do  the same in the European Union. Conditions for businessmen and  employees will be improved. There will be nondiscriminatory  treatment of employees once they are legally employed in an EU  member state or in Russia. Mobility of key personnel on  temporary corporate transfers will be increased and the  cooperation council will examine the whole area of business  conditions, including the prompt issuing of visas and residence  permits.    All these initiatives, in both the trade and investment  sectors, will be supported by specific arrangements on taxation,  competition, approximation of legislation and the protection of  intellectual property rights.    The partnership and cooperation agreement also fosters  economic cooperation in a wide range of areas. The objective of  such cooperation is the expansion of the economies of both  Russia and the European Union.    The European Union will provide support for economic  cooperation through the TACIS [Technical Assistance to the CIS]  programme, which fosters the development of harmonious and  prosperous economic links between the European Union and the new  independent states. Through TACIS, the EU has committed some  ECU500 million ($588 million) to Russia between 1991 and 1993,  mainly to promote nuclear safety, restructure state-run  companies, set up public administrations and boost efficiency in  farming, energy, transport and telecommunications, as well as  providing emergency aid.    The partnership and cooperation agreement will only come  into  force after it has been ratified by the parliaments of the  member states of the European Union, the European Parliament and  the federal assembly of the Russian Federation. The European  Commission will therefore prepare an interim agreement which  will allow trade related aspects to be applied as early as  possible.  <H5>  Trade Between the European Union and Russia </H5>   European Union's trade balance (in goods) with the former  Soviet Union:    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |EU Exports        |EU Imports        |EU Deficit        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992              |ECU13.5 billion   |ECU17.7 billion   |ECU4.2 billion    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993              |ECU15.8 billion   |ECU18.5 billion   |ECU2.7 billion    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993*             |ECU11.5 billion   |ECU14.8 billion   |ECU3.3 billion    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |*(Russia only)                                                             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The European Union is far and away the biggest importer of  Russian goods. figures for 1992 show that the EU's imports from  the ex-USSR were 27 times greater than those imported by the  United States (637 MECU [million ECU] ), 9 times greater than by  Japan (ECU1.9 billion) and 6 times greater than by the EFTA  [European Free Trade Association] countries (ECU3.1 billion).  About half of the ex-USSR's total exports are sold to the EU,  while some 40-45 percent of its imports come from the EU.  Furthermore, the EU has become an increasingly important trading  partner both for Russia and for the whole of the ex-USSR since  the old system collapsed.    In 1993, EU imports from Russia were predominantly minerals  (44 percent) and metals (14 percent), wood and wood products (3  percent) chemicals and allied industries (4 percent). The share  of imports taken up by products considered especially sensitive  to European industry (steel, textiles, nuclear materials,  aluminium, fish) is around 11 percent.    Russian imports from the EU in 1993 were predominantly  electrical and mechanical machines and parts (30 percent),  processed foodstuffs (16 percent), vehicles and aircrafts (11  percent), chemicals and allied products (7 percent), optical and  medical equipment and other precision tools (4 percent),  plastics and rubber (2 percent).    Russia accounts for a little over three quarters of the EU's  trade with the ex-USSR.</p>

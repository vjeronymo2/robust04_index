			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Letter: Bundesbank policy is right Sir, In your comments on the latest move by the Bundesbank, you argue that the narrowing of the difference between the discount and Lombard rate to 1 percentage point may produce an increase of the latter fairly soon because of the unusually small gap between the two ('Stay in the ERM vice', July 17). In fact, from 1948 to 1958 - with two short interruptions - the difference was always 1 percentage point; from 1969 to 1984 the evidence is mixed and only from 1985 onwards has the difference always been more than 1 percentage point. But the Bundesbank has indicated several times that it prefers not to have a wide difference between its key interest rates. Nevertheless, the question raised seems to be very valid. If money supply growth were still around 8 per cent this autumn and the world economy were showing clear signs of a recovery by then, the possibility of an increase in the Lombard rate cannot be excluded. Whether Europe likes it or not, the Bundesbank policy is exactly that required by the Maastricht treaty, with price trends in the EC still a far cry from stability.

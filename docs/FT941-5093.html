			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Valmet sells unit for FM600m In a significant pre-privat-isation restructuring within Finland's state-controlled industry, Valmet, the paper machinery and engineering group, is to sell its transportation and tractor business to Sisu-Auto, maker of heavy trucks, military vehicles and freight-moving equipment, for FM600m (Dollars 107.8m). Both companies are on the list of state-owned groups which the centre-right government intends to at least partially sell, although no timetable has yet been specified. The sale is designed to narrow further the focus of Valmet, which is 73 per cent state-owned, on forestry industry processing machinery before implementation of the government's plan to lower its stake to between 30 and 50 per cent. Valmet said the move would have a neutral effect on profits - which reached FM100m last year - while strengthening its equity-to-assets ratio. At the same time, the deal will transform Sisu-Auto, now 98 per cent state-owned, from a company with sales last year of FM918m to a group with combined 1993 sales of FM4.26bn and production plants in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Portugal, the US and Brazil. The merged businesses last year produced profits after financial items of FM82m. The government plans to lower its holding in Sisu-Auto to between 50 and 65 per cent. Valmet is to retain a 24 per cent stake in the new company worth FM185m. This stake was part of the net purchase price of FM600m, Valmet said.</p>

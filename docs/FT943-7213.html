			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian farm returns boosted by livestock Australian farmers saw an overall 4 per cent increase in prices received in 1993-94. But the improvement, which compared with a 2.1 per cent fall in 1992-93, was largely due to higher returns from livestock and wool. Crop prices were generally lower than in the previous year. The figures, produced by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and published yesterday, showed that cattle prices increased by 14 per cent, thanks to a reduction in slaughterings and higher export prices. Prices of lambs and sheep rose by 12 and 23 per cent respectively, while wool prices were 3.9 per cent higher. Grain prices, by contrast, fell for the second year in succession, with a 6.7 per cent decrease in 1993-94 following the 4.6 per cent dip in 1992-93. The price fall for barley was 13 per cent and for wheat, 9.6 per cent. Only a few crops bucked the trend: sugar prices, for example, rose 12 per cent and tomato returns were up 30 per cent. Wine grape growers enjoyed a 17 per cent rise, while cotton prices were up 5.5 per cent. The index of prices paid by farmers rose by only 2.6 per cent, with the most noticeable increases coming for store and breeding stock and for plant and equipment.</p>

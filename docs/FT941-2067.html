			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Financial services demand The diplomatic manoeuvring for the post-Marrakesh Gatt negotiations gathered pace yesterday after France called for the European Union to take a tougher line with the US and other Gatt members in the long-running negotiations over liberalising financial services. In a strongly worded memorandum issued to a meeting of finance ministers on Monday, France demanded that the EU retain its threat to maintain 'reciprocal' restrictions in Europe's financial services if the US and others did not offer to liberalise theirs. 'In the context of (continuing discrimination against European banks). . . . the European Union should not abandon its recourse to reciprocity,' the memorandum said. This step would be needed to protect European banks from the risk of discrimination in other markets. The EU is due to reopen formal discussions with the US and other Gatt members over the liberalisation of the financial services after next month's Marrakesh meeting. They failed to reach agreement over the issue at the final Gatt meeting last December. So far, the Commission has refused to indicate whether Union would maintain reciprocal controls if these new negotiations fail to reach an accord within the six-month deadline set for them. The barriers, which were introduced under a recent European banking directive, allow the EU to take action against the banks of countries which are imposing similar restrictions. But Brussels officials yesterday insisted that the Commission was unlikely to bow to French demands. 'The common position among the member states is let's wait and see what happens in the negotiations,' said one.</p>

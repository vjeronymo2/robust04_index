			<p>BFN     [Text] The elections of the president and local power  bodies scheduled for 26 June in Ukraine can lead to a  confrontation between the head of the state and the parliament,  believes Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk.    Speaking at a press conference on his return from  Luxembourg,  Kravchuk declared that a referendum would actually take place in  Ukraine on 26 June.    "If the people come to elect the president they will  actually  give their backing to the presidential-parliamentary form of the  state system," he believes.    Kravchuk underlined that in the course of the 26 June  elections the president would be elected in accordance with the  acting Constitution--both as the head of the state and the head  of the executive power.    In this case, he emphasized, in the future the legislature  should be brought in line with this provision. "If the Supreme  Soviet refuses to do this then a confrontation will be  inevitable," declared Kravchuk, who running for the presidency  for the second term.    On Tuesday [14 June], Ukraine's Supreme Soviet declined  amendments to the decree on the formation of local  self-management bodies which stipulates that heads of local  councils should be subordinated to the president. The present  law preserves their subordination to the government and to the  council standing above them.    According to observers, this will lead to a sharp  restriction  of the president's influence in domestic policy.    "Somebody wants to make these elections into a farce," said  Kravchuk. He said that "at first the deputies voted for  nationwide elections of the president" and then started to  restrict his authorities.    Kravchuk was also critical of the position of communists in  the parliament who speak about the need to abolish the  presidency in the Republic. He called their actions "a  strategy" which is intended "to bar movement forward."</p>

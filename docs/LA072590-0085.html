			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL VOTE TO EXPAND SUNSHINE LANDFILL ON SCHEDULE;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS: BOARD HAS A CHANGE OF HEART ON DELAYING ACTION. OPPONENTS BLAME  LOBBYING BY THE DUMP'S OPERATOR.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors refused Tuesday to delay a vote  scheduled for today on the controversial proposal to expand the Sunshine Canyon  landfill.  </P> <P> The county's Regional Planning Commission is scheduled to vote on  Browning-Ferris Industries' proposal to expand its 230-acre dump near Granada  Hills into 542 acres of unincorporated county land.  </P> <P> The board's inaction Tuesday was a dramatic reversal from last week, when a  board majority indicated sympathy with dump opponents asking for the delay. On  Tuesday, however, neither Ed Edelman nor Kenneth Hahn would even second a  motion by Mike Antonovich to delay the vote.  </P> <P> The board's inaction Tuesday angered dump opponents who wanted more time to  respond to new information that Browning-Ferris included in an environmental  impact report on the project. The Planning Commission appeared to be on the  verge of approving the project in February when a county attorney warned that  the environmental impact report was incomplete.  </P> <P> Dump opponents accused Edelman and Hahn, the board's two liberals, of caving in  under lobbying by Browning-Ferris Industries.  </P> <P> Antonovich also blamed lobbying by BFI and pressure from the city of Los  Angeles, which favors the dump expansion, for changing his colleagues' minds.  </P> <P> "Obviously, Ed Edelman and Kenny Hahn ignored the people's request to have  further input," Antonovich said. "I feel Edelman and Hahn's shortsightedness is  a slap in the face" to the homeowner groups opposed to the project.  </P> <P> Chris Funk, an attorney for Browning-Ferris, said James E. Hartl, the county's  chief planner, and Browning-Ferris explained to the supervisors during the past  week why their initial vote was misguided.  </P> <P> "Last week those two people voted without realizing what the process was," Funk  said.  </P> <P> But the politicians and their staff said they changed their minds for other  reasons.  </P> <P> Edelman said he switched sides after learning from the county's top planning  official that the 30-day delay could set the proposed project back several  months. He added that there would be ample time for the landfill's detractors,  who previously testified against the project before the Planning Commission, to  testify again when the project comes before the Board of Supervisors for final  approval.  </P> <P> "The community already has had a public hearing, and we'll have a public  hearing," Edelman said. "No sense setting it back."  </P> <P> Mas Fukai, Hahn's chief deputy, said that discussion with Browning-Ferris  representatives did not influence his boss.  </P> <P> "They will never strong-arm Kenny Hahn," Fukai said.  </P></p>

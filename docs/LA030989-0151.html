			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Ronnie Harmon testified that his education at the University of Iowa was not a  joke, as an attorney in the fraud trial of two sports agents questioned the  running back on why he was allowed to play football despite failing grades.  </P> <P> Harmon, the government's first witness in the trial of Norby Walters and Lloyd  Bloom in Chicago, acknowledged that he was put on academic probation at the end  of his junior year and took a summer course in water-color painting, for which  he got a D.  </P> <P> But Harmon, now with the Buffalo Bills, and Iowa officials said his grades  never left him ineligible for football. And the officials said that Harmon was  given no special treatment.  </P></p>

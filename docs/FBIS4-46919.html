			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Representative Authority </F> Consolidates Its Status (Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies  Third Session)"]    [Text] As distinct from the first two, the agenda of the  third session of the oblast soviet of deputies, which opened  yesterday, was more than full. It included the following items:    --structure of the administrative machinery of the  Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies;    --budget of the oblast for the second quarter and 1994;    --oblast soviet of deputies' expenditure estimates;    --rate of profits tax and enterprise and organization  property tax;    --the law "Legislative Activity in Novosibirsk Oblast";    --draft plan of legislative work of the oblast soviet of  deputies;    --standing orders of the Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of  Deputies;    --the law "Support for the Activity of the Deputies of the  Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies" and others.    But the first matter considered by the session concerned  personnel--the deputy chairman of the soviet. Addressing the  deputies, A. Sychev, chairman of the soviet, moved that the  candidacy of Deputy V.Ya. Karpov be considered for this office.  There were no other nominations. Vladimir Yakovlevich Karpov was  elected deputy chairman of the oblast soviet of deputies by  ballot (24 in favor, 8 against).    On the basis of A.P. Sychev's report the session approved  the  structure and list of personnel of the administrative machinery  of the oblast soviet of deputies numbering 50 persons. The  following committees were approved as part of the soviet: for  fiscal, tax, and financial and credit policy; for economics,  interregional foreign economic relations, and property  management; for industry and the production infrastructure; for  social questions, agrarian policy, and the consumer market; for  social policy, health care, research, education, and culture;  for the environment and natural resources; for legislation and  interaction with the local government authorities, political  parties, grassroots movements, and the news media; a consultant  will operate under the auspices of each committee.    The soviet resolved to create on a permanent basis the  institution of oblast soviet deputy assistants.    The deputies examined and approved oblast soviet expenditure  estimates of R700 million for the maintenance of the  administrative machinery of the soviet itself and R147 million  for the support of the activity of the deputies. Having received  the report of I.Yu. Glebova, deputy chief of the Office of  Finance and Taxation Policy of the oblast administration, the  session approved the statute "Rate of Profits Tax on Particular  Types of Income and Enterprise and Organization Property Tax and  Stamp Tax for the Registration of Enterprises With Foreign  Investments." Specifically, the following rate of profits tax to  be paid into the oblast treasury was approved: for banks and  insurance organizations--30 percent; for exchanges and broker's  offices--32 percent; on the income from video rooms and the  rental of video and audio cassettes and recordings on them--57  percent of income; on income from casinos and gaming houses--77  percent (the decision on this will be published in full).    Active discussion was evoked by the question of the law "The  Oblast Budget for 1994." Deputies G.V. Ivashchenko, A.I.  Bulgakov, A.P. Melnikov, A.S. Plyushkin, A.K. Khilchenko, N.G.  Krasnikov, A.A. Stepanov, K.L. Komarov, G.I. Makarenko, and P.N.  Isayev spoke in the debate on this item.    The soviet approved the amount of revenue and expenditure of  the oblast budget at R970.461 billion. Of these, R311.821  billion will go to finance the economy. Some R239.345 billion  have been appropriated for the financing of socio-cultural  measures.    Discussion of the items on the session agenda continued at  the evening sitting.</p>

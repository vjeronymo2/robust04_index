			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: French Connection dives Pounds 8m into the red FRENCH CONNECTION Group, the USM-quoted clothing wholesaler and retailer which has recently undergone substantial changes of management and activities, plunged from profits of Pounds 57,000 into pre-tax losses of Pounds 7.95m in the year to January 31 1992. Despite the 'entirely unsatisfactory' results, the group won the continued support of its bankers about six weeks ago. 'We showed them a budget they could live with and a strategy they could understand,' Mr George Wardale, chairman, said. At the year-end bank borrowings stood at Pounds 6.7m, against shareholders' funds of Pounds 3m. Of the Pounds 49.9m (Pounds 56.7m) turnover, only Pounds 3.1m had been contributed by Bukta Connection, the specialist company making replica football strips and not part of French Connection's core that last month was sold to its management. After exceptional costs of Pounds 2.93m - Pounds 1.4m in respect of provisions against stock losses in Bukta and Pounds 1m for losses of the group's discontinued operations - and before interest payable of Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 1.24m), operating losses were Pounds 6.87m (profits Pounds 1.3m). Mr Wardale said some Pounds 2.5m of these losses derived from Bukta. Extraordinary charges of Pounds 2.19m related to trading losses of - and the loss on the sale of - Bukta. Losses per share emerged at 40.6p (earnings 1.4p). Having passed the interim dividend, the final is also omitted. Previously a total of 2.7p was paid. Mr Wardale, who was previously chief executive of Highland Spring, the bottled water company, for six years, said that recessions show up the cracks in companies and 'our cracks were large'. Apart from an inability to manage well, he said, the previous management had become involved in non-essential parts of the business. Bukta had branched out into shell suits which it had not been able to move. French Connection (Germany) was closed in January 1990. In September and November respectively, Mr Michael Shen, group chief executive, and Mr Stephen Malme, finance director, were dismissed. to Mr Wardale this April and in Mr Wardale's words 'has moved back to centre stage concentrating on the product side' as chief executive. Mr John Ellis has been brought in as finance director. Mr Shen and Mr Malme won damages and an apology from the group for wrongful dismissal and its allegations of 'gross misconduct'. Mr Shen was also paid Pounds 1m owed him by the group. Mr Wardale said that, coming into a fight that had already started, he decided that 'the interests of the group and its shareholders were not served by the continuation of the dispute'. He felt that the whole board held 'common responsibility for the not very distinguished performance'.</p>

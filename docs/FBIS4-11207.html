			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Otero and Vilma Figueroa] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino has described as  "unfortunate" U.S. Senator John Kerry's recent statements  harshly criticizing the Panamanian Government's lack of  cooperation with the United States in curbing drug trafficking.    Kerry, a Democratic senator from the state of Massachusetts  and chairman of the U.S. Senate's hearings on terrorism,  narcotics, and international crime, stated last Saturday that  although "organized" crime prevailed in Panama during the regime  of former General Manuel Antonio Noriega, "disorganized" crime  now persists under the Guillermo Endara administration.    Mulino, who recently traveled to the Vatican and Russia on  diplomatic visits, pointed out to Radio KW Continente that he  believes Kerry's statements are `unfortunate' that they should  not be interpreted as originating from the U.S. Government. The  foreign minister also stressed that the U.S. senator's  statements "have not been very prudent."    Mulino explained: "The entire world is aware of the efforts  we have made, despite our government's economic and human  resource limitations, to straighten out what Noriega left us in  1989 after being deposed by the U.S. invasion."    On the other hand, the foreign minister also referred to  statements by Robert Gelbart, deputy assistant secretary of  state for inter-American affairs, who acknowledged Panama's  efforts against drug trafficking and the importance of a  high-level meeting between the two nations to discuss the issue,  as proposed by Panama.    Meanwhile, legislator Leo Gonzalez admitted Panama has not  done enough about the problem of money laundering via  corporations, and this is where the focus of all U.S. Government  complaints lies. According to Gonzalez, the struggle against  drug trafficking has been tremendous, but the government has  fallen short in combating money laundering, which is the one  activity that ensures the drug traffickers' survival.</p>

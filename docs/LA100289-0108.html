			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ZENITH CORP. SELLING COMPUTER BUSINESS TO FRENCH COMPANY  </P> <P> Zenith Electronics Corp. said today that it is selling its fast-growing  computer group to the French company Groupe Bull to concentrate on consumer  electronics, the weaker segment of its business.  </P> <P> Zenith is the last major U.S.-headquartered manufacturer of televisions, a  business that has usually lost money for the company in recent years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Zenith said in a statement that it expects the purchase price for the computer  business to be less than $635 million, with the exact amount to be based on the  net asset value of the computer business when the deal is closed, probably by  the end of the year.  </P> <P> The deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.  </P> <P> Sales of Glenview, Ill.-based Zenith's computer systems and components expanded  23% to $1.6 billion last year contrasted to a 2.7% increase in  consumer-electronics sales, which totaled $1.1 billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Large Amount of Debt  </P> <P> Despite its fast growth, Zenith Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said the computer  business is saddled with a large amount of debt that has restricted Zenith's  ability to realize the full potential of its consumer electronics division.  </P> <P> "Zenith will emerge as a conservatively financed company better prepared to  capitalize on our strengths in consumer electronics," Pearlman said in a  statement.  </P> <P> Zenith said it will concentrate on "new consumer electronics and component  technologies, particularly high-definition television and advanced  high-resolution color displays."  </P> <P> Zenith's stock surged more than $2 a share, to $16.75 from Friday's close of  $14.50, in early trading today on the New York Stock Exchange. Pearlman  estimated the book value of Zenith's stock after the sale at $19 a share.  </P> <P> Charles Ryan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said the deal represents  good value for stockholders. He said that with the proceeds from the sale,  Zenith could retire about $300 million of its debt load and invest heavily in  emerging video technologies such as high-definition television and its own  flat-mask video display, an industry standard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Turned Profit Last Year  </P> <P> "This takes a company in the red that was becoming quite financially shaky into  very sound financial condition," Ryan said.  </P> <P> Zenith spokesman John Taylor said the company had $167 million in short-term  debt and $309 million in long-term debt at the end of the second quarter.  </P> <P> Zenith turned a profit of $11.7 million last year -- its first annual profit in  four years -- but had a net loss of $17 million for the first half of 1989.  </P> <P> The agreement marks the French company's second acquisition of a U.S. computer  maker. In 1987 it became the major shareholder of Honeywell Bull, which took  over the $2-billion computer business of Honeywell Inc.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Zhongfan (2621 1813 0416) of the State </F> Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, and editor  Wang Yun (3769 5366): "Analysis and Forecast of 1994 Development  of the National Economy"]    [Text] In early 1992, after Comrade Deng Xiaoping spoke on  his southern tour, China's economic development entered a new  stage of rapid development, prominently expressed in the  following five aspects: The first is the rapid growth of the  national economy and a large increase in the wealth of society.  The second is an obvious upturn in economic performance. The  composite economic performance of enterprises, on the basis of  the 6 percentage point improvement in 1992 over the previous  year, also clearly improved in 1993. The third is the  breakthrough achieved in price reform. With the economic life of  society rather stable, the prices of 80 percent of means of  production and 90 percent of means of subsistence have been  freed up. The fourth is the initial improvement achieved in the  industrial structure, concentrated in the rather rapid  development of tertiary industry, especially the soaring  development of railroads and highways. The fifth is the rapid  expansion of the opening to the outside, in the the broadening  of the scope, as well as the use of foreign investment and the  development of foreign trade, we have achieved great results  universally acknowledged. Practice proves that Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's speech was completely accurate. If we only  conscientiously implement the spirit of his "speech," 1994 will  be another year of rapid development for the national economy.  We have conducted a rather scientific proof of this. Based on  the economic model already established, we have calculated  eighteen programs of the 1994 macroeconomic arrangement and  after analyzing and summarizing them, we believe that despite  the fact that there are several contradictions in the economic  development, prospects are optimistic and it is totally possible  to achieve rapid development.    I. Guiding Thought of the Macroeconomic Arrangement    Based on 1993 macroeconomic performance and proof of the  feasibility of the 1994 macroeconomic arrangement, we believe  that the guiding thought for the 1994 macroeconomic arrangement  should be to continue to concentrate on improving economic  performance, stress increased enterprise vitality and conversion  of operating mechanisms, maintain the overall stable growth of  newly added credit, and move the national economy toward more  normal systemic circulation. At the same time, we should  appropriately control the growth of overall investment in fixed  assets of the whole society to ensure a basic balance in overall  supply and overall demand in the whole society and  correspondingly adjust the structure and continue to slant  policy toward development of the transportation and energy  industries and improvement in farmers' income.    II. Appropriately Control the Growth of Overall  Investment in Fixed Assets of the Whole Society    In the last two years, investment in the fixed assets of the  whole society has grown very rapidly. In 1992 the growth rate  was 37.6 percent and the investment rate (the ratio of  investment in fixed assets of the entire society to gross  national product (GNP)) was 31.6 percent. In 1993 the growth  rate is expected to be about 40 percent and the investment rate  37 percent, thereby causing the average annual growth rate for  the five years between 1989 and 1993 to rise to about 20 percent  and the average annual investment rate to reach about 30  percent. Without a doubt, the rapid growth in fixed asset  investment has driven the rapid development of the national  economy. In the two successive years 1992 and 1993, the growth  rate of the GNP reached as high as 13 percent, causing the  average growth rate for GNP for two successive years for 1989 to  1993 to reach 8.54 percent. Obviously, with the rapid growth of  fixed asset investment in these two years, the investment rate  has essentially been restored to normal and rapid economic  growth has essentially been formed. On this basis, we believe  that fixed asset investment growth should be appropriately  controlled in 1994. It should not exceed 20 percent, taking  15-81 percent [as written] growth as appropriate. That is,  controlling total investment in fixed assets of the whole  society at about 1.25 trillion yuan to 1.3 trillion yuan, a  nominal increase of 15-18 percent over the previous year.  Discounting the price factor, the actual increase would be about  3-6 percent. And the investment rate would be about 34 percent,  a drop of approximately three percentage points from the  previous year. This way the essential balance of overall supply  and overall demand could be maintained for the whole society and  the sustained rapid development of the national economy could be  maintained, causing the GNP to increase by about 11 percent over  the previous year.    The important thing is that while controlling the growth of  overall investment, we decide to adopt measures to improve  investment performance. In sum, we must adopt three important  measures: The first is to make state enterprises truly become  principal investment bodies responsible for their own profits  and losses. The second is that new starts be linked to  completion of construction and going into operation, the  investment rate be improved, and the growth of new starts be  controlled. The third is that, in accordance with industrial  policy, differential interest rates be implemented on bank loans  for fixed asset investment projects.    III. Continue to Maintain Overall Stable Growth of  Newly Added Credit    To maintain the rapid growth of the national economy, based  on the decline in the economic performance of state enterprises,  the obvious increase in "triangular debt," and the difficulty of  economic operations in the last half of 1993, while  appropriately controlling overall investment in fixed assets of  the whole society, newly added credit must be increased to a  rather great extent, so that the systemic circulation of the  national economy can operate normally. When determining total  newly added credit, we must consider three factors: the first is  the growth of the national economy; the second is changes in the  prices of means of production and means of subsistence; and the  third is the operating needs of the socialist market economy.  So, in determining total newly added credit, we cannot simply  indiscriminately apply the formulas of the past. According to  our calculations, total newly added credit in 1994 should be  between 560 billion yuan and 650 billion yuan, a growth rate of  22-25 percent, roughly equivalent to the average growth rate  from 1984 through 1988. We should soberly consider that if the  scale of newly added credit is too low, it will not be adequate  to alleviate the current difficulties in economic operations and  could quite possibly cause great damage.    It is important that while increasing overall credit, we  must  pay attention to improving credit performance. We must adopt  four measures: The first is that in total newly added credit, we  must increase the ratio of circulation funds loaned to make  current enterprises operate smoothly. The second is that, in  accordance with industrial policy, we implement differential  interest rates and adjust the credit structure to unify the  credit structure with the investment structure. The third is to  fully utilize domestic and foreign funds by flexibly applying  such means as interest rates, bonds, and stocks and raise a  large amount of domestic and foreign funds. If we can reach 500  billion yuan (including savings), it would be a great victory.  The fourth is by rapidly establishing a new financial order that  meets the demands of the socialist market economy system and  permitting short-term interbank loans and various ways of  raising funds, to make funds fully efficient.    IV. Consolidate and Develop the Results of Price Reform  and, Accurately Identifying the Opportune Time, Resolutely  "Merge" Exchange Rates    In the last two years, price reforms have achieved a  breakthrough, freeing up 90 percent of means of subsistence  prices and 80 percent of means of production prices. The "dual  track" price system has nearly been merged into a "single track  system" based on market prices. This reform should be considered  worth the cost, a 12-13 percent rise in the retail price index  for all of society in 1993 and maintaining a corresponding level  in 1994. On this basis, we advocate totally merging petroleum  and coal prices in 1994 with an approximate affect of about 1  percentage point on the retail price index, and we forecast that  the retail price index for the whole society in 1994 will be  11-12 percent. So, we can say that a rational price system  meeting the needs of the socialist market economy is essentially  formed.    Quite obviously, a rational price system demands a  corresponding rational exchange rate system. So, we already have  the basis for "merging" the exchange rate and should not miss  the opportunity to adopt decisive measures and implement  "merging" the exchange rates.    The current issue is whether merging the exchange rates  could  trigger large price increases. Our research indicates that 1994  price increases would not be triggered by excessive demand or  material shortages. The main reason that they would rise still  would be the combined manifestation of the chain reaction from  the rationalization of comparative prices formed in accordance  with market mechanisms after prices are freed up. The 1994  retail price index for the entire society (11-12 percent) is  calculated based on the above determination. So, the merging of  the exchange rates should not have an obvious affect on the  retail price index for the entire society.    V. A Rather Large Increase in Citizen Savings Driven by  Adjustments in the Interest Rate    We once again emphasize that, based on China's national  characteristics, credit is currently an important means of  controlling economic operations and an important channel for  banks to accumulate funds. The situation since reform indicates  that the savings of urban and rural residents are a principal  source for banks to accumulate funds. In the past five years,  they have averaged approximately 70 percent of the year's newly  added credit. Obviously, stable growth in the savings of urban  and rural residents is an important factor in the stable growth  of the economy. So, we must adopt effective measures to cause  citizen savings in 1994 to return to the average levels (30  percent) of the last ten years. The most effective measure is  promptly taking the initiative in adjusting interest rates in  accordance with overall price levels to keep the interest rate  on citizens' savings 2-3 percentage point above the retail price  index for the entire society. That is, in 1994 interest rates on  citizen savings should at least be adjusted up to about 13  percent, striving to have newly-added citizen savings reach  about 450 billion yuan, making up 70-80 percent of newly added  sources of credit funds. So, total newly added currency can be  held within 200 billion yuan, an approximate increase of 34  percent over the previous year and roughly equivalent to the  average increase from 1984 through 1988, extremely significant  for the rapid stable growth of the national economy. If we  analyze the average currency growth rate for the last six years  (1989-1994), the growth rate is only 25 percent, still  approximately eight percentage points lower than the 1984-1988  currency growth rate. Its affect on inflation is not clear.    VI. Continue To Slant Policy Toward Development of the  Transportation and Energy Industries and Increasing Farmers'  Income    In 1994, including 1995, a focus of the macroeconomic  arrangement will be helping to accelerate the resolution of the  "bottleneck" affecting the rapid, sustained, sound development  of the economy in the 1990s. That is, we should implement policy  slanted toward development of the transportation and energy  industries and increasing farmers' income. In developing  transportation, we should ensure that before the end of 1995,  ensuring quality and quantity, we will complete the construction  of the Beijing-Kowloon Railroad and achieve regular service and  railroad transportation totals reaching 1.7 billion tons. The  key to raising farmers' income is opening up farmers' avenues of  employment. Not only must we put forth greater effort to develop  rural enterprises, but we also must formulate preferential  policies for converting the rural labor force to other  industries. At the same time, we must further publicize science  and technology on a greater scale and with higher goals and more  strongly support and promote the effective "Spark Plan" and  develop the rural information industry and effectively guide the  farmers in developing production and striving for a rather  obvious increase in farmers' net income, with the actual growth  rate in the annual income reaching 5 percent or more.    VII. The Key Is To Improve the Economic Performance of  Large- and Medium-sized State Enterprises    Enterprises economic performance is the basis for the  performance of the entire national economy. Sustained, rapid  development of China's economy must be based on constantly  improving economic results accomplished by enhancing the  vitality of enterprises, especially large- and medium-sized  state enterprises and improving their economic performance.  Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Central Committee,  several effective and bold experiments have been made in this  respect and remarkable results have been accomplished. In sum,  we believe that the following few points are extremely important  for enhancing enterprise vitality and improving their economic  performance:    1. The aim of reform is to free up and develop productivity.  Enterprises are the creators of social wealth and are productive  forces. Therefore, the beginning and the end of all reform  should be helping to enhance enterprise vitality and improve  economic performance. Macroeconomic controls should conform to  and serve this goal. We must conscientiously and resolutely  implement the policy that "the central link in reform of the  entire economic system focussed on the market is enhancing  enterprise vitality, especially enhancing the vitality of large-  and medium-sized enterprises under the ownership of the whole  people." All thinking and measures that are divorced from this  central point fail to grasp the main point and even run counter  to intensification of reform.    2. In the 1990s, the guiding thought for intensification of  enterprise reform still should be resolutely implementing the  proposal made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in May 1992 when he was  inspecting Capital Steel, that "we can only take the approach of  relaxing. Turning on the water raises fish well." We believe  that this is an incisive summary of more than ten years of  enterprise reform and indicates the direction for further  intensifying enterprise reform.    3. Creating an environment of fair competition has become an  important component of intensifying enterprise reform in the  1990s. First, according to the principles of the market economy,  tax burdens should be generally equal for all enterprises,  including "partially or wholly foreign owned" enterprises. Here  we should point out that the tax burdens of state enterprises  should gradually move closer to those of "partially or wholly  foreign owned" enterprises, rather than "partially or wholly  foreign owned" enterprises emulating state enterprises.    4. More than ten years of practicing enterprise reform has  proven that no matter what form of management state enterprises  practice, they must first determine the relationship between  state and enterprise responsibilities, rights, and benefits.  This demarcation of responsibility, rights, and benefits  essentially is the demarcation of social property rights based  on the public ownership system. Making it explicit that state  asset legal person property rights are carried out by  enterprises and the ownership of the assets ultimately falls to  the state is the essential content of the contract management  responsibility system as it has developed up to now. It is  compatible with such forms of management as stock systems and  limited liability companies. On this basis, the management form  of state enterprises can be diversified and gradually  standardized.    VIII. Forecast of Principal Indicators of the 1994  National Economy    On the basis of the guiding thought and main points given  above, after rather detailed proof, we have selected one out of  the 18 plans for macroeconomic arrangement that we believe is  rather feasible. The results of its principle forecasts are as  follows:    1) Input Total fixed asset investment for the entire  society:  1.25 trillion to 1.3 trillion yuan; total newly-added credit:  560 billion yuan to 650 billion yuan.    2) Output 1. Production GNP growth: 10-11 percent. National  income growth: about 10 percent. Growth in total value of  industrial output: about 19 percent; growth in total value of  agricultural output: about 4 percent; growth in total grain  production: about 1.7 percent.    Output 2. Market and prices growth in total social commodity  retail sales: 20 percent; increases in social commodity retail  prices indices: estimated at 11-12 percent.    Output 3. Banking and finance Urban and rural resident  savings: growth 30 percent, new increases will be about 450  billion yuan (driven by adjustments in the interest rates and  ensuring that it is 1-2 percentage points higher than price  indices). New increases in currency circulation: growth 29-34  percent, increased amount 170 billion yuan to 200 billion yuan.  Finances: revenue increase 12.6 percent; expenditure increase  11.2 percent. Financial deficit about 27 billion yuan, making  up approximately 4.8 percent of treasury expenditures.    Output 4. Foreign trade and use of foreign investment total  imports and exports will be about US$224.6 billion, an increase  of about 16 percent. Actual foreign investment used  approximately US$36.9 billion, an increase of approximately 34  percent. Foreign firm direct investment approximately US$27.6  billion, an increase of about 46 percent.    Output 5. Urban and rural resident livelihood Total employee  wages: increase about 18.6 percent. Growth of farmers' annual  per capita net income: 9 percent; Growth of bank wage  expenditures: 25.2 percent.    It can be seen that the above plan is directed at the  problems existing in 1993 economic operations, giving prominence  to credit increases to start normal operation of systemic  circulation of the national economy and appropriately control  the the growth of the scale of investment to ensure a basic  balance in overall supply and overall demand, to orient the  national economy in the direction of sustained, stable, rapid  development.</p>

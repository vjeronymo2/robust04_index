			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The leader of the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), a group in the ruling  coalition, said Tuesday [12 April] that former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  is unlikely to be chosen as a successor to outgoing Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi said, "Mr. Watanabe is outside the  framework of the coalition. I have heard there is considerable  criticism and rejection from opposition and ruling parties  (against Watanabe's premiership). It's not so easy."    "Even if Mr. Watanabe would join the current ruling parties,  how many people can he bring (from the LDP)? I doubt the number  reaches as high as rumored. In that case, it would be quite  difficult for the ruling parties to secure the majority (in the  511-seat House of Representatives)," said Ouchi, the health and  welfare minister.    A senior official of the LDP's Watanabe faction said Monday  that Watanabe plans to form a new parliamentary group in the  lower house in a bid to form a coalition government with three  ruling parties -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito and  the Japan New Party (JNP).    As the combined parliamentary strength of Watanabe's  46-member faction, Shinseito, Komeito and the JNP stands at 161,  Watanabe will need to win support from more than 95 LDP  legislators who belong to other LDP factions in order to hold  the majority seats.    Since last February, Watanabe has repeatedly held meetings  with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is regarded  as the chief coalition strategist.    Shinseito and Komeito -- key forces within the ruling  coalition -- are widely deemed as willing to name Watanabe the  next leader of a new coalition government in an attempt to oust  the Social Democratic Party and new party Sakigake [Harbinger]  from the coalition.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Cross-border deals show strong rise: US reclaims role as magnet for foreign capital, survey reveals Mergers and acquisitions of companies across international borders reached Dollars 77bn (Pounds 50bn) in the first half of 1994, according to a report published yesterday. That represents a 10 per cent increase on the sums spent on deals in the second half of last year but is still below the Dollars 90bn of deals made in the first half of 1993. One of the most striking trends revealed in the report by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy and consultancy firm, is that the US has returned to 'its traditional role as a magnet for foreign capital' helped by the weakness of the dollar and the resurgence of economic growth. In the first six months of the year, foreign companies spent Dollars 26bn on more than 300 acquisitions, joint ventures and minority investments in US companies. Foreign spending in the US is 'on track to surpass last year's total by almost 50 per cent', the survey says. That marks a reversal of the pattern of the last two years, when US companies spent more on acquisitions abroad than foreign companies did in the US. In 1992, US companies spent Dollars 22bn on 824 foreign deals, and imported Dollars 14bn through 528 transactions. Last year, US companies spent Dollars 38bn on 942 deals but foreign companies spent only Dollars 33bn on 570 deals. However, despite the dollar's weakness this year against sterling, the historically strong level of deals between US and UK companies fell by 30 per cent to around Dollars 16bn in the first six months of 1994, the survey says. Last year, UK companies were responsible for four of the six largest foreign takeovers of US companies. But so far this year, SmithKline Beecham's acquisition of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services from United Healthcare has been the only UK deal to figure in the top six foreign takeovers by value as ranked by KPMG. It also notes a 70 per cent drop in spending by Japanese companies on foreign acquisitions, which may reflect political and economic uncertainty. But the drop in the value of US companies, measured in yen, is likely to tempt Japanese companies back into deal making, the survey predicts. The survey also notes that there were sharp drops in spending in acquisition investment in Russia and China, from a combined total of Dollars 22bn in both countries in 1993 to only Dollars 5bn in the first half of 1994. It attributes this to the collapse of the Russian economy and to human rights tensions in China. Following last year's successful completion of the North American Free Trade Agreement, deals across the borders of Nafta countries - the US, Mexico and Canada - appear to be sharply up in the first half of 1994. Despite political unrest in Mexico, deals total Dollars 7bn so far this year, compared to Dollars 11.4bn in the whole of 1993 and Dollars 2.5bn in 1991. The 1994 figures - and the bidding for Del Monte and Westin Hotels - reflect the new aggression of Mexican buyers, the survey notes. Already, in the first six months of 1994, Mexican purchasers have spent as much as they did in the past three years. However the survey comments that, in theory, the lowering of trade barriers through deals such as Nafta 'reduces the need to acquire cross-borders'.

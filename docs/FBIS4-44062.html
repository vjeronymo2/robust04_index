			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with ET-1 Brussels correspondent Kostas </F> Kekis by Kostas Yiannopoulos in Corfu--live]    [Excerpt] The EU [European Union] leaders luncheon has just  ended. During the lunch the leaders would have held informal  discussions. Kostas, do we have any information on their  discussions?    [Kekis] The luncheon agenda included an evaluation of the  results of the European Parliament elections and a discussion on  how to deal with racism and xenophobia in the EU. Regarding the  elections for the European Parliament and according to our  information, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said the European  leaders should not be satisfied with the result because of the  low voter turnout and because some parties with positions  against the Maastricht Treaty have increased their power.  Papandreou....    [Yiannopoulos interrupts] We have a picture now of the  meeting before the luncheon.    [Kekis] Papandreou's view was that the low turnout was due  to  problems faced by the EU, such as unemployment and the loose  promotion of the EU's internal security in the fields of social  protection and solidarity. According to the various  delegations, the same positions were expressed by other leaders  who do not appear satisfied with the result of the elections.  [passage omitted]</p>

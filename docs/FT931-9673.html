			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / CBI urges boost for small businesses THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry yesterday called for higher first-year capital allowances and more generous corporation tax rules for smaller businesses in its 10-point Budget submission. The programme would cost between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn in a full financial year, but Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, argued yesterday that the boost to small businesses would lead to higher tax revenues in the longer term. The main elements of the CBI's proposals are: Permission for smaller companies to write off up to Pounds 200,000 of plant and machinery investment, or 40 per cent of capital investments, whichever is the greater, in the first year. Raising thresholds of corporation tax. The lower threshold, below which companies pay 25 per cent, should increase from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 400,000 and the higher threshold, below which companies pay 35 per cent, should go up from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 2m. Exempting business assets from capital-gains tax after seven years. Tax relief for export promotion spending or increased government grants to help with exports. Deferring capital gains tax on the sale of unquoted equities provided the proceeds are reinvested in unquoted companies. Easing penalties for errors and delays in paying VAT. Punitive surcharges for defaulters should be replaced with penalties closer to commercial rates of interest. The CBI said it was concerned at the proposed abolition of the Business Expansion Scheme at the end of this year and intends to submit plans for a possible replacement, Mr Davies said.</p>

			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Boeing may tie component deals to aircraft sales Boeing, the world's leading aircraft maker, has started a review of purchasing policies aimed at directing future contracts for aircraft parts to countries which buy its aircraft. The review could result in the Seattle-based company shifting purchases away from countries, such as Canada, whose governments and airlines have increasingly opted for European Airbus aircraft. Although no decisions have been taken, a Boeing official said yesterday the review was designed to place work in a way which would 'assist in market access'. Boeing's commercial aircraft division buys components from 323 suppliers in 38 countries outside the US. The company, which has traditionally controlled about 60 per cent of the world's commercial aircraft market but has been facing intense competition from Airbus, is seeking to expand its presence in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market by offering sub-contracting work to Japanese and Chinese manufacturers, and to aircraft makers in other Far Eastern countries. Japanese manufacturers are responsible for about 20 per cent of the work on the Boeing 777, the new twin-engine wide-bodied aircraft that will enter service next year. Airbus is also stepping up competition in these markets, recently announcing a Dollars 25m agreement with the China Aviation Supplies Corporation to set up a flight crew training centre in Beijing. The European consortium has also been in talks with Japanese manufacturers to interest them in possible collaboration over a new 800-seat aircraft. Boeing's move was disclosed by Mr Ron Woodard, president of the company's commercial aircraft group, in a speech to the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada. Mr Woodard complained that the Canadian defence department had not given Boeing an opportunity to bid on replacements for a fleet of ageing Boeing 707 airliners. Instead, the Canadians bought five twin-engine wide-body Airbus A-310s. He noted that Boeing has spent about CDollars 800m (Pounds 370m) annually in Canada over the past three years. But sales had dwindled to about CDollars 30m a year, all on components and not new aircraft. 'Our Canadian business placement must understandably be market based, as it is elsewhere,' Mr Woodard said. 'Boeing supports the principal of the level playing field. We don't ask for special considerations and we don't want to have to compete against special considerations granted (to) others.' Mr Woodard's comments have been interpreted as a shot across the bows of Calgary-based Canadian Airlines International, which is expected to place sizeable orders over the next few years to replace its Boeing 737 twin-engine, narrow-body fleet. The Canadian government is also eyeing an order for search-and-rescue helicopters. Boeing will review its Canadian contracts next week. An official said that the review will would affect not only 130 contractors in Canada, but also two plants in Manitoba and Ontario, which are Boeing's only company-owned manufacturing sites outside the US.

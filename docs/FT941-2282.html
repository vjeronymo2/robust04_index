			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / London post office staff likely to strike Post office counter staff in London look likely to take industrial action before the end of the month. Yesterday it was announced they had voted by a three-to-one majority to back their trade union's call for disruption in protest at main post office closures. There was a 45 per cent turnout in the postal ballot called by the Union of Communication Workers with 664 backing industrial action and 243 voting against. The union's executive committee is due to meet today to decide its next move. Mr Ernie Dudley, the union's national officer for Post Office counter staff, called on the public to join staff in calling for a halt to closures and franchising of services in London. More than 120 main post offices in London have shut since 1989 while across the country 650 have been cut. Mr Dudley said the public was suffering from an inferior service as post office counters were opened in supermarkets. He said: 'They are putting profit before service. They employ staff who are inexperienced, poorly trained and badly paid which causes problems and threatens service quality. These closures are quite simply ripping the heart out of communities.'</p>

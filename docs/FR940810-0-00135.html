			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> A number of participants in the rulemaking, primarily representing industry interests, objected to the proposed requirement for a competent person specifically trained in an EPA-approved course to oversee workers performing small-scale, short duration asbestos jobs. These included: J. Bavan of Michigan Consumers Power (Ex 7&hyph;21), Mr. Quanstrom of Amoco Corporation who felt in-house training was often superior to EPA's (Ex. 7&hyph;37), and others contain virtually identical comments in which the plumbing contractors state their support. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the record evidence, OSHA concludes that its expansion of the competent person requirements and additional requirements for training are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Shipyard Employment Standard <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> SESAC agreed that asbestos operations should be overseen by personnel who have the qualifications to ensure that asbestos operations are performed safely; however, they noted in their submission (Ex. 7&hyph;77) that in existing OSHA shipyard standards, the term competent person(s) has been used to refer to a person who is uniquely qualified to perform entry tests preparatory to entering enclosed and confined spaces and felt that the use of this term as employed in the asbestos standard would cause confusion. They suggested that the competent person be called a ``qualified'' person in the shipyard standard. OSHA does not object to this substitution of terms, but notes that all requirements for competent/qualified person(s) are to be equivalent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SESAC also pointed to a process which may be the general case in large operations, in which the duties of the shipyard qualified person are shared or divided between two or more persons. That is, in some of the larger companies represented on the committee, a training department (not a person) is responsible for ensuring that employees are trained and another department is responsible for setting up the regulated area, while an industrial hygiene department conducts all monitoring. SESAC recommended that this be specifically allowed. OSHA feels that the current regulatory language permits utilizing this organization of responsibilities and agrees with the suggestion that it is appropriate for shipyards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> (p) Dates <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The amendments to the General Industry and Construction Standards and the new Shipyard Employment Standard become effective 60 days after date of publication in the Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . All existing provisions remain in effect (including coverage of Shipyards by the General Industry Standard) until the new provision's start-up dates. Various start-up dates are set forth in the standards. Where there is no start-up date for a provision, the start-up date is the effective date. If any new or amended provision is stayed by OSHA or a court or vacated by a court, the pre-existing provision becomes binding again.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendices A, C, D, E, and F of the General Industry Standard are binding. Appendices A, C, D, and E of the Construction Standard are binding. Appendices A, C, D, E, J, and L are binding in the Shipyard Employment Standard. Appendices B, H, I, and J of the General Industry Standard are not binding. Appendices B, F, H, I, and K of the Construction Standard are not binding. Appendices B, F, H, I, and K of the Shipyard Employment Standard are not binding. They are intended neither to add to or detract from binding requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shipyard Employment Standard. With respect to the appendices to the standard, SESAC recommended inclusion of the appendix dealing with work practices and engineering controls for automotive brake and clutch repair and assembly in the shipyard standard. OSHA agrees that this appendix is appropriate to the shipyard employment standard, since these activities occur within shipyards and has included this as appendix L in the shipyard employment standard. OSHA further notes that this appendix has been amended subsequent to consideration by SESAC, and therefore differs from the alternate regulatory language suggested by the committee. For example, the Agency no longer considers the solvent spray can a preferred method for controlling asbestos contamination and will not include it in either standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All changes indicated in this document are to be made to Appendix A of the asbestos standards and all changes are the same for 1910.1001, 1915.1001, and 1926.1101.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the explanatory paragraph at the beginning of Appendix A phrase:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``(such as the NIOSH 7400 Method)''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> is replaced with:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``(such as Appendix B of this regulation, the most current version of the OSHA method ID&hyph;160, or the most current version of the NIOSH Method 7400).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change is made to assure that the analytical methodologies followed are the most current and reliable available. Appendix B of this standard has been updated and is the most current version of OSHA ID&hyph;160. This method was written to adhere to the language of Appendix A so that there would be no confusion about the limits of the sampling and analytical parameters such as flow rates. So long as parameters consistent with Appendix A are used, there will be no analytical differences between ID&hyph;160 and NIOSH 7400 methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sampling and Analytical Procedure paragraph 2:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

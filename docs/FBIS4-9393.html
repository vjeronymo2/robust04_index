			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 25 April reports on  low-level combat activities in the following parts of the  republic:    The studio announcer says that "the Bihac district has been  exposed to attacks by the joint aggressors: the chetniks and  the paramilitary formations of Fikret Abdic. The chetniks  continue to shell the defense lines." The announcer adds that  "the defense lines on the Bosanska Krupa and Grabez fronts have  also come under attack. Fresh chetnik regrouping has been noted  in this part, too."    Reporting on the situation on the Brcko front, Hamiz  Deronjic  says that "most active on the aggressor's side were the snipers,  who targeted all the defense positions throughout the day. The  enemy also intensified the attacks with small arms and  antiaircraft machine guns along the entire front line. The  areas of the most frequent and strongest attacks over the past  14 days of the enemy offensive -- Vranovaca and Boderiste --  were not spared shelling today either. The chetniks fired 50-  and 82-mm mortars at this part of Brcko's defenses today."    A report by the Information Service of the 1st Corps of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports that "the chetniks disturbed the  deceptive lull on several occasions" in Sarajevo today. It is  reported that "they were most active from the direction of  Vozlica Kuca near Brijesece, from where they used a death sower  and an antiaircraft machine gun and fired rifle grenades at the  town's defense lines. A similar thing happened from their  positions in the so-called Sarabina Kuca, from where they  attacked the free territories using an antiaircraft machine gun  on several occasions."</p>

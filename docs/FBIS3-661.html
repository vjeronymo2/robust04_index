			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Rowan Cronje, Bophuthatswana minister of </F> state; Major-General Jack Turner, commanding officer of the  Bophuthatswana Defence Force; and Major-General P.J. Seleke,  commissioner of the Bophuthatswana police force; issued by the  Information Service of Bophuthatswana on the SAPA PR Wire  Service]    [Text] The Bophuthatswana government this morning announced  that the situation in Mmabatho/Mafikeng had been brought under  control during the course of the night, and that actions were  being implemented to restore full stability.    Mr Cronje stressed however, that an offer of assistance from  the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement] (AWB),  had been declined. As a result, any AWB presence in the  Mmabatho/Mafikeng area is without the knowledge or consent of  the Bophuthatswana authorities. Minister Cronje said: "The  presence of AWB contingents in Bophuthatswana would not be  acceptable in terms of the morale of our security forces and in  view of the political sensitivity of the current situation.  This was firmly explained to AWB leader, Mr Eugene Terreblanche.    Major-General Turner disclosed that during the course of  last  night's defensive action by the Bophuthatswana security forces -  which took the form of a joint operation between the  Bophuthatswana Defence Force and the Bophuthatswana police --  one person had died and 36 had been wounded -- 12 seriously --  in clashes between security forces and unruly elements.    General Turner said the injured had been transported to  Mafikeng's Victoria Hospital by military personnel where medical  attention had been provided throughout the night.    In the course of the security force action, a limited number  of rounds of live ammunition had unavoidably been fired, in  addition to birdshot and rubber bullets. Injuries sustained had  been almost entirely in the stomach and leg region.    General Turner added: "This was a tragedy which is deeply  regretted. The security forces acted purely in terms of  restoring law and order and operated with great restraint, in  the face of intense provocation from hostile elements, many of  whom were armed with automatic weapons and petrol bombs."    Mr Cronje said the outbreak of unrest had clearly been  aggravated by inflammatory statements from senior ANC [African  National Congress] officials, including Mr Popo Molefe and other  senior officials from the ANC's Western Transvaal region, who  had been actively lobbying and organising inside Bophuthatswana  in the days leading up to the outbreak of violence. "These  facts are beyond dispute. The results of their actions are now  plain to see. We ourselves had been at great pains to avoid any  provocative action or statement that might inflame a sensitive  situation. This blatant interference by the ANC has had, as its  direct consequence, the tragic and regrettable loss of life and  injuries that have ensued.    "The events of the past few days are indicative of the  turmoil and instability facing southern Africa unless leaders of  all political persuasions re-double their efforts to find an  inclusive political settlement. We ourselves remain committed  to that quest."</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / South African motor industry strike ends The five-week long strike that has paralysed the South African motor industry ended yesterday as workers agreed to return to factories tomorrow. But no formal resolution to the wage dispute has been reached, and union leaders say discussions will continue on the issue. The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, which organised the 25,000 strikers, said the decision to end the stoppage came after consultation with the union's branches over the weekend. Workers have been demanding 11 per cent across-the-board wage increases while employers have been offering 10.5 per cent. The strike is estimated to have cost between R2bn (Pounds 360m)-R3bn in lost production. The decision follows an announcement last Friday by Mr Trevor Manuel, trade and industry minister, that he was scrapping the 15 per cent import surcharge on motor vehicles as well as cutting tariffs on motor imports from 115 to 80 per cent. Numsa reacted furiously to the moves, accusing the government of deliberately weakening its bargaining position with employers. But Mr Manuel defended the cuts as being in line with recommendations made by an industry task group that had included union representatives, to help bring tariffs down to their Gatt-required level of 30 per cent by 2003. The conclusion of the strike comes just ahead of a critical four-day national conference for the 1.3m member Congress of South African Trade Unions, due to open tomorrow At the top of the agenda will be an attempt to re-define the federation's role in the post-apartheid era. President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and Cosatu are formal political allies and worked closely together in the run-up to the April elections. Since then, widespread industrial unrest, as well as the government's tough stance on tariff reduction, has started to sour the relationship and Cosatu is now keen to reaffirm its links with the party. Nevertheless, the government is worried that the recent strike wave has been deterring much-needed foreign investment as well as hampering economic growth and has called for restraint from the unions. Cosatu's general secretary, Mr Sam Shilowa, has said publicly that he feels legitimate industrial action has no effect on international investor sentiment. Mr Shilowa is reported to have come under criticism from federation members for lacking the strategic vision to carve a new role for Cosatu in the post-Apartheid era, and his leadership may be challenged at the conference.</p>

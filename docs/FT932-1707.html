			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Tories have 'very strict' record of donations THE CONSERVATIVE party has kept 'very strict' records of every donation received for at least 23 years, a former senior Tory fundraiser has confirmed. Sir Bryan Wyldbore-Smith, who was director of the party's board of finance for 22 years leading up to the last general election, said he had submitted a statement to the cross-party home affairs select committee, which is inquiring into the funding of political parties. Questioned on reports citing him as saying the Conservatives received Pounds 7m of funding just before the last election from foreign backers with business and property interests in Britain, Sir Brian said: 'I would think it was highly inaccurate.' The figure was 'on the high side'. In yesterday's proceedings before the home affairs select committee the Liberal Democrats called for the provision of state funding for political parties to ensure 'fair competition' between them and to reduce their financial dependence on sectional interests. Mr Graham Elson, Liberal Democrat general secretary, told the committee that the state should fund political parties on the basis of votes gained in general elections - even if this meant financing Sinn Fein. State funding should go hand in hand with curbs on the national expenditure of parties in elections. Acceptance of state funds should be conditional on a party publishing full audited accounts showing the sources and application of all its funding. Meanwhile, some senior Tory backbenchers added their voices to opposition calls for stricter rules on the disclosure of political donations. Mr Julian Critchley, Tory MP for Aldershot, said the 'sensible' thing for the Conservative party to do would be to 'come clean' and have its accounts published annually. Senior Labour officials, including Mr Larry Whitty, general secretary, are due to appear before the home affairs committee tomorrow as its inquiry into funding con-tinues. Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, last night attacked Labour over its links with the unions, saying its 'unprincipled campaign of smear and unsubstantiated allegation' was 'a smokescreen for its own embarrassments'. He said at the Dulwich Conservative Association that Labour's real aim was to force the taxpayer to fund political parties. 'State funding of political parties . . . would be one of the least justified and most unpopular pieces of public expenditure conceivable,' he said. Sir Norman added: 'The real issue surrounding the funding of political parties in this country is simple. It is the undemocratic way in which the Labour party sells itself to the highest trade union bidder.'</p>

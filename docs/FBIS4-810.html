			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] There is no hope for tranquility in Cuito, Bie  Province, in the coming days. Clashes took place in the city on  13 April, after Eduardo dos Santos' aircraft parachuted war  materiel on the defense lines of the Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FALA]. This scenario was repeated  yesterday.    According to our reporter Jardim Sikito Prata, a Ilyushin-76  aircraft belonging to the Luanda Air Force on two occasions, at  0900 and 1500, dropped war materiel, fuel, backpacks, and other  equipment. A total of 10 parachutes once again fell on the  FALA's defense lines. Military sources contacted by Sikito  Prata, say these constant operations are part of a deliberate  plan by Eduardo dos Santos to resume clashes in Bie in order to  delay peace which is being negotiated in Lusaka.    The FALA military command in Bie has warned, however, that  it  will not tolerate any act of provocation and all those who  insist will be severely punished.    Military operations by the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] continue to be the  center of attention inside Angola where Eduardo dos Santos' men  have not learned from their defeats. In Cuanza Norte Province,  the UNITA armed forces pushed to Lucala-2 River region the  Luanda regime troops who had in vain tried to take N'Dalatando,  the capital of Cuanza Norte Province. Lieutenant Colonel Sexto  Sachi, chief of FALA operations in the province, gave assurances  that the city will never fall into the hands of the MPLA-PT by  the force of arms. [passage omitted]</p>

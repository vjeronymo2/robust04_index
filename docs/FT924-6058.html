			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scots warn of summit action SCOTTISH nationalists promised a programme of action during next month's EC summit in Edinburgh including a demonstration in the city to stress their case for home rule. Meanwhile Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, announced plans to give Scotland a greater say within the European Community. But he said the prospect of an independent Scotland within Europe was a 'fantasy'. Asserting that Scots often got on better with continental Europeans than the English, he offered the prospect of Scotland having more influence in the EC, while staying within the UK.</p>

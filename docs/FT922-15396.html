			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Two-horse race - Ballot Box The Tory leadership race has begun, at least, at the bookies. Those who think that the grey, currently at the head of the Conservative pack, may be an early faller might be interested to learn that William Hill has just taken a bet on a mare with form as long as your arm. Someone the bookmaker describes as 'a very well informed client' has bet Pounds 20 at 25/1 that Margaret Thatcher will regain the leadership of the Tory party before the end of the century. Another Pounds 20, this time at 50/1, says she will return to 10 Downing Street. Meanwhile, it has been a long wait for the man who had a bet on next Thursday's big race nearly three years ago. Patience, however, can be rewarded; he wagered Pounds 40,000 to win Pounds 110,000 that Labour would gain the most seats. Walk into any bookmaker today with Pounds 40,000 to place on the same bet and you would collect not much more than Pounds 13,000. Victor Chandler, the bookmaker which laid the bet in June 1989, will not disclose the client's name, saying only that he is 'a leading entrepreneur'. Yet whoever he is, his winnings will be nothing like a political record. Ahead of the 1964 election, Sir Maxwell Joseph, founder of Grand Metropolitan, placed a bet of Pounds 50,000 - that is not far short Pounds 500,000 today - on a not unexpected Labour victory. He collected more than Pounds 32,000.</p>

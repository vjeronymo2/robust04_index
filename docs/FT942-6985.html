			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Vehicle caught by neural network Neural networks, which recognise patterns rather than carrying out vastly complicated calculations, are penetrating into a variety of industrial and financial areas. Racal, the UK electronics company, has used the technology for its new vehicle number plate registration system designed to work in the day or night. Called Talon, its applications cover traffic monitoring and security operations. It was developed with Cambridge Neurodynamics, a specialist in digital signal processing and pattern recognition. The system works by being 'trained' to recognise a large number of repetitions of a set of characters. The network builds a statistical model which adapts to the features that make each character distinctive. Thus it also works well when number plates are crooked and the numbers are partly hidden or dirty. Racal Radio: UK, 0734 875181</p>

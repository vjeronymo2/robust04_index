			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Ukraine has apparently  returned 200 million kilowatt-hours of energy it drew in extra  imports from the joint Centrel electric system of eastern  European countries, the Hungarian national electricity  distribution centre said Friday [21 January].    Over the past fortnight, the Centrel system maintained  normal  frequency levels after considerable fluctuation caused by  unplanned Ukrainian imports since November, officials of the  centre said.    The fluctuations caused slowdowns and overstrain with  electric appliances, and Centrel countries -- the Czech  republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the eastern  part of Germany -- threatened Ukraine with separating it from  the grid if it failed to return the energy drawn until Friday.    Ukraine was forced to import more energy than it had planned  due to severe fuel shortages there. Hungary supplied a quarter  of the extra energy drawn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 19 TASS -- The Russian State Duma  refused on Wednesday [19 January] to discuss the statement of  the agrarian party in which it attacked the financial,  investment and credit policy of Finance Minister Boris Fedorov  and former First Deputy Premier Yegor Gaydar which, it said,  triggered collapse of agriculture.    The Duma said the statement contained "arbitrary and  subjective assessments of the current situation in agriculture".    By proposing the statement the Agrarian Party, evidently,  wanted to support its leader and Deputy Premier Aleksandr  Zaveryukha before the president and the prime minister agree on  the new composition of the government.    The president and the premier stumbled over the candidacy of  Fedorov who said he might remain in the government only in case  Zaveryukha is dismissed.    Zaveryukha is responsible for agricultural policy in the  government and supports the interests of collective and state  farms. Fedorov became his arch rival after refusing to provide  subsidies to state-run agriculture.    At the same time the Duma adopted a statement which  recommended the government to consider in five days the problem  of financing agriculture in 1994 in order to increase production  and stabilise its development in conditions of a market economy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wang Genbao and Chen Yong: "Syria Not Convinced </F> of Israel's Proposals"]    [Text] Damascus, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Syria welcomed American  endeavors for peace in the Middle East but said the Israeli  proposals U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher carried  here were vague and insufficient.    Christopher is shuttling between Syria and Israel to advance  the Middle East peace process, especially the peace talks on the  Syrian-Israeli track.    He arrived here Sunday [15 May] and left this afternoon for  Israel after talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad.    Diplomatic sources here said Christopher briefed Syria on  Israel's response to the Syrian questions and reservations  concerning the Israeli formula of peace which he had conveyed to  Syria during his visit last month.    Israel proposed a phased pullout from the Golan Heights  along  with security arrangements to be worked out by Syria and Israel.    The sources said that Syria deems the Israeli replies vague  and insufficient as they do not include a clear reference to  Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan which the Jewish state  has occupied since 1967.    Syria has rejected the principle of gradual pullout but it  was reported that it might be ready to negotiate a timetable for  Israeli withdrawal.    The sources said that Christopher proposed the formation of  a  joint Syrian-Israeli military committee to work out security  arrangements on the Golan Heights.    He also proposed the formation of a similar committee to  work  on water distribution and the start of the normalization process  at the first stage of the Israeli pullout from the Golan.    However, Syria insisted on Israel's commitment to full  withdrawal according to a definite timetable, saying that  normalization of relations will be discussed by the end of the  last stage of the withdrawal.    The Syrian sources stressed that full withdrawal is the only  way to achieving comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel.    Political observers here said the positions of Israel and  Syria are still far apart, but there might have been some  progress in the discussions of some essential issues which can  be a start for reaching compromises.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: BTR's marginal error BTR hit a raw nerve with yesterday's revelation that the difficulty of passing on cost increases had caused a drop in its first-half margins. It would be natural to expect such a squeeze to affect other manufacturers given the anaemic nature of the economic recovery. But one should beware of drawing too strong a general conclusion. BTR's mix of businesses tends to peak in mid to late cycle, so there is time for its margins to improve as an operational gearing effect clicks in. Besides, the 12 per cent fall in its shares yesterday reflects the way BTR has compounded its problems through strikingly poor presentation. BTR's studied aloofness from City institutions may be justified in the tighter climate for disclosure and insider dealing, but companies which make a point of disclosing nothing informally should make every effort to use formal occasions for straight talking. BTR's annual meeting statement this summer was a model of obfuscation. It contrived to give the impression that margins, while affected by price pressures, were actually rising. Investors have a right to feel indignant to find they have fallen, especially when confronted with the lame excuse that the group margin would have risen without the cessation of the Denver airport contract and other selected events. BTR will now find it difficult to dispel lingering doubts about whether margin recovery, now presumably awaited next year, will ever occur. If it does not and the climate really has changed, the company will have to revise its traditional policy of being willing to sacrifice volume growth for margin enhancement. Even another large acquisition, for which room is emerging as gearing declines, might not then be enough to distract from worries about organic growth.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Painful reforms should yield surge in third world's growth / Analysis of the latest World Bank report on prospects for developing countries - with east Asia leading the way THE WORLD Bank is forecasting a surge in developing countries' growth rates over the next ten years, as a result of the often painful economic reforms they have undertaken. Growth in the developing world is projected at 4.7 per cent a year over the period 1992-2002, compared to 2.7 per cent in 1982-1992, according to the Washington-based multilateral development bank's annual forecasts.* Gross domestic product per capita is expected to grow at 2.9 per cent a year  -more than three times the 0.8 per cent rate of the last ten years. Mr D C Rao, the bank's acting senior economist, said much of the improvement reflected the transformation of economic policy in the developing countries in recent years: trade rules have been liberalised, the policy of import substitution abandoned, over-valued exchange rates corrected, public finances brought under control and the state's role in industry and commerce reduced. These policy changes have led to a 'remarkable resurgence' of private capital flows to the developing countries, with foreign direct investment climbing by 50 per cent over the last two years to Dollars 38bn in 1992, with portfolio investment growing even more explosively to Dollars 34bn last year. The World Bank expects growth in the developing world to be led by east Asia, where growth is projected to slow slightly over the next decade but to remain at the high level of 7.3 per cent a year. East Asia now accounts for a quarter of output in the developing world, Mr Rao said. Over the next ten years, its weight is likely to rise to one third. In Latin America, the World Bank says growth of nearly 4 per cent a year is achievable over the next ten years, compared with a rate of 1.9 per cent a year in 1982-92, if countries such as Chile, Mexico and Argentina persevere with their domestic policies and if Brazil adopts credible policies of macro-economic stabilisation. Sub-Saharan Africa could see growth rise from 2.0 per cent over the last ten years to 3.7 per cent in the decade ahead, largely as a result of improvements the World Bank anticipates in prices of commodities such as coffee and cocoa. If their fundamental reforms succeed, the national economies of eastern Europe and central Asia should stop contracting and start to grow at a rate of 2.1 per cent for the next ten years, attaining a trend rate of 4 to 5 per cent in the second half of the decade. Mr Rao cautioned that the World Bank's forecasts were heavily reliant on the assumption that the recovery that now appeared to be consolidating itself in the US would spread to the rest of the G7 leading industrial nations, with a prospect of sustained growth in the developed world over the medium term, combined with lower real interest rates. The forecasts also assume faster growth in world trade, a stabilisation in real non-oil commodity prices, and a continuation of policy improvements, especially in Latin America. 'A more pessimistic set of assumptions would halve the rate at which developing countries' per capita income grows to about 1.3 per cent per year,' Mr Rao said, warning that this would mean an increase of 80m in the number of people living in poverty. One of the most serious threats to the economic prospects of the developing countries is the continued failure to make progress in the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation. Countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are hit by tariffs averaging 7 to 8 per cent on their exports to developed countries and by non-tariff barriers on 60 to 80 per cent of the goods they export, while expanding market opportunities are also critical for the prospects of the reforming economies of eastern and central Europe. *Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries; World Bank, 1818 H Street NW, Washington DC 20433, USA.

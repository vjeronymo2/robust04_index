			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Observer: By the book Out of all South Africa's political prisoners released yesterday, Robert McBride, a 29-year-old coloured man who spent 1,463 days on death row for a Durban car-bombing, is perhaps the best known. Not only is he married to a daughter of an Anglo American director, Peter Leyden, but he is also the subject of a book. Bryan Rostron, a Daily Mirror journalist who wrote 'Till Babylon Falls', believes that he is the first journalist to get on to death-row in Pretoria's central prison where there are over 300 inmates. He had the idea for the book after reading a brief news report of the exploits of McBride and his Zulu colleague, Gordon Webster, who had been involved in a series of sensational propaganda bombings in Natal. In the book, Webster gets injured at a roadblock and then McBride shoots his way into a hospital to rescue him. If the background was not so tragic - McBride bitterly regrets the deaths caused by his Durban bomb - the saga might be worth comparing with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. No one is sure of McBride's forebears but one story is that he is the grandson of one of the leaders of the Irish Brigade, one John MacBride, described by Yeats as a 'drunken, vainglorious lout'. Such is the stuff of legends.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Gardening: A blooming scrapheap - Arthur Hellyer visits the Garden Festival, Wales THE GARDEN Festival, Wales, opened yesterday and will continue, seven days a week, until October 4. It is the last of the five great festivals that started with Liverpool eight years ago and continued at Stoke-on-Trent, Glasgow and Gateshead in the intervening years. All have been good fun, all have reclaimed waste land and handed it back cleared and rejuvenated for further use by the community concerned and, although I do not think that any made a profit, it seems sad that there are no more in the pipeline. There is no time to improvise any stopgap since it takes a minimum of four years to prepare one on the scale and to the standards we have come to expect. The Wales festival has been in the making for five years. Not only does the Welsh exhibition at Ebbw Vale fully live up to those standards but it is unique in being the only one that occupies a naturally beautiful site. Ebbw Vale is a small industrial town with mountains on both sides. On the valley floor there used to be a large steelworks, and its associated slag heaps were a blot on the landscape. Now only a small part of the steelworks remains, at the head of the valley, and the slag heaps are a series of beautiful gardens plus a fine lake and a medley of pavilions. When the festival is over, they will disappear to make way for a new village, to be named Victoria, which will provide both living and working opportunities. Some features of the show will also remain, almost certainly the lake and possibly the 40 metre-high waterfall which seems to be a perfectly natural feature of the western mountain side. Gone, I imagine, will be the funicular railway which at the moment ascends the mountain to a height of 1200ft, from which there are spectacular views of the 200-acre exhibition site. On the way up the railway passes a working farm, part of which has been incorporated in the exhibition. Here there will be demonstrations, including sheepdog trials. In this part, too, there is a natural woodland walk and a demonstration of the flora of wetland. If you want a quicker overall view of the show you can be lifted in a few seconds about 300ft above it in a giant 'sky shuttle'. You can also be drawn around it at ground level in any one of three land trains, which came to Wales directly from Gateshead where they had performed a similar function. A unique feature of this festival is a giant hothouse which has been built against the mountainside, making use of the natural steep slope of the land. There is talk of retaining this when the show is over as a permanent feature but nothing has yet been decided. Part of the endeavour after October will be to attract new industry to the site and I wonder whether any company might see a prestigious piece of publicity in retaining a feature such as this. There is no easy railway access to Ebbw Vale as there has been to former national garden festivals and so most people will arrive by road. The signposting could not be better. I began to encounter the cheery little joker named Gryff, the festival logo, on the M4 motorway 30 miles or more away from Ebbw Vale and he reappeared at every junction and roundabout to point the way. At the moment the daffodils are almost over in my Sussex garden but still fully out in Wales. They got more and more numerous as I approached the site until they burst into a final frenzy of colour in the festival grounds. They had been specially retarded so that they would be at their peak for the opening ceremony. The festival authorities intend to give special significance to certain flowers month by month: in June to a new bearded iris raised by a local specialist; in July to the Welsh poppy; in August to a rose named Abraham Darby, after an Ebbw Vale ironmaster; and in September to the dahlia called Bishop of Llandaff. There will also be a number of spectaculars to fill the floral hall with displays of flowers and foliage throughout the festival. Admission is Pounds 8.50 for adults and Pounds 5.50 for children and senior citizens. Concessions for groups and families are available, as are season tickets. It is open from 10 am until 7 pm during May, September and October and until 8 pm in June, July and August.

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Europe issues storm warning to Serious Fraud Office: The Saunders judgment threatens the power to demand answers It is too early to say yet that Mr Ernest Saunders has won a famous victory at the expense of the UK authorities, but the the European Commission on Human Rights judgment that the 1986 Guinness trial was unfair will cause profound concern among UK prosecutors - and particularly those at the Serious Fraud Office. It is virtually certain that the case, which centres on provisions under UK law allowing the removal of the right to silence, must be taken to the European Court of Human Rights for a final decision. This could take more than a year and the UK authorities may yet have their position upheld. In the meantime, prosecutors will be looking anxiously at the precise terms of the commission's ruling, which is expected to be published later this week. It is already clear, however, that the most obvious threat posed by the ruling is to the power under Section 2 of the 1988 Criminal Justice Act, which enables it to compel suspects to answer questions. The future of the SFO is already under review. A successful challenge to this power, which is unique to prosecutors, would further undermine its credibility. The issues may not stop there. If the UK authorities lose before the European Court then the direction of the government's wider policy on crime could be in question. The provision passed in the last criminal justice act, limiting the right to silence for anyone questioned by police, could then also come into conflict with European law. The government's overall policy of shifting the balance of advantage in favour of the state could then face being halted by the judges at Strasbourg. The case brought by Mr Saunders concerned the use of evidence he gave under compulsion to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors carrying out their investigation into the 1986 Distillers takeover. This evidence was later used against him at his trial. Mr Saunders not only claimed that presenting this evidence to the jury was unfair in itself but that the whole criminal process which followed the DTI investigation was an abuse of human rights because of the initial removal of his right to silence. The commission's judgment upheld his first complaint in full. To have used the evidence from the DTI inquiry rendered the trial unfair and was a breach of Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, it said. It stopped short of agreeing with Mr Saunders' wider claims, however. In the case of Mr Saunders and the three men convicted with him - Mr Gerald Ronson, Mr Tony Parnes and Mr Jack Lyons - the consequences of this judgment are specific. The UK authorities have the option of accepting the judgment and settling the case with Mr Saunders, possibly asking for his conviction to be quashed and compensation offered. In the view of most lawyers this is inconceivable. The Serious Fraud Office would hardly be prepared to admit that the Guinness trial - the highlight of its mixed history - was profoundly misconceived. The issue, most believe, will have to go to Europe. The investigation and prosecution of white-collar crime has moved on since the Guinness trial. The judgment will not affect the ability of the DTI to continue to mount inquiries and compel witnesses to answer questions, since these are not criminal proceedings. But the SFO has taken over some of the de facto role of DTI inquiries. Cases where DTI evidence is used in court are now rare. It is therefore the SFO which has most cause for concern. Its Section 2 powers enable it to compel suspects to answer questions although this evidence may only be used in court if the account a defendant gives in court differs from what he told investigators. This safeguard does not alter the fact that, since its introduction in 1988, Section 2 has had a powerful effect on the prosecution of financial crime. Its legality has also been successfully defended before the House of Lords. Lords rulings will be of little help if the European Court eventually finds in Mr Saunder's favour, however. As Mr David Kirk of solicitors Simons Muirhead Burton said, the government would not be able to respond with legislation. 'The commission's judgment will be extremely far-reaching,' he said. 'If this is upheld by the European Court, then there would be absolutely nothing the UK government could do about it.'</p>

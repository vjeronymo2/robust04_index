			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 34. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we announced that, for a period of time, we would not accept applications for new ITFS facilities or for major changes to existing facilities. We expressed our concern that potential applicants would inundate the Commission with applications while the old cut-off rule was still in effect, thereby defeating the purpose of the proposed rulemaking. However, we stated that we would continue to accept (but not process) applications in which the applicant relies on NTIA for construction funds. We have also continued to accept major change proposals where they are filed in the same market to accommodate settlement agreements among applicants that have previously achieved cut-off status and where the settlement resolves mutually exclusive applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35. Upon publication of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Order and Further Notice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we shall instruct the staff to begin accepting applications for major changes to existing facilities, and any mutually exclusive applications thereto. Such applications will be processed under the existing A/B cut-off rules. We believe that this will ease the burden that the freeze has caused to educational institutions that seek to alter their existing facilities. Licensees and those filing competing applications may file such applications until the effective date of any window filing rules. We note that this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Order and Further Notice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contemplates modifying our definition of a major change. For the purposes of modifying the freeze, we shall use the existing definition of the term. Any pending major modification application not cut off as of the adoption of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Order and Further Notice <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will be considered in conjunction with the newly submitted applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in &sect;&sect;1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R. 1.415 and 1.419, interested parties may file comments on or before August 29, 1994, and reply comments on or before September 28, 1994.

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Banca del Gottardo upbeat on earnings Banca del Gottardo, the Swiss bank controlled by Sumitomo Bank of Japan, yesterday reported a 10 per cent rise in non-consolidated cash flow in the first half to SFr67.8m, (Dollars 49.4m) and made an optimistic forecast about earnings for the full year. The bank, which is aiming to place 100,000 existing participation certificates in the next few days, said revenues from asset management were up 18 per cent while those from stock trading and new-issue commission income were up 11 per cent. No figures were given. Foreign exchange activity remained at the levels achieved last year but income from lending and securities investment was down. The 3 per cent rise in costs was in line with expectations. Gottardo said its affiliates also reported positive results, especially InterEuropa SIM in Milan, Banque du Gotthard (Monaco) and Gotthardfin in the Cayman Islands. The bank said prospects for the full year were 'moderately positive' considering the uncertainties in foreign exchange and financial markets and questions over the trend of interest rates. At the end of June, Gottardo's assets stood at SFr7.74bn compared with SFr7.59bn at the end of 1993.</p>

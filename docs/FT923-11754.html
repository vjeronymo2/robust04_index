			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace Spot the odd one out among the following: Booker, Laporte, William Morrison and British Aerospace. The answer is of course BAe: the others all have a market value of more than Pounds 800m. The continued plunge of the BAe share price doubtless owes much to the general shakiness of market sentiment. In addition, the company is suffering from a hiatus of news in the period of enforced silence ahead of its interim results. In particular, there is no word about the sale of the regional aircraft business, while the UK car market is approaching a supposedly disastrous August. More fundamentally, the stage is being reached where the market is either wholly wrong about the stock or the company's continuance in its present form is open to question. One aspect of the market's worry is self-evident. At the start of last month, the historic yield was 9.4 per cent. It is now 15.9 per cent. If the market's sums are right, BAe looks set to join that exclusive band of companies - otherwise mostly in the construction industry  -to have raised cash from shareholders and blown it before it could be paid back in the form of dividends the following year. To justify such a blunder, BAe must argue for a sharp rebound in earnings in the reasonably foreseeable future. This may require the sale not just of regional aircraft but of Rover, plus compelling evidence that the defence business after the EFA still has an attractive future. More fundamentally again, BAe must convince investors that whatever form it ends up with possesses industrial logic, rather than representing a job lot of assets from the privatising days of the 1980s. Come the interims in September, the new chairman Mr John Cahill will have his work cut out.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BREEDING BIRDS: COMMON MOORHEN  </P> <P> COMMON MOORHEN  </P> <P> (Gallinula chloropus)  </P> <P> Description: Black head and neck, with red forehead shield, red bill with  yellow tip. Back is brownish-olive; underparts slate; white streaking on flanks  shows as a thin white line.  </P> <P> Legs and feet are yellow.  </P> <P> Habitat: Found in fresh-water marshes, lakes and ponds, usually with emergent  vegetation and grassy edges.  </P> <P> Diet: Mostly aquatic vegetation; also mollusks (especially snails), worms;  berries, fruit.  </P> <P> Displays: With head low, wings partly raised and open, elevates tail exposing  white undertail feathers. Male bends head down and in toward feet; male and  female bow.  </P> <P> Nest: Usually over water (with ramps leading down to water), occasionally on  ground or in low shrub. Occasionally unused nests, brooding and roosting  platforms nearby and old nests of jays and magpies.  </P> <P> Eggs: Cinnamon/buff, marked with reddish-brown or olive colors.  </P> <P> Natural history notes: These birds are cooperative breeders with young of first  brood, often aiding in care of subsequent broods and in defense of territory.  Younger birds lay smaller clutches than older birds and lay later. Young  usually hatch asynchronously. Wing spur aids young in climbing. (The Common  moorhen was once called the Common Gallinule.)  </P> <P> Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or  to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final  year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714)  962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160.  </P> <P> Note: Map is divided into 5-kilometer squares so that Audubon Society  volunteers can more easily survey areas on a regular basis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sources: Sea and Sage Audubon Society; "The Birder's Handbook," Ehrlich, Dobkin  and Wheye, Fireside Books (1988); "Field Guide to the Birds of North America,"  National Geographic Society (1987); "Birds of Southern California: Status and  Distribution," Garrett and Dunn, Los Angeles Audubon Society (1981).  </P></p>

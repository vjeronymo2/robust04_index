			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Property Reality has caught up with UK property, last year's second top-performing sector in the stock market. This year, the property index has been struggling ever since the Fed raised US interest rates. Higher bond yields and UK interest rates have added to its woes. Since the Fed moved in February, the property index has underperformed the market by 10 per cent. For a while, property shares were sustained by expectations that economic growth would generate higher rents. Those hopes have been dashed. Although there have been pockets of progress for a few premium commercial properties in the West End of London and the City, income growth has proved elusive. Many property groups are less dependent than they were on London. But beyond the capital there have been even fewer signs of an upturn in commercial, industrial or retail rents. The market's forecasts for rental growth for the year to March have fallen from 12 per cent to about 7 per cent. There are fears it could actually reach zero. Eventually, the effects of 3.8 per cent GDP growth must begin to filter into the market. The absence of cranes that once dominated the City's skyline bears witness to the lack of new capacity in the pipeline. But it could be 1996 before rents move significantly upwards throughout the country. A case for near-term optimism is difficult to make. Some may wish to pick stocks with good portfolios. But even the more dynamic groups will find it hard to escape the malaise restraining the sector.</p>

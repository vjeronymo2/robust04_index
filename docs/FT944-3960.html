			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Portals wins Pounds 100m contract with Indian government Portals, the specialist papermaking group, yesterday announced a Pounds 100m contract to supply the Indian government with banknote paper. The news provided a further boost to the group's share price, which had already shot sharply forward on news earlier this week that Portals had been approached by De La Rue, the printing group. Portals shares closed up 10p yesterday at 833p, and ahead 128p on its close of Monday evening. The group was forced to make an announcement over the De La Rue approach on Tuesday when its shares began rising rapidly. The Indian contract is the largest value banknote paper order in the industry ever and was won through a public tender. Mr John Lloyd, managing director, said that the order, which will begin early next year, should allow the group to operate at capacity for the foreseeable future. He refused to comment on the De La Rue talks. It is the second time this year that the two sides have been in potential takeover negotiations. De La Rue approached Portals in May - a move which again sent the share price soaring - but the two groups called the talks off after failing to reach agreement. Following this week's news, De La Rue has said it would not make a hostile bid without the agreement of the Portals board and underlined the close commercial relationship between the two companies.</p>

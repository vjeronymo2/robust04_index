			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Rushdie shadow over UK-Iran trade THE Salman Rushdie affair is harming British companies' chances of winning contracts in Iran, according to the British Consultants Bureau (BCB), a non-profit group which promotes UK consultants overseas, and recently sent a mission to Iran. The eight-member mission said yesterday, after a 10-day trip to Tehran and Isfahan, that British groups were falling behind US, Japanese and European competitors in gaining contracts from Iran's ambitious plans for developing its infrastructure. This follows the souring of relations because of the late Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Mr Salman Rushdie, whose book, the Satanic Verses, Moslems regard as blasphemous. Mr Nigel Thompson, a director of Ove Arup who led the mission, said Iran offered a 'huge potential market' for UK groups, notably in petro-chemicals, power, water and sewage schemes, but that Iranian officials wanted to see the British government distance itself from Mr Rushdie. The mission was critical of the level of official British commercial representation in Iran, saying the embassy in Tehran was understaffed, underinformed and should raise the status of its chief representative from charge d'affaires, to full ambassador. The mission, three of whom remained in Iran to pursue possible contracts in transport, construction and water, also said they believed Britain should extend the level of export credit financing available to Iran through the Export Credits Guarantees Department (ECGD). Iran is on medium to long-term cover from the ECGD, and the agency said yesterday that cover for actual and potential contracts already exceeded the country limit - a total demand estimated to be around Pounds 1bn.</p>

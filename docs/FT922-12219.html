			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Romanian communist leaders sent to jail ROMANIA'S Supreme Court overturned the acquittal of 21 former Communist party bosses blamed for mass killings during the 1989 revolt and yesterday sentenced them to jail terms totalling 255 years, Reuter reports from Bucharest. State prosecutors had appealed against the earlier acquittal of the associates of Stalinist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown and executed in the December 1989 revolt. None of the 21 was present when the court announced the appeal verdict and fresh jail terms ranging from eight to 16 years on charges related to the deaths of 1,033 people as a result of violent attempts to crush the uprising. 'The Supreme Court rules that the 21 politburo members are guilty of aggravated murder and complicity in aggravated murder,' Mr Valeriu Bogdanescu, the court's vice-president said. 'All other rulings related to this matter are cancelled.' Legal sources said the former communist chiefs, who first came to trial in July 1990, had no further right to appeal. The court sentenced Ceausescu's adviser Silviu Curticeanu, former foreign minister Ion Totu and former trade minister Ana Muresan to 16 years. Another ex-foreign minister, Stefan Andrei, got 14 years, as did party ideologist Dumitru Popescu and six others. The remaining 10 received sentences of eight to 11 years.</p>

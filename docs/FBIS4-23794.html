			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Nairobi, 16 Jun (AFP) -- Sporadic gunfire  resumed in Kigali overnight after a lull of several hours  following a ceasefire announcement, a UN spokesman said Thursday  [16 June]. "There was sporadic firing during the night and a  few rounds of artillery fire at five this morning (0300 GMT),"  UN spokesman Pierre Mehu told AFP by telephone from Kigali.    Mehu said the guns had fallen silent for about five hours on  Wednesday afternoon after Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben  Ali announced at the end of the Organisation of African Unity  (OAU) summit in Tunis that Rwanda's government and rebels had  agreed to an immediate ceasefire. Gunfire resumed at dusk, Mehu  said.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe called in Paris  Wednesday  for western intervention to stop the ethnic bloodshed in Rwanda  if the latest ceasefire there fails. He said he had suggested  to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that UN troops from  the 18,000-strong force stationed in Somalia could be diverted  to Rwanda, if fighting there continues.    If the ceasefire is not respected and the massacres  continue,  "I say today that France would be ready to mount an intervention  operation ... with its European partners or African countries  to protect groups threatened with extermination," he said. "If  we learn over the next few days that there are massacres of  dozens, of hundreds of men, women and children, we will not be  able to tolerate it for much longer. [passage omitted]    Juppe, speaking after a cabinet meeting with French  President  Francois Mitterrand, said the situation in Rwanda was "already  unacceptable and that could lead us to mobilize France's  partners to intervene" without delay.

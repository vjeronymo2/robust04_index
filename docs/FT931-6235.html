			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Cocaine suspect surrenders THE man considered by police to be the financial brains behind the Medelln cocaine cartel has surrendered to authorities, the attorney general's office said yesterday, AP reports from Bogota. Mr Jose Fernando Posada, 38, turned himself over to representatives of the Medelln prosecutors' office waiting outside a cinema on Sunday night. He was taken to a maximum security prison outside Medelln where 17 other cartel members are being held. Mr Posada was the fourth leading cartel member to surrender in recent weeks under a government offer of leniency. Authorities say the surrenders are weakening the organisation led by fugitive drug lord Mr Pablo Escobar. Meanwhile, a wealthy Medelln businessman who is reported to have links to Mr Escobar was killed yesterday after being abducted from his home by about 20-25 gunmen, police said. The abduction and murder came 48 hours after an attack on the home of his brother, Mr Diego Londono White, an architect who has said he once worked for Mr Escobar. Mr Diego Londono White told Medelln television that the gunmen were members of People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar, a secretive group that has pledged to kill Mr Escobar. Reuter adds: Colombian authorities seized nearly Dollars 5.9m in more than 890 domestic bank accounts and arrested 250 people during a 15-month crackdown on drug traffickers' money-laundering networks, the Colprensa news service said on Sunday. Quoting police, Colprensa said Colombian authorities and Interpol uncovered the main networks used by the Cali and Medelln drug cartels in a 15-month investigation. It said the cartels moved their money through fictitious export and import companies and money exchange houses.</p>

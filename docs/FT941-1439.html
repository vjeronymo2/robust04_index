			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Lords defeat for police bill The government yesterday suffered another Lords defeat on its plans for police reforms. The police bill provided for abolition of the ranks of chief superintendent and chief inspector but a new clause, passed by 133 votes to 107, allows only one of the two ranks to be scrapped.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The military officials responsible for the two  operations in Rwanda have presented their assessment of these  operations at Army HQ in Rue d'Evere. [passage omitted]  General Charlier, Army Chief of Staff, drew lessons from the  premature withdrawal of the UN mission, UNAMIR. General  Charlier has clearly spelled it out. Listen. A journalist asks  Colonel Marshal, the commander of the Belgian blue helmets,  whether he is ready to go back to Rwanda under the same  condition. General Charlier answers:    [Charlier] I tell you frankly that I will not let Belgian  troops go under the same conditions, and my minister will not  let them go under the same conditions. We had to fight to  obtain UN authorization to take some armored vehicles to Kigali.  The Rwandan Army has armored vehicles. Therefore, there is the  need for a mandate which could be adapted to the pace at which  the situation develops, armament which would enable us to adapt  ourselves to the situation and offer some protection for  soldiers. [passage omitted] There were very few soldiers in  Kigali to the extent that the airport was guarded by two small  Belgian platoons. While, in fact, it needed at least a big  battalion to guard it.

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / France launches trade drive in Japan to cut ballooning deficit THE French government has launched a trade promotion campaign targeted at the Japanese market with the aim of reducing the ballooning French trade deficit with Japan. The campaign follows a five day visit to Japan by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, which is being interpreted in France as a direct riposte to the trade promotion visit by President George Bush. Mr Beregovoy sought from the Japanese government, and believed he had secured, undertakings that there would be no discrimination in favour of the US at the expense of Europeans. Mr Beregovoy attempted to distinguish himself from the insistent demands of President Bush, by emphasising his aim of closer co-operation with Japan, and France's openness to direct investment. The French export campaign, spread over three years, will aim to improve the image of French goods, and in particular will promote 12 specific sectors, including aeronautics, food and agriculture, pharmaceutics, environmental and car components. The French trade deficit with Japan currently runs at around FFr30bn (Pounds 3.09bn) a year. 'This is a difficult market, but not impenetrable', Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, French foreign trade minister said yesterday. 'Japanese imports are growing each year by 20 per cent, and we must get our share.' A consortium of ABB Power Plants and Japan's Marubeni Corporation has signed a letter of intent with the Indonesian Electricity Board to build a Dollars 700m power station at Tanjung Priok, near Jakarta.</p>

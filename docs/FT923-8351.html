			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Italy appoints new Mafia-buster The delay in appointing a head for Italy's new Mafia-busting 'super-magistrature' has finally ended with the nomination of Mr Giuseppe De Gennaro to the post, Haig Simonian reports form Milan. In a surprise nomination, Mr Di Gennaro, 68, a supreme court judge best known for his work for the Vienna-based drugs-fighting arm of the UN, is to take the position on a temporary basis pending the appointment of an official head later this year. Mr Di Gennaro's experience includes supervising Italy's prisons, a task which led to his kidnap in 1975.</p>

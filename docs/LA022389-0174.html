			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENCY;  </P> <P> CONSUMER PRICE JUMP SENDS DOLLAR TUMBLING; GOLD GAINS  </P> <P> The dollar fell against most major foreign currencies Wednesday as dealers  weighed the implications of a government report showing that consumer prices  rose sharply during January.  </P> <P> Gold prices gained, driven higher by the inflation report. Prices for the  precious metal rose by more than $5 an ounce in London. Later, Republic  National Bank of New York quoted gold at a bid of $386.40 an ounce at 4 p.m.  EST, up 90 cents from Tuesday's late bid.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said consumer prices surged 0.6% in January, the highest  monthly rate in two years. Last month's rise doubled the more modest 0.3%  increases in November and December.  </P> <P> Mary Anne Tompkins, a foreign exchange trader at Barclays Bank PLC in New York,  said the inflation report intensified market speculation that U.S. interest  rates will be hiked to slow inflation.  </P> <P> Higher U.S. interest rates raise the value of dollar-denominated investments.  </P> <P> But in the meantime, many dealers seem to be focusing their attention on the  strong West German economy and British economic prospects.  </P> <P> The dollar slid against the West German mark, falling below levels considered  key thresholds at which the U.S. currency would find support. The dollar fell  to 1.8380 marks in London from 1.8420 marks late Tuesday. Later in New York,  the dollar fell to 1.83425 marks from 1.8440 marks on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The British pound came under pressure from the mark's strength. The pound fell  in London to $1.7465 late Wednesday from $1.7565 late Tuesday. In later New  York dealings, sterling dipped to $1.7470 from Tuesday's late $1.74725.  </P> <P> Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar eased to 126.62 Japanese yen from Tuesday's 127.15  yen. In London, the dollar traded at 126.65 yen and later in New York the  dollar finished at 126.525 yen, down from 127.15 yen late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Tuesday's late rates,  included: 1.5658 Swiss Francs, down from 1.5690; 1.1999 Canadian dollars, up  from 1.19225; 6.2560 French francs, down from 6.2795, and 1,349.75 Italian  lire, down from 1,351.00.  </P> <P> Other rates for the dollar in Europe late Wednesday, compared to Tuesday's late  rates, included: 1.8380 West German marks, down from 1.8420; 1.5667 Swiss  francs, down from 1.5685; 6.2625 French francs, down from 6.2735; 2.0725 Dutch  guilders, down from 2.0910; 1,350.50 Italian lire, down from 1,356.00, and  1.1965 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1897.  </P> <P> Gold prices benefit when price pressures build because investors typically use  precious metals as a hedge against inflation. Renewed demand for bullion this  week also has bolstered gold prices.  </P> <P> The late bid for gold in London was $386.30 an ounce, up from Tuesday's  $380.75. Zurich's late bid was $386.25 an ounce, up from $383.00.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Are Taiwan Products Losing Out in the U.S. </F> Market?"]    [Text] The Committee on Mainland Affairs recently published  data which show that the share of Taiwan products in the U.S.  market has successively declined over the last six years, from  5.62 to 4.35 percent, while the share of mainland products has  steadily gone up, from 1.93 to 5.47 percent. The reporting  member of the said committee sees this as the sign that Taiwan  products are now in inferior position in the competitive battle  for overseas markets between the industries on both sides of the  Taiwan Strait. He attributes this situation to the fact that  Taiwan merchants have shifted their production bases and have  placed large investments on the mainland.    There is no doubt that the success of mainland products and  failure of Taiwan products on the U.S. market is closely related  to the fact that Taiwan merchants have placed investments on the  mainland, but it is still open to argument whether this  indicates that Taiwan products are "in inferior position" and  are "successively declining." If we carefully examine the  changes in the trade situation since 1986 as between Taiwan, the  United States, and other East Asian countries, we may discover  that while other countries and territories have greatly  increased their exports to the United States and Taiwan's rate  of export increases to the United States has slackened, the  value of Taiwan's exports to the various countries of East Asia  has greatly increased. For instance, Malaysia's exports to the  United States increased from about $2.3 billion in 1986 to $5.8  billion in 1991, while Taiwan's exports to Malaysia also  increased from 200 million to $1.5 billion. Thailand's exports  to the United States increased from about $1.6 billion in 1986  to $6.1 billion in 1991, however, Taiwan's exports to Thailand  increased from $300 million to $1.4 billion. This indicates that  as Taiwan merchants placed their investments in Malaysia,  Thailand, and in Mainland China, the effect was not at all that  products formerly exported to the United States were merely  diverted to exports to the said regions, but rather that these  regions greatly increased purchases of Taiwan raw materials and  machinery for use in their processing industries.    From the viewpoint of upgrading industry, this situation is  normal and healthy. The said "upgrading of industry" consists in  reducing the traditional production of labor-intensive products  and shifting to the production of capital- and  technology-intensive products. Those industries which Taiwan  merchants moved to the mainland or Southeast Asia were mostly  labor-intensive industries, which had been gradually losing  their competitive strength on Taiwan. On the other hand,  overseas industries initiated by Taiwan merchants were  purchasing Taiwan products, which were mostly capital- and  technology-intensive semifinished products and machinery. This  conforms to the directional shift in the comparative advantage  caused by the change of comparative prices of key elements of  production, as it also conforms to Taiwan's objective of  economic upgrading.    In actual fact, it is not only Taiwan that is undergoing  this  kind of a shift, but similar shifts are taking place in South  Korea, which is at a similar stage of development as Taiwan, and  then even in the more advanced country of Japan. Since 1986,  South Korea's share in the U.S. market has declined, but at the  same time South Korea's investments in Southeast Asia and South  Korea's exports to Malaysia have increased from about $200  million in 1986 to $1.1 billion in 1991, and exports to Thailand  during the same period from $200 million to $1.4 billion. Japan  is at a much higher stage of development than Taiwan and South  Korea, but Japan too is to a certain extent conducting similar  operations; between 1986 and 1991 exports from Japan have  increased: to Malaysia from 1.7 billion to $7.6 billion, and to  Thailand from $2.0 billion to $9.4 billion.    Japanese economists have come up with a "wild goose flight"  theory of economic development [one goose following the other]  to describe this phenomenon. Whenever economic entities of East  Asia, which are all at different stages of development, face  other economies in the world which are in a simultaneous process  of economic advance, the relative scarcity of key elements of  production and the gradual transfer of comparative advantages,  makes the situation, with its transfers each time from the first  economic entity to the hands of the next contestant, appear like  a relay race, and in this process investments and trade produce  corresponding changes.    This does not, of course, signify that nothing is left in  the  hands of the economic entity that is in the relatively more  advanced position, but it indicates that it will, in addition to  increased investments and exports to the developmentally lower  area, produce new products that conform to its particular  comparative advantage. As far as Taiwan is concerned, its  electronic communications industry is rapidly developing; its  computer main frames and monitors have been at the top in world  markets for several consecutive years. Exports of these two  items have increased from $2.3 billion in 1990 to $4 billion  last year, which gives a good picture of the situation.    Going abroad with their investments by Taiwan merchants has  of course also its negative effects, and problems involved in  investments on the mainland must be noted, must be taken into  consideration, and must be studied. However, if one looks purely  at the change of their shares in the U.S. market, and would  conclude that Taiwan products are in an inferior position and  that industrial upgrading has not been successful, it would  unavoidably be too rough and careless a conclusion. The effect  of the increase in value of the NT$ [new Taiwan dollar] since  1986 and the effect of Taiwan merchants going abroad with their  investments must be understood within the framework of the  changes in relations between the economic entities through the  entire East Asia region, and the true situation can only be  understood when studying the development indicated by the "wild  goose flight" theory. This alone will furnish the foundation for  a rational and feasible policy.</p>

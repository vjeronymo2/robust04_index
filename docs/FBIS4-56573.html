			<p>BFN     [Text] The workers of the modern Antonio Guiteras Electric  Plant in Matanzas City will stop work tonight, following 124  days of continuous operation of the 130-megawatt unit, to  conduct a three-day maintenance program on the boiler. This was  announced by plant manager Jesus Valdez Torra, who added that on  this occasion there will be no need for support from other  organizations and that the plant workers will undertake the  maintenance program without problems, given that all the  required parts are at hand.    With the shutdown at the Antonio Guiteras plant, the  National  Electric System will reduce its electric generation capacity by  10 percent. This will be reflected in a slight outage increase.  However, as soon as the gas circulator unit of the boiler is  repaired, which is expected to be completed by 8 May, the unit  will be ready to produce the 330 megawatts it regularly  produces, with low fuel consumption and the highest efficiency  to date in the electric sector.</p>

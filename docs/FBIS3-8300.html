			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Slavoljub Susic] </F>   [Text] The latest request for additional UN troops in the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina could be understood more as the  confirmation of the assessment of the better informed analysts  that the Balkans is a special experimental arena of the creators  of the new world order than an indication that this hotbed of  crisis would soon be mollified. Here is a military-political  commentary by Slavoljub Susic:    [Susic] It is indicative that almost all new peace proposals  for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina are followed by requests to  increase the UN military contingent to supervise the  implementation of these proposals. Does this mean that there is  an a priori doubt about the effectiveness of the offered  solutions that are drafted most frequently according to the  interests of foreign factors?    Let us recall that the failure of Cutiliero's plan in Lisbon  in 1991 was followed by the dispatch of the first battalion of  the UN Blue Helmets to Sarajevo -- consisting of soldiers from  France, Ukraine, and Egypt -- with the task of securing the  airport for the delivery of humanitarian aid. After the London  conference on the former Yugoslavia in August of the same year,  NATO's offer to protect relief convoys in Bosnia under the UN  mandate was accepted. By the end of 1992, there were about 7,000  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina from 10 member countries of the Western  military alliance.    After Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde, Bihac, and Srebrenica  were declared protected zones in May 1993, the Security Council  decided to increase the existing contingent with an additional  7,600 troops. This was not fully realized. After the well-known  Geneva plans for the settlement of the crisis in Bosnia, offered  during 1993, there were about 12,000 Blue Helmets in Bosnia and  more than 26,000 troops on the territory of the entire former  Yugoslavia. That year, more than $1 billion was spent on their  mission.    In order to ensure the implementation of the Security  Council  resolutions adopted so far and the agreements reached by the  warring parties, including the agreement reached on the creation  of the Muslim-Croat federation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina  in Washington this week, with a possibility of including it in a  confederation with Croatia, Mr. Akashi, special envoy of the UN  secretary general, and General Cot, the chief commander of the  peace forces, are asking for an additional 10,650 troops. If  this request, which is also strongly favored by British General  Michael Rose, commander of the peace forces in Bosnia, is met,  then the mission on the territory of the former Yugoslavia with  nearly 40,000 deployed troops and other staff would be the  largest and the most expensive peace operation by the United  Nations since its founding.    Judging by the mood in Europe and on the other side of the  Atlantic, it appears that the request for additional forces will  not be met. Russia has offered to send another 300 troops to  Bosnia in addition to the 400 troops already deployed there.  This has been received with visible uneasiness in the West.    The United States, on the other hand, sees its contribution  in support to the air force's mission, remaining consistent with  its view not to send land forces to the Bosnian nightmare before  an effective peace agreement acceptable to all three sides in  the conflict has been reached. One could not object to this at  all if the U.S. policy was in line with this stand. However, it  is known that Washington favors the Muslims and the Croats in  particular. This is confirmed by the latest separate agreement  between these two sides without the participation of the third,  the Serbian side.    Thus, the fear of the possible renewal of the  Muslim-Croatian  coalition, which, supported by powerful protectors, could renew  and even expand territorial and other demands to the detriment  of the Serbs, is justifiable. The old slogan that there are  many Russians and us will not be of much help to the Serbs,  because one must take into account the fact that Russia as an  indisputably big and influential power has strategic interests  in the Balkans as a whole, as well as partnership relations with  the United States and other developed countries in the West.  Therefore, our expectations should not exceed the level of that  reality.    Russia would do enough if it contributes to the halting of  further experimenting with the peoples in this region by the  creators of the new world order and if it helps in finding a  compromise solution acceptable to all sides. In that case even  a symbolic contingent of UN peace forces would be sufficient.</p>

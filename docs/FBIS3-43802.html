Tshisekedi told a news conference Mobutu, who also dissolved  the National Assembly, had carried out a "constitutional coup  d'etat".    On Friday Mobutu said an accord signed by his own supporters  and the radical opposition meant that the government of Faustin  Birindwa set up nine months ago should be dissolved "with  immediate effect" along with the transitional High Council of  the Republic (HCR) and the rival National Assembly.    A long-running power struggle between Mobutu and the  opposition had left the country with two governments, including  one led by Tshisekedi, and two parliaments.    Tshisekedi, at a press conference on Sunday, condemned the  dissolution of the HCR and claimed there had been "abuse" in  interpreting the agreement signed by the opposition Holy  Alliance, which was concerned mainly with reforming the HCR and  drawing up an election timetable.    Presidential supporters and the opposition had been engaged  in talks since last September to resolve the political crisis.  Mobutu ordered the HCR and the National Assembly to unite to  form a new transitional assembly and to choose a new prime  minister.    The first session of the enlarged body, originally set for  Monday, has been put back to Wednesday.</p>

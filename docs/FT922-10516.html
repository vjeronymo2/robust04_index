			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Observer: Spot the bank Readers are challenged to identify the investment bank portrayed as follows by two members of its central management team in a learned professional journal. According to them, it has: '. . .a very strong achievement culture; a strong (though declining) power culture; and relatively low support and role cultures. One of the features of an achievement culture is difficulty of control; the weak role culture is associated with a comparative lack of rules and procedures. 'At its simplest, this means that it is not an organisation where people naturally look for guidance from above. They want to get on with the job and regard anything that deflects them from immediate client-orientated bottom line activities as an unwelcome intrusion.' Possible clue: when formally setting objectives for his staff, one of its managers included 'Help cover my backside.' Answer later.</p>

Notwithstanding this provision, an employer that submits a revised or maintenance plan in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(iv) or paragraph (k)(1) of this section shall not be required to have the plan certified prior to its submittal to the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Plan Certifiers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Administrator shall designate an organization or organizations as plan certifiers for the Sacramento ECO program area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The Administrator will provide the Air Districts in the Sacramento ECO area with the first opportunity to become designated certifiers for employer plans for employers in the geographic areas for their jurisdiction. In addition to certifying plans for completeness, the Air Districts may provide, if they so choose, a recommendation regarding the approvability of plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Should any or all of the Air Districts in the Sacramento area decline the opportunity to become designated certifiers, the Administrator will designate another organization or organizations to certify plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Plan certification criteria. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In assessing whether a plan can be certified, the certifier shall consider the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The completeness of the plan based on the presence of all required components of plan submittals as described in paragraphs (i)(3) and (4) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The accuracy of the work location APO computation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Consistency with this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certification procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (i) A certifier shall review the plan utilizing EPA approved training and the criteria described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.

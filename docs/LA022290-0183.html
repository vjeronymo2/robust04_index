			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOUGLAS SIGNS FOR MIRAGE FIGHT;  </P> <P> BOXING: BUT $25-MILLION DEAL IS CONDITIONAL ON NEW CHAMPION GETTING OUT OF  CONTRACT WITH KING.  </P> <P> Buster Douglas signed a "conditional contract" Wednesday to defend his  heavyweight boxing championship at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas in September,  a fight that will pay him a record $25 million.  </P> <P> A Mirage spokesman said the contract Douglas signed was contingent on Douglas'  breaking his contract with promoter Don King, and that Douglas and the Mirage  had filed suit against King Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Buster Douglas and the Mirage, as co-plaintiffs, today filed suit against Don  King, seeking to break a promotional agreement King has with Douglas," Mirage  spokesman Alan Feldman said.  </P> <P> Las Vegas promoter Bob Arum, New York promoter Shelly Finkel and Douglas' camp  all said that John Johnson, Douglas' manager, and Mirage owner Steve Wynn had  completed a deal.  </P> <P> Douglas, who made $1.3 million in knocking out Mike Tyson Feb. 11, would earn  boxing's biggest purse for his first defense, most likely against No. 1  contender Evander Holyfield. One rumor had it that a two-fight deal was in the  works, with former champion Mike Tyson meeting the Douglas-Holyfield winner.  </P> <P> If the Mirage-Douglas deal is indeed made, Douglas' September payday will  exceed the record $21 million reportedly paid to Tyson after his 1988 knockout  of Michael Spinks.  </P> <P> According to Arum, Wynn and Johnson signed an agreement Wednesday afternoon.  And Arum said that he has a handshake deal to promote the fight and distribute  the pay-per-view telecast.  </P> <P> "Wynn has guaranteed Douglas $25 million," Arum said. "They signed an agreement  for Douglas to fight in September against Holyfield or another opponent."  </P> <P> Johnson acknowledged after the Tokyo fight that Douglas had signed a  promotional contract with King, in the event he defeated Tyson. But Johnson  said King breached his legal standing with Douglas by attempting to have the  Douglas-Tyson result overturned in the hours after Douglas' victory.  </P> <P> King and the Tyson camp claimed that Mexican referee Octavio Meyran had  blundered by giving Douglas a long count when Tyson knocked him down in the  eighth round.  </P> <P> Johnson's son and Douglas' assistant manager, John Johnson Jr., said Wednesday  that a deal had been completed.  </P> <P> "It'll be September and Buster will get $25 million," he said. "Dad and Buster  were to come back to Columbus and talk over everything, but things are moving  pretty quickly. It's possible everything could be signed Thursday."  </P> <P> Faced with covering Douglas' guarantee, Arum said the promotion of Douglas'  first defense will be a huge undertaking.  </P> <P> "It'll have to be the biggest-grossing fight in history just to break even,"  Arum said.  </P> <P> There was no word Wednesday as to what Holyfield would earn for a fight with  Douglas. But before Tyson-Douglas he had signed for a June 18 fight with Tyson  that would have paid him $12 million, and Tyson $22 million to $25 million.  </P> <P> Shelly Finkel, New York rock-concert promoter and pay-per-view TV syndicator,  said Johnson had told him Tuesday night he had cut a deal with Wynn.  </P> <P> "I told John that September is a problem for Holyfield's people and he  understands that. I told him we ought to look at what kind of money is out  there (for Douglas-Holyfield) before we discuss the September date."  </P> <P> From the outset, Wynn seemed to have been the bidding leader for Douglas' first  defense. In fact, the red carpet reached all the way from Las Vegas to  Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, Wynn arrived in Columbus in his private jet, a 26-seat DC-9,  picked up Douglas and Johnson, and flew them to Las Vegas. Two hours after  arriving, Douglas and Johnson had prime seats, with Wynn, for the Siegfried and  Roy show at the Mirage.  </P> <P> Dan Duva, Holyfield's promoter, was unavailable for comment Wednesday. But a  spokeswoman for his firm, Main Events, said Duva remains strongly opposed to a  September fight with Douglas.  </P> <P> "If it turns out September is non-negotiable, I'm sure he'd discuss it," said  Ellen Krudys. "But he definitely feels very strongly that the fight should be  in June."  </P> <P> Holyfield will be Douglas' opponent in September, Arum said.  </P> <P> "They may not like the date, but they'll take the fight," he said."  </P></p>

Official sources here said the region now has 243,000 women  cadres -- 34.2 percent of all the cadres in the autonomous  region. Some 55,000 of the women are from ethnic minorities.    Women also make up 23 percent of the regional people's  congress members and 17.5 percent of the regional committee  members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, the sources said.    The region has set up a computer data bank to provide lists  of possible women candidates for various positions.

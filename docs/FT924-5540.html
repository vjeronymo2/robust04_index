			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: Computing services groups win bonanza FOR THE UK-based computing services industry, the market testing programme announced yesterday is a bonanza beyond their dreams. It may eventually result in total fees of more than Pounds 750m flowing to private-sector companies. Last year, total revenues of the 200-plus members of the Computing Services Association (CSA), the trade body, amounted to Pounds 4bn. Market-testing will fundamentally redraw the profile of the industry and relationships between established suppliers and government will change. Internal operations that hold on to their department's business may emerge as computing services companies in their own right. Only a handful of companies operating in the UK are big enough and have the capability to profit substantially from the windfall. The majority of them are foreign-owned. The Inland Revenue, for example, is seeking a single strategic supplier to manage its Pounds 250m-a-year information technology budget. The contract is expected to be in place by the end of 1993 and the value in the first year is thought to be about Pounds 50m. The Revenue is speaking initially only to companies with more than 20,000 staff worldwide. Only a large manufacturer could be expected to meet the Revenue's conditions. The contenders include International Business Machines and Digital Equipment of the US, and ICL, now owned by Fujitsu of Japan. Mr David Teague, ICL managing director for government business, said he would be disappointed if his company did not win a share of the contracts on offer at the Inland Revenue, Department of Trade and Industry, Home Office and Customs and Excise. Even large companies might find difficulties in meeting the contract specifications, which imply moving computer staff from government to the private sector; IBM is losing 40,000 staff worldwide and may not relish adding several thousand Revenue personnel. The large computing services companies - Andersen Consulting, Cap Sogeti Gemini (in the guise of its UK subsidiary, Hoskyns), Computer Services Corporation, Computer Management Group and Logica and Sema Group could expect a share of the spoils. Intensive discussions are taking place to establish consortia to bid for the larger contracts. The larger concerns welcome the market-testing initiative, which will increase market volume at a slack time for computing services, but there are concerns based on a belief that the government has not fully thought through the implications of outsourcing such sensitive services. They question whether market testing is a fashion that will have to be reversed in a few years as the close relationship between policy and data processing becomes apparent. One supplier said: 'At present, if ministers ask for information, civil servants jump. It is not going to be like that again. Once data processing skills are lost, they will be hard to replace.' They are also anxious that the reputation of the industry might be damaged if companies desperate for a share of government business quote unrealistically low prices. Departments will have legal remedies against unsatisfactory service, but may have a poor appreciation of the complexity of moving from one supplier to another. Questions have also been raised about what redress a government would have if an internal department won a contract on a low bid and was unable to fulfil its obligations. Mr Colin Rowland, a director at Logica and chairman of the CSA, said market-testing would lead to increased efficiency in government computing. But some contracts were likely to be so big that only one or two companies could hope to win them; that in itself would be anti-competitive.</p>

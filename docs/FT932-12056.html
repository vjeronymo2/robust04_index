			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Hussein tries to cope with Islamic surge / Assessing the king's 40 years in power WHEN King Hussein surveys the ever-expanding white city of Amman from his hill-top palace on Sunday, he may have difficulty in recalling the small dusty outpost to the east of the Jordan River which became his capital on the May 2, 1953, the day he formally assumed constitutional powers. Thrust into a turbulent Middle East as an 18-year-old Sandhurst graduate 40 years ago, the king is now the longest reigning monarch in the world. Having survived two Arab-Israeli wars, numerous coup and assassination attempts, international alienation over the Gulf war, and now, apparently, a cancer operation, he can afford a little self-indulgent pride as Jordanians take to the streets this weekend to celebrate his accession. The kingdom is stable, its economy is growing under the watchful eye of the International Monetary Fund, and with the country's first multi-party elections since 1956 planned for later this year, Jordan is projecting itself as a model democracy in the region. 'The king's past 40 years have been vindicated,' says Mr Mustapha Harameneh, a local historian. 'His brand of nationalism with its human rights and democracy has put the Hashemites in a position of leadership in the Arab world.' But Jordan has yet to be reconciled with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait after the king refused to join the coalition forces to oust Iraq from Kuwait in 1991. The Middle East peace talks, to which the king is so firmly committed, continue to disillusion Palestinians and Moslem fundamentalists in the country. And the king's democratic vision for the future will face its most crucial test yet at the forthcoming parliamentary elections. Political parties, banned in Jordan since 1957, were legalised last year. A total of 16 parties has so far registered to vie for seats in the 80-member parliament elected nearly four years ago. But by far the strongest and most well-organised is the Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the Moslem Brotherhood, which aims to create an Islamic state. Many Jordanians fear that they will achieve a landslide victory. They point out that the splintering effect of the other 15 parties, whose manifestos are largely indistinguishable, cannot possibly create an effective opposition to the Brotherhood. The Islamists command a great deal of popular support. They hold the largest bloc, of 30 seats, in the outgoing parliament and have made significant gains in local council and student elections. They are especially effective in mobilising support from the underprivileged. Despite a real growth in gross domestic product of 11 per cent last year, a recent government survey showed that one fifth of Jordan's population of 4m fall below the poverty line. Anxiety over an Islamist-dominated government is played down by government and palace officials. 'I don't think one can say publicly that one is worried. Obviously democracy is not for the faint hearted,' says Crown Prince Hassan. But privately there is talk of changing the 1986 electoral law to a one person, one vote system which will drastically cut the number of people voting for Islamist candidates. There also remains the possibility that the elections will be postponed to allow the new non-religious parties to develop. 'If there is a breakthrough on the peace process in the next few weeks I don't think there will be elections because the government can't risk a parliament where the majority will vote against them,' predicts one MP. Although press reports have suggested that 500 Islamist candidates are to stand for election, Brotherhood officials say that rather than confront the government over the peace process they might simply retain their position as the opposition for the time being. Such a conciliatory approach would be typical of the co-existence between the fundamentalists and government over the years. Unlike Algeria and Egypt there is little evidence of Islamic militancy in Jordan and they insist that they are 100 per cent loyal to the king. But their ultimate aim is clear. 'We will influence the Islamisation of this country calmly and slowly,' says Mr Abdullah al-Akayleh, a leader of the Islamic National Front. The king established a close relationship with the Brotherhood early in his reign in order to counteract the growing threat of the leftist Nasserist and Ba'athist parties, banned in 1957 following a coup attempt. Ironically he now needs the support of such secular parties to fend off the fundamentalists' progressive bid for power. But most of all he needs the support of his people. Less than 40 per cent of the population voted in the last election in 1989 and there remains an acute sense of apathy that while the king is around everything will be all right. The danger is that without a strong anti-Islamist secular vote the elections may be yet another crisis the king has to navigate to retain maintain the status quo.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Farmers' earnings increase by 60% Farmers saw their income rise by about Pounds 1.1bn last year, an increase of 60 per cent on the level of earnings in 1992, according to figures to be published by the government today. The rise in farm receipts was almost wholly due to the devaluation of sterling in September 1992 which increased the value of European Union agricultural payments for UK farmers. Overall output from the industry slipped by 2 per cent during the year. Farmers producing milk, arable crops, beef and sheep all benefited from the devaluation of the pound. Cereal growers gained from higher subsidies paid as part of the EU's farm reform programme. Pig farmers and vegetable growers did not share in the overall return of confidence to the sector. Pig producers saw prices for pork slump because of European overproduction in the past two years. At the same time, their costs rose because of higher grain prices caused by the devaluation. Vegetable growers have seen their margins come under pressure with receipts falling in real terms for the past three to four years. Demand for fresh vegetables has also dropped. With farm incomes up substantially and most farm costs remaining steady because of low inflation and low interest rates, many farmers are beginning to invest in their business again. The National Farmers' Union estimates that investment rose by 30 per cent last year and is set to continue to rise this year. In addition, farmers reduced borrowings by 5 per cent. Mr David Naish, NFU president, said the increase in farm incomes came after many years of declining earnings and very little investment. Farmers could soon be under pressure again through the effects of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

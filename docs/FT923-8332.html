			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: PolyGram rises 16% with N American boost POLYGRAM, one of the world's top three music companies, yesterday announced a 16.3 per cent increase in interim profits, helped by an improvement in North America and strong sales from recording artists such as Lionel Richie, Elton John and Kiri Te Kanawa. The company, 80 per cent owned by Philips and listed in the Netherlands and the US, reported net income after tax and minorities of Fl 171m (Dollars 103m) in the six months to 30 June, up from Fl 147m. Mr Alain Levy, chief executive, said the results were pleasing, especially since European markets were affected by recession. The performance was in sharp contrast to that at Philips, which last week announced a 63 per cent fall in interim net profits due to price cutting in consumer electronics. PolyGram increased sales 10.1 per cent to Fl 2.98bn. North America's proportion of group sales rose 4 per cent to 22 per cent. Mr Levy said margins also improved, but remained below those for other main markets. Compact disc sales continued to increase at the expense of cassettes and records. CDs accounted for 67 per cent of units sold in the period, compared with 58 per cent last year. LP record sales fell from 7 per cent to 3 per cent. PolyGram has started production of pre-recorded digital compact cassettes (DCC), which Philips plans to launch later this year as the new generation for recorded tapes. Really Useful Holdings, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's music company in which PolyGram holds 30 per cent, performed well, the company said. Net income per share increased 17.4 per cent to Fl 1.01. The company does not pay interim dividends.</p>

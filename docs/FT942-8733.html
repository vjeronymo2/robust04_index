			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Dorrell critical of high dividends Dividend payouts by British companies may have become too high and too inflexible, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday in a speech to the council of the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Dorrell, who is conducting a review of savings and the movement of funds through the economy, said that in the early 1980s companies were distributing between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of their after-tax earnings in dividends. This 'payout ratio' rose to more than 50 per cent by 1990 and to more than 60 per cent in both 1991 and 1992. 'A long-term rise in dividend payout ratios necessarily implies reduced availability to a business of its retained earnings, and greater reliance on its ability to raise new capital from the markets,' said Mr Dorrell. 'It undeniably increases the cost of capital if the system requires a business to employ professionals to secure access to capital which it has just distributed.' Mr Dorrell added that the system may inhibit the ability of smaller companies to obtain capital, since they feel the same pressure to distribute, but face disproportionately greater costs when raising new capital. He said that the inflexibility of dividend payouts had disturbed the balance of risk between shareholders and other capital providers. Surprisingly little capital was provided in the form of term debt or preference shares, Mr Dorrell said, and both businesses and investors might benefit from a broader range of financing instruments. However, he ruled out specific dividend controls and added that tax changes would not be made until the government could 'first identify the improvement we seek and secondly establish that tax changes are the best means of achieving it'. He added: 'Neither of those two conditions have yet been established.' Lex, Page 24</p>

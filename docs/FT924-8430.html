			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Water resources drying up in EC Economic growth in the European Community will become constrained or made much more expensive by lack of fresh water, according to a report* released today by the European Commission. The shortages will be most pronounced in Mediterranean countries, but industrial and agricultural contamination of ground water could also lead to constraints in northern European countries if present patterns of use are maintained, it concludes. The study of water resources, prepared for the European Commission's Science, Research and Development directorate by Ecotec, a Birmingham-based consultancy, gets its first public airing at a conference on EC industrial and environmental policy today in Manchester. Its usefulness is that it focuses on the quantity of water in Europe, where recent debate - and EC directives - has focused on its quality. It provides a reminder that EC countries will have to invest considerable sums just to keep water flowing, before they begin to foot the bill for complying with new directives. Lack of fresh water - water from the natural water system of lakes, rivers and aquifers (water-bearing rocks or soil) - tends to be a local problem. 'Each year an average of more than 7,000 cubic metres per capita enters the rivers and aquifers. It does not always arrive where and when it is needed,' says the report. Even when it does, between 15 per cent and 30 per cent of it leaks from delivery pipes or evaporates, according to the study. Around 50 per cent of water taken for irrigation is lost before it reaches the field. The result is that the average cost of water in Europe - Ecu 0.66 per cubic metre - is between two and three times the costs in the US and Japan. European costs could rise further as countries comply to a greater degree with EC directives. The report identifies two groups of regions at risk. Metropolitan France, Belgium, Netherlands and south-eastern England could face shortages because of high population density and industrial development despite considerable rainfall and plentiful large rivers. Portugal, southern and central Spain and Italy, Greece and the Mediterranean islands might also have problems because rainfall is low at the times of year when the demand from agriculture and tourism is high. The main weakness of the report is the same one that affects most studies of water standards in Europe: the absence of reliable and comprehensive data on pollution levels. The European Commission has so far not collated data on whether its member countries are complying with its directive. Instead, the report offers anecdotal evidence to argue that pollution from pesticides and nitrates is a problem in all EC countries. It argues too that water shortages will worsen as supplies are already scarcest in the regions where demand for water is growing fastest, particularly in Spain and Portugal. The inevitable, costly solution for those areas facing future shortages is investment in technology to reduce leakages, reuse industrial water and clean wastewater. The authors of the report believe the need for this investment offers a huge opportunity for water treatment companies. *Research and Technological Development for the Supply and Use of Freshwater Resources.

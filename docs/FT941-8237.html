			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Great expectations despite harder  -Astra Satisfying investors' high expectations has become a familiar problem for Astra as the Swedish pharmaceuticals group may discover again on Friday when it presents its 1993 figures. The group's record speaks for itself: for 15 consecutive years up to 1992 profits growth outstripped sales and the feat will almost certainly have been repeated last year. Analysts' expectations range widely, but the average forecast is for pre-tax profits of SKr7.7bn - SKr7.8bn (Pounds 655m), up around 50 per cent on 1992's SKr5.12bn. The 1992 dividend of SKr1 per share (adjusted for a share split) is expected to be raised to at least SKr1.5. The wide range of forecasts stems from uncertainty over the fourth quarter performance after sizzling profits growth in the first nine months. The key to the group's success has been the spectacular growth of two drugs: Losec, an anti-peptic ulcer drug, and Pulmicort, an anti-asthma agent. But like other pharmaceuticals groups worldwide, the company has had less success in raising prices because of government clampdowns on healthcare spending. Investors will therefore be looking for a positive statement about prospects. Again, expectations are running high: Kleinwort Benson, for example, is already penciling in profits of SKr9.8bn for the current year.</p>

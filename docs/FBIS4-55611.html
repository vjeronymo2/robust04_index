			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Croatia's international position has recently  improved significantly -- this conclusion was reached by Mate  Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, the Croatian  ambassadors to the United Nations, the European Union, the CSCE,  and the Council of Europe, and by members of the Foreign Policy  Committee of the Croatian Parliament's Chamber of  Representatives.    [Correspondent] The Republic of Croatia has never been held  in higher international esteem, says Minister Granic. There are  no serious pressures from foreign countries. We have completely  adjusted our position regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina to that of  the international community. The Washington agreement is the  foundation for future relations between the Croats and Muslims.  Now that the Vienna agreement has been signed, there are no  significant obstacles to the establishment of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.    As regards the UN protected areas [UNPA's], the cease-fire  agreement has been fully implemented by the Croatian side. We  expect that the Serbian side will do the same. After that the  talks on economic issues and, finally, on political issues  should follow.    [Begin Granic recording] Our relations with Serbia are  perhaps the only thing I would like to underline. If Serbia  does not make its position regarding the UNPA's very clear, we  will insist on the sanctions, in keeping with [UN Security  Council] Resolution 871. There will be no meeting in Belgrade  and I will not travel there until the agreed conditions are met.  [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

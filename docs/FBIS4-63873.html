			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Akimov and Amangeldiy </F> Akhmetalimov]    [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] May 25 TASS -- "The Euro-Asian  union may spring up from the mutual integrational urge of the  CIS countries. The restoration of the former union or the  establishment of some sort of a confederation is out of the  question. The new union must be a logical culmination of the  basically new community of states, former members of the USSR,  which now make up the Commonwealth of Independent States,  provided they are really interested in the establishment of  deeper and more effective multilateral relations," press  secretary of the Kazakh president Nurlan Danenov told the  newspaper "KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA".    Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, he said that he was compelled to  make this statement due to recent speculations around  Nazarbayev's Euro- Asian union idea. In his opinion, the Kazakh  president's statement on the Euro-Asian union, made during his  official visit to the Russian Federation last March, was now  being used for unseemly political purposes. Some analysts are  trying to use the differing approaches of some CIS leaders to  Nazarbayev's proposal in order to drive a sort of wedge between  the commonwealth members.    The press secretary expressed the conviction that the CIS  potential was still not exhausted. "The commonwealth has already  played and continues to play an important role in the legal  corroboration of inter-state relations within it, contributing  to the civilised `divorcement'of the republics after the  collapse of the Soviet empire. However, the pace of the  intergrational processes, mildly speaking, could have been much  faster. Most telling is the absence of structures that would  ensure the fulfilment of the already concluded agreements.  Dissatisfaction with this state of affairs was behind the  Euro-Asian union idea," Danenov noted.    As to press allegations that "President Nazarbayev had  allegedly dropped the Euro-Asian union idea, well, they can  evoke nothing but surprise. The idea was not officially raised  anywhere. There was nothing but a call to exchange views on the  possibility of finding ways for promoting constructive  cooperation with CIS countries that are particularly important  for Kazakhstan and which experience the same need for our  republic. Hence, the Euro-Asian union subject can in no way be  officially excluded from further discussion," Danenov explained.</p>

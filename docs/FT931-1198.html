			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (8): Golden fibre in trouble - Jute growers face dual pressures THE jute industry, once Bangladesh's biggest export earner, is today its greatest agricultural liability. Annual losses run to more than Dollars 80m and bad debts total Dollars 925m. Shoddy management, overmanning, competition from synthetics, and a sharp fall in jute prices over the past decade have all contributed to the downfall of the 'golden fibre'. Under a World Bank-led programme, the government is trying to reform the industry ahead of its eventual privatisation. It envisages large-sale jobs losses, modernising plant and improving competitiveness. But since its announcement two years ago, the privatisation programme has consistently encountered problems in implementation: from a civil service wary of the thrust of the policy to unions fearing jobs losses. Earlier this month, jute unions took part in a (largely unsuccessful) two-day hartal - general strike - in support of a minimum wage. The industry employs a fifth of the country's workforce and earns 29 per cent of its foreign currency - down from 80 per cent at its peak in the late 1970s. The World Bank has warned that further wage increases would erode competitiveness and impede reform. The Bank is expected to announce a financing packing for reform of the sector soon, but as Mr Saifur Rahman, finance minister, says: 'The Bank may not participate in restructuring if there are further wages increases.' Some 10,000 jute workers have already accepted redundancy, but another 20,000 need to go together with a larger number of mill closures before the sector is ripe for sell-off, the government says. Mr Hannan Shah, jute minister, blames the industry's losses on old machinery and higher overhead costs. But, as independent observers say, these problems pale besides the sector's huge bad debts, the biggest single headace facing the government in overhauling the industry. Bangladesh accounts for 80 per cent of world exports of raw jute, a fibre used in many jute-based products such as hessian, carpet-backing cloth and sacking, and for 40-45 per cent of jute manufacturing. Jute acreage has been declining over the years, mainly in response to a downward trend in international prices: an average 780,000 ha were planted to jute in the early 1970s, falling to 588,260 ha in 1991-92. Slight yield improvements have not been enough to make up for the fall in area under cultivation and in general jute output has continued to decline. In 1990-91, the jute crop was 942,700 tonnes from 584,000 ha, while in 1991-92 an estimated 937,600 tonnes was produced. Bangladesh's jute fibre exports have fallen sharply, from 500,000 tonnes in the early 1980s to 288,000 tonnes in 1990-91, though they have picked up a little. After rising steadily in the 1970s and 1980s, world jute demand rose last year by just 0.7 per cent, says the Dhaka-based International Jute Organisation, which represents producers. The IJO says that with jute acreage contracting in leading producer countries such as Bangladesh and India, world output this year will total 2.9m tonnes, 15 per cent down on last year. Prospects for the industry are under a cloud: competition from synthetics and containerisation have dented demand for jute as a packaging material. Mr Shah believes crop quality must be improved so as to diversify into other jute-based products, such as paper and textiles. His ministry is studying two proposals from China and one from Japan to establish a jute-based paper and pulp industry in Bangladesh. The rise in environmental concern has also taken its toll on demand; as a result of a European Commission directive promoting recyclable forms of packaging, jute consumption in western Europe is expected to fall. The IJO is pressing EC countries to implement the directive in a way which recognises jute's environmental qualities. One of the main arguments for boosting use of jute-based paper, for instance, is that it will reduce the number of trees chopped down to supply conventional paper mills.

Its aim is to obtain additional orders for the industrial  research capacities that still exist in eastern Germany. To  achieve this goal, the BDI wants to integrate industrial  research in the "Shopping Offensive New Laender" launched with  the Trust Agency. Within the framework of this action, 90  enterprises in the sphere of industry and trade agreed to  clearly increase their purchases in eastern Germany. The BDI  wants to present this initiative at the innovation forum of the  Leipzig Fair on Wednesday [9 March].    The BDI is calling on industry in western Germany to spend a  considerable portion of its funds on research in the new  laender. It referred to the capacities of over 180 enterprises  with 4,000 employees. Details have been listed in a catalogue  by the Technology Transfer Agency in Berlin.    The industrial association hopes to use this action to stop  the further decline of capacities for industrial research in  eastern Germany. Whereas a total of 86,000 persons were still  employed in this sphere in 1989, the number has now fallen to  11,500. The BDI is aware that both private enterprises and  numerous public institutions are competing for the annual  research amount of just under 1 billion German marks. Yet it  stressed that, as a result of public subsidies, east German  enterprises are able to offer attractive services. The federal  promotion scheme "Commissioned Research East-West," under which  east German research institutes receive subsidies worth 35-40  percent of the overall research volume, has been prolonged until  the end of 1994.    The BDI hopes that existing research institutions will  develop into fertile ground for new industrial structures in the  new laender. It referred to numerous successful examples in  western Germany of the transfer of technology from research  institutions to regional enterprises. For cost reasons,  numerous companies have reduced their research capacities. At  the same time, however, they depend on new developments.  Industrial research must make use of this opportunity, the BDI  stressed.</p>

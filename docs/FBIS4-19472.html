			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Professor Mumtaz Soysal: "Identification -- </F> Friend or Foe?"]    [Text] The IFF system is used in modern military aircraft.  The acronym means "Identification -- Friend or Foe?" The  system is used by allied military aircraft and helicopters. The  pilots use the system to determine whether the aircraft on their  radar screens is a friend or a foe.    Why did the F-15 aircraft, which are affiliated with the  Hammer Force, destroy the two Black Hawk helicopters without  using their IFF systems? Obviously, a stupid communications  error must have happened, just as in the case of the [USS]  Saratoga incident in the past. The flight information of the  U.S. helicopters over northern Iraq was not conveyed to the U.S.  military aircraft patrolling the region. That was an incredible  mistake on the part of the U.S. officials. If that is the case,  it is not totally absurd to postulate the following: The U.S.  pilots were not informed of the U.S. helicopters' flight plan.  Could it be that they took them to be Turkish helicopters and  deliberately shot them down without using their IFF systems?  According to British aviation experts, confusing the Black Hawk  helicopters with Iraq's Soviet-made helicopters, even at a great  distance, is impossible.    Meanwhile, it was common knowledge that many Black Hawk  helicopters were in the air to support the Turkish military  forces' cross-border operation into northern Iraq. The U.S.  pilots should have considered that and used their IFF systems.    Considering all that, we ask whether we are confronted with  a  tragic but comical situation, one in which U.S. officials who do  not support a military solution to the problem in southeastern  Turkey, have downed their own helicopters while trying to "teach  a lesson" to Turkey by destroying one or two of its helicopters?    The picture becomes worse when that incident is put into  context with the "private" talks President Clinton held with  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller in Washington. According to the  U.S. officials who drew up the agenda for the 12-minute talks,  they were to confer on only three issues, the first being  Turkey's economy. Clinton was to inform Ciller that he would  support Turkey's economic stability measures if Ankara agreed to  sign a "stand-by" agreement with the IMF. The second issue was  the problem in southeastern Turkey. Ciller would be asked to  abandon the quest for a military solution and instead seek a  "political settlement." The third issue was the Cyprus problem.  An effort had to be made to convince Turkey to say "yes" to the  "package of confidence-building measures," which has been  changed by the UN officials.    We have been thoroughly informed on the outcome of the  discussions on the first issue; Ciller disclosed that she agreed  to the condition on the IMF. However, she is unable to make an  open disclosure on the second issue because she is aware of the  consequences of revealing that she has agreed to those terms.  Meanwhile, in view of her ignorance of past developments, she  may not fully realize the implications of agreeing to the  suggestions presented to her on the third issue. Therefore, we  wish to recall a few points to help her realize who our true  friends are and who are not.    The latest package on Cyprus is very meaningful, regardless  of the fact that it has been described as a "mini" package. It  calls for giving up a certain piece of territory. That requires  reciprocity -- that is, something very substantial and  permanent. However, the amended package calls for the Turkish  Cypriot side to lose control of a piece of territory as large as  Maras [Varosha] itself. That step will probably be taken before  the Nicosia International Airport is reopened and before  officials have an opportunity to establish whether or not  opening the airport has contributed to the lifting of the  embargo on the Turkish Cypriot side.    In view of the abandonment of the former concept on the  boundary of Maras, the package was only accepted by the Turkish  Cypriot side due to significant pressure. Considering that, any  policy tantamount to a step back from that package will be  rejected in northern Cyprus and Turkey. In fact, such a policy  would be suicidal. Therefore, those who try to use Ciller's  lust for power to encourage her to adopt suicidal decisions  cannot be her friends.</p>

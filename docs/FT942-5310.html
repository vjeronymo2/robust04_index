			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The Pineau-Valencienne Affair: Hostile strategy pays off for Schneider In 13 years as head of Schneider, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne has transformed a disparate range of business interests, ranging from steel and telecommunicatons equipment to sportswear, into one of Europe's largest electrical engineering companies. The transformation has involved an aggressive strategy of acquisitions and disposals. Landmarks include liquidation of the group's Creusot-Loire steelmaking arm in 1984, after a protracted test of strength with the Socialist government of the time. The government's refusal to rescue the steel company prompted its collapse, one of France's largest corporate failures. In 1986, Mr Pineau-Valencienne took over Telemecanique, the electrical equipment group, after a bitter battle with employee shareholders. Five years later, the target was Square D of the US, which again succumbed only after a fierce fight. The final cost of the deal, Dollars 2.23bn (Pounds 1.48bn), made it the biggest hostile takeover by a French company in the US. Mr Pineau-Valencienne's victory won him the accolade of manager of the year from the Nouvel Economiste magazine. The Schneider chairman's aggressive restructuring strategy can be seen from the company's statistics. Last year it recorded sales of FFr56bn (Pounds 6.55bn) and employed about 90,000 people. In 1981, sales of FFr40bn were achieved from a workforce of 125,000. The bottom line has also been improving, with net profits up by 33 per cent last year to FFr405m. The bulk of the group's business comes from electricity distribution, industrial controls and electrical contracting. In addition to Square D and Telemecanique, the principal subsidiaries are Merlin Gerin and Spie Batignoles. The Schneider chairman has also pursued a strategy of partnerships, resulting most recently in a joint venture with AEG of Germany in robotics. Ironically, Mr Pineau-Valencienne's role in transforming the company may prove a weakness. 'He is responsible for a lot of what the group has achieved in improving productivity and re-focusing its operations,' says one electronics industry analyst in Paris. 'As a result, his incarceration is worrying for investors.' Such worries have been reflected in the movement of the company's share price. It fell by 5.6 per cent on the day of Mr Pineau-Valencienne's arrest and by a further 5.5 per cent when the Brussels magistrates confirmed that he would be detained in prison. Industry observers say Mr Pineau-Valencienne's detention does not pose a threat to the group as a whole since the subsidiaries involved in the fraud case are relatively small - Cofibel and Cofimines represent less than 5 per cent of Schneider's total assets. But in terms of image and practical management of the group, the implications are more serious.</p>

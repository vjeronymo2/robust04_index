Speaking at  a fast-breaking party in Muzaffargarh, he said the Kashmiris  have risen against the repression of Indian troops and seek to  achieve freedom. He said the Kashmir issue can only be solved  through a plebiscite.    Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan said that he will call a meeting of  the Kashmir Committee on the 20th of this month, which will be  constituted of delegations to be sent abroad to mobilize world  public opinion against the grave human rights violations in  occupied Kashmir. According to APP, he said that he was not  happy with the deferment of the voting on the resolution on  Kashmir at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.    Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Group  president, and Maulana Mohammad Ajmal Khan, acting chief of  Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam, have also criticized the deferment of  the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir.    Hamid Mufti, a member of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council, has  commended the efforts being made by Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto's government to raise the Kashmir issue at various  international agencies. Commenting on the deferment of the  voting on the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir at the UN Human  Rights Commission, he said the objectives for moving the  resolution have been achieved. He asked the political forces to  commend the government's efforts due to which India has allowed  a Muslim delegation to visit occupied Kashmir to investigate  human rights violations. Pakistan Solidarity Front Chairman  Nabid Malik has also commended the government's efforts due to  which India has been forced to allow the ambassadors of Muslim  countries, Amnesty International, and other human rights  agencies to visit occupied Kashmir.  *</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Conference on China Trade and Investment Opens in </F> Hong Kong; Zheng Xilin, vice minister of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation, Says Both Sides Suffer if the United  States Revokes China's MFN Trading Status"]    [Text] Yesterday, Hong Kong's '94 China Trade and  Investment Fair opened at the Hong Kong Conference and  Exhibition Center. This is the largest fair of this type that  the mainland has held in Hong Kong in recent years. Four  ministries and state commissions and 24 provinces and  municipalities have sent their delegations to the fair, where  760 projects were arranged for inviting investment. Zheng Silin,  vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, and  other responsible officials from the ministries and state  commissions concerned attended the opening ceremony of the fair  and yesterday's symposium on China's foreign trade and economic  cooperation.    When attending these activities yesterday in Hong Kong,  Zheng  Silin said that China opposed the practice of linking human  rights and other non-trade issues with most-favored-nation  status. If the United States revokes China's MFN status, both  sides will incur losses and China will not be the only side  harmed. As for whether China will terminate the current  favorable policies in order to meet the GATT regulations on the  treatment of nationals, Zheng Silin said that China will not  terminate the current favorable policies for the five special  economic zones and other open cities, but will gradually bring  the policies toward state-owned enterprises and other areas into  line with the policies for the foreign-funded enterprises, the  special economic zones, and the open cities. He said that China  is comprehensively considering how to bring its foreign trade  policy better into line with the relevant GATT regulations and  other international practices, such as in the aspects of the tax  policy and the equal competition mechanism. The foreign-funded  enterprises will enjoy treatment equal to that enjoyed by  Chinese nationals, and the investment environment will be  further improved so that foreign investors' interests in China  will enjoy double guarantees from both domestic and  international law.    When mentioning the prospects for China's import and export  trade, Zheng Silin said that China's basic policy for foreign  trade is to seek a general balance between imports and exports  under the premise of maintaining the necessary foreign exchange  reserves. Increasing exports in order to ensure a sustained  increase in imports is the positive method China has used to  seek a balance in trade. It is expected that the volume of  China's imports will reach $1,000 billion over the next seven  years.    Ma Xiuhong, deputy director of the Foreign Investment  Management Department of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation, also indicated on the same occasion that,  as the amount of foreign investment is increasing, the Chinese  Government will attach greater importance to investment made by  transnational corporations which possess advanced technology and  management expertise. In particular, it will encourage  transnational corporations to invest in capital-intensive and  technology-intensive projects. China has selectively approved  the establishment of foreign investment companies which are  allowed to invest in many industries, many fields, and many  geographic areas and which are allowed to manage and provide  comprehensive services for their investment projects in China.  China is considering the relevant policies for the  establishment of transnational corporations' Asia-Pacific  headquarters, Asian headquarters, China headquarters, and  regional management organs in China.    Ma Xiuhong said: Between 1979 and 1993, China approved a  total of 174,000 foreign investment projects in China. The  agreements for these projects involved more than $220 billion in  foreign funds, and foreign investors actually injected over $60  billion in funding. Funds from Hong Kong and Macao ranked first  in terms of the amounts of investment from outside the mainland.  By the end of 1993, Hong Kong and Macao businessmen set up over  110,000 investment enterprises, and the investment in the  relevant agreements exceeded $150 billion, with over $39 billion  being actually used.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Aylwin has promulgated the last law of his  mandate: the three A's telecommunications law which, according  to Transport and Communications Minister German Molina, will  lower telephone fares. During a brief ceremony in the Camellia  Garden at La Moneda Palace, Minister Molina pointed out the most  important points of the new law.    [Begin Molina recording] This law introduces a contracted or  dialed multicarrier system that will allow the public to choose  the company with which they want to place their long distance  calls, both national and international. This choice may be made  from call to call, by dialing the identification code of the  carrier the user chooses, or by signing a contract with a  determined carrier to channel all their calls through that  company. [end recording]    The law also establishes the obligatory interconnection of  telecommunications networks, in the case of public services, and  the mediating services offered by the long distance service.    [Begin Molina recording] Another important step taken by  this  law is the adoption of measures facilitating the modernization  of the telephone networks, which will mean cheaper telephone  fares.    The telecommunications development fund plays an important  role in giving the entire public access to telephone services,  in that it includes low income users whom market laws did not  accommodate. Despite this important step there still remain  pending tasks, like strengthening the government's ability to  control and establish norms in order to surmount the imbalance  existing between the regulating agency and the regulated  companies. This is therefore a pending challenge for the  incoming administration. [end recording]    Molina recalled the difficulties in approving this bill,  mainly as a consequence of litigation among the telephone  companies, which were overcome thanks to the support of  everyone. After the ceremony President Aylwin did not wish to  speak with the media.</p>

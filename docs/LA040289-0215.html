			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIFTS TO COUNTY'S 13 LEGISLATORS  </P> <P> In regard to The Times' article "Gifts to 13 County Legislators Totaled  $116,339 in 1987 and '88," I find it hard to take the interviewed legislators  seriously.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad), for example, who enjoyed two free  nights in a Palm Desert condominium owned by a developer who was sponsoring  legislation last year (legislation that Frazee supported but claimed he was for  "all along" anyway), says he holds to the philosophy of the late Jesse Unruh:  "You should be able to take these kinds of things and not let it affect you.  That's the measure of a good legislator."  </P> <P> It may well have been that Unruh was above corruption by enticements, but few  people, certainly not most politicians, can claim such sterling integrity.  </P> <P> It's simply human nature, like it or not, to be affected favorably by people  who treat us with favor. Obvious as that truth is, politicians like Frazee  persist in pretending it's just not so. Gifts of all kinds are rationalized in  as many ways almost as there are politicians themselves, the most popular  rationale being "fact finding" or "information gathering.  </P> <P> That's how one lumber company wrapped its gift to Assemblyman Ross Johnson  (R-La Habra) and others, of a relaxing fishing expedition in Humboldt County in  December -- a trip that included a company-owned bed-and-breakfast inn, among  other benefits.  </P> <P> But Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), a little more concerned with  appearances than Johnson, takes care to stress "a lot of time" was spent  finding out about issues relevant to California regarding her trip to New  Zealand, courtesy of oil and chemical companies. Yet surprisingly (or maybe  not, considering the presumption of many politicians), she later expresses  bewilderment about why the press and public pay so much attention to annual  reports.  </P> <P> In any event, I can already hear Bergeson and countless other politicians who  read The Times, muttering in disgust about the "nit-picking of the press" and  the naivete of the public who just "doesn't understand how government works."  Well, we're learning, and the most important thing we're learning is that  whether we're talking about churches, schools or the Legislature, the name of  the game these days is accountability.  </P> <P> If it takes the bill of Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), which would,  among other things, ban gifts and honorariums valued at more than $50, to keep  legislators more accountable to their constituency, so be it. No, it won't  prove to be a panacea, but it could well be a step in the right direction.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH WATSON  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Jeyes seeks clean growth on the continent - A look at BP's sale of its 75% stake in Globol JEYES, the cleaning products group, has announced an expansion into continental Europe that will take sales from Pounds 61m to Pounds 100m and elevate the company from the Unlisted Securities Market to a full listing. The group is paying DM52.2m (Pounds 18.1m) for Globol, a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of BP, which is based in Neuberg and makes domestic insecticides, lavatory cleaners and air fresheners. The acquisition will be financed through a 3-for-7 rights issue underwritten by Barings at 385p, an 85p discount to Jeyes closing price yesterday. The deal marks a turning point for both Jeyes, which emerged from Cadbury Schweppes in a 1986 management buy-out and BP. BP's sale of its 75 per cent stake fits with its new strategy of selling peripheral activities and returning to the core business of oil exploration and development. Late last year BP approached Mr Jimmy Moir, the managing director who led the Jeyes buy-out, with the idea of the sale. For Jeyes, which has grown rapidly since the MBO and has traded for much of that time with Globol, the expansion provides a timely new business area to develop. Jeyes' bleach and disinfectant divisions are currently responsible for about half of its sales. Its Parozone bleach brand is among the market leaders in domestic bleaches and Jeyes fluid is the clear leader in disinfectants. Both markets are mature in the UK and both shrank in volume terms last year due to the recession. By comparison its automatic solid block lavatory cleaning materials business is growing rapidly. The group has commited large amounts of research to developing blocks for cisterns and sticks for the inside of lavatory bowls. It has lifted its market position to just behind Reckitt. Japan, in particular, has shown dramatic growth where two years ago there was no market. Nevertheless, to secure a longer term future, Jeyes recognised the need to generate more cash and higher margins through the development of other business areas and through international expansion. Not that the group has been unsuccessful since the buy-out and its arrival on the USM two years later. Mr Moir sold the plastic bottle blowing facility and withdrew from distribution, thereby easing the demands on capital and reducing exposure to risks not directly related to the main business. Operating profits rose from Pounds 1.77m in 1987 to Pounds 4.93m last year on sales doubled at Pounds 61.76m. Earnings per share grew in 1991 by 20 per cent to 19.6p, despite the recession. Jeyes bought Rufus Forpacknings of Sweden last year, expanding Jeyes in the moist wipes market which has been the fastest growing grocery category in the UK for the last two years. But while wipes is a promising area, Jeyes still needed a more substantial new business leg. It hopes Globol will provide it. The acquisition will add domestic insecticide and air freshener products and immediately give Jeyes direct access to the German market. The company will also gain a more sophisticated research and development facility. Once Globol is assimilated Jeyes' dependence on its bleach and disinfectant output will be much reduced. Of the combined sales of about Pounds 100m some 30 per cent will come from lavatory cleaners, 17 per cent from bleaches, 16 per cent from insecticides, 14 per cent from disinfectants and 10 per cent from wipes. Mr Moir believes the greatest immediate opportunity is to reverse the decline in Globol's operating profit margin. In 1988 it stood at 10 per cent. The following year it had fallen to 8 per cent and by last year it was 3 per cent as a result of overheads rising faster than sales and a dramatic increase in marketing expenditure. That compares with 8 per cent for the Jeyes businesses, a level which Mr Moir does not think is yet adequate to sustain internally financed growth. Mr Moir has one distinct advantage in tackling the assimilation of Globol. The Jeyes which he bought from Cadbury has certain similarities with Globol under BP; both had tired brands, runaway overheads and sometimes lacked the tight financial management displayed by smaller companies driving for earnings per share growth. While Jeyes has not trumpetted the fact, Globol will be faced with some stringent financial targets not known since it was run by the family of Mr Fritz von Philipp, the holder of 25 per cent of the stock. He is selling the stake to Jeyes and joining the main Jeyes board. Mr Moir is confident Jeyes' growth will continue rapidly this year. Yesterday he confirmed that both sales and market share were growing in the UK and that the board intended to declare an interim dividend of 3.1p, up 19 per cent on last year.</p>

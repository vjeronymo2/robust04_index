			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Alexon falls on profits fear - More bad news awaited from demerged women's wear company FEARS OF a second profit warning in six weeks led yesterday to a 17p fall in the share price of Alexon Group, the women's wear retailer. The 82p closing level represented a new low since its demerger from Claremont Garments (Holdings), the Marks and Spencer supplier, in July 1991. A couple of months after that move the price hit 444p, but it has slid downhill since under the weight of slack trade in the high street and management mistakes on stock. The shares were undermined yesterday as analysts anxiously awaited a statement about Christmas trading and the January sales. If the news is bad, annual pre-tax profit could fall to a little more than break-even, compared with Pounds 11.3m in 1991-92. Balance sheet worries also emerged, with the focus on the possibility of further stock write-downs. Net debt at the January year-end may be as much as three times last year's level, pushing gearing above 60 per cent. The forecast increase in borrowings from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 20m or more is only partly accounted for by a delayed tax payment of Pounds 4.5m. Stock build-up is suspected of having played a part. Meanwhile Claremont - once the cash cow of the combined group - last week saw its share price soar to a new high of 337p with the help of a confident statement from M and S. Yesterday it eased 11p to 326p - still twice its opening level in July 1991. Profit forecasts for Alexon had already been knocked back from Pounds 7m to about Pounds 4m after a profit warning in early December. That announcement stressed disappointing sales at the Dash leisure wear chain. Two months earlier Mr Lawrence Snyder, chairman, had warned that unsold spring and summer stock, mainly from the Alexon women's wear ranges, would lead to a stock write-off at the end of the year. Analysts pencilled in a profit reduction of about Pounds 2m to account for that. Criticisms levelled at Alexon include that it was slow to change its classic women's wear formula, for instance remaining wedded to co-ordinates for too long, and that Dash was vulnerable to competition, deferred spending on leisure wear and the high fixed cost of prime locations. Only Eastex, the revamped range for older women, has escaped the scepticism. Like the Alexon collection it is sold mainly through concessions in department stores. In the first half of the year, the group's pre-tax profit fell 46 per cent to Pounds 2.08m on reduced turnover of Pounds 48.7m. Both the Alexon and Dash brands suffered like-for-like sales falls of about 10 per cent. Although the autumn ranges got off to a good start, Dash proved the most vulnerable to a further sagging of consumer confidence after 'black Wednesday' on September 16. The ensuing profit warning also led analysts to forecast a cut in the final dividend from 7.6p to as little as 2p. This is reflected in the historic yield of 17 per cent. Claremont is now on 2.58 per cent historically, significantly below the market average. At yesterday's closing prices, Claremont's market value was Pounds 131.2m, Alexon's Pounds 23.7m.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / German interest rates put Emu success at risk HIGH German interest rates are jeopardising many EC countries' chances of meeting the stiff fiscal targets set for European monetary union (Emu) at the Maastricht summit. The objectives were laid down as the crucial criteria to decide which countries could participate in Emu at the end of the decade. However, sluggish European economic growth  - a consequence of high interest rates across the continent  - is leading to a sharp increase in EC public-sector borrowing this year. This compounds the economic obstacles in the path of Emu, which is already facing larger than expected political hurdles because of the growing reluctance of the German population to countenance abandoning the D-Mark. Underlining a growing mood of questioning about Germany's commitment to Emu, one senior European central banker said at the weekend: 'There's no doubt that they (the Germans) are having some second thoughts.' Economic expansion in most western European countries is expected to remain in the 1-2 per cent range this year, after an average of only 1.2 per cent last year. Dampened growth automatically widens public-sector deficits by increasing social security spending and reducing tax revenues. This is raising doubts over whether a majority of European countries will be able to fulfil the fiscal targets by the time of the earliest date for Emu in 1997. Because of bloated deficits caused by unification, some experts at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris calculate that Germany itself may not be able to meet the fiscal targets. A considerable economic pall has been cast by the Bundesbank's policy of keeping interest rates high to dampen the inflationary effect of steep German public-sector deficits. These deficits have been driven up by large-scale transfers of public funds from west to east Germany. Reflecting concern about the growth of German money supply well outside the Bundesbank's target range, the central bank seems likely to keep its discount and Lombard interest rates unchanged at least until the autumn. They were raised to 8 per cent and 9 3/4 per cent respectively - the highest levels since the 1930s  - a week after the Maastricht meeting. The Maastricht fiscal policy criteria require that countries bring their budget deficits down to no more than 3 per cent of gross domestic product. The outstanding stock of government debt is required not to exceed 60 per cent of GDP. Andrew Fisher adds from Frankfurt: Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank, reaffirmed yesterday that the bank had no intention of cutting interest rates for the moment, as inflation was 'unacceptably high' and money supply growing too fast. The bank's goal was an inflation rate of 2 per cent or less.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               EUROPE'S STRUGGLE FOR CONVERGENCE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Inflation (A) Deficits (B) Debt (C) Int Rates (D)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Target                4.4          -3        60.0         10.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium               3.2          -5.7     131.5          9.3 Denmark               2.4          -1.7      59.6          9.3 France                3.1          -1.7      47.1          9.0 Germany               3.5*         -3.2      43.4          8.5 Greece               18.9         -17.9      85.2         23.3 Irish Rep             3.2          -2.7     113.0          9.2 Italy                 6.4         -10.1     103.8         13.0 Luxembourg            3.1          -1.9       6.9          8.1 Netherlands           3.9          -3.5      79.8          8.7 Portugal             11.3          -5.4      64.7         17.1 Spain                 5.9          -3.9      45.3         12.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures in bold indicate statistics which meet Maastricht criteria.

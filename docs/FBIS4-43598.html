			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today  commented on the decision of the Turkish Constitutional Court  outlawing Turkey's Democratic Party. International public  opinion, he said, which can recognize justice, will judge this  move.    The KKE [Greek Communist Party] described the Turkish  court's  decision to dissolve the Democratic Party and remove 13 deputies  from office as illegal and an escalation of the persecution of  the Kurdish people.    The Coalition of the Left and Progress protested the Turkish  move as a brutal violation of basic democratic freedoms. It  also stressed that geopolitical expediencies lead the powerful  countries to take hypocritical stances.</p>

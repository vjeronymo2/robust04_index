			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Aleksandr Shashkov] </F>   [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, opening  today's Russian government session, was strict as usual. He  began by removing two questions from the agenda since Cabinet  members had not had time to acquaint themselves with them, and  by recognizing as correct the criticism of the government  expressed by the president at a news conference.    The report by the deputy minister of economics on the  preliminary results of the first six months of this year  bristled with figures. On the basis of them, Yakov Urinson drew  the conclusion that the government program for stabilizing the  situation in the economy is beginning to bring real positive  results, and that any talk of the collapse of the economy or of  it being on the brink of collapse is groundless.    Without denying the claims of the Economics Ministry, Viktor  Chernomyrdin nevertheless cast doubt on the figures on which  they are based. As it turned out, statistics today follow the  imprecision of the statistics of the Soviet Union, with the  difference that if previously the indices received by the State  Committee for Statistics were exaggerated in the name of the  transient red banner, then now they are underestimated in order  to avoid taxes, which also confirms the movement of the economy  toward market relations.</p>

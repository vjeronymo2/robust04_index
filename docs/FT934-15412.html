			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Personal View: Unified Germany no drag on Europe The unification of Germany would not have been possible without the help and support of our partners in the west. Our neighbours, too, have felt the effects of unification in various ways, politically as well as economically: unification initially generated a surge in growth for our EC partners amounting to 1 per cent of their gross national product in 1990-1991. But since then, the economic consequences of German unification have become, for some, a cause for dissension. German unity is being blamed for high interest rates and flagging growth in Europe. Is there any substance to these allegations? One fact is that Germany now has to transfer internally, from west to east, at least 5 per cent of its gross domestic product each year. In spite of savings of DM30bn-DM40bn in the federal budget since 1989, equal to about 1.5 per cent of GDP a year, this has pushed the general government deficit up to 4-4.5 per cent of GDP (using the internationally comparable national accounts definition); the deficit amounts to between 5.5-6 per cent of GDP if one includes Germany's future commitments in assuming the debt of the Treuhandanstalt and the German railways. But it is also a fact that countries such as Belgium, the UK, Italy or Sweden have higher public sector deficits without having undergone such an unprecedented task as reunification. There are other countries that have run continuously high deficits for a decade or more, whereas Germany managed to realise a moderate fiscal surplus in 1989, the year of unification. The decisive fact is that Germany is now putting into effect, through legislation, a consolidation strategy that will bring down fiscal deficits within a clear time-frame. Regional and local governments have now joined the federal government in following this course. Annual expenditure growth is to be held to about 3 per cent up to 1997. This is exactly half of the projected rise in nominal GDP over the same period. Among the leading industrial countries, Germany is making the greatest effort to cut its deficit. According to the International Monetary Fund's most recent estimates, Germany's structural budget position (including the deficits of Treuhandanstalt and the railways) will improve by about 5 per cent of GDP between 1991 and 1995. No other Group of Seven country is making a comparable consolidation effort in such a short period of time. Of course, as a result of the weak economy, the improvement in the structural budget has been partly offset by a deterioration in the cyclical component of the fiscal balance, but by 1996 we expect an actual aggregate government deficit of 2 per cent of GDP. And we are not overly optimistic in our assumptions: we have based our medium-term planning on a real average annual growth rate of 3 per cent. Of this, about half a percentage point a year is attributable to the disproportionate rise expected in east Germany. By assuming about 2.5 per cent annual growth for west Germany we are staying on the safe side, in line with most international projections. We have not been dragging our feet in dealing with our financial problems; indeed, individuals and enterprises in Germany have been called upon to pay additional taxes and other fiscal charges amounting to some 3.5 per cent of GDP annually. This is also evidence of our efforts to avoid shifting the burden on to our neighbours' shoulders, for what we can finance at home from additional revenue will not weigh down international capital markets. Our strategy is already paying off. We have put the phase of high interest rates in Germany well behind us. Over the past 12 months, money market rates have declined by 3 percentage points. Bond yields have fallen by almost the same amount, and at below 6 per cent are now appreciably below their long-term average of 7 per cent. Germany is not the 'lame duck' of the world economy either. Measured over the period 1989-1993, aggregate real growth in Germany at 11 per cent has been more than one-fifth higher than the G7 average. The recession in Germany is so pronounced because the preceding boom was so much more vigorous. We are also aware of Germany's need for structural improvement. Germany is one of the first industrial countries to have launched a comprehensive government programme, adopted by the cabinet a few weeks ago, that contains a far-reaching assessment of the situation and a broad catalogue of action. Germany is still prepared to work hard and to get to grips with its problems. And we will continue to do this in co-operation with our friends and neighbours in Europe and throughout the world.

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Save &amp; Prosper to end free banking ROBERT FLEMING Save &amp; Prosper is expected to announce today that it is introducing some transaction charges for banking customers whose accounts remain in credit. Reaction to the move is likely to be watched closely by other banks. The bank, which has about 50,000 customers, said yesterday that it could not comment on its plans. However, it expected to make an announcement today which would affect the terms for some of its current accounts. Mr Ian Lindsey, the group's banking director, said that the bank wanted to inform its customers first of any changes to their accounts. It had about six different forms of account with different terms and conditions. The group was among the financial services groups which introduced free banking for customers in credit in the 1980s as competition between building societies and banks for personal customers' business grew. The large high street banks are all considering introducing charges for customers in credit, but none has disclosed any immediate plans to do this. Most banks only charge when personal customers' accounts are overdrawn. A study by the Association of Payment and Clearing Services found that the clearing system cost the banks Pounds 4.5bn a year.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Letter: Electricity in an open market Sir, The purpose of the electrical supply industry is to provide reliable, economically priced electricity to the consumer. The ability of generators to optimise fuel price and security of supply in both the short and long term on the world markets is a major factor in achieving this objective. Prof Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, was therefore correct in telling the Department of Trade and Industry select committee that it is not his job to determine fuel mix. However, it is his job to protect the consumer. In regard to the gas contracts of the regional electricity companies he referred to his power to disallow uneconomic charges to pass through. He then went on to indicate that there is not a single price for electricity, that there were factors other than price and that it is not his job to review every gas contract signed by the regional electricity companies (RECs). Given this apparently self-negating interpretation (with which I agree), how to move forward? Clearly the requirement is for mechanisms that encourage proper market behaviour. Specifically, contract negotiations should be conducted in an open market and not, as now, in secret. Then prima facie evidence for misuse of market power by either RECs or generators would be visible, acting as a deterrent and providing both transparency for regulatory bodies and easily accessible evidence for any inquiry.

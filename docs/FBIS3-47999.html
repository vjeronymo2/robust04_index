Accordingly, the government will decide on its position  after  discussion with ministries concerned, including the Ministries  of Foreign, Defense, and Finance, in February.    On 21 January, a government official said, "The Russian  Government recently sent official documents to the ROK proposing  joint development and production of weapons." He added that,  "The government is carefully reviewing the list of possible  items sent by Russia for joint development." The Russian  proposal, which was made on the level of ROK-Russian economic  cooperation, says that Russia will provide the ROK with 25  end-products, that the ROK may manufacture weapons with Russia's  permission, and that the ROK and Russia jointly develop and  produce weapons. Ultramodern weapons -- such as missiles,  submarines, tanks, and fighter planes -- are included in the  list of items proposed by Russia for joint development and  supply.    According to the government official, the ROK Ambassador to  Russia Kim Sok-kyu will return home soon for intensive  discussions on this matter.    The position of the Foreign and Finance Ministries on this  matter is that the ROK should at least consider the Russian  proposal, while the Defense Ministry is saying that the ROK  should consider the proposal cautiously, taking into  consideration ROK-U.S. relations, supply of parts, and  compatibility of equipment.    Russia proposed joint development and production of  ultramodern weapons to the ROK through unofficial channels late  last year.</p>

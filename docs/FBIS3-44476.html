			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, December 30 (XINHUA) -- The puzzle of how  China, with less than 10 percent of the world's arable land,  manages to feed about one fifth of the population of the globe,  prompted Aziadomi Kogblevi to come to China.    Kogblevi, an adviser on technology and development of  agriculture and forestry of Benin, a small African country, was  just one of swarms of foreign visitors to probe China`s  agricultural success.    The year of 1993 has seen a China brisk in agricultural  exchanges with the outside world.    "The Ministry of Agriculture has received delegations from  such countries as Senegal, Jordan, Mexico, Myanmar (the former  Burma), Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Cuba, and the United States  this year," said Jin Shisheng, an official responsible for  international cooperation in the ministry.    "Prominent among the visitors was American Agricultural  Minister Mike Espy," Jin said. "He was the first American  cabinet member touring China since Clinton took power.    "He was also the first American agricultural minister coming  to China since the establishment of the Sino-American joint  working group on technological cooperation in agriculture in  1980."    Espy's visit was considered "the new starting point for  Sino-  American agricultural cooperation," Jin said.    Another important figure was Arturo Gusman Pascual, the  chairman of the Cuban Price Commission, who was authorized by  Fidel Castro, Cuba's top leader, to have a thorough look at the  booming agriculture here.    Meanwhile, 4,400 Chinese people have been sent abroad for  the  purpose of investigation, training and promotion of trade this  year.    He Kang, China's former minister of agriculture, visited  Japan and later went to India where he found both sides were  interested in exchanges of sources of seeds and science and  technology.    The visit of incumbent Minister Liu Jiang to Israel scored  rich achievements: the setting up of a joint commission of  agriculture and the signing of a memorandum between the two  agricultural ministries.    Scientific communications and economic cooperation in  agriculture have been given a strong impetus with these busy  exchanges.    So far China has fostered scientific and economic relations  with 114 countries and almost all the international agricultural  organizations and institutions, while involving itself in many  important agricultural activities.    The Ministry of Agriculture has reaped as much as 83.5  million U.S. dollars worth of aid this year, up 20 percent on  1992, with which Germany and Australia will help China in the  fields of bringing up fine breeds of pigs and dairy cows and  protection of dry land.    World Food Program offered China 13 million U.S. dollars  worth of food aid gratis, and the United Nations Food and  Agricultural Organization approved programs costing over 6  million U.S. dollars for preserving fresh fruit and fish.    The U.N. Development Program also sanctioned this year "the  Development Plan in Northwest China", worth of 8.59 million U.S.  dollars, consisting of six projects.    In order to strengthen China's cooperation with the U.N.  Food  and Agricultural Organization [FAO], Minister Liu Jiang attended  the FAO's 27th conference, held in Italy this year.    China was also a participant in the World Agricultural  Development Foundation's 16th conference on management, and was  elected a member of the organization's executive bureau.    In September, at the 49th meeting of the executive bureau, a  project covering agricultural development in Yunnan, a remote  province in southwest China, was ratified, and a preferential  loan of 25.79 million U.S. dollars was promised to China.</p>

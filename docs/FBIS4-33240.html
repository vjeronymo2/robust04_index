			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jesus Matheus Linares; quotation marks as </F> published]    [Text] Caracas, May 30 -- This Monday May 30, at midday, an  arrest warrant was executed for Air Force General Efrain  Francisco Visconti Osorio and four other officers. The four  officers fled with Visconti to Lima, Peru, following the failed  coup attempt on 27 November, 1992.    Gen. Visconti Osorio arrived with his four subordinate  officers at the Military Court at approximately 1330. The men  were transferred from the Lino Clemente Battalion headquarters,  where they are being held.    Visconti told reporters: I am not interested in commenting  on  any issues.    He was asked: Are you considering returning to the  Venezuelan  Air Force?    That is our greatest hope.    Are you sure President Caldera will grant a pardon?    We are sure of that. That is part of the peace policy the  President and the government are promoting.    What are the conditions?    The basic condition is for us to face justice and the  government will guarantee a pardon.    The general was also asked about a rumor that the officers  exiled in Peru were given millions of bolivars to return to  Venezuela. He responded by shaking his head with a smile of  amazement.    Why did you flee the country on 27 November?    He said flatly: We have already answered that question  before.    What is your opinion about the arrest warrant issued for  former President Carlos Andres Perez?    You have studied that in detail and know more about it than  I  do, as I have just arrived, he answered.    You have said you have "great hope" for the country.    Our intention is to contribute to finding a definitive  solution for all of the soldiers who remain under arrest,  following the 4 February and 27 November uprisings.    Why were you the last to return?    Because I was the highest ranking officer to go to Peru and  the process demanded I return last, he explained.    "Panorama" asked Visconti if he would accept a position in  the Caldera administration, as Commander Arias Cardenas did,  once he is pardoned and leaves the Venezuelan Armed Forces. He  flatly said: "That we will have to study when the situation  requires that type of evaluation."    Do you have any political aspirations?    There is nothing in that direction at this time, he said.    Captain Freddy Rio Pacheco, the presiding judge, reported  that once the officers have been formally served with the arrest  warrants, Carmen Salinas will temporarily act as their defense  attorney. Rios explained that this would be "to assist them in  preparing their deposition at the inquiry, read the trial  records, and set the dates for the formal inquiry.</p>

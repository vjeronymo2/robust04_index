			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Restricting Industries That Cause Pollution"] </F>   [Text] Sarwono Kusumaatmaja, minister of state for the  environment, has warned that the governmemt will put a limit on  businessmen wishing to invest in industries that will pollute  the environment. Industrial plants will also be relocated to  restricted areas.    Minister Sarwono was speaking at a coordinated meeting on  environment and water polllution, which was chaired by Hartarto,  coordinating minister for industrial and trade affairs, on Pulau  [Island] Air, near Jakarta recently. He said that the  government will phase out the operational permits of pulp and  paper companies that use chlorine, mercury, and sulphur in their  productions. The government will also prohibit new investment  in projects that are not environment-friendly.    It is understandable that participants focussed their  attention on ways to overcome the environmental impacts of toxic  waste throughout the meeting. This is in line with the  post-Uruguay Round talks on exports strategy, whereby products  are highly competititive in the world market. Indonesian  manufacturers are required to act together on environmental  protection because the environment has become an important  economic asset. They have to assure consumers in the developed  countries that they are serious about dealing with environmental  issues, otherwise their export products will be rejected by  these countries.    Indonesian exporters should pay serious attention to the  demands of the world market for more environmentally-friendly  products to take advantage of the new GATT rules on market  access signed in Marrakesh, Morocco, last April.    At the meeting, it was also mentioned that at least 51  percent of Indonesia's industrial products are targeted for  countries that apply eco-labelling rules to their imports.  Actually, Indonesian exporters can request the office of the  minister of state for the environment to eco-label their  products. Yet, to date not even one exporter has asked for his  products to be inspected. We admit that all this while even  without the eco-labelling rules being observed, some products  were able to be exported; however, sooner or later their  international competitiveness will decline.    Indonesia's products are exported mostly to EC member  countries, which are calling for the application of the  eco-labelling rules on products sold to them. The pressures not  only come from the importing countries, but also from consumers  who are environmentally aware.    We have to bear in mind that the manufacturers' commitment  to  environmental awareness is linked to the export of their  products on the international market, otherwise their  competitiveness could not be maintained. On the other hand, the  closure of existing industries and the prohibition of new  investment projects will decrease employment opportunities in  the country. This situation will worsen social disparities  because the manpower growth rate is higher than that of the  growth rate of job opportunities.    Can the restriction and closure of industries that produce  toxic wastes be the only alternative to comply with the world  trade regulations or are there any other alternatives?  Indonesia should study the facts on production technology from  other pulp and paper manufacturing countries that have stopped  using chlorine in their productions. The papers that are  manufactured from pulps contain chloride, causing hazards to  health when they are used for wrapping up food. Waste water  from the pulp and paper industries reaches danger level when it  contains over 1.5 kilograms of chloride per ton.    However, it is impossible to say that waste water from all  industrial plants is free from chlorine because industries that  produce toxic waste do exist. A plastics plant, for example,  cannot replace the chlorine in its manufacturing process.    When these industrial plants are equipped with water  treatment [preceding two words in English] facilities, it is  possible to neutralize the environmental impact of dangerous  toxic waste. Now the only problem left to be looked into is the  system of waste disposal, or how the toxic waste is being  handled, so that it will not endanger the surrounding area. To  cite an example, the construction of a paper factory in North  Sumatera turned into a political issue because the local  residents and the owners of the factory could not reach a common  settlement on the method of waste disposal. It will take some  time before the government can impose a law on all industries  prohibiting them from using any toxic material, and this has to  be implemented in stages. The government cannot force  industrial plants to stop using the dangerous chemicals in their  production within a short time because this will create a  distortion in the country's industrial policy.    Now that the government has shown its committment to  coupling  trade with the environment, obviously it will require wise and  rational measures to cope with the circumstances so that  industrial development in the country will not be jeopardized.  The Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) is expected to be more  selective when issuing operational permits to companies or  industries by taking into consideration the possibility that  they may pollute the environment, the use of dangerous raw  material in their productions, the type of machinery to be used,  and the type of goods to be produced. In this way, industries  that are hazardous to the environment will be cut out.</p>

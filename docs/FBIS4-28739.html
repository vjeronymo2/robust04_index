			<p>BFN     [Text] On 11 June the people and the National Army of  Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] swept the invading forces of the  two-headed government from Toek Chum commune to Spean Treng and  from Prasat commune to Phnum Liep commune in Preah Net Preah  District, Battambang Province. We completely liberated and and  now control this area including the following nine villages:  Rouch, Spean, Toek Chum, Cha, Kouk Siem, Toek Haoch, Aumal,  Anlung Cha, and Bat Trang.    We killed or wounded a number of enemy soldiers and seized  15  assorted firearms and a quantity of ammunition and war materiel.    The people also joined hands in destroying the Phnum Liep  bridge to deprive the communist Vietnamese puppets and  two-headed government of its use for transporting troops and  ammunition in their operations to persecute, kill, and rob the  local people.</p>

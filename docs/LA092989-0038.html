			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle called for all-out support for non-Communist  resistance factions in Cambodia to help prevent a comeback by the Khmer Rouge.  Speaking in Malaysia at the end of a four-nation Asian tour, Quayle declined to  say whether his comments mean the United States has been sending military  assistance to those factions. He told reporters that "I want to reaffirm our  strong support for the non-Communist resistance. We need to make sure that they  have credibility, that they have resources, that they can participate  efficiently in a resolution in Cambodia." The Khmer Rouge was blamed for 1  million deaths during its 1975-78 rule.  </P></p>

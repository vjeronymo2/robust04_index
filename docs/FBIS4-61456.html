			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Larisa Ivanova under the "Kirgizia" rubric: "TV </F> Viewers Will See Executions. Republic's Leaders Think This Will  Help Fight Crime"]    [Text] One more nightmarish novelty -- seeing executions  on your home television -- may soon be added to the horrors  taking place in the post-Soviet space. The news agency  POSTFACTUM has learned from unofficial sources close to the  president's staff that the public relations department has "for  a long time and seriously" been discussing the possibility of  such broadcasts on the Republic's television. Should this  rather extravagant idea be approved by the Republic's  parliament, the department's staffers would begin drawing up  corresponding documents. Local observers believe such  broadcasts would prove to be the biggest "box-office" shows.    Major General Sutalinov, the Republic's minister of internal  affairs, has stated in this regard that in a civilized state  such educational measures are unacceptable, but "in our bleak  living even the impossible is possible." "Neighboring Turkmenia  [Turkmenistan] went for it but it has hardly improved the crime  situation in the fraternal republic," the general pointed out.    This is essentially simply savagery, and it is not going to  help combat crime a bit. On the contrary, having grown to be a  customary sight, death would erode the principles of humanism in  people's minds because violence, even in the form of punishment,  only breeds violence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young  Democrats [Fidesz], has announced that he is willing to give up  his mandate as party chairman but will remain in his post if the  Young Democrats' congress asks him to do so. Fidesz, which  according to the most recent data is the last--sixth, with  scarcely more than 7 percent of the votes--of the parties to get  into parliament, will make a decision at a session of the  presidium tomorrow about the convening and date of this  extraordinary meeting.    Viktor Orban said that as long as he is chairman of Fidesz  his party would certainly not enter into a coalition with the  Hungarian Socialist Party, which received the most votes.  According to Orban, the country has voted for a radical change;  Fidesz, however, wanted only a partial turnabout, and this is  probably why it performed more poorly than expected.</p>

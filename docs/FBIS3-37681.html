The news  conference took place after his political consultations with  three EC foreign ministers -- those of Belgium, Greece, and  Germany.    Kozyrev said that at the moment UN representatives are  discussing the number of personnel in such formations. There is  hope that this problem will be solved within the next few hours  and Russian "blue helmets" will take part in the peacekeeping  operations in Sarajevo. The main thing is not to miss the this  opportunity but to move toward the peace settlement.    He said that Russia has historical, cultural, and religious  sympathy with all the peoples of southern Europe and is  interested in stability in the Balkans. It is in Russia's  interests that all the states in this region should enjoy their  sovereignty and independence and renounce all territorial or any  other claims on each other by solving all the problems by  political means. In particular, we are always ready to offer  our help as mediators in solving controversial problems between  Athens and Skopje, both of which we consider as friendly states,  he said.    During all the stages involved in reaching a Bosnian  settlement, the Russian minister said, we have been taking part  in the efforts that are being made to resolve the conflict  politically, both in Sarajevo and in Bosnia as a whole. These  efforts have been manifested in the new Russian initiative to  set up security zones, primarily around Sarajevo. They have  found expression in the letter that Russian Federation President  Boris Yeltsin sent to the Serbs, and to which their positive  reply has been received.    A. Kozyrev commended the efforts by Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias, who has launched a personal initiative for  moving toward peace in the region.    Reiterating the importance of B. Yeltsin's message, the  minister said that Russia is now trying to get the United States  and other partners to exert the necessary influence on all sides  in the conflict, especially the Muslims and Croatians, so that  they opt not for force but for using the opportunities opening  up for achieving peace in Sarajevo and in Bosnia as a whole.  The laurels for whoever does the most for this will be shared  later, if this is necessary at all, A. Kozyrev concluded. The  main thing is not to miss this new opportunity for peace in  Europe.</p>

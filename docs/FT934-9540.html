			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Warburg trebles pre-tax profits: Details of revenues show big contribution from marketmaking and proprietary trading SG WARBURG Group, the UK-based investment bank, yesterday reported pre-tax profits for the six months ended September 30 nearly trebled to Pounds 148.8m from Pounds 51.2m in the year-ago period. Earnings per share rose to 89.9p from 24.7p. The group for the first time also provided a breakdown of the sources of its revenues, detailing the very significant contribution which marketmaking and proprietary trading had made in the first half of the year. Analysts said the figures, which had not been expected in such detail, were partly responsible for knocking the Warburg's share price down 20p to 857p yesterday in spite of its report of record six-month earnings. The group also raised its interim dividend to 6p per share from 5.25p. Warburg said fees and commissions provided revenues of Pounds 302.5m, up 42 per cent on the six months ended September 1992. Of that, 'perhaps less than 10 per cent' were advisory fees earned on Warburg's two largest international equity offerings; the Pounds 5.4bn stake in British Telecom sold on behalf of the UK government and the demerger of pharmaceuticals company Zeneca from ICI. 'Everyone tends to overstate the profitability of the trophy transactions,' said Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, noting the heavy costs associated with the BT and Zeneca offerings. Marketmaking and proprietary trading revenues were Pounds 140.6m, up from Pounds 39.8m. Group operating costs also rose significantly during the period, with personnel costs up to Pounds 224.5m from Pounds 146.1m in 1992. Return on capital for the investment banking division - exempting Warburg's 75 per cent stake in Mercury Asset Management - was 25 per cent pre-tax, Lord Cairns said. Of the Pounds 1.26bn in regulatory capital employed by the group, Pounds 1.05bn was deployed in investment banking. Lord Cairns said the group would be devoting greater capital in future to developing its derivatives business, expanding on its recent acquisition of KC-CO, a Chicago-based firm. 'We have a significant amount more to do,' he said. Geographically, Lord Cairns said that all regions 'contributed to profitability', but declined to elaborate.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] In Mexico City, four under secretaries explained to  senators the details of the country joining the OECD. Guillermo  Ortiz, deputy secretary of finance, Pedro Noyola of commerce,  Andres Rosenthal of foreign relations, and Norma Samaniego of  labor, appeared before senators and reported that Mexico, in  joining the OECD, does not grant any privileges in addition to  those established by local regulations. Regarding commerce,  Noyola said this:    [Begin Noyola recording] We do not relinquish our status as  beneficiaries of the general preferential treatment that  industrialized countries apply to developing countries. [end  recording].    Mexico remains entirely free to sign regional commercial  agreements, he said.    Ortiz of finance said financial openings were a difficult  point in the negotiation but that a gradual basis was  established for operations of banks, stock exchanges, and  insurance companies; operations that will be revised in 1998.    Rosenthal of foreign relations said that Mexico did not join  a wealthy men's clubs. He explained that joining the OECD will  not magically solve the national growth's shortages and  deficiencies. Samaniego of labor said that Mexico's advantage  in this area is that the nation will have access to advanced  studies on labor and job markets.    The senators were informed that in this year's first  quarter,  foreign investment increased 89.5 percent over last year. In  the first few months of 1994, more than $5.2 billion have been  invested in creating 34 new corporations under the new foreign  investment law. Sixty-three percent of these investments  originated in the United States. Following the meeting, the  senators will decide whether or not to approve Mexico's joining  the OECD.</p>

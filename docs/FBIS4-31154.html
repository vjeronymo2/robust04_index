			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "dz": "GUS--How Much State-Owned Property?"] </F>   [Text] According to the Central Office of Statistics  [GUS], at the end of last year, just 39 percent of the employed  worked in the public sector (formerly known as the "state-owned  sector"). The highest numbers were employed in the health  protection and education systems, where, according to official  statistics, the role of the private sector continues to be  minimal.    The prevalence of the public sector over the private one  also  continues to exist in transportation and industries, even  though, when it comes to the latter, the public sector's role  continues to decrease. The trade and construction industries  have clearly been mostly privatized.    Within the so-called material production area, (without  taking ownership distinctions into account), 5.9 million people  worked in the last quarter of 1993, with the highest number (3.2  million people) in industries. Out of the 2.8 million people  outside of the material-production sector, 1.1 million were  employed in the education system, 815,000 in health service,  323,000 in state administration and the justice system, and  241,000 in finance and insurance.    Salaries in the nonmaterial sector were lower by as much as  11.1 percent than salaries in the material sector--that was the  biggest difference in three years. The biggest differences were  reported with regard to salaries in health protection and in  education: They were lower by 15.5 percent than salaries of  those employed in enterprises. On the other hand, average  salaries in the state administration exceeded those in  enterprises by 33 percent, but that means a relative  deterioration of the ratios: In 1992, salaries of clerks were  higher by almost 40 percent than the average salary paid out in  enterprises.    In the fourth quarter of 1993, the average salary in the  material sector amounted to 4.7 million zlotys [Z], while the  average salary outside of the sector was Z4.1 million, including  Z3.6 million in education and health services, and Z5.4 million  per month in science.    In industries, where the average salary was almost Z5  million  per month, very big differences were reported between individual  branches: Z9 million (without annual awards) in the excavation  industry, but only Z4.3 million per month, on average, in the  processing industry. Out of the material sector, the lowest  salaries were reported in agriculture--Z3.5 million--while those  in forestry were not much higher--Z3.7 million per month.    The average employee retirement pension was Z2.8 million  before taxes and 2.3 million per month after taxes. Regarding  agricultural retirement pensions, the numbers were Z1.5 million  and Z1.3 million per month, respectively. Employee pensions  [renta pracownicza] were Z1.7 million and 1.3 million per month,  respectively. Last year, we had as many as 8.730 million senior  citizens [emeryci] and pensioners [rencisci].</p>

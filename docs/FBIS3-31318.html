French General Andre Soubirou, UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR)  commander for the Sarajevo sector, then went to the Lukavica  barracks, the Serbs' main military base southwest of Sarajevo,  where he briefly met with the local sector commander.    The UNPROFOR-supervised meeting was to have studied  implementing the ceasefire and trying to establish a number of  sites where heavy artillery of both sides could be placed under  UN control in line with a NATO ultimatum aimed at ending the  siege of Sarajevo.    Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic warned on Wednesday that  the Moslem-majority Bosnian army did not intend to attend  Thursday's meeting, saying it had met all its obligations and  that the negotiations only concerned the Serb side.    In his meeting at the Lukavica barracks, Soubirou asked the  Serbs to agree to 50 heavy pieces of artillery they had handed  in being guarded by armed UN forces.    A Serb officer at the barracks, who asked not to be named,  told AFP "armed guards are not needed here," but that  "negotiations are still going on."    No UN forces were in sight within the compound on Thursday  morning.    UNPROFOR warned the Serbs on Wednesday that all heavy  weapons  withdrawn in line with the NATO ultimatum would have to be put  under armed UN guard before midnight on Sunday if they wanted to  comply with the terms of the ultimatum and avoid air attacks.    In Naples, the commander of the southern NATO zone Admiral  Jeremy Boorda told journalists that the warring parties in  Sarajevo had a long way to go to comply with the NATO ultimatum.    "We are seeing some evidence of weapons being turned in, but  we are a long way away from complete compliance," he said.    However, he said "progress in the right direction is  encouraging," although he emphasised, "We need real compliance  by the deadline."</p>

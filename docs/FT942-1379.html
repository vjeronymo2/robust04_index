			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television There are three World Cup soccer matches this evening. BBC2 shows Brazil v. Cameroon at 8.30, and ITV shows Sweden v. Russia at 11.40. But the game that will presumably attract most attention in the UK, now that the Irish have beaten the Italians and been appointed honorary Brits, is Mexico v. Republic of Ireland on ITV. Unfortunately for those with normal jobs and travel arrangements, coverage starts at 5.15. Another outside broadcast on radio comes from Glastonbury where John Peel is covering the summer music festival (10.00 Radio 1). Channel 4 Goes To Glastonbury at 11.50 for more than two hours of music. The names of the groups become more weird and wonderful every year. Those playing today should include Madder Rose, Spin Doctors and Manic Street Preachers. Of course soccer is not the only sport on television today. Coverage of the Wimbledon championships begins on BBC2 at noon and continues on BBC1 (1.50). There is another two and a half hours of live coverage on BBC2 at 5.55, and then BBC1 screens highlights at 10.25.</p>

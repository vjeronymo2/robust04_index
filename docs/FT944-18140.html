			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Clause 4 set to become familiar battleground Mr Tony Blair is renewing an old battle from a fresh starting point, Ivor Owen writes. When Hugh Gaitskell first sought to remove Clause 4 from the constitution it was in the wake of the shock election defeat in 1959. Now, in the hope of strengthening the prospects of election success, Mr Blair returns to battle over an issue which over the years has caused deep wounds and bitter divisions in the party. Mr Gaitskell had to contend with opposition from his shadow cabinet, the national executive and union bosses. Mr Michael Foot, who by then had lost his seat as MP for Devonport, used his position as editor of Tribune to lead a determined campaign for the retention of Clause 4. At a special party conference which turned into an inquest on the election defeat Mr Gaitskell emphasised his isolation by saying he spoke for himself alone in advocating a revision of the party's constitution. It was left to Aneurin Bevan, deputy leader of the party, to point the way to compromise. His insistence that a Labour government should be able to control the 'commanding heights of the economy' provided a sufficiently ill-defined redefinition of Clause 4 to damp down but not extinguish a controversy which now seems set to flare again.</p>

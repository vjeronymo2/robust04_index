			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We will not adopt these suggestions. As we said in the NPRM, identifying the primary event on a Special Event Tour will seldom be a matter of debate, but identifying secondary events that are ``integral to the experience'' of the tour would be a far more subjective exercise. Tour participants who do not receive promised admission to a secondary event may have a contractual right to a refund of the value of that event, and they can pursue that claim with the tour operator. By declining to incorporate the commenters' suggestion in the rule we are not suggesting that a consumer would not as a matter of contract law in certain circumstances be entitled to a full refund in situations other than failure to receive a promised ticket to the primary event. We are merely not establishing as a matter of regulation a guarantee of a full refund beyond those instances in which a ticket to the primary event is not provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for multi-game tournaments, the rule as proposed should be able to deal with this situation. If the tour operator held out admission to ``the NCAA Final Four,'' the operator would be obligated to provide tickets to all three Final Four games (the two semi-final games plus the final). On the other hand, if what was held out was admission to the championship game on Monday night, there would be no reason for tour participants to assume that they were also going to receive tickets to the semi-final games on the previous Saturday.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM we proposed to incorporate in the new rule the provisions in the existing Public Charter rule on price increases (14 CFR 380.33). These provisions allow participants to cancel and receive a full refund if the tour price is increased more than 10 percent, and prohibit price increases in any amount during the last ten days before departure. We proposed to apply the ban on price increases to the last five days before departure in the Special Event Tours rule, recognizing that these tours often have shorter lead times than the typical charter. In comments on the NPRM the price increase provisions were supported by the Football Bowl Association and the NCAA; there were no other comments on this point. We are finalizing this provision as proposed except that for the ban on price increases we have decided to remain with the ten-day period specified in the provision on which this requirement is modeled (&sect;380.33 of the charter rule) rather than reducing it to five days in the Special Event Tours rule as proposed in the NPRM. Although Special Event Tours may be organized on shorter notice than the typical charter, most Special Event Tours are marketed significantly more than ten days before departure. Being presented with a price increase only five days before departure is unjustifiably disruptive, and this is just as true of Special Event Tours as other tours. Operators of Public Charters to special events have been subject to the ten-day requirement for years, and incorporating this provision in the Special Event Tours rule should not constitute an unreasonable burden. In addition, the requirement to have tickets in hand or under contract may result in fewer unanticipated cost increases for tour operators for this component of the tour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ANPRM noted that some tours are promoted in conjunction with a special event, but do not include, and do not represent that they include, admission to the event. The ANPRM solicited comment on whether the new rule should ban this practice, or whether it should specify a form of required disclosure. Most of the comments on the ANPRM favored requiring disclosure of the fact that an event ticket is not included. In the NPRM, however, we proposed not to regulate these tours. The FBA and the NCAA have objected to this tentative decision; both organizations urge a disclosure requirement. We have decided not to include a provision of this type. Consumers solicited for such tours are able to determine from the advertising material that an event ticket is not held out as included; this is distinguishable from the situation of a tour participant who paid for an event ticket and then didn't receive it. Should any particular tour deceptively imply that event tickets are included when in reality they are not, the Department has authority to take enforcement action and will not hesitate to do so. For example, 49 U.S.C. &sect;41712 (formerly section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act) prohibits unfair and deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition, and 14 CFR 399.80(f) declares that it is unfair or deceptive for a ticket agent to misrepresent fares, charges or services in connection with air transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed comments in support of the proposed rule. However, he said that tour operators should be required to disclose the protections available under this rule to all tour participants, in writing. He noted that such disclosure is currently required in section 380.32(s) of the Department's regulations, but that the NPRM proposed to eliminate this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 380.32(s) is one of the provisions of the Public Charter portion of the Super Bowl rule. The NPRM proposed to rescind the Super Bowl rule, since it would be replaced by the new Part 381. A disclosure requirement for Part 381 of the type suggested by the Pennsylvania Attorney General was not proposed in the ANPRM or the NPRM, or in any previous comments in this proceeding. While section 380.32(s) has required specific disclosure of the protections of the Super Bowl rule on charter flights, there has never been a corresponding requirement for tours on scheduled service, and we see no reason to impose one now. The past notice for Super Bowl tours using charter air transportation had been incorporated in the operator-participant contract, an extensive document that was already required on all publicly-sold charters. There has been no required contract for Super Bowl tours (or other tours) on scheduled service, and we are not aware of any problems related to lack of notice on past tours of this type. With our action here, which will apply the protections of the new Part 381 broadly to all types of Special Event Tours on both scheduled and charter service, we see no need for a requirement that specific notice be given consumers of the rule's protections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

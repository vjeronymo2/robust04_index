			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (3): 'Quiet confidence' as recovery gathers pace - Andrew Bolger reviews the financial sector The financial sector, long one of the most vibrant parts of the Scottish economy, is in good heart. Scotland's clearing banks have seen profits begin to surge as the UK's emergence from recession brings a drop in bad debts. Independent fund managers look back with satisfaction on booming world stock markets. The main cloud on the horizon concerns the life assurance companies. They face regulatory uncertainty and difficult choices as to how best to market their products, now that competition from banks and building societies seems set to increase. Mr Alfred Moon, a director of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the biggest clearer, feels 'quiet confidence' as the country recovers from a downturn which arrived later than in England. Scotland has also avoided the problems of negative equity caused by the late-1980s property boom and subsequent crash in the south-east of England. The Royal Bank intends to build on the success of Direct Line, its rapidly growing 'direct-dial' motor insurer, by launching a new company specialising in sales of non-standard motor and home policies. The Royal also recently opened a new Pounds 2.6m dealing room in Edinburgh, geared mainly to offering capital market and foreign exchange services to its Scottish customers. A slightly more cautious note is struck by Mr Peter Burt, treasurer and chief general manager of the Bank of Scotland, the second largest clearer. Although recession came later to Scotland, he believes it has by no means gone away: 'There are still some after-shocks.' Lacking the Royal Bank's extensive network of branches south of the border, Mr Burt says the Bank of Scotland intended to concentrate further on developing niche markets such as credit cards, screen-based banking and venture capital. An ebullient mood prevails at Baillie Gifford, the independent Edinburgh investment management firm which has increased its funds under management tenfold since 1984 to their present level of more than Pounds 10bn. The firm has achieved this commanding position by attracting an increasing amount of money from UK pension schemes, which now account for more than 50 per cent of its funds. Baillie Gifford is one of several Scottish investment firms which have won an increasing amount of business from US pension funds. Americans have wanted to tap their long-standing expertise in emerging markets, particularly in the Far East, and also use them as a route into investing in Europe. Over the last 10 years Baillie Gifford has seen the proportion of its business in investment and unit trusts shrink from 76 to only 22 per cent of total funds, but the firm remains interested in the retail market. Mr Gavin Gemmell, senior partner, says: 'There is huge potential in Europe - for the first time in a generation the wealth in Germany has not been wiped out by war.' An American connection has certainly proved stabilising for Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund manager which recently sold itself to United Asset Management of the US. Rivals say settlement of the ownership question has been good for morale. Mr Giles Weaver, a director of Murray Johnstone, says the firm's 230 staff are responding well to a more performance-oriented environment. The Glasgow firm is one of only two global firms in UAM's stable of 38 fund managers and it hopes the new owners will bring further clients and more financial backing, if necessary. More difficult challenges face Scotland's nine life assurance companies, which together command more than 20 per cent of the UK market in long-term life assurance and pensions, and employ more than 20,000 people. Last year Halifax, Britain's largest building society, announced it would sever its exclusive tie with Standard Life and set up its own insurance company. The Edinburgh-based Standard Life, the UK's largest mutually-owned life insurance company, sold 18 per cent of all its new business through Halifax offices in 1992. Standard intends to replace the lost Halifax business by building up its direct sales force, which already stands at 380 and will be increased to 1,000. Mr Tom King, Standard Life's general manager of marketing, says he is confident that his company would thrive, but adds that the looming over-capacity in the industry was likely to lead to a shakeout. Scottish Life is more typical of the other mutuals in that it relies almost entirely on independent financial advisers (IFAs) - as Standard Life does for 66 per cent of its business. Mr Ray Milne, Scottish Life' s assistant general manager of sales, says he is confident that IFAs would largely be exonerated when the current investigations into the mis-selling of pensions were complete, although all the transaction documents may not have been properly completed. However, Mr Milne believes that struggling with this growing burden of paperwork has prevented the Scottish mutuals from developing new products in growing areas such as care plans for the elderly. Concern about the future of the mutuals and the increasing pressures on banks to reduce staff contributes to the feeling that the great job-creating record of the financial sector in recent years has run out of steam - and could be reversed. Scottish Financial Enterprise (SFE, the promotional body for the financial community) estimates that the sector accounts for about 15 per cent of Scotland's GDP and more than 10 per cent of its jobs. The number of jobs in the sector has increased by about 50 per cent since 1986. Mr James Scott, executive director, says SFE had pinpointed the training of back-office staff as one area needing improvement. As a former senior civil servant in the Scottish Office, Mr Scott believes that government still thinks too much in terms of manufacturing when it considers encouraging inward investment and job creation. He says: 'A start-up in the financial sector is at least as valuable as one in manufacturing or tourism.'</p>

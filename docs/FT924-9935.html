			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Technology: Up in arms over downsizing - Technically Speaking Downsizing may have become the computer buzzword of the early 1990s, but those corporate IT users who followed the trend could find they have made an expensive mistake. Downsizing implies the replacement of large and expensive mainframe systems with networks of inexpensive personal computers driven by servers - essentially powerful microcomputers. Many were tempted away from the traditional mainframe by the new power of the personal computer, and often for the wrong reasons. In the next few years they may come to realise that centralised systems cost less in the long run. By 2000 there will be a strong trend towards upsizing, both because it will be cheaper and because of the greater value that can be obtained from centrally managed data. Any downsized organisation looking for cost-effective solutions will undoubtedly have to extract data from expensive PCs and Unix systems, and dump it on to a parallel database server where it can be managed efficiently and cheaply. I would challenge anyone to dispute this point. It is a brave man who assumes that because a solution is best or cheapest today it will still be so in three years' time. There are right and wrong reasons for downsizing. Restructuring your business applications because it suits your business strategy is a sensible thing to do. It will often prove to be more expensive to downsize, but that should not deter people because if it meets the business need effectively it will be worthwhile. Unfortunately, the reality is often the other way round. People start to downsize even though it does not fit their business strategy because they believe it will be cheaper. In practice, it works out to be both more expensive and disruptive to the business - the worst possible scenario. Recent evidence reveals that this is true today for organisations with more than 200 users. But in the longer term it will be true for all companies. How can downsizing be more expensive? First, there is the long-term cost of supporting distributed systems. These can be difficult to calculate, and too easy to ignore. The time taken by secretaries doing systems administration or PC housekeeping is rarely counted as part of the business case. Second, there will be the need to run existing systems alongside the new ones. Typically this is for two to three years, often longer. Finally, there are costs imposed if you have forced a downsized solution on to an inappropriate organisation structure. The costs of splitting databases and redesigning systems are not trivial. So after three years of redesign and restructuring - and three years of paying double cost - you end up with a redesigned system that does not fit your organisation structure. That's when the industry announces new 'open corporate systems' at a price performance that makes it cheaper to centralise. Already companies are working on 'parallel' systems that will build big central systems out of many cheap processor chips. Unfortunately, the world is still full of misguided devotees of downsizing who have sliced up their databases into illogical chunks in order to make it work in a downsized environment. They are yet to discover the consequences. Independent studies indicate that many big IT users still see downsizing as the way forward. Five years ago 85 per cent of applications in management information systems were performed on mainframes, compared with 67 per cent today, according to the US periodical Service News. By 1995, the figure is expected to fall to 50 per cent. Downsizing may be cheaper this year, but it is just as likely to be more expensive next year. So go back to basics - treat IT as a business issue, not a technology issue. The author is corporate systems business manager at ICL.</p>

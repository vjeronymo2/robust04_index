			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading AN ACTIVE day's dealing in the traded options market was in stark contrast to a dull business in the futures, writes Christopher Price. The total options volume was 41,902, with a chunky 12,389 being dealt in the Euro-FT-SE option. Amstrad led the way in the stock options, with 6,451 contracts recorded. Lasmo was next on 2,158, with 1,000 November 140 puts sold at 12p and 500 of the November 180 calls bought at 36p. Among the other stocks, Asda reached 1,551 lots, Cable and Wireless 1,063 and BTR 1,015. The June FT-SE 100 futures contract opened firmly on the back of a good overnight performance from Wall Street. However, buyers quickly lost interest and June drifted in mid-morning, hitting a low point of 2,826 around 11am. Quiet trading ensued and the contract nestled in a 10-point trading range for most of the afternoon, before a rally towards the end enlivened the session. June finished at 2,831, up 3 points from its previous close and at a 10-point premium to the underlying cash market. Turnover was 6,900.</p>

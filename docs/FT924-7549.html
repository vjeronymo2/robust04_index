			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Observer: Eleven on edge Eleven brave Tory MPs with the smallest majorities have formed a new dining club, 'the marginals'. Indeed, the new boys feel confident enough to have chosen a tie. The background colour is 'basil' blue and the stripes are the light and dark blues of Cambridge and Oxford - the home of 'dons'. Basildon is, of course, the constituency of David Amess, the 40-year-old Conservative MP, whose victory on election night marked the turn of John Major's fortunes. However, Amess seems to have bent the club rules to get in since his 1,480 majority is not among the 11 slimmest. A precautionary move perhaps to ensure some continuity of membership after the next election?</p>

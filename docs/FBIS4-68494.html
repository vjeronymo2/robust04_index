			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report of head of administration of Novosibirsk Oblast I.I. </F> Indinok at the scientific-practical conference on 18 April 1994]    [Text] Esteemed conference participants!    When thinking over the structure of this report, considering  the complex of difficult social and economic problems in the  oblast, and trying to find the most notorious main link in this  chain of problems, I discovered that many of my assessments,  notes, and approaches are fairly closely correlated with ideas  that lie at the basis of the president's recent Message to the  Federal Assembly, "On Strengthening the Russian State," or,  rather, with its main idea which is reflected in the actual  title of this message. Its essence is on everyone's list--we  must look for a way out of the economic crisis in the  strengthening of state regulation of the economy. Obviously,  this is also the link that will make it possible for us to undo  the entire knot of economic problems.    This being the case, we at the level of components of the  Federation must, perhaps, without lapsing into sophistries,  concentrate our efforts on implementing the idea of  strengthening the state principle in regulating economic  processes. In order to verify my conclusion I turned for advice  to an assembly of leading scientists and specialists from  various spheres of activity in our oblast whom we asked to  attend a conference last Friday in order to discuss the outlines  of the draft of the recommendations for today's conference. The  opinion of this assembly of Novosibirsk intellectual elite was  unanimous: In our oblast it is time to take regulation of the  economy firmly into the hands of the state, since the so-called  liberal but actually uncivilized market into which radical  reformers have led us is ruining Russia and leading all of us to  a socioeconomic disaster.    This principle, I must admit, provided a clear orientation  for the preparation of the present report. As an outline I took  a number of constructive points from the president's message  plus our own proposals, and in these areas and I have considered  what can be done to realize the earmarked approaches at the  level of a component of the Federation. Here, naturally, I  proceeded from the realities of Novosibirsk Oblast, which are  typical of many regions of Russia.    First, in order to give participants in the conference an  idea of the socioeconomic base used for developing our  proposals, I will give a brief description of the condition of  the economy of Novosibirsk Oblast and try to show the price it  has paid for the radical reforms.    The economy of our oblast and its social sphere have relied  in past decades on branches that today have been driven into a  situation of poverty. These are science-intensive industrial  production, including the defense complex, agriculture, science,  the higher school, and education. Of course, you are also well  aware that the oblast's economic potential, its branch  structure, and the dynamics of social processes, as with all  other Russian regions, have been determined, unfortunately, not  by local conditions but by directive centralized plans, many of  which, unfortunately, have run counter to economic-geographic  and, as is apparent now, market preconditions for the  development of the territory. Nonetheless by the middle of the  1980's, in order to implement the most important state tasks in  Novosibirsk, a powerful economic complex was created with a  progressive economic structure, a very high proportion of  science-intensive modern productions, and the most skilled work  force. Although the extraction industry made up only 2 percent  of it, in terms of volumes of the oblast industrial production  it occupied fourth place in Siberia (after Tyumen and Kemerovo  Oblasts and Krasnoyarsk Kray), in agriculture--second after  Altay Kray, and in terms of total economic potential--fourth  place on the territory of Siberia and the Far East. In a word,  the oblast was one of the most important in Russia.    The president's message devotes a great deal of attention to  the cost of the reforms in Russia. The president is obviously  right when he notes that economic reform is not painless and is  not free and that losses are inevitable. But the painful  phenomena turned out to be especially severe in our oblast and  the cost of the reforms was so high that practically everything  we had went to pay for them. It is difficult to explain to  people what they paid for at such a price. Incidentally, it  should be noted that Novosibirsk Oblast was not among the  victims of the first stage of perestroyka when the sharp  reduction of centralized investments and the depression in the  raw material branches began. Right up until the end of 1991 it  retained its positions in the Russian economy. The collapse  began the moment the so-called market reforms began to be  forced. During a little more than two years there was a sharp  deterioration of our positions in the economy of Russia and our  economic position in the main branches became intolerable.    The reason for the high cost of reform lies in the  peculiarities of the structure of the oblast economy to which I  wish to draw your attention. In order not to be accused of local  egocentrism, I shall use the analytical materials of the World  Bank. Thus, according to information from this international  financial institution, in 1990 Novosibirsk occupied third place  in Russia in terms of degree of militarization of the economy.  The proportion of people employed at enterprises of the defense  complex in the overall number of industrial production personnel  was 43.5 percent (the only ones higher than us were  Udmurtia--55.3 percent and Saratov Oblast--50.9 percent). The  overall number of workers at defense enterprises of Novosibirsk  Oblast (according to World Bank figures) exceeded the number of  people employed in the military-industrial complex of all of  Eastern Siberia (we have 172,500, and Eastern Siberia--167,500)  and was approximately equal to the number of people employed in  the military-industrial complex of all of the Far East, where  the figure was 176,200. Thus the blow dealt to the country  during 1992-1993 by the reformers' policy in fighting against  the military-industrial complex caused many regions damage of  varying degrees of severity--in some places it was tolerable,  but for our oblast and especially the city of Novosibirsk--it  was murderous and largely irreversible.    The conversion of defense enterprises, regardless of how  fervently and at what a high level it was discussed, will remain  on paper until real resources are invested in it. What is  allotted from the budget for conversion is more like a  propaganda experiment than target investments. In 1993  allocations for conversion in Russia as a whole amounted to 870  billion rubles [R], which is little more than the credit  investments of Inkombank alone. And the distribution of these  funds was extremely unfair and very subjective, mainly according  to the criterion of proximity to the hand that gave them out  (and Novosibirsk, as we know, is a long way from Moscow). The  aforementioned investments were not only unable to stop the  catastrophic decline of the defense industry; they could not  even slow it down.    During the past two years of reform the oblast  military-industrial complex has managed to continue to exist  without sources of development and almost without any structural  rearrangement, scaring up loans and subsidies from time to time.  Now that the last reserves of the enterprises have been  exhausted and, as a result of the ill-considered reforms, the  prices of many kinds of raw material have exceeded world prices,  the collapse of all industry has begun--not only defense, but  also purely civilian industry--a large part of the domestic  economy has reached the verge of complete bankruptcy.    The legal excesses and galloping inflation greatly  exacerbated the investment climate. Commercial banks grant  practically no credit for investment projects since it is  disadvantageous to invest in the production sphere as compared  to servicing short-term commercial operations. This leaves  industrial production without any future.    Among the main areas of specialization of Novosibirsk Oblast  are science and personnel training. Before the beginning of  perestroyka (1985) we had 85,000 people employed in the branch  entitled "Science and Scientific Service." In terms of the  proportion of science in the fixed production capital and the  overall number of workers, the oblast occupied first place in  the Soviet Union, outstripping Moscow and Leningrad. We were  proud of our three academies, 15 VUZ's [higher educational  institutions], and powerful branch science, justifiably assuming  that this was our main capital, which was quite competitive by  world standards. Let me note, incidentally, that according to  assessments of the most eminent economists of the West,  including Nobel prize winner Solow, over a long historical  period 85 percent of the economic growth was provided as a  result of scientific and technical progress. Therefore financing  science is the most effective investment of money in the  development of the economy.    The surrealistic market in which we have now found ourselves  has shown that there simply is no effective demand for rendering  scientific services under the conditions of a total crisis. This  pertains to both fundamental and applied research. Yet there has  been a sharp increase in the demand for Russian and especially  Siberian scientists abroad, which is causing an ever increasing  brain drain from Russia to other countries. Centralized  financing at best covers 30 percent of the expenditures in  comparable prices compared to the level the same academy of  sciences had in 1990. As a result world-renowned scientific  schools and collectives are falling apart and the influx of  youth into science has come to a halt. There is an analogous  situation in higher education. Russia is losing its future and  the oblast and local budgets contain no resources for supporting  science and the higher school.    The collapse of the economy was reflected most fatally in  culture. While in past years it was financed according to the  so-called residual principle, today nothing at all is left for  culture. The destruction of the culture of Novosibirsk--the  world famous music schools, the renowned theater collectives,  artists, writers, excellent libraries--would cause harm not only  to Russia but to all world civilization. God forbid that such a  thing should happen.    Another leading branch of specialization of our oblast is  agriculture. Its share along with branches for processing  agricultural products is approximately one-third of all the  economic potential. To be sure, the agrarian branch, as in all  developed countries of the world, has always existed under  conditions of large state subsidies, and this has made it  possible to keep consumer prices at a fairly low level so that  these products are available to all the population. Now there  are almost none. Today the sharp reduction of the buying power  of the population and also the impossibility of really  maintaining parity of prices between the city and the country  are driving agricultural producers into an abyss. By the end of  last year wholesale prices of means of production for the  agro-industrial complex increased 13.3-fold, including for  machines and equipment for animal husbandry--14.5-fold, and  diesel fuel--18-fold. Procurement prices for agricultural  products increased only 11.8-fold during that same period. The  continued unrestrained growth of prices for energy sources,  agricultural equipment, spare parts, fertilizers, and means of  plant protection have led to a situation where even the  strongest farms are unable not only to acquire new tractors and  combines but even to repair the existing ones, which are in  short supply. The fertility of the soil is being exhausted since  the application of mineral fertilizers has practically stopped.  Agriculture in the oblast has been thrown back decades.    Late payments for bread, milk, and meat that have already  been consumed and credit under extortionate conditions of  180-213 percent are destroying the financial base of  agricultural production. Now that the banks are encountering  problems of distributing credit resources even in trade, the  existing rates for agricultural enterprises like, incidentally,  those of industry, are simply ruinous. Even under conditions of  the sharp reduction of production volumes, grain, milk, and meat  produced on the farms at the present time are going begging  because of the exceptionally low buying power of the population.  In the food ration of the impoverished population there is a  reduction of the consumption of biologically necessary products.  Macaroni items, bread, and potatoes have become basic in the  nutrition of residents of our oblast.    The reform of agricultural enterprises has actually been  reduced to changing signs without affecting the basic economic  incentives in rural areas. Today the oblast, like all of Russia,  has been faced with a dilemma: To have its own agricultural  products, which are now more expensive, taking into account  transportation costs and the price of energy sources, or to  increase procurements from abroad of products that are less  expensive and frequently of poorer quality. It would be more  correct to put it like this: To encourage the hidden  subsidization of importing foodstuffs through artificially  maintaining the exchange rate of the ruble to the detriment of  our own commodity producer. By following this path, you  understand, we could arrive at complete dependency on the West  for our food supply as well, so this is not only an economic  issue but also a political one, and it cannot be resolved at the  level of an individual oblast. Incidentally, the answer to it  given in the president's message inspires hope. Indeed it is  necessary to have (I quote) "a reasonable protectionist policy  that protects the interests of domestic producers but without  appreciable harm to the consumers." Let us hope that is the way  it will be.    Speaking about the price of reforms for Novosibirsk Oblast,  let me note that in terms of formal indicators which the  higher-ups like to use to evaluate the course of the reforms, we  have considerable achievements in the main areas of reform.  Privatization of housing, trade, and industry is proceeding more  rapidly in our oblast than the average for Russia. Indicators of  the creation of farmer-run farms are at a high level and we have  created a multitude of banks, investment funds, intermediary  enterprises, and other institutions of the market  infrastructure. Alas, all this, unfortunately, has so far not  contributed to economic growth in the oblast or to raising the  standard of living of most of its residents.    The conclusion from an analysis of the consolidated  indicators of the development of the oblast is this: Its economy  has actually entered a stage of reduced reproduction. In certain  branches of the national economy the "eating up" of production  capacities has become apparent and is reflected not only in the  reduction of the residual value of fixed capital and the  increase in the indicators of its wearing out, but also in the  absolute reduction in physical terms.    The elimination of the commodity deficit is considered to be  one of the main pluses of the radical reforms that have been  conducted. Indeed this deficit has disappeared. It is possible  to buy almost anything both on the consumer market and on the  market for raw and processed materials and also on the market  for contracting work. Incidentally, even before the reforms  there was no deficit on our market portrayed in physical items,  which we call a flea market. The only commodity that is still in  short supply is money, and the whole country, unfortunately, has  become like a flea market. The lack of regulation of the  processes, the failure to account for the turnover of goods and  incomes, and the lack of quality control of goods have become  typical for the entire economy of Russia.    An analysis of the minimum consumer budget of the population  of Novosibirsk Oblast shows that workers of the majority of  branches do not have sufficient money to support at a bare  minimum not only their children but even themselves. Only  workers in transportation, communications, construction, and  wholesale trade had wages at the level of the minimum consumer  budget at the beginning of this year, that is, they could  support themselves. At the same time workers of the  financial-credit sphere, insurance institutions, and energy  engineering had wages that averaged twice the minimum consumer  budget.    The consequences of such a state of affairs are extremely  severe. For enterprises and organizations living on the sale of  goods to the population this means ruin and ultimately  liquidation. As an example one can give the state of affairs in  consumers' cooperation. At the present time it is conducting  trade in 1,231 population points which do not have a permanent  trade network. The fact that one-third of the consumer  cooperative stores (about 1,000) are operating at a loss becomes  threatening since, as experience shows, the rural population  points start losing population after the schools are closed and  they die out after the store is closed. For the individual  resident, the specific family, and society as a whole the  situation in which monetary incomes are below the subsistence  minimum means moral and physical degradation.    As a result of the fact that prices of food products  increased more rapidly than the nominal incomes of the  population, there has been a marked deterioration of the  structure of nutrition. I have already discussed this. Medical  services and the condition of the environment have become worse  and crime and the nervous-psychological strain on people have  increased. As a result, practically all demographic indicators  have gotten worse. In 1992 for the first time in many decades  the death rate in the oblast exceeded the birth rate. In 1993 as  compared to the preceding year the birth rate dropped by another  17 percent and the death rate increased by 25 percent. As a  result, the natural attrition of the population in the oblast  during the year (!) increased 16-fold. It is my deep conviction  that under the conditions of peacetime no good wishes can  justify such tendencies. Such is the price of the reforms in our  oblast and, as I know from colleagues from other regions, it is  just as great there.    Here is the last thing I would like to say before moving  onto  my proposals. All of us, esteemed compatriots, must be clearly  aware of the fact that the people's patience is at an end. The  rate and level of social stratification of society in Russia  today is worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. The ratio  between the wages of the most highly paid 10 percent of the  citizens and the 10 percent of the members of society with the  lowest pay in our country is 27:1. For comparison: In Sweden  this coefficient is 11:1, in the United States--14:1. Such a  strong stratification of the standards of living of the wealthy  and the poor is fraught with serious social upheavals. And they  can arise if this process continues. Even the reserves of the  majority of key technological systems are at an end--energy  engineering, gas lines, railroads, aviation, etc. If we do not  radically change the situation in the state for the better, in  the very near future we will inevitably encounter not only  social upheaval but also technological and ecological  catastrophes.    We have invited to the conference representatives of the  government, federal ministries, the Soviet of the Federation,  and the State Duma as well as leaders of many regions of the  country in the hope that our concern will be understood  correctly and measures, including those developed during the  course of this conference, will find sympathetic support in the  center as well.    Analyzing the socioeconomic situation that has developed,  the  oblast administration as early as the eve of 1994 came to the  conclusion that it was impossible to quickly and painlessly  improve the economic situation on any individual territory  through any radical measures. Therefore the administration's  program of actions for 1994 are based on the task of  stabilization in the oblast economy and the creation of  preconditions for future economic growth. Scholars and  specialists of a number of scholarly institutions of the  Siberian branches of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the  Russian Agricultural Academy, the city's VUZ's, and leaders and  workers of enterprises and organizations of various branches  were enlisted to prepare proposals for this program. Most of  these proposals are in the sections and therefore I request that  participants in the conference consider the existing proposals  and make additional ones during the course of the section  meetings.    Which of the main areas make up the backbone of the  stabilization program in the region? First of all, I repeat,  state regulation of economic relations. It says in the  presidential message (I quote): "The creation of a system for  regulation of the market economy is not a step backward but  movement forward, development of the reform, strengthening of  the Russian state. There will never be a real market order in a  poorly managed economy." For the regional level regulation of  the economy means the development of clear-cut priorities for  the economic and social policy and the conclusion of  intraregional and interregional cartel agreements aimed at the  survival and socioeconomic survival of regions, the development  of a regional budget policy adapted to existing economic  conditions, the formation of economic mechanisms providing for  support of commodity producers, and alleviation of the crisis in  industry, the agrarian sector, and the credit-financial sphere.    The president emphasized that if there were no structural  rearrangement in the economy there would inevitably be  structural degradation and that it has long been time for the  government to straighten out its structural priorities and take  action on the basis of this. In this area we are prepared to  support any government actions. The oblast is already preparing  and beginning to take measures for the development of a  mechanization for streamlining, reprofiling, and reorganizing  inefficient enterprises. Moreover, regional investment programs  are being created in the main economic complexes. The Fund for  Support of Entrepreneurship is selecting projects.    In the complex of anticrisis measures, part of which are  under oblast jurisdiction, a most important position is occupied  by measures for improving the tax policy. We also expect that in  keeping with the points in the president's message and the  decree of the Soviet of the Federation, in the near future  changes will be made in the tax system in the direction of  encouraging material production and resource saving. As the  president promises, 1994 should be a year of real state support  for the producer. The tax burden can be eased only in  combination with effective measures for fighting against  unaccounted-for commodity and monetary turnover. What kind of  state is it that will allow the existence of a growing volume of  unaccounted-for turnover which is obvious to everyone and is  incapable of performing its controlling function? It has long  been time for our state to be cured of its powerlessness.    In order to search for additional revenues and sources of  financing expenditures from the oblast budget it is intended to  use such measures as issuance of short-term funded loans,  regulation of licensing activity, interaction between the  administration and authorized banks, and new forms of direct and  indirect tax regulation, taking advantage of the rights granted  by Edict No. 2268 of the President of 22 December 1993.    Our anticrisis program has reflected measures for  controlling  blocks of shares and oblast-owned enterprises. Developing the  corresponding edicts of the president, the administration is  contributing to the creation of financial-industrial groups in  industry and the agrarian sector of the economy and the  utilization of trust forms of management, in spite of the fact  that federal legislation is imperfect. We intend to step up  control over the fulfillment of conditions for competition  during privatization of state and municipally owned facilities  without, however, transforming this control into a campaign for  reprivatization.    The mechanism for support of rural commodity producers in  the  oblast is also changing. Based on the capabilities of the oblast  budget, financial resources are being allotted only on the basis  of agreements concluded for the delivery of products to the  oblast food supply or the oblast food market. But there is not  enough budget money to form a regional food fund in the  necessary volume, even taking working capital into account. In  keeping with the president's edict on liberalization of the  grain market, the government will apparently have to accelerate  the solution to the problem of sources of financing regional  grain supplies. To this end it would be possible to use the  funds allotted to the Roskhlevoprodukt Corporation last year for  purchasing grain for regional needs.    Of the measures having to do with the social policy I will  mention only the introduction of nonbudget forms of investment  in housing construction, including the use of mortgages and  funds of enterprises in the population. I would also like to  hear proposals from participants in the conference regarding a  solution to another problem that is critical, at least for  us--growing abandonment of the departmental social sphere by  enterprises when the local authorities do not have the funds or  technical base to support it.    I want to discuss once again a couple of the most important  issues whose resolution is possible only at the federal level  because they are under the joint jurisdiction of the Federation  and its components.    Among the most crucial problems requiring immediate solution  I will single out the problem of nonpayments. Let me remind you  that in its Decree "On the Crisis of Solvency in the Economy of  the Russian Federation" the Federation Council proposed that  before 15 April (today is already the 18th) the government and  the Central Bank submit to the Federal Assembly a program for  resolving this crisis. Among the most important measures the  government and Central Bank were also instructed to retire  indebtedness of the republic budget for 1993 taking price  indexation into account. The state's position regarding the  inflation factor in the state debt to the enterprises is  affected and shows disdain for the enterprises. The state, which  regularly defaults on its debts to the enterprises for long  periods of time, does not intend to pay them the generally  accepted fines while the suppliers for these enterprises, the  state budget, and nonbudget funds do not forget to demand from  0.7 to 1 percent for each day of defaulted payments, and the  latter have the right to impose penalties without recourse to  appeal. Frequently indebtedness of enterprises initiated by the  state is covered by them with state funds, but they already have  the character of credit at the same interest rate, which  objectively cannot save the vast majority of enterprises of the  production sphere. This kind of interaction between the state  and the enterprises has nothing to do with economic methods of  regulation, the goals of the reform, or the norms of the law.    Additionally, it was suggested that the government of the  Russian Federation pay back to Russian enterprises the debts of  the CIS states. There is a proverb: If there is time to throw  stones there is time to pick them up. The entire country is  waiting for concrete and effective actions from the government  in this area.    As of 1 March of this year defaulted indebtedness of buyers  to enterprises of the oblast alone amounted to R294 billion, and  defaulted indebtedness of enterprises to the suppliers was R170  billion. Defaulted indebtedness to the budget--R44 billion, and  bank credit (also defaulted)--R15 billion. As you can see, for  one oblast the figures are immense, more than a month's volume  of sales from industry. Since this disease has affected the  entire country, the formula for recovery must be sought through  joint efforts. Here one cannot forget that the nonpayments  crisis is a result of the overall crisis that has affected the  country's economy and the deep impoverishment of the population.  Emerging from this crisis will require a change in the paradigms  of the reforms in the direction of strengthening the role of the  state.    I hope that specialists on questions of taxes and finances  will make recommendations for solving this problem. Let me note  in passing that Novosibirsk mathematicians have developed a  highly effective and precise algorithm that makes it possible to  find on the spot and calculate sequences of mutual settlements  for problems of practically any size and to optimize the  directions and volumes of credit infusions according to the  criterion of minimizing the bottlenecks in the payment system.    In the government's plan of actions special attention should  be devoted to the creation of a social structure with a high  buying power for the majority of the population and elimination  of all privileges that are not the direct result of higher labor  productivity.    Regarding questions of regional policy, it is impossible to  bypass another subject that is painful to us--relations between  the center and the region. Before perestroyka, when we were  building a classless society and Moscow continued to build a  model communist city, a rather lame joke was going around in  Siberia: We have only one exploiter class in the country--the  Muscovites. Everyone knew that the norms in Moscow were  different, that there were more imports, and that their food  products were better. But the differences were not egregious.  According to statistical figures for February 1994, the level of  monetary incomes of Novosibirsk residents lagged behind those of  Muscovites by a factor of almost three. Moreover, according to  estimates of experts of the Federation Council, such attributes  of centralized power as federal taxes, the funds of branch  ministries and departments, centralized nonbudget funds, and  others brought about a concentration in Moscow of up to 80  percent of the financial and credit resources of Russia. Under  market conditions, when money is of decisive significance for  society, this kind of centralization, in my view, is worse than  the administrative-command system. If one looks at such an  important indicator as average budget support per one resident,  it turns out that here too the people of Novosibirsk are being  treated unfairly today. According to figures for 1993, this  indicator amounted to 70 percent of the average federal level  and 46 percent of the average for Western Siberia.    Much needs to be changed here. For example, it is not  permissible to have a single minimum wage for all of Russia when  we have an imperfect system of regional coefficients that  developed under conditions of a centralized economy. Taking  advantage of Sergey Mikhaylovich Shakhray's presence here, I  would ask the government to revisit the question of raising the  regional coefficient to wages in Novosibirsk Oblast and the  mechanism for financing costs of enterprises and organizations  that are linked to this.    Another example: The formation of territorial budgets and  their relations to the federal budget, and also the Central Bank  of Russia. So much has already been said about the harm caused  by granting all kinds of benefits and privileges out of  subjective motives or national indicators. Why are certain  regions exempt from taxes and receive certain exclusive rights  while others do not receive these rights and are not exempt from  taxes? I would not ask this question if this kind of  redistribution had been done openly and on a scientific basis as  it is in civilized countries. But this is not the case. And  seeing the draft budget for 1994 convinces us of this once  again. At the same time the president in his speech in the  Federal Assembly named "overcoming the obvious unfairness in  benefits and privileges to the regions" as the task of the year.  We support the government's intentions to establish standard  principles for budget relations in Russia and to conduct a  clear-cut and, I emphasize, open budget policy. In our view,  this would contribute to strengthening the unity of Russia more  than the most brilliant verbal declarations.    Unfortunately, an analysis done on the basis of new  approaches to the draft of the budget of the Russian Federation  shows that the system of budget transfers adjusted by a fairly  arbitrary subsidy to the regions that are called "especially  needy," taking into account differences in volumes of  centralized financing and capital investments, again leads us to  the old results. What kind of equalization of conditions can  there be if only additional subsidies to certain neighboring  territories which are "especially needy" are sometimes  comparable to the overall volume of revenues planned for the  budget of Novosibirsk Oblast, including the notorious transfers.    A couple of words about the problem of differentiation of  incomes. I have just spoken about territorial differences. But  interbranch differences in wages and incomes inside each oblast  are even greater. Finally, within an individual firm or  department there can be an immense, sometimes 10-fold difference  in wages. The detonator for the social explosion could be a  situation whereby in one village a milkmaid receives 8,000, a  postman--60,000, and a worker in a tax institution--200,000,  where a cleaning lady in a commercial bank earns more than an  academician with a name recognized throughout the world. We are  moving from one extreme--the idea of universal equality and  brotherhood--to the other--glaring inequality. But this extreme  is much more dangerous and immoral.    The implementation of many of the tasks set in my report and  others will require coordination of efforts of the center and  the regions in carrying out state policy in all spheres of the  life of society. In this connection during the period of  preparation for the conference there arose the idea of creating  in Novosibirsk a regional center for supporting Russian  statehood and developing it. It is suggested that this center in  the process of its activity would do prognosticatory-analytical  research and development on draft laws under contracts with  state organs at the federal and regional level and also through  its own initiative. In order to clarify attitudes toward this  and obtain your advice as to how best to organize the work of  this center, a small questionnaire has been compiled and  distributed among the participants. I hope that each participant  in the conference will answer the questions on it, which will  help us to correctly orient the activity of the center for  support of Russian statehood.    The proposed approaches to the stabilization of the  economies  of the regions require qualified discussion and detailed  development. I believe that this discussion could take place at  this conference. Nor shall I conceal from you that the social  commissions under the oblast administration, which include  leading scholars, experienced businessmen and entrepreneurs, and  workers of financial-credit institutions, has already developed  a package of concrete proposals for anticrisis measures. We have  studied the experience in implementing anticrisis measures in  Ulyanovsk, Voronezh, and Nizhniynovgorod Oblasts and the state  of affairs in the neighboring regions. We are waiting for  proposals from our guests as well. But after discussion it is  important to act on what is proposed.    Under the conditions of sharp socioeconomic fluctuations and  chronic [word illegible] in federal legislation we in the oblast  have arrived at the need to make maximum use of the rights  granted by the new Constitution to components of the Federation  in the area of norm setting. Based on the provisions of the new  Constitution, the president's message, the experience of other  regions, the Human Rights Declaration, and recommendations from  the present conference, we shall begin to take extraordinary  anticrisis measures on the territory of Novosibirsk Oblast. The  measures we shall introduce shall envision:    --state regulation of prices and rates for products of  monopolists;    --improvement of the system of taxation in the direction of  increasing the buying power of the oblast's population;  encouragement of the production of necessary goods; preservation  of effective jobs;    --a complex of measures for combating commodity and monetary  circulation that is not accounted for;    --commodity quality control, especially of foodstuffs, aimed  at all-around support for the consumers;    --active support for the agro-industrial complex;    --regulation of the wage level in the direction of  eliminating unjustified distortions, exercise of the citizens'  right to equal pay for equal work as envisioned by the Human  Rights Declaration and Russian legislation, the fight against  unearned incomes, and other measures as well.    Of course it is impossible to come up with a radical  solution  to these problems in an individual area without state support.  Therefore we are waiting for the comprehensive government  commission which Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin promised to  send us. The goals we are setting in our own anticrisis program  are aimed at stable development of the territory, they are  clear, and they should gain support. Our program envisions that  each person, young or old, each worker, in the rural areas or  the cities, each student, graduate student, scholar, artist,  painter, entrepreneur, hired worker, physician, teacher, and  others will finally receive what every person deserves--the  right and the chance to live in a worthy way, like a human being.    And this is not a slogan. We are proceeding from a key  provision of Article 18 of the Constitution of Russia to the  effect that the rights and freedoms of the human being and  citizen are immediately applicable and determine the meaning,  content, and application of the laws as well as the activity of  the legislative and executive powers.</p>

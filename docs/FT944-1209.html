			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Monsanto shares fall after it buys Merck unit Monsanto, the US chemicals company, has agreed to pay Dollars 1.07bn for a specialty chemicals subsidiary of Merck which will have sales this year of only about Dollars 300m. Fears that Monsanto was paying too much sent its shares into a sharp fall on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday morning. By lunchtime they had dropped to Dollars 66 3/4 , a loss of Dollars 6 1/8 . The steep decline also reflected market concerns that the company was shifting its attention away from cutting costs. Monsanto said it would use cash and debt to buy Kelco, a company which makes stabilising and gelling agents for food and industrial products. The sale is the last in a series of planned disposals of non-core businesses announced by Merck in August. 'It's a great business, but the price is way too high,' said Mr Paul Raman, a chemicals analyst at S. G. Warburg in New York. Monsanto was paying about Dollars 150m too much for the company, or Dollars 1.50 a share, based on Kelco's estimated earnings before tax, interest and amortisation of Dollars 120m, he said. Monsanto said the transaction would be beneficial financially, and brought it a business which had good growth potential and offered synergies with some of its existing operations. 'We knew that it would take some time for the market to understand this acquisition,' Monsanto said. The deal would add to cashflow next year, and would enhance earnings per share in 1996, it added. The company said any dilution to earnings per share next year would be minimal, and may be avoided altogether. The deal could add Dollars 800m to Monsanto's debt, which stood at Dollars 1.7bn at the end of September. The company plans to pay for Kelco with about half of its cash reserves, which it expects to stand at about Dollars 550m at the end of this year, with the rest financed with mainly short-term debt.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Delors on Italian </F> Issues"]    [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, June 21 -- European Commission  President Jacques Delors said he would be happy to hold a  bi-lateral meeting with Italy's Premier Silvio Berlusconi at  this weekend's Corfu summit, but was waiting for Berlusconi to  propose it.    Speaking at a press conference on the Corfu summit, Delors  said that "being of a rank lower than that of prime minister...  it is not up to me to propose a meeting, it is up to him. If he  does so, I would be most happy to hold bi-lateral talks on the  sidelines of the summit."    Delors also dwelt on his recent negative reaction to a  statement by Gianfranco Fini, leader of Italy's rightist  National Alliance, who alleged that the American landings in  Europe in 1944 marked the end of Europe's own cultural identity.    Denying that his remarks amounted to interference in Italy's  domestic affairs, Delors said "if Fini makes statements which I  believe to be not good or worrying, I respond, and this is a  dialogue between him and me. I have never judged, and I never  intend to judge people's intentions, and I do not interfere in  Italy's domestic affairs."    Asked who should head the World Trade Organisation, the body  which will replace GATT, the EU [European Union] executive chief  said "there is an Italian candidate, and he certainly has all  the right qualities for being an excellent director." The  reference was to Renato Ruggiero, a one-time diplomat and former  foreign trade minister.</p>

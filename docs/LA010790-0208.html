			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A QUINTET OF YOUNG PLAYERS FOR THE '90S;  </P> <P> IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A DEFINITE REJUVENATION IN ACOUSTIC JAZZ  -- PARTICULARLY OF THE MAINSTREAM PERSUASION, WHERE THE MUSIC'S TRUE ROOTS  RESIDE, BUT ALSO IN THE AVANT-GARDE. SOME ARTISTS HAVE MANAGED TO CONCOCT  STYLES THAT INVIGORATINGLY AND INVENTIVELY BLEND THE TWO STYLES. CALENDAR'S  JAZZ WRITERS HAVE SELECTED THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS AS THOSE MOST LIKELY TO  HAVE AN IMPACT IN THIS REVITALIZED AREA IN THE COMING DECADE.;  </P> <P> DELFEAYO MARSALIS  </P> <P> Delfeayo Marsalis is a name that has appeared on a substantial number of record  labels during the past five years, yet the credit line never listed him in the  capacity that may yet establish his fame -- as a trombone player.  </P> <P> Marsalis has produced albums for his father Ellis and his brother Branford, as  well for Harry Connick Jr., the quintet of Donald Harrison and Terence  Blanchard, and the Polish piano wizard Adam Makowicz.  </P> <P> Among all these albums, he was never heard playing a note, though those who  have heard him are aware that he may well emerge as the outstanding new  trombonist of the decade to come.  </P> <P> The main reason for the delay is that during his six years as a student at  Berklee College of Music in Boston, Delfeayo Marsalis spent the first half of  that period studying record production. It was only later that he began to take  up the trombone seriously, with several Berklee teachers as his guide but with  the records of J.J. Johnson (the so-called father of bebop trombone) as his  spiritual mentor.  </P> <P> Graduating from Berklee last spring, Marsalis was heard on a few gigs, then  moved back to the family home town of New Orleans, where he wants to continue  working seriously on perfecting his craft as an instrumentalist. Recently,  calling from New Orleans, he stated that he plans to organize his own group  next April. Dedicated, intensely creative yet easygoing, Marsalis at 24 seems  to have no obstacle in his path en route to a brilliant future. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

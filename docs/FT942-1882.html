			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / People: Bay Green moves up at Kleinworts Bay Green, 51, has been rewarded for returning to the Kleinwort Benson fold. Three years after he resigned as Hill Samuel's head of corporate finance, he has been appointed head of Kleinwort Benson's financing and advisory division. Green, a chartered accountant who first joined the merchant bank in 1971, takes charge of one of the biggest parts of Kleinwort's business. It covers everything from corporate lending and leasing to privatisation advice and public issues. It has a staff of around 600. His appointment follows last year's management reshuffle when the group's investment bank business was put under the control of two joint chief executives David Clementi and Sir Nicholas Redmayne. At the time the corporate finance and financing divisions were merged; Clementi took over as head of the new division and Bay Green was appointed his deputy. Having overseen the merger of the two divisions, Clementi has decided to hand over control to Green and concentrate on his job as joint chief executive of investment banking. Kleinwort portrayed Green's appointment as a natural promotion but it is understood that there has been some jockeying for power behind the scenes. Earlier this month, Ian Peacock, 46, the main board director who had headed Kleinwort's financing division before the merger with Clementi's division, left to join BZW as co-head of merchant banking in the US. Meanwhile, Kleinwort Benson has merged its project advisory and medium term export finance businesses into a new project and export finance department chaired by Patrick de Pelet. Adrian Montague and Simon Parker have been appointed co-head.</p>

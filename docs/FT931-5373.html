			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Czechs impose stiffer rules for new banks THE CZECH National Bank has introduced tougher requirements for banks wishing to set up in the Czech Republic. Banks will now have to deposit 300m crowns (Pounds 7m) with the central bank before starting up, Mr Josef Tosovsky, bank governor, said yesterday. Until now, foreign and local banks were required to place only a third of the deposit with the central bank on start-up. Over the last three years, the number of banks with a full banking licence in the Czech republic has risen from seven to 48, including six foreign-owned banks. Such rapid expansion has imposed a heavy strain on the limited availability of experienced bank staff and led to widespread staff poaching. Meanwhile, the Czech authorities are preparing a small revaluation of the Czech crown against the Ecu-denominated clearing account set up to regulate trade between the Czech and Slovak republics. Since the former joint currency split into separate Czech and Slovak crowns last month the Slovak authorities have made three small devaluations totalling 5 per cent against the clearing-Ecu. The latest Czech move is expected to raise the effective overall devaluation of the Slovak crown in bilateral trade with the Czech Republic to 7 per cent.</p>

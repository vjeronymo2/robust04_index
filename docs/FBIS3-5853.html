			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's administration  still enjoys a high support rating despite the split among the  ruling coalition parties and their meanderings. To find out  why, the ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide poll in late  February, asking pollees to answer freely as to why they do or  do not support the Hosokawa administration. An analysis of the  poll results was then made.    According to the analysis, the high support rating seems to  be backed by a feeling of disgust and revulsion toward the  Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] long reign and an expectation  for the new administration. Although the prime minister himself  is very popular, a negative appraisal of LDP politics seems to  be linked to a high support rating for the Hosokawa  administration rather than a positive appraisal of the  administration.    On the other hand, complaints against the prime minister,  such as his "indecisiveness," and criticism of some of the  administration's specific policies, such as the "national  welfare tax" and the "rice issue," were given as primary reasons  for nonsupport.    In the latest poll, the support rating for the Hosokawa  administration was 57 percent. Among 1,231 respondents who  indicated support for the administration in response to a  free-to-answer-question on reasons for their support, 18 percent  accounted for the majority with these respondents saying they  supported the administration because "it was not an LDP  administration." There were other remarks which indicated a  deep-rooted distrust of the LDP. For example, some respondents  said: "I do not like the LDP at all because it is corrupt and  causes too many problems, so I am fed up with it," while others  said: "I am tired of the long [LDP] reign."    The next group of supporters, also at 18 percent, gave  "expectation" for the administration as the reason for their  support. Among their remarks were: "Although there are many  problems at the moment, I hold expectations for the future";  "Politics will change"; "It is likely to bring about a new wave  in politics"; and "Maybe Japan will change." Thus, it seems  people still hold deep-rooted expectations for the new  administration after over six months have elapsed since its  inauguration.</p>

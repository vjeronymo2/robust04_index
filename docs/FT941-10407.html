			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea re-export plan angers growers The Indian tea industry is up in arms about a proposal to import tea into the country for blending with the locally grown tea and re-export. Growers fear such a move could debase the quality image of the country's tea. The idea has been around for some years, but the prospect is now looming larger following the commerce ministry's decision to canvas industry opinion about it. Tea processing units located in the export processing zones are already allowed to import tea for re-export in packets, tea bags or in instant form with a minimum value addition of 20 per cent. But according to Mr SK Bhasin, vice chairman of the Indian Tea Association this 'has not yielded any worthwhile result'. Tea blenders and exporters maintain, however, that it should be possible to find fair tea in the world market at lower than Dollars 1.10 a kilogram, the present average price for south Indian tea. Mr Mumtaz Ahmad, director of Mcleod Russel, does not agree. 'The tea that is available at less than Dollars 1 a kilogram is fibrous and stalky,' he says. 'Much of this tea in India will be treated as waste tea. Therefore, if we import such tea and blend it with Indian tea for re-export, then our tea will get a bad name in the world market.' Mr RK Krishna Kumar, managing director of Tata Tea, estimates that India generated about 35m kg of tea waste in 1993 in the course of producing over 755m kg of marketable tea. 'Not many gardens in the country have the expertise to extract tea solids from tea waste,' he says. 'The tea solids which are water soluble are used to make instant tea. Till now, we are using only a small portion of the tea waste to extract tea solids and caffeine. India is the only tea producing country in the world which strictly enforces quality standards and does not permit the marketing of tea waste. We must not allow the import of tea waste in the name of fair tea.' The tea producing industry feels that once the import of bulk tea is allowed the importers will press the government to let them sell some of it, blended with Indian tea, in the domestic market. Units in the export processing zones are generally allowed to sell 25 per cent of their production in the domestic market. However, the value-added tea produced from imported tea is not allowed to be marketed within the country. According to Mr Ahmad: 'If low value foreign tea finds its way into the Indian market, it will spell disaster for teas grown in south India, Dooars, Terai and Cachar'. Mr Bhasin rejects the contention of the import lobby that 'the re-export of tea to be imported in bulk will supplement India's present export of around 200m kg'. He thinks such a move would simply lead to replacement of Indian tea exports with teas from other countries. 'The government must not forget,' he warns, 'that India generally has a surplus of over 200m kg of tea which must be exported if there is not to be a crash in tea prices.' However, Mr SM Datta, chairman of Hindustan Lever, argued at tea convention organised last year by the consultative committee of plantation associations that India whose annual per capita consumption of the beverage was a 'negligible' 630g, should take steps to 'accelerate the growth of domestic tea consumption, which would allow the mopping up of the relatively low quality surpluses of Indonesia, Kenya and Malawi'. He suggested that this would make room for the higher quality and higher priced teas from India in the world market 'without setting off a price war'.</p>

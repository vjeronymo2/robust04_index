Khrushchov Sept 21 93;  received Sept 22 93; UDC 591.089.84.612]    [Abstract] The article objective is to study changes in  external geniculate body (EGB) neurons after removal of field 17  of the visual cortex and immediate transplantation of embryonic  nerve tissue (ENT) into the resulting cavity long time after the  operation. Three)five months old Bright strain rats with removed  cerebral cortex field 17 were used as recipients. The study of  semifine sections of EGB tissue of recipient's brain 8, 11 and  20 days after removal of field 17 demonstrated acute retrograde  changes in the neurons. Electron microscope studies confirmed  all symptoms of retrograde changes described in the literature.  Ninety days after removal of field 17 of the vision cortex the  ultrastructure of EGB neurons corresponded to a substantial  degree to chronic retrograde changes. In studying semifine  sections of brain tissue of a recipient with a neurotransplant  one was able to see that the transplant was filling up the  artificial cavity. Even 10 and 18 months after the removal the  majority of nerve cells had practically normal structure. The  results of the studies presented in the article demonstrated  that one removal of field 17 of the brain of adult rats results  in retrograde changes and the death of some EGB neurons within  several weeks, while embryonic transplant of telencephalon  prevents destructive processes in EGB neurons even long after  the transplant operation.

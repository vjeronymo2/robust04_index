			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe, 24 Mar -- Official Dushanbe is ready to  start the process of negotiations with the opposition,  Abdulmadjid Samadov, the head of the Tajik Government stated to  journalists today. In his words, intensive preparations for the  forthcoming dialogue are under way in the republic, and a  delegation has already been practically formed. It will be  headed by Shukurjon Zuhurov, the republic's labor minister.    The prime minister stressed that there is no alternative to  a  peaceful political settlement of the Tajik conflict, but he  refrained from stating a preliminary date for the beginning of  the dialogue and the names of the representatives of the  opposition forces with whom the authorities of Tajikistan are  ready to sit down at the negotiating table.    Incidentally, the latter circumstance is very important.  Local observers believe that, and Colonel-General Boris  Pyankov, the commander of the collective peacekeeping forces in  Tajikistan stated on several occasions that the real force is  represented by that part of the opposition which, figuratively  speaking, is controlling weapons. It is this part of the  opposition, which declared itself as the irreconcilable  opposition to the present regime in Tajikistan, and which set up  the so-called government in exile in Afghanistan, that has, of  late, also announced its readiness for a political dialogue with  Dushanbe.    Local observers, however, are quite skeptical about the  feasibility of the dialogue, referring, in particular, to the  recent statement made by the press center of the republican  procurator general, which demands that practically all the  leaders of the armed opposition be detained and taken to court,  including Khodzhiakbar Turadzhonzoda, former spiritual leader of  the Tajik Muslims; Shodmon Yusuf, chairman of the Democratic  Party; Davlat Ousman, deputy chairman of the Islamic Rebirth  Party, and Tohir Abudujabar, chairman of the Rastokhez movement.  Criminal proceedings against them, the Tajik procurator  general's statement says, were instituted in absentia as early  as spring 1993. They are accused of a number of crimes against  the republic's constitutional system. Davlat Khudonazarov, one  of the opposition leaders, is on a black list too, although  criminal proceedings against him have not been officially  started.</p>

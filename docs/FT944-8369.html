			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Tory chief sets out wish-list to boost party image A blackout on media coverage of the National Health Service and a plan to have back-bench 'yobbos' metaphorically beat up the Labour leader, Mr Tony Blair, feature in the wish-list of a draft Conservative party communications plan for the run-up to the next election. Not intended for publication, it was written by Mr John Maples, the party's deputy chairman, for Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Conservative central office. It is based on detailed interviews with 80 people who voted Tory in the 1992 election but who now say they might not or would not, because they see the government as 'ineffectual and unable to deliver its promises'. Those surveyed were in the so-called 'BC1' and 'C2' average income social categories, whose support was crucial to the Conservatives' three previous election victories. They are described in the research as 'natural Conservatives', but they disapprove of privatisation and believe that the 'rich are getting richer on the backs of the rest'. Mr Maples' proposal for wooing them back, dated September 30 1994, says the election 'could be as little as 20 months away and no more than 30 months'. It identifies the task before the 1995 Conservative party conference as eroding or reversing the Labour party's lead in the opinion polls on four issues: the economy, law and order, education and the National Health Service. On the economy, Mr Maples says: 'The crucial issue here is living standards', which are 'falling in 1994 to 1995' and will fall 'again in 1995 to 1996'. He says the government's talk of recovery is 'completely at odds with their (the surveyed Tory supporters') experience'. He believes that Labour's lead on law and order can be reversed, but is pessimistic on the NHS, where Labour has a 55 percentage point lead over the Tories. 'We can never win on this issue,' the paper says. 'The best result for the next 12 months would be zero media coverage of the National Health Service.' Labour's other great electoral asset is identified as its leader, Mr Tony Blair. The paper says: 'If Blair turns out to be as good as he looks, we have a problem.' It continues: 'We cannot paint Blair as a left winger.' However, it urges a strategy of drawing commitments from the Labour leader which illustrate the divide between him and many members of his party. 'Could we set some back benchers on to this?' the paper asks. 'Maybe a few yobbos of our own to try to knock him about a bit.' The market research shows statements by Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, on returning to full employment are 'striking a chord'. The paper asks: 'Can we go any way down this path? . . . It would help neutralise any possible Labour advantage.' Legislation designed to split Mr Blair from the rest of his party - such as on ID cards - is proposed. Mr Maples also suggests delaying the pace of NHS reform, postponing the imposition of the second instalment of VAT on fuel and increasing the tax levied on executive share options. Mr Tim Collins, Tory communications director, last night said that though Mr Maples was formulating the communications plan, he had no policy-making role.

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Smith &amp; Nephew up at Pounds 171m - Rapidly changing markets provide more acquisition opportunities Smith &amp; Nephew, the surgical implants and bandages group, recorded a 10 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 170.6m, against Pounds 154.6m, despite the impact of healthcare reforms in the US. Excluding exceptional items and beneficial exchange rate movements profits rose by 8 per cent. Profits included a net gain of Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 13.3m) on disposals. Turnover was Pounds 948.7m (Pounds 857.7m) including Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 48.7m) from discontinued items. Underlying sales from continuing operations rose 7 per cent. Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said: 'We are very pleased with these results in a healthcare market that is changing rapidly around the world.' He added that some of the changes were benefiting Smith &amp; Nephew and were creating many more acquisition opportunities. The company has brought in consultants to identify targets which would strengthen its product range or geographical cover. The company has not made a significant purchase since the Dollars 236m (Pounds 162m) acquisition of Ioptex, the US eye lens maker in 1988 and, helped by a series of disposals, now has a strong balance sheet. Gearing fell from 12 per cent to 9 per cent over the year with shareholders' funds rising to Pounds 452m (Pounds 405m). US sales, 45 per cent of the total, suffered from a slowdown in non-emergency surgery which hit demand for its artificial hip and knee joints. Sales of such 'elective' surgery products rose by just 1 per cent. But other products, including wound management and bone fracture pins, continued to grow strongly leaving total US sales up 7 per cent. On the continent strong sales in northern Europe, including the difficult German market, offset weakness in Spain and France. Sales by its Japanese subsidiary jumped by more than 50 per cent to Pounds 13m and Mr Robinson predicted 'growth of 50 per cent or more for the next few years'. Earnings per share rose only 0.4p to 10.6p, after the tax rate increased from 29 per cent to 33 per cent. A final dividend of 3.02p is proposed for a total of 4.91p (4.62p). COMMENT For a decade until the mid- 1980s Smith &amp; Nephew turned in annual earnings growth of 20 per cent. Since 1989 that has sunk to a little more than 2 per cent. In the depths of the recession such dullness had its appeal, now it looks, well, dull. Nor will acquisitions necessarily return the sparkle. In its last large deal in 1988 the company paid Dollars 236m for a business which is now breaking even on sales of Dollars 30m. Prospects for the core businesses look healthy enough, particularly in south east Asia, though sales slowed in the second half. Earnings growth will be blunted by a rising tax charge again this year but on forecasts of Pounds 175m the multiple is just 13.5. Safe, if unexciting.</p>

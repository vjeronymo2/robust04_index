			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND RACING AT SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> CUTLASS REALITY FACING OLD PROBLEM  </P> <P> When it rained for the Breeders' Cup last November at Churchill Downs, the  owners of Cutlass Reality were stuck in the mud.  </P> <P> Because Cutlass Reality wouldn't have otherwise been eligible, Howard Crash and  Jim Hankoff paid a $360,000 supplementary fee so that their horse could run in  the $3-million Classic.  </P> <P> The up side to the investment was that Cutlass Reality could earn $1.35 million  by winning the race, plus substantially increasing his value as a sire.  </P> <P> The downside was that Cutlass Reality would have to finish at least second for  his owners to show a profit, and the opposition was so strong that he was the  fifth betting choice, behind Alysheba, Waquoit, Forty Niner and the entry of  Seeking the Gold and Personal Flag.  </P> <P> Cutlass Reality doesn't run well on off tracks, but if Crash and Hankoff had  scratched him from the Breeders' Cup, they would have forfeited the $360,000.  </P> <P> Cutlass Reality was in second place at the top of the stretch, but he quit  running and wound up seventh, about eight lengths behind the winning Alysheba.  </P> <P> Now, Crash, Hankoff and their trainer, Craig Lewis, may be stuck again, because  they could be faced with another off track when Cutlass Reality makes his first  start as a 7-year-old on Sunday in the $250,000 San Antonio Handicap.  </P> <P> If Cutlass Reality doesn't run, the owners are out only their $200 nomination  fee, but that would leave Lewis with the problem of getting his horse ready for  the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap on March 5 without the benefit of a prep  race.  </P> <P> Crash and Hankoff, who are investment bankers, have made plans to fly from New  York for the race and on Friday Lewis acted as though they would have a race to  watch.  </P> <P> "I want to get a race in him, and I have no other options," Lewis said.  </P> <P> In a 64-race career that has yielded $1.3 million in earnings, Cutlass Reality  has won only two of 13 starts in the mud. His last off-track victory was at  Aqueduct in 1986, long before he became a major stakes winner.  </P> <P> "He prefers a fast track, but I really can't say that the track bothered him  that much at Churchill Downs," Lewis said. "The caliber of horses that beat him  was pretty good."  </P> <P> Earlier in the year, Cutlass Reality was capable of beating that caliber.  Horse-of-the-year Alysheba lost just twice all year, once to Bet Twice and once  to Cutlass Reality, by 6 1/2 lengths in the Hollywood Gold Cup.  </P> <P> Although the 1 1/8-mile San Antonio is considered a traditional prep for the  Big 'Cap, only two horses in the 1980s -- Bates Motel and Lord at War -- have  won both stakes. Ten horses are entered Sunday, but some are questionable if  the track remains muddy. Super Diamond is a sore-legged horse who usually only  runs on fast surfaces, and Cherokee Colony was scratched from last Sunday's  Strub Stakes because of an off track.  </P> <P> Cutlass Reality, ridden as usual by Gary Stevens, has drawn the rail and will  carry the most weight, 124 pounds. Outside him, in order, are:  </P> <P> Super Diamond, with Laffit Pincay, 121 pounds; Frankly Perfect, Eddie  Delahoussaye, 115; Cherokee Colony, Rafael Meza, 120; Crimson Slew, Alex Solis,  111; Payant, Bill Shoemaker, 118; Stylish Winner, Corey Black, 112; Good Taste,  Sandy Hawley, 113; Mark Chip, Russell Baze, 113; and Stalwars, Chris McCarron,  115.  </P> <P> Frankly Perfect and Payant are coupled in the betting, because Charlie  Whittingham trains both horses and owns an interest in Payant.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Flying Continental, winner of last Wednesday's Santa Catalina, is scheduled to  run next in the San Rafael on Feb. 26, said trainer Jay Robbins. Another of  Robbins' stakes-winning 3-year-olds, Raise a Stanza, is headed for Golden Gate  Fields and the Lafayette Invitational Handicap on March 11. . . . Bruho,  injured while running second to Music Merci in last year's Del Mar Futurity, is  back in training.  </P></p>

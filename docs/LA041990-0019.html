			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LASORDA TO BE RAZZED WITH BERRIES  </P> <P> Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda has upset the Oxnard Convention and  Visitors Bureau so much that it is, well, sending him a flat of strawberries.  </P> <P> Apparently, Lasorda asked a reporter from an Oxnard newspaper recently:  "Oxnard, where the hell is that?"  </P> <P> The visitors bureau is not going to take a comment such as that lying down. "We  are planning on shipping him a flat of strawberries," said Robert Varley,  bureau executive director.  </P> <P> It's not much of a reprisal for making fun of the city, but Varley said that,  if nothing else, the strawberries will make Lasorda remember the comment.  </P> <P> "And, since he's on a diet, maybe we should send him a strawberry shortcake,"  Varley said.  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport (World Cup '94): A new generation wooed by skill - Robbie Walther, 15, plays soccer for Dalton School in New York City. He says that doesn't make him a wimp / Soccer Why do I, a good, young, upstanding American, play soccer and not American football, basketball or baseball? The question had never crossed my mind before it was announced that the soccer World Cup would be played on American soil. As soon as I heard the news I was ecstatic, but confused. How could soccer's most prestigious tournament be played where football, baseball and basketball reigned supreme; where soccer had not even been televised on the four major networks; and where anyone who wants to watch a soccer game either has to listen to a commentary on a cable station - probably in a different language - or go and watch a college match, at times possibly the most embarrassing athletic vision the US has to offer? My feeling is that it was the suburbs and the immigrant communities around the country that helped create the impression of some interest in soccer. But one thing was certain, I thought: it was not people like me who caused Fifa, the sport's governing body, to choose America as home for the 1994 World Cup. I have been playing soccer since I was six years old and, since everything back then had to revolve around me, I naturally assumed that just about everybody played soccer. Now that I am in high school, it is pretty obvious that I am in quite a small minority. This must have something to do with the availability of soccer equipment in New York City. For a pick-up game of American football in the park, all you need is six kids, a football and something to mark the end zone. Soccer needs a ball, at least 10 kids - and two goals. Now, some of the suburbs and areas with heavy immigrant populations do have pitches and goal-posts marked out, but not the New York City parks I know. So soccer is almost destined to falter in the cities, though there are a few of us who keep the game alive in urban areas. In New York, the football and soccer seasons overlap, which forces choice on anybody who wants to play both. I tried football, but once I had experienced the joys of a sport in which it takes 30 minutes to put on pads to play for another 30 minutes without ever actually touching the ball with hand or feet (I was big enough to play in the line), I lost my taste for it. When I said as much to the football coach, he reprimanded me with words that not only told me he liked anchovy pizza but also that he thought I was a wimp. I was nudged towards soccer. If the football coach started me playing, I have stayed with soccer because it is different and I love it. It does not involve my hands or brawn but it does involve my feet and brain (speed helps, too). There is no other sport in the world that allows the feet (and sometimes the head) to do the scoring. So, a country where men like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Joe Montana and Lawrence Taylor are labelled as superior athletes has yet to produce a soccer superstar like Pele, just about the only soccer player anybody has ever heard of. Other kids my age have not been so lucky to have soccer's history and traditions explained to them, and it is hard for them to learn about the game. Most start not by playing it but through television. And here's something interesting: we can now see TV commercials that use soccer to sell a product  -for example, Snickers candy, in which a man is shown juggling a soccer ball. The target of this commercial is children, which tells me that the advertising people have worked out that soccer just might be bigger among kids than they had thought. Now we have reports that an eight-team American soccer league might be formed. On reflection, maybe America got the World Cup not just because its government put in the highest bid but because of people like me, who live in big cities, as well as the suburbanites and the immigrants. I guess Fifa saw that America could become a great soccer-playing nation, and how much my generation needed a new pastime. Perhaps we are really on our way.</p>

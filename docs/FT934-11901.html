			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Moi 'behind tribal clashes' Presbyterian pastors in Kenya yesterday accused the government of President Daniel arap Moi of instigating ethnic clashes that have killed hundreds and displaced thousands in the Rift Valley, writes Leslie Crawford in Nairobi. The victims are peasant farmers of the Kikuyu tribe, the largest and wealthiest ethnic group in Kenya, who are distrusted by Mr Moi, a Kalenjin, and his coalition of minority tribes. The pastors accused troops, disguised in traditional attire and using clubs and spears, of carrying out the killings. The worsening violence in the Rift Valley and the government's apparent indifference to the Kikuyus' plight are causing alarm among Kenya's donors, who meet next month to discuss resuming aid.</p>

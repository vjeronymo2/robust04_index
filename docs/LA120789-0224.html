			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> IRAQ CLAIMS ROCKETRY ADVANCES  </P> <P> Iraq said today it launched a rocket capable of carrying satellites into space,  a development that would have profound implications for the military balance in  the Middle East.  </P> <P> Hussein Kamel, minister of industry and military industrialization, said on  state-run Baghdad radio that the three-stage rocket was launched at 8:30 a.m.  Tuesday from the Al Anbar space research center.  </P> <P> He also claimed that Iraq has developed two surface-to-surface missiles with a  range of 1,240 miles. If true, this would double the reach of Iraq's missile  arsenal.  </P> <P> There was no independent confirmation of the launch.  </P> <P> Iraq is the only Arab country to have claimed it has the capability of  launching satellites into space. If true, this could enable it to develop a  military satellite to spy on Israel and Iraq's rivals in the region.  </P></p>

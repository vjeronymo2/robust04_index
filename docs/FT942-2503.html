			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / How to Spend It: For those who serve . . . - What to wear for tennis There are those who still care about what they wear when playing sports such as tennis. Tennis wear for chaps has remained reassuringly much the same throughout the years with the only real change being a welcome trend to longer, baggier shorts and looser shirts (if in doubt buy a size or two up). For women, though, it has been hard in recent seasons to find much that looked tolerably feminine and yet fulfilled the practical briefs. Strictly tailored little skirts with rather butch shirts have become the standard wear, whether on rickety public courts or Centre Court at Wimbledon. Anybody wondering what happened to the sweet little tennis dresses of yesteryear (the sort that Chris Evert and Tracy Austin used to wear, remember?) might like to know that this year, soft dresses are back on the agenda. Ellesse, for instance, has created a series of long-bodied, low-necked dresses with skirts which twirl prettily as you serve and run and which would look equally good at the club bar afterwards. In white, with a canary yellow skirt, in cotton and lycra, it is Pounds 110 from good sportswear shops including Lillywhites. Another name to look out for is Belfe, better known for its excellent ski-wear - like many a winter sports orientated company it needs to fill in the income gap in the summer and this it does with some very beguiling tennis-wear. There is a sleeveless dress made from soft white cotton with a pink or blue and white gingham skirt. Pounds 59 from Harrods Olympic Way. Finally, if dresses are what you are looking for, there is Desrosiers, a British company which has also decided that this is the year to go a little bit more feminine. In particular there is a cap-sleeved, drop-waisted version with a pleated skirt edged with a floral band for Pounds 55. Also from Harrods Olympic Way.</p>

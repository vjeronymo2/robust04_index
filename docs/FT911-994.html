			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Labour takes the next step LAST night's speech by the shadow chancellor John Smith to the Royal Institute of Public Administration marks the first formal endorsement of the government's reforms of the Civil Service by a senior member of the shadow cabinet. It thus offers assurance that the creation of agencies to deliver government services will survive beyond a change of government, a welcome measure of bipartisan support for reforms designed to increase the quality of those services while strengthening financial and managerial controls. In the adversarial atmosphere of British politics, such cross-party support for institutional reform has become rare enough to merit comment in its own right. It would be advantageous were similar consensus to be achieved in other important spheres of public life, such as pensions, education and health care (or, for that matter, local government finance). Without such agreement, reforms must be implemented against the opposition of entrenched interests which look to a change of government to reinstate the status quo. All too often, whatever success is achieved will be unravelled in future years. For the Civil Service reforms, at any rate, the threat of such a reversal may now be lifted. Mr Smith not only welcomed the reforms set out by Sir Robin Ibbs in the Next Steps report of 1988; he positively endorsed their aims as central to Labour's objectives for the public sector. Such criticisms as he made were not of principles, but of implementation - for example, the government's alleged failure to carry civil servants and their unions with it. Service delivery The Next Steps report sought to separate the delivery of government services from policy-making by creating separate agencies to provide specific services. Agency managers focus on service delivery, whether it be the testing of heavy goods vehicles, the provision of company information or the payment of benefits. Service targets are set for a three-year period, agreed between the agency and its sponsoring department in a framework document which also specifies the powers devolved on questions such as personnel management. Agency chief executives are accountable to their sponsoring department and to parliament for operational matters, a process which seems to have worked well so far. Mission statements The launch of the first agencies was buttressed by much private-sector paraphernalia - corporate identities, glossy annual reports and impressive mission statements. More substantially, almost all the first tranche of agencies launched customer service surveys, leading to improved service quality and new - usually profitable - services. These early initiatives indicate that the Next Steps approach has reinvigorated managers and staff and begun to create more responsive and consumer-friendly organisations. Agency staff remain civil servants, covered by national pay agreements, terms and conditions. There is some freedom to introduce employment changes where these would be more suited to the nature of the work; only one agency  -HMSO - has used this freedom to create its own pay structure, though several have introduced staff bonus schemes to encourage greater efficiency. As the first agencies renegotiate their framework documents this summer, managers will seek and should be granted greater powers to manage, further untying themselves from the dead hand of central control. In short, some progress has been achieved in creating free-standing, user-oriented organisations, but much of the potential is still to be realised - which is why Mr Smith's endorsement of Next Steps is significant. Managers implementing the agency programme can now adopt a longer-term perspective, secure in the knowledge that it will not be blown off course by a change of government. While there is much further to go in the evolution of Next Steps, the principle that government services are best delivered by dedicated agencies at arm's length from the policy-making process is here to stay. Its recognition is long overdue.</p>

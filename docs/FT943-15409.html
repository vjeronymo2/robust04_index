			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: SelecTV SelecTV, the USM-quoted independent television production company, yesterday reported a 14 per cent advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 809,000 to Pounds 926,000 in the year to end-March. The outcome was achieved on turnover 19 per cent ahead from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 23.8m and was boosted by an increase in receivable interest to Pounds 441,000 (Pounds 163,000). Earnings per share emerged at 0.38p (0.42p). Mr Allan McKeown, chief executive, said the results reflected a year of continuing growth in the company's core business of television production - albeit at reduced margins - and investment in its programme library had increased by Pounds 650,000 to Pounds 1.17m at the year end. The company now faced a period when its cash resources would be called on both to finance its continuing programme production schedule as well as its expansion into other areas. For this reason, Mr McKeown said, the board was not recommending payment of a dividend this year.</p>

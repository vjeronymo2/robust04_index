			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Police Minister Moshe Shahal met last night in  Jerusalem with Faysal al-Husayni on the issue of Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres' letter and made it clear to him that  Israel has no plans to hurt the Palestinian institutions that  began operating in East Jerusalem after the Madrid conference.  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports:    [Begin Amir recording] The police minister held an urgent  and secret meeting with al-Husayni because of the need to  publicize Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' letter to his  Norwegian counterpart. Palestinian sources reported that  Minister Shahal reiterated to al-Husayni that Israel has no  intention of impeding the activities of the Palestinian  institutions established in East Jerusalem after the Madrid  conference and that there will be no change in the status quo on  the issue. According to them, al-Husayni voiced his concern  over statements by Israeli cabinet ministers regarding the  activities in Orient House and once again demanded that the  Israeli Government lift the closure on East Jerusalem, which  cuts it off from the territories.    Al-Husayni came to the meeting with Shahal after an  emergency  session at his office in Orient House with members of the  Jerusalem Committee. His fellow committee members accused  Israel of trying to determine unilaterally and already at this  point the status and future of Jerusalem. [passage omitted]    It should be pointed out that the Jerusalem Committee headed  by al-Husayni set up a subcommittee to monitor Israel's actions  against the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem.    [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 7 June, in a page-9  report by Roni Shaqed, says that "yesterday, Arab leaders in  Jerusalem decided to take action to strengthen the Palestinians'  status in the city and raise the plight of the city within all  negotiating frameworks without conceding its status as the  Palestinian capital. It was also decided to continue to develop  the Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem and not to heed  Israel's orders to transfer these institutions to the autonomy  area."    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 7 June adds  that Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi told correspondent Moti Amir last night  that "all the Palestinian autonomy institutions will be located  in Gaza and Jericho during the interim period but could relocate  elsewhere, including East Jerusalem, later."]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister  P.K. Chiang said the government's policy to build the fourth  nuclear plant will not change despite overwhelming opposition to  the plant by villagers who live near the proposed site.    Chiang said he was not surprised by the result of a public  poll in Kungliao Sunday [22 May], and said he will ask the  state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) to step up its dialogue  and communication with people in Kungliao, a village some 35 km  east of Taipei.    In a vote Sunday, some 5,669, or 96.1 percent of the voters,  voted against the plan to construct the nuclear plant in  Kungliao, while 176 voters supported the plan.    Taipower officials said that it attached great importance to  the vote, and will study the reason for villagers' opposition  before embarking on another round of communications with them.    They noted however that only 58 percent of the eligible  voters turned out to vote.    Taipower also announced that it will subsidize electricity  fees for Kungliao villagers as soon as the budget for the fourth  nuclear power plant is approved by the legislature.    Taipower President Chang Shih-min will lead Taipower  officials to visit Kungliao leaders Tuesday to solicit their  support for the plan.    Chang said that the vote is not legally binding and that the  plant should be constructed for the welfare of the nation.  Plans to construct the plant should not be swayed by the vote  alone, he said.    Chang reiterated that the fourth nuclear plant will boast  the  world's best security and environmental facilities.    Chao Kuo-tung, chief of Kungliao Village, said he was  thrilled that most of the voters were against the plan, but said  that the 11,000 residents in Kungliao do not have enough  strength.    Chao asked Taipei County Magistrate You Ching to hold a  public poll in Taipei County to solidify the opposition force.  You said he supports the idea of a poll but will have to spend  time studying the issues first.    Anti-nuclear activists said they are not content with this  "triumph" and have planned other actions to prevent construction  of the plant' Legislator Chou Po-lun said that if the ruling  Kuomintang tries to force the budget for the nuclear plant  through the legislature next month, he will mobilize Kungliao  villagers to form a self-defense force to block the construction  of the plant.    He said that anti-nuclear groups will begin a series of  protests this [words indistinct] the Legislative Yuan Tuesday  and National Assembly and the Presidential Office Thursday and  stage a large demonstration against the nuclear plant next  Sunday.</p>

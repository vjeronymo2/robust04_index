			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Granada No doubt there will be tears shed at the Rover's Return, the pub immortalised by Granada Television's long-running series, Coronation Street. But sober shareholders ought to accept yesterday's enforced resignation of chairman Mr David Plowright as the inevitable and probably welcome consequence of the changing face of commercial television. The abruptness of the departure of one of the doyens of UK programme-making is an embarrassment in the short term. But it is already clear that a fresh combination of management skills will be needed when the new terrestrial TV regime begins in earnest next year. Granada admittedly has a well-deserved reputation as a cash cow, and last year pulled off a brilliant coup by retaining its franchise on the cheap. But with its old monopoly profits no longer assured, and a higher annual bill from the Treasury under the new levy system, a cheaper cost structure is required. Differences with Mr Plowright evidently go deeper than this. But whatever they are, they have distracted attention from the main task. Granada, for example, has been absent from the power bloc building up around Carlton, LWT, Central and Scottish. On balance, yesterday's development should do nothing to dent the recovery in investor sentiment towards Granada. But having outperformed the market by 50 per cent since last July the shares may now find the going harder.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Demirel fails in first ballot TURKEY'S parliament failed at the weekend to elect a new president in the first ballot when Mr Suleyman Demirel, the front-runner, did not win the two-thirds majority required, our foreign staff and Reuter report. Prime Minister Demirel, tipped as the most likely candidate to replace Mr Turgut Ozal, who died of heart failure last month, received 234 votes from the 450-member single-chamber Grand National Assembly. A second ballot will be held on Wednesday, at which the winner also needs a two-third majority, and if necessary a third on May 16, when only a simple majority is required. Seven times prime minister and twice ousted by the military, the 69-year-old Mr Demirel has been a feature of the Turkish political map for almost three decades. There is some disappointment that he is keen to take up a largely ceremonial post, leaving the government without strong leadership.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special statement" by President Zhelyu Zhelev on his </F> decision to sign Law on Amendments to the Privatization Act --  recorded]    [Text] Today President Zhelyu Zhelev signed Decree No.  141, with which he ordered that the Law on Amendments and  Additions to the Act on Conversion and Privatization of State  and Municipal Enterprises should be published in DURZHAVEN  VESTNIK. In this connection, he made the following special  statement for Bulgarian National Radio and Television:    [Zhelev] I signed the Privatization Act because it is one of  the most important, not to say fateful, laws for our country's  development. Before deciding to sign the law, I held a broad  series of meetings and talks with experts and economists from  various institutions and circles with the aim of hearing their  views. As a result of the talks and the views that I was able  to hear, I understood that they have various objections to the  content of the law itself, although as a whole most of them  support mass privatization.    I also have such objections, I also have my own reservations  regarding this law, but despite this I decided to let it pass,  to sign it, because otherwise there is a danger of us stopping  altogether one of the most important aspects of the reforms.  Whereas the Restitution of Property Act affected about 3 or 4  percent of the population, and the Law on Return of Farmland  affected about 70 percent of the nation, this law affects  practically every single one of us. In my view, the mass  privatization act, as it is popularly called, is important  because of the following. First, it launches, it provides a  powerful stimulus -- if it is properly applied -- to  privatization in general, which in Bulgaria is almost at a  standstill. Second, it creates a new, far wider social basis.  Such an important law cannot operate effectively unless it is  supported by practically the entire nation. For this to happen,  one needs mass privatization that attracts the interest of the  people. Third, none of the Eastern European countries that are  moving along the same path were able to manage without the  instrument of mass privatization. In Czechia, Poland, Hungary,  Slovakia, and Russia, although the different countries achieved  varying rates of success, all of them in one way or another used  mass privatization as a means to intensify this process and  impart a strong impulse to it.    In practice, I found myself in the situation, despite my  reservations, of having to sign this law. However, for it to be  a truly effective law, to prevent it proving another dead  letter, in my opinion parliament must pass as a matter of  urgency the bills on insolvencies and on investment funds, and  also carefully consider the question whether the banks could not  also be used in the role of investment funds. Second, in the  subsidiary legislative and normative documents to the act, it is  essential to differentiate very clearly and precisely the  functions and role of the mass privatization center and the  Privatization Agency, to ensure that the mass privatization in  no way hampers the other forms of market privatization. Last,  but not least, we need a strong government that has the will,  energy, and courage to carry out the privatization. The law  itself, however perfect it may be, cannot achieve anything.    Accordingly, I had to choose between signing a not  completely  perfect law on mass privatization and the prospect of Bulgaria  not having any mass privatization at all. I prefered to sign.</p>

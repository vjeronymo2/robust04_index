			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT ARE FANS FOR?  </P> <P> I really wonder what was going through Melissa Henry's mind when she wrote her  letter ("Enough already with the letters from incensed New Kids on the Block  fans!" Calendar, Nov. 10).  </P> <P> Her letter comes as no surprise in an adult society where no one does much of  anything except complain about students' falling test scores and other  shortcomings of today's young people. The letters we write as New Kids fans  allow us to give back to them in some minute way. In our hearts, we know we  have done the right thing by defending them.  </P> <P> Everything comes to pass anyway, but for now, let the New Kids fans exercise  their right to freedom of speech.  </P> <P> MICHELLE PARKINSON  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

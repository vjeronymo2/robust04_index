			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan falls after rise in Lombard rate WITH most of the Continent closed for the Whit Monday public holiday, Milan and Madrid were the main players on a stage darkened by last week's Danish referendum 'No' vote, writes Our Markets Staff. The focus for Euro Disney shifted to London where the shares finished down 20p at 1083p. Analysts said that trading was thin as many investors waited for Paris where Euro Disney's shares lost 5 per cent on Friday. MILAN was also depressed by rises in banks' base rates following the Bank of Italy's increase in Lombard rate last Friday, and confused by another blackout of the bourse's screen trading system which left volume thin after last Friday's L99.5bn. The Comit index fell another 6.34, or 1.3 per cent to 481.08. The 35 shares listed on the computer system started trading by traditional open outcry at 1100 GMT after the screen system collapsed due to a technical failure. Heavy rainstorms and lightning put the screens out of commission a week before. Fiat fell L52 to L5,230, and shed another L50 to L5,180 on the kerb. Banks, and other industrials lost ground, and selling of Ferruzzi's Eridania dragged the food sector down by 3.15 per cent, Eridania savings shares losing L280 to L5,410. Traders said that domestic Italian investors were selling to raise liquidity for the upcoming Stet new issue. The day's special situation was Alenia, the Italian partner in the troubled European defence jet fighter consortium, which plunged L130, or 7.7 per cent to L1,550 on Germany's lack of political will to stay with the project. MADRID remained cautious with the post-Maastricht vote still weighing on sentiment. However, the market may gain impetus on Friday with the release of CPI data. The general index lost 0.84 to 253.80 in low turnover of Pta5.7bn. Endesa bucked the trend, rising Pta25 to Pta3,680, on speculation that RWE of Germany is interested in building a 10 per cent stake. ISTANBUL was encouraged by positive May inflation figures published after the close on Friday. The 75-share index gained 198.7 or 6 per cent to 3,462.05.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUN 8*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1178.67  1178.74  1178.74  1178.18  1177.75  1177.89  1177.20  1177.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High  1179.50            Day's Low  1176.90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     Jun 5         Jun 4        Jun 3         Jun 2         Jun 1    1181.18       1184.92**    1186.81       1200.27       1196.12  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).           * Partial     ** Indicative.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

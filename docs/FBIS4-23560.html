			<p>BFN     [Text] The members of the Electoral Court were sworn in by  President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano in Maputo today. The  Electoral Court will be responsible for assessing contentious  issues stemming from decisions made by the National Elections  Commission. Speaking on the occasion, the Mozambican head of  state said the task of the Electoral Court is to uphold the  Electoral Law and guarantee that the Mozambican elections take  place in strict adherence to that law. The Electoral Court has  two Mozambican magistrates and five international judges  appointed by the UN secretary general on recommendation of the  Security Council.</p>

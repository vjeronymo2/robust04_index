			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (23): The burden grows heavier - The welfare state is not faring too well GERMANY'S generous social state is caught in a double bind. On the one hand, the demographic trends are resulting in an ever increasing aged population, needing greater health care, residential care, and pensions, while the actual size of the working population is shrinking. That is a problem common to virtually all the western industrialised world. On the other hand, the traditionally generous German benefit system has been knocked sideways by the sudden advent of 17m new potential claimants from the former east Germany, wanting full benefits, but only just beginning to make any insurance contributions now. The result has been an explosion of costs, which has suddenly focused attention on the capacity of the German economy to carry on paying so much. When the total cost of social spending passed the DM1,000bn mark this year, reaching rather more than one third of gross domestic product, it brought the problem home to the ordinary citizen. Yet he already has a very precise idea of what the rising costs mean to him. The three pillars of the German welfare state - health insurance, pensions and unemployment insurance - have always been generous in their benefits. Unemployed workers, for example, have until now received two-thirds of their former salary for 32 months, and then a few percentage points less, indefinitely. Unlike the British system, where social security payments and income tax payments are effectively all part of a single kitty policed by the Treasury, German insurance funds are self-financing, and contribution-driven. It is only when payments outstrip contributions that the state must step in to make up the shortfall. It has always been easier in Germany to allow insurance contributions to rise as social spending has soared, rather than switch a part of the burden to the general taxpayer. The result has been a rising burden, not only on individual workers, but on their employers, for they share the insurance contributions for all three funds on a 50:50 basis. The proportion of gross income which the employer and employee must jointly pay in insurance has risen from just 26.5 per cent, in 1970, to an estimated 39.2 per cent next year, thanks to a two percentage point jump in pensions' contributions. According to the Economics Ministry's big policy paper on Securing the Future of Germany's Economic Base, total labour costs in Germany are now running at DM42 per hour, of which ancillary costs - mostly social contributions - are no less than DM20. The comparable figures in France are DM28 and DM13, and in Portugal DM9 and DM4. 'The limits of social policy should be set where the social framework and redistribution of income starts to endanger overall economic performance, because economic incentives are weakened and the individual responsibility of both citizens and enterprises is undermined,' the paper says. The aim it sets out is to stabilise contributions for health, pensions, and unemployment, and in the medium-term, start to reduce them. It is much more easily said than done. In the first place, the government is committed to introducing a fourth pillar to the social security system - an insurance system for residential care for the old and handicapped, whether they need to live in homes, or be cared for in their own homes. At present such nursing care is financed by local authorities, but the rapid rise in the elderly population has put a well-nigh intolerable burden on their budgets, and the government has promised to find an alternative system. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Labour Minister, Mr Norbert Blum, seem to see the scheme as a vote-winner in next year's elections, although it will not result in any improvement in nursing care in the near term. It will simply transfer the financing to a new scheme. Their problem is how to finance it without adding yet another brick to the pillar of social contributions. After three years of painful negotiations, the answer they have come up with seems to have pleased no one: they suggest cutting the number of national holidays in the calendar from 10 to eight, or instead, allowing workers to choose to take a 20 per cent pay cut on those holidays. In this way, they say, employers will be effectively compensated for the increased insurance contribution. The workers are furious, and the employers unpersuaded. The former are simply mad to be paying more contributions, and losing precious holidays to compensate their bosses. The latter believe that the scheme will anyway soar in costs - one estimate puts it at DM13bn a year straight away - leaving the 'compensation' far behind. As for the rest of the social spending, the real problem lies now with unemployment benefit. With the sharpest downturn since the war, and unemployment in the two halves of the country expected to rise from 3.3m today towards 4m next year, the costs of unemployment benefit, short-time working allowances, job creation schemes and the like have rocketed. The Federal Labour Office faces a deficit this year, in spite of its increased unemployment insurance, of around DM27bn on total spending of some DM114bn. A huge share of that is the cost of labour market measures, retraining and the like, in east Germany. Yet the cost is borne entirely by western workers who pay unemployment insurance - which excludes all public servants, and all the self-employed. That is another cause of deep bitterness among ordinary workers and the trade union movement. Provided the Germany economy soon rises from recession and eastern Germany starts on the path of self-sustaining growth, the costs of unemployment benefits will return to the manageable. The long-term problem remains how to deal with the demographic change. On that score, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, can only appeal for a national debate. As he points out, it is not just that the population is ageing, but that there is a growing trend towards early retirement. So the shrinking workforce, caused by the low birthrate, is further reduced by early retirement, and the base for social contributions is smaller still. 'The present trend towards early retirement must be reversed in the medium- to long-term,' he says. Quite apart from reducing the able-bodied workforce, it results in 'the inhumane exclusion of productive and willing older workers from the ranks of the economically active'. The pensions burden stretches into the future, Mr Rexrodt's paper says. 'This question must be discussed now, and a decision reached on how in the long-term old age care can be guaranteed, without overburdening the younger generation.' It is a question which will involve the length of a normal working life, promotion of larger families, expected migration, pension reforms, the development of the labour market, and future incomes. And it is a debate which is only just beginning.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shake-up of teacher training starts today THE GOVERNMENT will today take a first step towards a wide-ranging shake-up of Britain's system for training teachers by announcing a trial scheme of 'teaching schools' as an alternative to teacher training institutes. The Pounds 1m pilot - likened to the system of teaching hospitals for training doctors - is intended by ministers as precursor of reforms aimed at reducing the role of conventional university and college courses in favour of more classroom-based experience in schools. The schools involved in the pilot will train teachers themselves and receive funding direct from the government which they will then be able to use to 'buy' services from the training institutes. Mr John Patten, education secretary, envisages eventually a nationwide network of primary and secondary schools offering to train teachers. The government has already increased the proportion of time trainee teachers spend in the classroom during their training. The move has been backed by Mr John Major. Schools involved in the pilot will include both those under local authority control and grant-maintained schools. Ministers are likely to argue that the pressure for change has come from the schools themselves who want more control over the training of teachers. Currently the training of primary school teachers is closely tied to courses at colleges and universities. and has been attacked by the right of the Conservative party. Ministers believe existing teaching training courses remain too theoretical and have failed to adapt sufficiently to the national curriculum and regular testing. Legislation on teacher training in the next session of parliament was not being ruled out last night by Department of Education officials, although further changes are likely to depend on the department's consultative exercise. As the government's Education Bill - with more than 260 clauses the biggest education measure ever introduced - was given a third reading by a government majority of 30 (282-252) in the Commons last night, Mr Patten said that schools controlled by local education authorities are to be given the right to decide on a year-to-year basis whether to seek self-governing status.</p>

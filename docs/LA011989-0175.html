			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> 40 AFTERSHOCKS RECORDED AFTER 5.0 QUAKE AT MALIBU ROCKS WIDE AREA; 4 INJURED  </P> <P> At least 40 aftershocks were recorded early today in the wake of an earthquake  that was centered in the Malibu area, causing minor damage and slightly  injuring at least four people.  </P> <P> The moderate quake, measuring 5 on the Richter scale, hit at 10:56 p.m  Wednesday. It was centered in the Santa Monica Bay about 8 miles south of  Malibu and was felt from San Diego County 100 miles south to Santa Barbara,  about 100 miles to the north.  </P> <P> Caltech seismic analyst Steve Bryant said 20 aftershocks were recorded before 1  a.m. -- the largest measuring 3.3 on a composite seismographic scale. Since 1  a.m., at least 20 more were registered, he said.  </P> <P> "With a quake this size, we expect to see (aftershocks) for several days,"  Bryant said. "They should decrease after a while."  </P> <P> An earthquake measuring 5 is classified as "moderate," capable of causing minor  damage if centered in an urban area.  </P> <P> The quake shook office buildings 25 miles away in downtown Los Angeles with a  rolling motion for 10 to 15 seconds, but was felt as a sharp jolt closer to the  epicenter.  </P> <P> In Malibu, an early assessment showed only minor damage, sheriff's Lt. Jim  Glazar said.  </P> <P> The rumble sent rocks tumbling down from the mountainside onto the road through  Malibu Canyon and toppled bottles and jars from shelves at a Hughes' Market,  causing several thousand dollars damage to merchandise in the store, Manager  Kelly Seidel said.  </P> <P> "It hit real hard down here," Seidel said, noting that several shoppers in the  store abandoned their shopping carts when the shaking started and ran outside.  </P> <P> Glazar said the quake also pushed six cans and a bottle of beer onto the floor  of the evidence locker of the Malibu sheriff's station, where they were being  held for evidence.  </P> <P> "When the evidence custodian came in this morning, she found a big puddle of  beer on the floor," he said.  </P> <P> In Santa Monica, the quake shattered a 10-by-15-foot storefront window at a  downtown J. C. Penney Co. and caused a few small cracks in the stucco at City  Hall, police Lt. Roy McGinnis said.  </P> <P> Area hospitals reported that four people were treated for cuts and other minor  injuries, including a woman who broke her foot when she jumped out of bed,  hospital officials said.  </P> <P> The Department of Water and Power said more than 90,000 people were momentarily  without electricity because of automatic shutdowns of some equipment due to the  quake.  </P> <P> Bryant said there are several large fault lines in the coastal area where the  quake was centered, including the Elysian Park and Torrance-Wilmington faults.  </P></p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Channel incurs loss Recession coupled with difficult conditions in the shipping industry left Bristol Channel Ship Repairers Pounds 236,261 in the red at the pre-tax level for the 28 weeks to October 9. The loss, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 74,884, was struck after taking account of a special non-recurring item of Pounds 150,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 661,801 to Pounds 34,192 and losses per share amounted to 0.3p (earnings 0.09p). Andreas Ugland, a private Norwegian shipping group, took a 24 per cent stake in the company last July. Developments at Bristol could result in Mr Christopher Bailey stepping down as chairman.</p>

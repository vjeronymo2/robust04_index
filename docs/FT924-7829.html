			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Britain protests over Rushdie death call BRITAIN yesterday made a strong protest to Iran over the the renewed call by a senior Iranian legal official for the killing of Mr Salman Rushdie, the British writer. Mr Douglas Hogg, a Foreign Office minister, summoned Iran's charge d'affaires in London, Mr Gholamreza Ansari, to demand that Iran should urgently reaffirm its earlier commitment not to interfere in Britain's internal affairs. In a 20-minute meeting with the Iranian diplomat, Mr Hogg protested 'in the strongest possible terms' about a statement made on Tuesday by the Iranian chief justice, Mr Morteza Moqtadaei, that Moslems were obliged to kill Mr Rushdie for his alleged blasphemies against Islam in his book, The Satanic Verses. The British government 'took a very serious view of the statement and all other statements reiterating the fatwa (death call) and calling on Moslems to implement it,' the Foreign Office said. 'It appeared to call into question Iran's commitment to honouring its obligations not to interfere in our internal affairs.' The fatwa was originally issued by Iran's late spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1989. Mr Rushdie has since lived in hiding in Britain, but has lately made appearances in Germany and France to appeal for international pressure on Iran to lift the death edict. Diplomatic relations between Britain and Iran were broken off by London over the issuing of the fatwa, but were restored in September 1990. However, a round of tit-for-tat expulsions last summer resulted in a renewed deterioration in relations and put a stop to possible moves to exchange ambassadors.</p>

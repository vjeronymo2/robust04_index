			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Letter: Courage needed to defend the economy rather than currency Sir, Common sense? Of course it was common sense. The tragedy is that the chancellor did not think of it himself, but had it forced on him by the Bundesbank and the foreign exchange markets in a chaotic, expensive and humiliating manner. Far from acting as the villain, the Bundesbank has demonstrated the benefits of having a politically independent central bank. Roman Slawinski, 115 Park Road, Chiswick, London W4 3ER</p>

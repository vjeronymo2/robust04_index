			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer Suzette Pockock] South African troops  have been stationed on full alert along the Ciskei border. This  is the word from Defense Minister Kobie Coetsee. However,  according to a Defense Ministry spokesman, these troops will not  be deployed inside the homeland. This move follows requests  from former Ciskei military leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo that the  South African Government and the Transitional Executive Council  [TEC] take over administration of the territory. Ciskei's chief  representative at the TEC, Mr. Mickey Webb, made the  announcement of Brig. Gqozo's voluntary release of the reins of  power to that body last night.    Matters came to a head in the Ciskei yesterday when striking  policemen took officers hostage in the capital, Bisho. The  strikers demanded that Brig. Gqozo address them. However, the  former leader said he saw little point in speaking to the men  after his resignation. Last night South Africa's ambassador to  Ciskei, Mr. Piet Goosen, spoke to the strikers. The border  chairman of the ANC [African National Congress], Mr. Smuts  Ngonyama, also spoke to the policemen in the early hours of this  morning. For the latest in the eastern Cape, it's over to James  Barkhuizen.... But I believe we don't have that link at the  moment. James has confirmed this morning that Brig. Gqozo was  under house arrest. [passage omitted]    Well, we have that link now with James Barkhuizen in Ciskei,  who is in Ciskei at the moment, and apparently in Brig. Oupa  Gqozo's house. Good morning, James. What can you tell us?    [Barkhuizen] Good morning. I'm in the brigadier's house,  Brig. Oupa Gqozo's house. Brig. Gqozo didn't speak to me up  until now, but people working for Brig. Gqozo -- I can't confirm  whether they are bodyguards or defense force members; they  wouldn't say, but they are at the house -- they say that we must  correct the earlier report on the news. The brigadier is  allowed to go anywhere. He is not, I repeat, he is not --  according to these people -- he's not under house arrest. The  brigadier himself is next to me now. I wonder, Brigadier, would  you please speak? It's live on air. Brigadier, can you please  explain the situation?    [Gqozo] Yes. Hello.    [Pockock] Good morning, Brigadier. What can you tell us?    [Gqozo] Suzette, I'm definitely not under house arrest as it  was reported in the news earlier.    [Pockock] What is the position?    [Gqozo] The position is that since I have announced  yesterday  that I'm retiring, I think that has caused a little bit of  confusion, and the soldiers received it with mixed feelings.  They are definitely outraged that I could just resign like  that, when they thought there was nothing really worth the  effort. They didn't want me to resign, but I've told them that  it is just a matter of resigning 2 weeks earlier. I would have  had to resign, anyway, after 27 April.    [Pockock] Now what is the position of the strikers at the  moment?    [Gqozo] The strikers are still holding those people hostage,  but I promised them yesterday that I would talk to them at 7.30  today.    [Pockock] And what will you be saying to them?    [Gqozo] Well, basically I'd like them to release the  officers, to go back to work, and let us wait for the TEC people  and some officials from foreign affairs to come and discuss the  future of this territory.    [Pockock] Now we beleive that a woman and a child are being  held hostage. Is that correct?    [Gqozo] I'm not yet sure where the woman and the child have  been taken to, but I was told yesterday night that the acting  commissioner of police's wife and child have been abducted from  the house, although no one was certain where exactly they were  taken to.    [Pockock] Now what exactly do the strikers want? What are  their demands?    [Gqozo] This is what is making me totally frustrated,  Suzette. They say they want their pensions paid out now, and you  know, it's very impossible. So such impossible demands led me  to believe that this was just an excuse to try and do another  Bop [Bophuthatswana] on Ciskei, and I thought that the best way  to avoid it and to avoid that any losses of life and any  destruction of property would be for me to step down before  something happened that has happened in Bophuthatswana. I don't  think it's worth it. If people would like to have a change of  government or a change of scene, I think it's better that we act  and preempt that by acting wisely. In this case, I thought that  retiring from office and getting the South African Government  and the TEC to already put an administration which would ensure  that all these grievances are answered, would be the best. I  don't think at this moment I've got any power to grant leave  gratuities, I've got no power to grant the people all the  assurances that they want about their future in a future  government.    [Pockock] Now, Brigadier, one last question. What is the  mood of the people in Bisho this morning?    [Gqozo] Very cool. I think the whole night was very quiet  and very cool. There is absolutely nothing that shows any  excitement or extraordinary activities. Everybody is happy and  everybody is waiting to hear what will unfold today.    [Pockock] Brig Gqozo, thanks very much for speaking to us  this morning.</p>

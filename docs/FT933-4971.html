			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: Toronto SE launches index THE TORONTO Stock Exchange is to launch on October 1 an index of 100 most actively-traded stocks. It is designed to help institutional investors measure Canadian equity performance more accurately. The TSE-300 Index, now among the most widely used, includes smaller capitalisation stocks. The new 100 Index will contain only large capitalisation stocks and the most liquid securities. It will comprise stocks representing 83 per cent of the total capitalisation of the TSE-300. A range of derivative products will be ready within six months. The new TSE-100 was given a value of 250 at August 31 and will reflect market changes since then when the TSE begins reporting on October 1. The TSE-300 continues, and those stocks not included in the TSE-100 will later form the basis of a new TSE-200. The 100 index will be updated each April at the same time as the 300. Stocks in the 100 are classified into resource, industrial, interest-sensitive and consumer products groups.</p>

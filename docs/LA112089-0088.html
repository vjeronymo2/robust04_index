			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWS WATCH  </P> <P> JITTERS: Orange County residents are so accustomed to their own dangerous  earthquake fault (the Newport-Inglewood) that the Bay Area quake a month ago  has hardly affected them, right? Wrong. . . . The four major insurers of Orange  County homes report increased interest in quake insurance: State Farm says  business has doubled since the quake, Farmers says business is up by about  250%, and Allstate and Aetna say queries are way up, although sales figures are  not in.

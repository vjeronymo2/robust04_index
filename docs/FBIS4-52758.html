			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Parliamentary forces  opposed to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata are poised to step up  next week their attacks on his minority coalition cabinet, which  was inaugurated only in late April.    "Operation Besiege" against the Hata Government was kicked  off by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Friday [13 May]  when it submitted a resolution demanding the chairman of the  House of Representatives Diet Steering Committee be sacked. The  resolution against Keiwa Okuda, a member of the coalition's core  party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] which Hata leads, is  virtually certain to be approved at a lower house plenary  session Tuesday because the Social Democratic Party (SDP)  supports the idea.    The LDP demanded Okuda's dismissal because the coalition  rejected its call for a change in the chairmanship. The LDP and  the SDP -- the biggest and second largest opposition parties,  respectively -- have a combined majority in the 511-member lower  chamber.    The Diet action will be taken at a time when speculation is  mounting that hata will be forced to resign with all his cabinet  members or dissolve the lower house for a snap general election  after the overdue state budget for fiscal 1994 has been cleared  through the Diet as early as June.    Hata will be given another headache next week as his  predecessor in the premiership and major coalition partner  Morihiro Hosokawa might be forced to give up the post of head of  the Japan New Party (JNP).    The JNP is on the verge of another split because more than  half its members favor disbanding the 130-member joint  parliamentary group Kaishin (Innovation) in the lower house.  The setting up of Kaishin triggered the SDP's withdrawal from  the coalition.    The group was formed mainly by Shinseito, Komeito, the JNP  and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), excluding the SDP,  after Hata was named new prime minister at the Diet in April.    Three legislators have since quit the JNP and joined new  party Sakigake [Harbinger] in a unified 18-member lower house  group.    The JNP is scheduled to call a meeting of its national  delegates Saturday next week to discuss Hosokawa's political  fate and the party's future political course. Political sources  said if Hosokawa leaves the post, the party will withdraw from  Kaishin, accelerating further realignment moves in Japan's  political community.    The LDP and the SDP this week agreed to cooperate with each  other against what they termed as the coalition's high-handed  management of state affairs -- a reference to the way coalition  main strategist Ichiro Ozawa is running the show behind the  scenes.    Their alliance could drive the Hata administration into a  tight political corner with a no-confidence motion against it,  for instance.    The SDP and Sakigake, an LDP splinter group, this week also  agreed to bolster their parliamentary cooperation by exploring  prospects for a future coalition.    In an attempt to get out of the corner, Hata will meet  separately with Yohei Kono, the LDP president, and Tomiichi  Murayama, SDP chairman -- probably Tuesday.    The LDP was in uninterrupted power for 38 years until last  August when it was toppled by the coalition of Hosokawa. The  SDP was the coalition's biggest party before its withdrawal.    In a parliamentary interpellation this week, Kono questioned  the authority of Hata's minority government and expressed his  party's readiness to take over power from it.    Kono made the statement in reaction to Hata's appeal to  opposition parties in his first policy speech to cooperate to  help his fragile government steer Japan through difficult times  on the domestic and international fronts.    Hata is also likely to meet Masayoshi Takemura, leader of  Sakigake, a small grouping which was also a Hosokawa coalition  member but which stayed out of the Hata administration.    Takemura, chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa  government,  said this week there will be a change of power after enactment  of the fiscal 1994 budget, indicating the Hata administration  will be short-lived. The Hata government is not in good shape  and is merely an administration to take charge of "certain  things" for a "certain period," Takemura told a public meeting  in front of Tokyo's Shimbashi Station on Thursday.    "A fire before the wind" is how one political commentator  described the fate of the Hata government in the weeks to come.  [passage omitted]</p>

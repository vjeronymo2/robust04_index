			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Arms sales to Serbia denied Heckler &amp; Koch, a subsidiary of the UK armaments manufacturer, Royal Ordnance, yesterday denied allegations that it had illegally supplied small arms to Serbia in contravention of arms embargoes. The allegations are the latest twist to reports that throughout the 1980s, Heckler &amp; Koch and Royal Ordnance - which bought the German concern in 1991  -were part of an international cartel illegally selling arms to a variety of countries. In developments apart from the Serbian arms sales allegation, Mr Walter Lamp, the former manager director of Heckler &amp; Koch, is to be tried in Germany on charges that Heckler &amp; Koch in conjunction with Royal Ordnance diverted arms through the UK to illegal destinations such as Nicaragua and Iraq. The mention of Iraq as a destination has lead the Scott arms-to-Iraq enquiry office in London to admit that it will be investigating allegations arising from the German trial. Meanwhile, Customs and Excise yesterday strongly denied reports that it has supplied documents backing claims that Iran may also have been a beneficiary of explosives sales channelled through the UK by Royal Ordnance. A Customs official yesterday insisted no such documents had ever been passed over to the department's investigators. The Scott enquiry also denied the report, saying all Customs documents relevant to the probe were handed over before Mr Justice Scott began his inquiry.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: American Express stays on travel acquisition trail American Express will continue to seek large acquisitions in the business travel market following the purchase of parts of the Thomas Cook travel agency business for Dollars 375m. 'There are obviously large acquisition candidates out there,' said Mr Roger Ballou, head of American Express's Travel Services group. 'We're not ruling (anyone) out. We remain committed to building the business worldwide.' Yesterday's deal brings to American Express Thomas Cook's international business travel agency operations, which had revenues of Dollars 1.1bn last year, and the combined business and leisure travel agency operations in the US, with revenues of Dollars 1.9bn. The bulk of the US revenues come from the business side, Mr Ballou said. The US business is being acquired from Mr David Paresky, who has operated it under licence from Thomas Cook. The acquisition in the US will add to American Express's leading market share there, while the non-US Thomas Cook operations give it a strong market position, particularly in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK. Although Mr Ballou would not comment on which countries American Express would look to next for acquisitions, the financial services group is widely expected to target the Far East. American Express added that it had begun to contact Thomas Cook's biggest corporate customers over the weekend and had received a positive response to the acquisition from all the companies it had spoken to. It is almost certain to lose the account of rival plastic card company MasterCard, however. Thomas Cook will retain all rights to its brand name and will invest its share of the Dollars 375m in expanding its existing travellers cheque, foreign exchange and leisure travel businesses, according to Mr Christopher Rodrigues, the company's chief executive. Mr Rodrigues refused to comment on whether Thomas Cook would re-enter the US leisure travel market through another licensing agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Ahtisaari's Group Not a Vote </F> of No Confidence in Government"]    [Text] President Martti Ahtisaari does not think that he  trespassed on the government's territory and overstepped his  powers when he appointed his own working group to discuss  employment.    Ahtisaari himself gave prominence to his working group as  his  most important message at the press conference he arranged  yesterday at Tamminiemi. Remarkably enough in his introductory  remarks he made no mention of the historic decision made an hour  earlier to grant the authority to sign the EU [European Union]  agreement.    Ahtisaari dismissed the suggestion that the appointment of  his working group can in any way be seen as a vote of no  confidence in the government. In a somewhat irritated tone he  rejected suggestions that this means that he is dissatisfied  with the government.    He said that he wanted to arrange a clear link with the  government by appointing the Labor Ministry's administrative  director as the group's general secretary.    The president did not allow himself to be drawn into any  discussion of the constitutional aspects of the matter --  something on which criticism has concentrated. Asked his view  of the criticism he simply replied: "I have not heard anyone  who is unemployed saying this."    He justified his move by saying that the reduction of  unemployment down to a tolerable level is a major national issue  which not even the president can disregard.    "It is as important as the relocation of the evacuated  population and the payment of war compensation were in their  day. Perhaps we were successful then because there was national  unity," he said.    The group includes Matti Pekkanen, the retired director of  the Central Association of the Forestry Industry, Nokia managing  director Jorma Ollila, director Jukka Pekkarinen of the  Employees' Research Institute, Maj-Len Remahl, the chairman of  the retail workers' trade union, Labor Ministry administrative  director Pertti Sorsa, and Professor Antti Tanskanen. Pekkanen  acts as the group's chairman and Sorsa as its general secretary.    According to Ahtisaari, the goal should be that before the  end of the century unemployment should fall to 200,000. "I have  assumed that temporarily at least we should dare to also adopt  exceptional, even radical measures," the president said.    The working group will present a report to Ahtisaari before  the end of September. He is unwilling to anticipate at the  present time what will happen then.    President Ahtisaari admitted that the Center Party congress  did have some effect on the fact that the authority to sign the  EU agreement was granted yesterday. "For me it did not matter  whether is happened on Friday or on Monday -- as long as it  happened in good time before the meeting (on Corfu next  weekend)," he said.    Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen has  criticized the government for not reaching a decision on the  authority to sign the agreement last week and instead putting  the decision off until after the Center Party congress.    Ahtisaari will also travel to Corfu along with the  government's representatives, and he himself will deliver  Finland's five-minute address to the meeting.    He gave no firm answer when asked whether the legislation  covering the national support package should be completed by the  Eduskunta before the EU referendum -- a condition laid down by  the Center Party.    "This depends entirely on whether people manage to give full  consideration to the laws in time. But I do not think that  anyone wants to slow them down," he said.    According to Ahtisaari, the question of whether the support  package is a precondition for joining the EU should be decided  by each party individually. However, he is also hoping for  broad national consensus on the support package. "I have not  met a single Finnish politician who would have said that there  is no need for a support package. There may be differing views  about the details -- for what length of time the package's  measures should remain in force, for example," he said.    Asked about the EU Commission's position on the support  package Ahtisaari said that the Commission's consideration of  the package has not even begun yet, but that he had not heard  that anyone had said that the package is absolutely unacceptable.    Ahtisaari said that this fall he himself will make a number  of public appearances in the context of the EU question, at a  UKK seminar on 3 September, for example. But in the field of  foreign and security policy he does not intend to express any  new ideas during the course of the fall.    "We have made our position known and it has been accepted by  the EU. If the Finnish people decides that we should join, we  will have a lot of time next year to discuss and prepare  ourselves for the intergovernmental conference in 1996. Then we  will also be able to see more clearly how thinking on these  issues is developing in Europe as a whole. There is no need to  have this discussion this fall," he said.    Ahtisaari also revealed that last week he ate lunch with his  predecessor, Mauno Koivisto. He hopes to be able to meet  Koivisto again later this summer, perhaps on the volleyball  court at [presidential summer residence] Kultaranta.    Ahtisaari traveled out to Kultaranta yesterday afternoon.</p>

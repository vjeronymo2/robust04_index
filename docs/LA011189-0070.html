Mario Biaggi was sentenced to six years in  prison and fined $222,000 for his role in the Wedtech racketeering case.  Bernard Ehrlich, 59, who was found guilty of 11 counts of racketeering,  conspiracy, extortion and bribery, remains free on bail pending appeal. He was  convicted last summer with Biaggi and three other people of turning the Wedtech  Corp., the now-defunct South Bronx military contractor, into a racketeering  enterprise for their personal gain.  </P></p>

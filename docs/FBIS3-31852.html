Upon his arrival at Skopje's Petrovac airport, van den Broek  stated that he was bringing some positive messages to Kiro  Gligorov, president of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM], and the government. On the other hand,  he added, much remained to be done, but in any case a dialogue  must be restored in the forseeable future.</p>

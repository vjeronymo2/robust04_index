			<p>BFN     [Text] A two-day all-citizens conference has ended in  Gbarnga with the issuance of a resolution giving a one-week  grace period to the State Council for the full sitting of the  Liberian National Transitional Government [LNTG] to ably observe  the disarmament process. In the eight-count resolution, the  citizens called for the setting up of a committee which would  constantly remind ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and ULIMO [United Liberation  Movement for Democracy in Liberia] to accelerate the peace  process.    According to the resolution, the all-citizens conference  fully endorsed all NPFL nominees to the LNTG and urged the  appointees to adhere to the code of conduct agreed upon by the  NPFL. The resolution also called on the NPFL to contact leaders  of all armed groups to the Liberian conflict through NPFL  representatives to the Constitutional Assembly to open dialogue  for the total and the unconditional resolution of the Liberian  civil conflict. The conference also spelled that the general  and presidential election, scheduled for December this year, be  held in accordance with the (?April 7 accord) in Monrovia.    Receiving the resolution, the leader of the NPFL, Mr.  Charles  Gankay Taylor, said he would carry out the wishes of the  Liberian people as he is their servant. He said the road to  peace has been rough and rocky and the Liberian people have  contributed immensely to the peace process. Mr. Taylor said the  Liberian people can boast that they preserved the sovereignty of  this nation.    The NPFL leader, Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, speaking during  the citizens meeting in Gbarnga over the weekend, said the NPFL  is satisfied over the resolve of intense negotiations thus far  in furtherance of the peace process and therefore formally  becomes part of the LNTG today, Monday. Mr. Taylor expressed  greats thanks and appreciation to the Almighty God for his mercy  and handiwork which have continued to sustain this nation,  despite all odds during the course of the five-year old civil  conflict.</p>

The forum was held to discuss  major programs for the Armed Forces' modernization. Chi  Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou, Central  Military Commission members, also attended the forum.    According to a briefing, 20 academicians of the CAS and the  CAE now work in medical care, public health, scientific  research, higher education, engineering, technical, and the  Armed Forces' departments. They included Qian Xuesen and Zhu  Guangya, world-famous scientists. They have won twelve  special-class state awards for scientific and technological  progress, special-class awards for scientific and technological  results in national defense, and state awards for major  scientific and technological results; 21 first- and second-class  state awards and first-class military awards for scientific and  technological progress; and 10 merit citations, first or second  class. Sixteen of them have been issued special subsidies by  the government, and three have been rated young and middle-aged  experts with outstanding contributions.    At the forum, Zhu Guangya, Wu Mengchao, Wang Chengwei, Zhang  Xiaoxiang, Chen Fangyun, Zhou Tingchong, Qian Qihu, Sun Manji,  Zhou Xingming, Cheng Kaijia, Wang Yongzhi, and other  academicians stated their views on developing science and  technology for national defense, strengthening the training of  qualified personnel in advanced science and high technology,  attaching importance to scientific and technological exchanges,  organizing personnel to tackle difficult scientific and  technological problems through coordinated efforts, and further  arousing the enthusiasm of scientists and technologists.    Liu Huaqing made a speech after listening to academicians'  opinions. On behalf of the Central Military Commission, he  extended warm congratulations to the academicians of the two  academies as well as high respects to large numbers of  scientists, technologists, and engineers who had made  outstanding contributions to the development of science and  technology for national defense and the Armed Forces'  modernization. He called for various departments to  conscientiously step up research and continue to improve their  work.    Liu Huaqing said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that  science and technology constitute a primary productive force.  The Armed Forces' modernization cannot be accomplished without  science and technology. It is a long-term, arduous task to  develop science and technology for national defense. Large  numbers of scientists, technologists, and engineers are charged  with important tasks. We should further arouse their  enthusiasm, train high-level personnel, have our eyes on the  future, and coordinate and concentrate our efforts on  continuously achieving results in modern science and technology.    Liu Huaqing hoped that scientists and technologists working  in the Armed Forces would strengthen their contacts with their  counterparts at home and abroad, do a better job in academic  exchanges, learn from others' strong points to offset their  weaknesses, and improve themselves and that they would, under  the Central Military Commission's leadership with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the core, unite as one and work in a pioneering spirit  to contribute more to the national defense's modernization.    Central Military Committee leaders had group pictures taken  with academicians of the two academies and also had supper with  them.</p>

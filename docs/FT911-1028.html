			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Italy passes law banning insider trading ITALY'S politicians have passed a landmark law banning insider trading, closing a loophole which has hindered the country's standing as a financial centre, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The new law, which will take effect as soon as it is published in the Official Gazette, has been under discussion for some years. The new rules will be enforceable through a jail sentence of up to one year and fines of up to L300m (Pounds 137,000). However, judges will have the discretion to raise the financial penalty if necessary. With the passage last December of landmark reforms for the stockbroking system, the Italian authorities have now passed two of the three most important pieces of outstanding financial market legislation. Discussion of the third element - new rules governing takeover bids - continues in parliament. Italian bankers do not expect the new insider trading regime to have any immediate effect on the Milan stock exchange. However, cynics have claimed that it might severely impede a market which has a reputation for thriving on rumour and privileged information.</p>

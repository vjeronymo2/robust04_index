			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (27): Partners hope for exports - Sweden: A look at the recovery from the Gripen crash The frightening spectacle last August of Sweden's new JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft veering crazily out of control over thousands of spectators and crashing pilotless in Stockholm's inner suburbs could hardly have come at a worse time for its manufacturers. The aeroplane that crashed was number 39.102, the first to be delivered to the Swedish Airforce after a full year's delay and heavy cost overruns in the development schedule of the fighter. With the vital first export order still unsecured, the crash appeared to be a disastrous setback for the four Swedish partners making the JAS - Saab-Scania, Volvo Flygmotor, Ericsson Radar Electronics and FFV Aerotech, part of the Celsius group. A year later, however, the consortium believes it has largely put the effects of the crash behind it. The export breakthrough has still not occured, but the JAS makers insist its credentials as a high performance, but relatively low-cost all-purpose fighter can capture a large chunk of the market for new combat aircraft over the next six years. An official investigation into the JAS crash - during which the pilot ejected safely and, miraculously, no one on the ground was hurt - concluded that it was caused by 'insufficient margins in the flight control system software' that led to 'a conflict between the pilot's commands and flight control system signals'. In other words, the aircraft did not do what the pilot told it to do. The consortium introduced a new edition of the flight control system software, and test flights were resumed last December. At the beginning of this year, a parliamentary commission set up to examine the JAS project gave it the green light to proceed. Hans Ahlinder, general manager of Saab Military Aircraft, says those within the industry in Sweden and abroad accept that the problems have been ironed out, and that there should be no significant sales fall-out from the crash. 'Everybody has some crashes during aircraft development. There is no bad will for the JAS 39,' he insists. The crash did add some SKr100m to the cost of development. But this was not a large amount in the context of the SKr60.2bn (Pounds 5m) cost of developing and producing the first batch of 30 of the JAS, of which the consortium bore almost two thirds and the rest was borne by the state. The Swedish Air Force ordered a further 110 aircraft in 1992, in a deal worth SKr18bn. The air force is being extensively restructured and slimmed to 16 squadrons, but all these are to be equipped with the JAS 39, giving the consortium the prospect of another 150 domestic orders. But for the consortium - especially Saab-Scania, easily the biggest partner  -the key to a significant payback from the JAS project lies in the export market. Here the ambitious target is to capture up to 500 overseas sales by the end of the century. Just how ambitious this is can be gauged from the consortium's own projections, which show original estimates of 3,000 worldwide combat aircraft replacements by the year 2000 falling to as low as 1,500. Mr Ahlinder believes the 500 target remains realistic. He says the JAS 39 occupies a niche which will make it attractive to air forces looking for a combination of performance and economy. The JAS 39 is designed to be fully qualified for attack, fighter and reconnaissance missions, and is intended to be cheap to run and service. It is priced below the other new-generation fighters now under development - the Eurofighter 2000 (a joint German, British, Spanish and Italian project), the French Rafale and the American F22. But, as Saab-Scania acknowledged in its latest annual report, it will also have to compete with upgraded versions of older aircraft such as the F16 and F18, the French Mirage 2000-5 and the Russian Mig29 and Su27. To strengthen the vital export push, the consortium has been in talks with British Aerospace for two years, seeking a deal to use BAe's worldwide marketing and product support network to help sell the JAS. From BAe's point of view, the JAS would provide it with a new product to fill the gap before the Eurofighter is in production. A decision on whether to proceed will be taken by the year's end, according to Mr Ahlinder. Meanwhile, similar talks with other manufacturers have also been held, he says. For Saab-Scania, these are also anxious times for its civilian aircraft division as it confronts a weak market. The company has carved out a significant share of the regional aircraft market, winning a near 40 per cent share of the world market for 20-39 seat airliners with its 35-seater Saab 340 aircraft. This year it has completed certification in the European Union and the US of its new 50-58 seater Saab 2000, and is due to make its first five deliveries of the new airplane - to Switzerland's Crossair. But last year, deliveries of the 340 fell to 28 from 49 in 1992, and its share of worldwide deliveries in its segment fell from 49 to 36 per cent. This year deliveries of both the 340 and 2000 are not expected to exceed 20  -a long way below the target of a break-even level of 50 sales a year. Saab-Scania, however, is committed to the long term in the industry, believing that when the cycle turns, regional airliners will be 'one of the most expansive segments in the aircraft industry'. It is convinced the 340 and 2000 are 'in pace with the times'.</p>

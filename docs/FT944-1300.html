			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Farm wages board granted reprieve The government yesterday bowed to pressure from farmers and their employees and said it would keep the Agricultural Wages Board, the country's last remaining statutory minimum pay body. The decision, believed to have been won by Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, in the face of opposition from more hardline ministers, was warmly welcomed by both sides of the industry. They had feared that the board, which sets minimum pay, holidays, sick pay and overtime rates for 180,000 farmworkers in England and Wales, would suffer the same fate as the wages councils which were abolished last year. Mr Waldegrave said: 'It is clear from the responses to consultation that there is wide acceptance, from both sides of the agricultural industry, of the present arrangements.' Out of 4,000 responses to the Ministry of Agriculture only 10 advocated abolition. The TGWU general union, which represents farmworkers, welcomed what it called 'an absolute victory', saying the government had decided not to risk legislation that could run into opposition from rural Conservative MPs. Mr Barrie Leathwood, national secretary of the rural and agricultural workers' section, said countryside interests had played an important part in two other government retreats this year - on privatisation of the Forestry Commission and the Post Office. Mr Leathwood said: 'Mr Waldegrave is a farmer himself and understands how the industry operates. He will have used the argument about the impact (of abolition) on rural areas and rural earnings.' Mr Gavin Strang, Labour agriculture spokesman, has campaigned strongly against abolition and described the government's decision as 'a truly welcome U-turn'. He said a report by the London School of Economics had shown that minimum wages had not reduced agricultural employment. The National Farmers' Union said the board was central to good industrial relations and to establishing an effective career structure for workers. Farmworkers, whose pay body has been under review for 18 months, have had a relatively good year. They won an above average pay rise of 4.9 per cent in the summer, and the extension of full-time workers' rights to 38,000 part-timers from next month. Mr Waldegrave said the board would continue to be kept 'under close review'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, May 9 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin, who is currently attending Western European Union [WEU]  meetings in Luxembourg, said on Monday [9 May] that Turkey's  goal was full membership in the WEU.    Foreign and defense ministers from member countries of the  WEU continued their meetings in Luxembourg on Monday.    Cetin and Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan said they welcomed  a  new `developed partnership' status given with WEU's structure  but Turkey's aim is to be a full member of the Union.    Cetin in a briefing on the meeting said the most important  improvement is the new partnership status that will be given to  Central and East European countries and Baltic countries.    He said the WEU will provide cooperation possibilities to  those countries in operational fields.    WEU's operational functions are preserving peace and  administering humanitarian aid and power.    Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria,  Romania, Lithuania, Estonia and Lithuania who have previously  signed a number of cooperation and partnership agreements with  the WEU, will obtain a special status within the organization.    Cetin said Turkey's status is specified as an `associate  member' with the Union meaning that Turkey will be officially  represented at the military secretariat which is the `planning  cell' of the WEU, and will be able to contribute to the Union's  operations.    Turkey does not have the right to vote or to veto.    The meetings will end this evening and Golhan will return to  Turkey, while Cetin will fly to Strasbourg, France to attend the  Council of Europe meetings.</p>

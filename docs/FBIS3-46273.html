			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yu Donghui (0151 2639 2547) ] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Wu  Jiahuang, director of Customs Duty Department of the Chinese  General Administration of Customs, pointed out today that  lowering import duties is required by China's efforts to  introduce a socialist market economy. In future, China's import  duties will continue to fall gradually each year until they come  to a rationally low level. Current duty deductions and remission  policies will also be adjusted accordingly starting this year.    It has been learned that China will lower import duties on  2,898 commodities this year. Last year, import duties on 3,371  commodities were lowered. These two measures have brought down  China's overall import duty rate by 15 percent.    At the moment, China's duty rate is 36.4 percent, 8.8  percent  lower than last year.    At an international economic and trade situation seminar,  co-  sponsored by the International Economic Information and  Development Center of the ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE and the publisher  of GUOJI JINGMAO BAO [INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS AND TRADE POST],  Wu Jiahuang said: In the past, when China's duty rate was  relatively high, many duty deduction and remission policies were  introduced, which contributed much to reform, opening up, and  the absorption of foreign capital.    According to statistics, by the end of last year, China had  utilized a total of $21 billion in loans from foreign  governments and international organizations. Goods and  materials imported under the many credit projects were duty  free. Last year, equipment imported duty free for wholly and  partially foreign-funded enterprises in China was worth $16.6  billion.    Wu Jiahuang pointed out: Duty deduction and remission  policies are now more and more out of tune with the situation as  China's reform and opening up moves ahead. They have caused  problems such as regions and trades competing with each other in  a negative way and have become an obstacle to fair competition.    Wu revealed that starting this year, according to the  principle of nondiscrimination and fair treatment, China will  gradually adjust its duty deduction and remission policies and a  number will be canceled.</p>

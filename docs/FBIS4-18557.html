			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 14 March Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE  PARIS reprinted the results of a SOFRES poll first published in  the new weekly newsletter SOCIAL ALTEDIA. The poll, which was  conducted between 3 and 5 March among 1,000 individuals over 18,  revealed that 69 percent of the respondents believe a serious  social crisis will occur in France within the next few months.  Some 44 percent are ready to participate in protest  demonstrations. While one-fourth of the respondents did not  believe there would be a crisis and 6 percent had no opinion,  the proportion of respondents who believed the crisis will occur  rose to 80 percent among partisans of the Left, to 86 percent  among adherents of the National Front (FN), to 53 percent among  partisans of the French Democratic Union (UDF), and to 55  percent among adherents of the Rally for the Republic (RPR).  Poll results also highlighted political cleavages, revealing  that the rate of respondents stating their willingness to  mobilize reached 59 percent among Communist Party (PC)  partisans, 27 percent among Socialist Party (PS) sympathizers,  and 36 percent and 20 percent among Greens party adherents and  Generation Ecologie partisans respectively. However, only 5  percent of UDF partisans, 8 percent of UDF adherents and 38  percent of FN sympathizers stated they would participate in  protest demonstrations.    The poll further showed that if a serious crisis occurred,  53  percent of the French would trust Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur to confront it, compared to 35 percent who would not  and 11 percent who had no opinion. More generally, 55 percent of  the respondents believed that the economic and social situation  is bad, 41 percent that it is fair, and 3 percent that it is  good.</p>

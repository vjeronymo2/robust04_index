			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Observer: Aitken fume Jonathan Aitken, the UK Treasury's chief secretary, is clearly jinxed when it comes to written correspondence. For months he has been exchanging letters with The Guardian newspaper over payment of a Paris hotel bill of his. Now he has sent a letter congratulating George Robertson, Labour's shadow Scottish secretary, on a 'bravura' Commons speech on Wednesday. Aitken's letter - which opened 'Dear George' - praised Robertson's 'stylish, amusing' contribution, and forecast rapid promotion. Unfortunately, the speech Aitken praised was made by Raymond Robertson, Tory MP for Aberdeen South. Confusion reigns: Aitken even put Monday's date on the letter, suggesting it was written before the speech.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major attempts to close 'bastards' affair MR JOHN Major yesterday sought to defuse the political row sparked by his off-the-record remarks bracketing three cabinet ministers with what he termed Euro-sceptic 'bastards' on the Conservative backbenches. But the publication in a national newspaper of the full text of his unguarded comments to a television interviewer provided fresh evidence of the prime minister's frustration with his opponents within the Conservative party. As ministers and MPs prepared for the summer parliamentary recess the opposing sides in the party's war over Europe made clear their unwillingness to call a truce. Tory opponents of Maastricht claimed strong, if quiescent, support in all ranks of the government but the strongly pro-European wing of the party called on Mr Major not to bow to the sceptics. The Positive Europe group, representing nearly 100 Conservative MPs, insisted that the government should press ahead with its policy of keeping Britain at the centre of the European debate regardless of its critics. Speaking after the Franco-British summit in London Mr Major dismissed suggestions that the Maastricht treaty had been overtaken by events. He insisted that Britain would complete ratification after what he expected to be a relatively short court challenge by Lord Rees-Mogg. But he declined to answer questions on the leak of his informal comments to a television journalist in which he explained his reluctance to sack three cabinet ministers - widely assumed to be Mr Peter Lilley, Mr Michael Portillo and Mr John Redwood - who share antipathy to the treaty with backbench sceptics. The BBC meanwhile, which was responsible for technical work at Downing Street when the leak occurred, denied any role in passing on details of the private conversation to newspapers. Downing Street reinforced the impression that the prime minister was determined to close the affair, indicating that Mr Major had not found it necessary to speak to the ministers concerned. Other cabinet colleagues said that the prime minister had been guilty of no more than 'letting off steam' after a tough week. But Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, renewed his criticism of Mr Major for appearing to allow his policy on Europe to be dictated by a minority in his cabinet. President Francois Mitterrand added to the prime minister's discomfiture by brushing aside suggestions that the central ambition of the Maastricht treaty - a single currency - had been put on the back burner. The French leader said the Paris government still expected to achieve economic and monetary union in the next few years. Leaders of the backbench rebellion over Maastricht signalled their determination to maintain the pressure on the government when it brings forward legislation in the autumn to allow an increase in Britain's contributions to Brussels.</p>

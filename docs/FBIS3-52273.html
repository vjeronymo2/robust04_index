			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Text] During the past two days, the Islamic Resistance  Movement, Hamas, has come under scathing attack by some members  of the 10-faction alliance for demanding 40 percent of the  membership in the alliance of Palestinian forces, which is the  latest approved name for this alliance.    Some observers commented on this verbal dual that was  conducted through the media by asking: Is Hamas equal to those  factions that do not have a presence inside the occupied  homeland?    Some officials in these factions leveled a number of  accusations against Hamas and said that it is seeking to  obstruct the march of the alliance and is backing out on what  was previously agreed. However, in statements to AL-DUSTUR,  Hamas official spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah said: We are going to  Damascus today, Thursday, to discuss together the organizational  formula of the alliance after agreement has been reached on the  name of this alliance; that is, the alliance of Palestinian  forces. We presented our view so that there would be guarantees  for the march of the alliance and a translation of its  resolutions on the ground and so that this march would have  credibility in representing the participating factions.    He noted: The leadership of the alliance should be more  realistic in evaluating the effective forces in the Palestinian  arena. Hamas has highlighted the daily facts of its developing  strength through its struggle, intifadah activities, as well as  professional union elections inside the occupied territories.  Our weight exceeded the quota demanded at the Palestine  National Council [PNC] in spring 1990.    Ghawshah added: Our demands for 40 percent of the alliance  membership is reasonable. We do not think we provoked any other  faction when we presented a draft demanding 40 percent of the  membership for Hamas, 40 percent for the other factions, and 20  percent for the independents. It is well known that this  alliance is a temporary leadership for the Palestinian people at  this critical stage -- a leadership that adheres to the  constants of these people, taking into consideration that the  permanent leadership is the one that will be elected by the  Palestinian people inside the occupied territories and in the  diaspora in free and honest elections.    Ghawshah went on to say: Hamas considers the local national  conferences and the comprehensive national conference as  political and media forums to announce the political program and  organizational formula to be approved. This conference does not  have any organizational authority. Therefore, it is logical to  say that whatever the 10 ten factions agree on is considered a  final agreement. Hamas understands that the purpose of the  national congress is to inform and bless the temporary  leadership.    This understanding is important because there are some  factions that are trying to make the national conferences,  including the general congress, an organizational tool that  replaces the PNC. Hamas rejects this, in part and parcel.    Asked about accusations by some factions that Hamas is  retreating, Ghawshah said: We did not change our policy,  method, or principle. We adhere to the clear Islamic principles  of the Palestinian issue. It is a united trend unlike what some  of the 10 factions claim.    He said: Our stand toward the Zionist enemy did not change.  Our rejection of the Zionist enemy is a principled rejection  since it occupies and colonizes an Islamic Arab territory.  There can be no dialogue, negotiations, or reconciliation with  this usurper. Moreover, there can be no agreement on decisions  that diminish the rights of the Palestinian people.    Ghawshah added: Hamas was surprised by some attacks that are  unjustified, unless someone wanted to impose their presence by  using loud voices instead of offering the blood of martyrs and  taking part in our people's intifadah inside the occupied  territories.    He said: These loud voices will never affect the course of  our movement. We believe that if the alliance is to become a  reality on the ground, then the other Palestinian opposition  forces, who are dear to us, must deal with the facts that are as  clear as the sun. The Islamic trend inside and outside Palestine  has become tangible and no one can ignore it except those who  want to ignore the light of the sun.    Ghawshah continued: As long as there is an objective  handling of issues, then it will be possible to reach a unifying  formula that will unite all the factions.    Asked about Hamas' stand in case the other factions reject  its demands dealing with representation, Ghawshah said: I  believe that the brothers in the factions will conduct a totally  objective and reasonable examination of our demands. We hope we  will reach an agreement on fighting the Zionist occupation,  standing against the Gaza-Jericho First conspiracy, and  reinforcing and continuing the intifadah.    He added: We sincerely and strongly hope to develop the 10  factions into a temporary leadership for the Palestinian people  so that action would be more effective and so that the people's  sympathy with us would be clearer. If the formula of the  alliance of Palestinian forces does not succeed, then we shall  continue with that formula until we arrive at circumstances that  will allow for more sincere unification.    As for what is being said about contacts between Hamas and  Israel during the truce which ended last Sunday, Ghawshah said:  There are trends that are fishing in murky waters and  exploiting the ability of the Zionist enemy and some Arab  parties, represented at the Knesset, that have access to Shaykh  Ahmad Yasin or other Hamas detainees, and report inaccurate  statements by Shaykh Yasin that are not scrutinized.    He added: Contacts between some Israeli officials and Hamas  detainees cannot in anyway be be termed as dialogue. Dialogue  is only held between free people and not between the prisoner  and the prison warden or between one who has the power and one  who is detained. Hamas will never hold any dialogue with the  Zionists.    He continued: Through the deputy chief of staff and Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres, the Zionist enemy rejected the truce  proposed by Hamas. Peres accused Hamas of seeking Israeli  capitulation. Hence, Hamas has a broad field in which to  continue confronting the soldiers and settlers of the Zionist  occupation.</p>

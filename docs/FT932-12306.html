			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Trade News: Seoul breached resin trade rules SOUTH Korea breached fair trade rules in an anti-dumping investigation of imports of polyacetal resins from the US and Japan, according to the report of an independent disputes panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. At a meeting of Gatt's anti-dumping committee, which ended yesterday South Korea said it would implement the panel's recommendations to conform with the world trade body's anti-dumping code. The code covers procedures for identifying and levying duties on dumped imports - goods sold below cost or below prices in the home market. The anti-dumping investigation by the Korean trade commission led to the imposition of duties in 1991 on US and Japanese exports of polyacetal resins, a plastic widely used in the manufacture of audio and video tapes, car parts and electronic components. Dumping margins were assessed at between 20 and 108 per cent. The findings of another panel report, on US anti-dumping duties levied on Norwegian salmon, were rejected by Norway after the panel cleared the US of most of the alleged code violations. Washington said it was prepared to implement the panel findings, which urged changes in US methods of calculating dumping margins.</p>

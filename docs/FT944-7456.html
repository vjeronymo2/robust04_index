			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Disposals bolster Commerzbank Commerzbank, the German bank, has suffered a 27 per cent drop in group operating profits, to DM660m (Dollars 425m), for the first 10 months of this year. It blamed weakness in world bond markets. However, it ended up with a higher pre-tax figure after including proceeds from sales of shareholdings. The bank also said it was buying 51 per cent of Hypothekenbank in Essen, which specialises in municipal and mortgage loans. The bank has total assets of DM22bn - which will bring the Commerzbank total up to more than DM310bn - and made net profits of DM34m last year. It gave no price. The fall in Commerzbank's operating profits mainly reflects the decline in bond and securities markets, with earnings on financial dealings on its own account falling 88 per cent to DM56m from DM475m. Losses and write-offs on securities trading were partly offset by profits on foreign exchange and derivatives transactions. Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chairman, said the bank still kept a critical eye on domestic loan risks. However, it was able to reduce loan-loss provisions by 3 per cent to DM1.3bn. In spite of the economic recovery, many companies still found business conditions difficult. Commerzbank, the first of Germany's big commercial banks to issue 10-month figures, said its pre-tax profit was 43 per cent higher at DM1.5bn. Profits on the sale of its 15 per cent stake in Karstadt, the department store group, and of shares in the DBV insurance group were mainly responsible for the increase. Mr Kohlhaussen hinted that shareholders would receive a higher pay-out to mark next year's 125th anniversary. He said the DM12 dividend would be 'at least' maintained, with an anniversary bonus to be considered after the year-end. Partial operating profits, which exclude own-account trading, rose by 14 per cent. Contributing strongly was a 10 per cent rise in net interest income to DM4.3bn. Increased lending competition pushed the average interest margin down to 1.79 per cent from 1.85 per cent, but this has improved since mid-year. The bank said it was opening a direct banking subsidiary, ComDirect Bank, next year. It will offer standard securities, deposit and loan products by telephone, fax or mail.</p>

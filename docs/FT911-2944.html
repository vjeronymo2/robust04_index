			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Observer: Timely The Bank of Italy is hosting today the first of what are intended to be biennial lectures of international renown. The Paolo Baffi Lecture on Money and Finance has been created to com- emorate one of Italy's most illustrious central bank governors. Baffi's death last year recalled, among other things, his extraordinary courage in standing up to politicians who at one time appeared ready to consign him to prison because of the Bank's prying into the affairs of Banco Ambrosiano. Known as the priest's bank because of its links with the Vatican, Ambrosiano was subsequently plunged into bankruptcy by the dubious activities of its chairman, Roberto Calvi. Today's inaugural will be given by Professor Amartya Sen who will lecture on ethics in economy and finance. It's a timely topic with the financial power of the mafia growing internationally, and Italy still lacking a proper system of law to regulate market behaviour.</p>

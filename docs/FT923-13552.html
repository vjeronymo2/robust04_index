			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Ukraianian reformist deputy PM sacked UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk on Saturday fired a deputy prime minister who was considered the leading economic reformer in the government, AP-DJ reports from Kiev. The removal of Volodymyr Lanovoy was expected to cause concern among western financial organisations. He was the architect of the reform program approved this year by the International Monetary Fund. Mr Lanovoy on Tuesday had threatened to resign in protest at what he called the government's 'economic inertia'. But he withdrew the threat the next day, saying he would remain on the job to fight conservative forces who were resisting his market-oriented reforms. Mr Kravchuk said Mr Lanovoy would be replaced by the president's representative in Odessa, Mr Valentin Simonenko, a former Communist official who has contributed to an economic boom in the Black Sea port. Mr Kravchuk, in an Saturday interview on Ukrainian television, said he had told Mr Lanovoy he could no longer tolerate his 'duplicity'. Mr Lanovoy, 39, is a member of the opposition movement, New Ukraine.</p>

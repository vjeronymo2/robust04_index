			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiu Qi: "More Sectors Will Open to </F> Foreign Investors"]    [Text] More sectors will be open for foreign capital in  the future to boost overseas investment in China, a senior  foreign trade official said in Beijing yesterday.    China will admit overseas investors to such sectors as real  estate, commercial retail sales, finance, insurance, and cargo  and transportation agency services and consultancies.    But such moves must be made on the basis of mutual benefit,  said Jiao Sufen, director of the foreign investment division  under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co operation  (Moftec).    Jiao said that foreign-funded projects must be in tone with  China's economic development. They may be guided into such  sectors as machinery, electronics, heavy chemicals, new  materials, automobiles and automation equipment.    She called for keen efforts to buoy export-oriented foreign-  funded firms, transform aged enterprises, upgrade technology and  equipment, and further improve quality to boost the  competitiveness of China's products on the world market.    Jiao signalled a halt to overseas investment in ordinary  labour- intensive, simple processing and assembly projects as  well as those involving products that are difficult to export.    Instead, Jiao encouraged overseas investors to develop the  energy, transport, raw materials and agricultural sectors.    The official vowed to further improve China's investment  climate and provide better services to foreign investors.    China encourages trans-national companies to finance the  country's infrastructure and high-tech industries, Jiao said,  adding that they could either invest in a specific project or  get involved by transferring and purchasing State assets, stocks  and securities.    Optimistic about the future of overseas investment, Jiao  said  China now enjoys political and social stability, a fast-growing  economy, and a long-term blueprint for economic development.    Since the country opened to the outside world in the late  l970s, China has approved more than 174,000 foreign-funded  ventures with contractual investment totalling $221.3 billion  and real investment hitting $60 billion.    Last year alone, the Chinese Government ratified more than  83,200 foreign-funded enterprises involving $110.5 billion in  contractual volume and $25.8 billion in real overseas investment.</p>

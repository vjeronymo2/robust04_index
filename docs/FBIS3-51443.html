			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Gustavo Rodriguez Vargas, a member of the Foreign  Relations Advisory Commission, said today [11 January] that the  OAS secretary generalship cannot be attained by ceding Colombian  sovereignty. Rodriguez Vargas said that there is a need for a  clearer policy regarding cases such as the presence of U.S.  Marines in Juanchaco, on the Atlantic coast, and the incident  involving the incursion by Venezuelan troops in Saravena,  Arauca. In the case of Venezuela, Colombia has been too  complaisant regarding the defense of our sovereignty. Some  believe that President Cesar Gaviria is seeking the neighboring  country's vote for the post of OAS secretary general, and have  gone as far as to publish cartoons such as these.    [Begin Rodriguez recording] I hope President Gaviria does  become the OAS secretary general, but it should not be at the  expense of our national sovereignty. [end recording]    According to Gustavo Rodriguez, six of the seven meetings  the  commission has held have addressed the Venezuelan issue.  Colombia first stepped back fearing Carlos Andres Perez' fall  from power. Then it desisted in favor of the election process in  Venezuela, and finally because of pressure from the Venezuelan  press. SEMANA magazine reported on Gaviria's recent efforts.  It says he spent his vacation on the telephone trying to  recruit votes for the secretary generalship. He was after the  votes of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Ecuador, and, of course,  Venezuela, which has Miguel Angel Burelli running for that same  post. According to the magazine, Gaviria even contacted  Burelli. Experts on international policy believe Venezuela will  support Costa Rica, and its candidate Bernd Neihaus, instead of  Colombia. They would benefit more by supporting a Caribbean  candidate than a Colombian. Experts also say that President  Gaviria must choose between his aspirations at the OAS and  defending national sovereignty.</p>

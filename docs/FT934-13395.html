The company expects a SKr625m profit this year, compared with an earlier prediction that profits would at least match 1992's SKr545m (Dollars 69m) surplus. The group raised profits after financial items by 23 per cent in the first eight months to SKr425m from SKr345m even though sales eased to SKr7.2bn from SKr7.7bn.</p>

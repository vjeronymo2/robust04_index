			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / British Gas chief receives 75% pay rise Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, has received a 75 per cent pay rise, taking his basic annual salary to Pounds 475,000. The Pounds 205,000 increase, which has been backdated to the beginning of this year, makes Mr Brown's basic pay among the highest of any UK public company director. Other executive directors of British Gas have also received rises of up to 50 per cent following a review by the company's non-executive directors. The news has provoked an angry reaction from trade unions and politicians. Mr Alastair Darling, the Labour party's City spokesman, said that the increases were 'sheer stupidity and stand to be condemned without reservation'. Mr David Stirzaker, a senior official of Unison, Britain's biggest trade union, described the salary increases as 'scandalous at a time when British Gas is shedding more than 25,000 jobs'. He said that Unison members who worked at British Gas had received rises of 'less than 3 per cent'. Last week the government committed itself to introducing big changes to the UK gas market by allowing full competition in the domestic market. Mr Donald Macgregor, a senior official of the GMB union, said: 'Such rises give all the wrong signals to employees at a time when there is a very difficult task ahead restructuring the industry.' The GMB will be the lead union in pay negotiations with British Gas due to start soon. British Gas said yesterday that the review by the company's remuneration committee, which includes Lord Walker, the former energy secretary, concluded that its directors were underpaid in comparison with other British-based international companies. The company added: 'We are expanding internationally and need to recruit, retain and motivate top calibre international management.' It also said that from next year the company's annual report and accounts would contain far greater disclosure of each director's salary package, including details of perks such as company cars. The directors' annual bonus scheme has been abolished and no payments will be made this year. The executive directors' share option scheme is also to be replaced with a scheme 'designed to reward directors for increasing shareholder value over the long term'. However, exact details of the new scheme are yet to be finalised and will only be revealed to shareholders next year. The second highest paid director remains Mr Richard Giordano, British Gas's non-executive chairman, who joined the company in January on a basic salary of Pounds 450,000. Three other executive directors - Mr Roy Gardner, Mr Philip Rogerson and Mr Howard Dalton - are all now on basic salaries of Pounds 285,000 with Mr Rogerson having had the largest increase at 50 per cent, or Pounds 95,000, due to increased responsibilities. Two other executives have also received increases. Mr Norman Blacker's salary increased by Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 250,000 and Mr Russell Herbert's pay rose from Pounds 136,000 to Pounds 170,000.

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Duran leads in Ecuador poll ECUADOR holds the second round of its presidential elections tomorrow with opinion polls suggesting a former cabinet minister, Mr Sixto Duran, is the leading contender. The polls put Mr Duran, who led in the first round of the election in May, ahead by at least 10 percentage points over Mr Jaime Nebot of the Social Christian Party. Both candidates are rightwingers and would move to a more market-oriented economy, following much of the rest of Latin America, and further away from the present government's democratic socialism.</p>

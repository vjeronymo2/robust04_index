			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPHEAVAL IN ROMANIA;  </P> <P> CAPITAL IS COMBAT ZONE AS LOYALISTS BATTLE REBEL FORCES;  </P> <P> ROMANIA: TANKS, HELICOPTERS AND MACHINE GUNS JOIN THE BUDAPEST FIGHTING.  DEAFENING SOUNDS OF WAR ROCKED THE CITY.  </P> <P> The pockmarked buildings of Bucharest are scrawled with slogans like "Hitler,  Stalin, Ceausescu" and "Down With Ceausescu and His Clan."  </P> <P> Salvos of bullets ripped the sides of buildings Saturday as units of the secret  police still loyal to deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu fought running battles  through the streets and squared off with regular army soldiers who have gone  over to the rebels.  </P> <P> "This is civil war," said a man in the throng of thousands gathered in a  central Bucharest square.  </P> <P> Brown-uniformed soldiers huddled in doorways, engaged in machine-gun duels with  secret police snipers on rooftops as crowds ran amid the bullets or crouched  behind cars.  </P> <P> In the morning, jets flew low over the city, adding to the deafening sounds of  combat that have rocked the capital since Friday night.  </P> <P> A Reuters correspondent saw trucks roar past with a cargo of coffins -- bound  for hospitals to bear away the corpses. Hundreds have been killed in the  capital. Doctors at one emergency clinic said they had at least 60 bodies.  </P> <P> The area around the central Inter-Continental Hotel was closed off by civilian  volunteers as the security police, the Securitate, fought for their survival.  They shot into the crowd from rooftops or from helicopters as rebel ranks moved  into the square in front of the hotel.  </P> <P> Trucks and cars were being used as barricades and young civilians armed only  with clubs checked cars to catch suspected Securitate members.  </P> <P> Despite the confusion and fear, unarmed civilians, many of them wearing red  armbands, risked the gunfire to help the army overcome the pro-Ceausescu  forces.  </P> <P> Some climbed on tanks to direct the soldiers against the security forces, or  even followed them into combat.  </P> <P> Most of the soldiers looked very young -- between 18 and 20. Their uniforms for  the most part looked old and shabby.  </P> <P> Flames leaped from the presidential palace in Republic Square as tanks ringed  the building and fired on Ceausescu's forces inside.  </P> <P> "There they are, on the eighth floor, shoot!" one onlooker called to the  soldiers. A group of more than 50 people stood behind the ring of tanks,  watching in silence.  </P> <P> The heaviest fighting was around the strategic radio and television buildings  in the city center, held by pro-democratic forces.  </P> <P> Hundreds watched as a Securitate deserter in a green windbreaker jacket  crouched behind a tree with an automatic rifle, his former comrades as targets.  </P> <P> Announcers on Bucharest Radio alternated between calm assurance that the  National Salvation Front was in control of the situation and urgent calls for  the population to help defend the building.  </P> <P> Bucharest television, freed from the yoke of reporting Ceausescu's personality  cult, showed pictures from the heat of the onslaught around the hotel and  nearby university.  </P> <P> As dusk fell, thousands sat with tired pro-democracy troops on the pavements or  clambered over tanks to offer food and then retreat to a cautious distance.  </P> <P> "I used to despise my own nation," said a Romanian, surveying the scene with  tears in his eyes. "But now I am proud. . . . "  </P> <P> In the square between the Central Committee building and the smoking  presidential palace, with forlorn gaping holes for windows, small groups still  shouted "Ceausescu! Murderer!"  </P> <P> Civilians picked their way through piles of shattered glass and broken plaster,  bearing the blue, red and yellow national flag with the Communist symbol cut  from the center.  </P> <P> They had discovered a warren of tunnels linking the two centers under the  square and aimed to flush the Securitate, bunkered down in them for the night,  out of their refuge.  </P> <P> On the balcony of the Central Committee building, where Ceausescu made his most  self-aggrandizing speeches during his 24-year reign, ordinary Romanians now  have their say, telling of the appalling conditions they have endured.  </P> <P> "For years, somebody else spoke for us without consulting us," one speaker  shouted above the gunfire. "Now we want our own brains to do the work. We are  now free, and we want to be just like people of the rest of Europe."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE ROMANIA STORY  </P> <P> The Fighting  </P> <P> Fierce street battles raged in Bucharest as forces loyal to ousted President  Nicolae Ceausescu continued to hold out. In Timisoara, where the uprising began  Friday, 100 elite Securitate troops loyal to Ceausescu reportedly parachuted  into the area to reinforce comrades still holding out.  </P> <P> Casualties  </P> <P> Estimates of total deaths during three days of fighting in Bucharest ranged to  1,000 or more. In Timisoara, the official body count had reached 4,082 and,  with searchers still digging up mass graves, the count there is expected to top  12,000.  </P> <P> Ceausescu  </P> <P> The provisional government announced on television that Ceausescu, his wife,  Elena, and brother, Ilie, had been captured. Ceausescu's son, Nicu, was  captured Friday. It gave no details of the Ceausescus' capture but said they  would be put on trial.  </P> <P> The Reaction  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged to provide "immediate and  effective humanitarian aid" to Romania. But the Kremlin turned down a request  for military assistance.  </P> <P> The United States called on all Romanians to lay down their arms and back the  new Romanian provisional government, saying it "has pledged a transition from  dictatorship to democracy."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, 5 January (ITAR-TASS) -- A statement by  Vyacheslav Kostikov, press secretary of the Russian president,  was issued here today. It says:    In connection with Lithuania's official request to join  NATO,  I am authorized to state the following.    A desire to join international organizations is an  acknowledged right of independent states. Democratic Russia  respects such rights.    At the same time, the haste with which some countries, among  them the Lithuanian Republic, are striving for membership in the  military-political alliance cannot but put us on our guard.  Regrettably, this tendency toward a bloc mentality is  manifesting itself at a time when the world's major powers are  earnestly seeking instruments for dismantling the inheritance of  the "cold war" and are declaring their desire to build relations  on the basis of principles of partnership in the name of peace.    Democratic Russia, with its new military doctrine and  following the principles of interstate relations, exclude any  kind of aggressive displays on her part in foreign policy. In  this connection, the motives and arguments of countries aspiring  to membership of NATO are unconvincing.    The president of Russia is worried at the tendency toward  the  expansion of the bloc system. The encouragement of such a  tendency would contradict declared intentions to build mutual  relations on principles of trust, partnership, and equilibrium.    The president is worried that expanding NATO with new  members  from the countries in direct proximity to Russia's borders will  provoke a negative reaction in Russian public opinion, promote  the development of undesirable attitudes in civilian and  military circles, and, ultimately, could lead to  military-political destabilization in a region which is of key  importance for the destiny of the world.    President Boris Yeltsin expects that the leaders of NATO  member-countries and the NATO leadership will dispel the  impression of ambiguity in their position on the issue, which  has a bearing both on the destiny of the world and the national  interests of Russia.</p>

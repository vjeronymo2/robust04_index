			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Quebec separatist passions cooling HOPES are growing in Canada that Quebec can settle its differences with the rest of the country without breaking away. None of the emotive issues which led to the collapse of the Meech Lake accord, which would have enshrined in the constitution Quebec's claim to be 'a distinct society', has yet been resolved. But recent events point towards a greater willingness to compromise - in both French- and English-speaking Canada - than has been evident for the past year. The improved climate was reflected this week in conciliatory remarks by Quebec's premier, Mr Robert Bourassa, who said he might delay a referendum on sovereignty, scheduled to take place by October 1992, if the rest of the country appeared close to making a binding offer on restructuring the present federal system. His remarks come amid evidence that the drive for a sovereign Quebec is losing some of its steam. One recent poll showed that 48 per cent of Quebec voters support sovereignty, down from 64 per cent last November. Organisers of next month's St-Jean-Baptiste Day parade, marking Quebec's national holiday, have complained that they have raised only CDollars 2,010 (Pounds 1,015) in donations this year, against a target of CDollars 500,000. The dampened enthusiasm for independence appears to result partly from the recession and warnings from business leaders about the economic cost of a fragmented country. The federal government will outline further details of its strategy for the forthcoming constitutional negotiations at the opening of a new session of parliament next Monday. Meanwhile, the 'national unity' initiatives launched by Ottawa since last autumn appear to be bearing some fruit. English-speaking Canadians, especially in the west, still oppose a special deal for Quebec along the lines of the defunct Meech Lake accord. But they are being reassured that the next round of negotiations will also deal with at least some of their concerns, including the composition of the non-elected Senate, the much-maligned policy of official bilingualism, and aboriginal Canadians' political and economic demands. And despite his party's dismal showing in public opinion polls, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is being widely applauded for his choice of former external affairs minister Joe Clark to take charge of the constitutional affairs portfolio. Mr Clark, who has the advantage of being a bilingual Albertan untarred by the Meech Lake episode, has said bluntly that it will be impossible to meet Quebec's October 1992 deadline. Ultimately, though, he may be unable to satisfy everyone. Despite the government's determination to avoid a national referendum on the issue, that may be the only way forward.</p>

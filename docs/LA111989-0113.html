			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON'T BE FOOLED BY MARKET MUMBO JUMBO  </P> <P> Who says newspaper editors don't have a sense of humor! The lead article of  your business section asks rhetorically, "Are Stocks for Gamblers Only?" (Oct.  22).  </P> <P> Your apologist gives a convoluted answer, saying that for the last 62 years  stock investments yielded a higher total return than all other investments.  This argument ignores a basic consideration stated in every mutual fund's  portfolio: Past performance is never a guarantee of future success.  </P> <P> Bill Sing supports his argument with phony statistics used by stockbrokers to  lure customers: "low annual average volatility" of the market. This is a  deceptive concept bordering on fraud and is a completely meaningless figure.  </P> <P> Then on your third page, guest columnist Martin Mayer really answers the  question about gamblers: The market is manipulated by a pack of speculators,  swindlers, arbitragers and other assorted crooks, while the SEC idly watches as  the laws are broken left and right.  </P> <P> Mayer's article answers Sing's question more realistically: Unless the SEC  cleans out the den of thieves on Wall Street, no statistical mumbo jumbo will  lure back the individual investors.  </P> <P> A. D. BORONKAY  </P> <P> SANTA ANA  </P></p>

While attending a cocktail party hosted by the Chinese  General Commercial Chamber to mark the spring festival, Zhu  Yucheng indicated to reporters that this behavior by the British  side would injure the overall interests of Hong Kong residents  and result in burdening Hong Kong's economy, so Hong Kong  residents must heighten their vigilance against it.    Zhu Yucheng said that the crux to the financial arrangements  for the new airport was that the British side all along had  wanted to spend money to the maximum, and to leave the debts  incurred to the future special administrative region [SAR]  government. The Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the  New Airport and Related Issues already has stipulated explicitly  that the debts incurred by the 10 core projects in building the  new airport should not exceed HK$5 billion, but the British side  all along has tried its best to break through this ceiling, and  the financial plans it set out always aimed at leaving the  financial burden to the SAR government. The fourth set of  financial plans put forward by the British side continued to  show that it wanted to shift HK$23 billion in debts onto the SAR  government.    Zhu Yucheng indicated that the British Hong Kong Government  regarded the loans made by Hong Kong Airport Administration and  MTR Company, which were spent in building the new airport, as  non-governmental debts, but that was not convincing because both  the aforesaid organizations are fully owned by the British Hong  Kong Government, which is the sole shareholder in those two  organizations. Naturally, the Hong Kong Government must bear  responsibility for its debts. In actual fact, with the transfer  of government in 1997, the tremendous sum of debts of those two  organizations inevitably will result in pressure on Hong Kong's  finances, which will be shifted onto the future SAR government.  Beyond a doubt, it is none other than Hong Kong's taxpayers who  will bear the burden in the final analysis.    Zhu Yucheng added that the British side had used up all its  tricks in making arrangements for use of the reclaimed land in  the Chek Lap Kok project, in an attempt to profit by  disturbances, while seizing the power to approve 100 hectares of  land exclusively. Regarding the issue of selling plots of land  along the railway, likewise, the British side excluded them from  the annual plan for land approval, and did its best to sell land  for cash.</p>

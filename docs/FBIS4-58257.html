			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Jordanian Papers" column by Samih al-Ma'ayitah: "The </F> Little High Commissioner"]    [Text] A few years ago, we used to write or talk about the  PLO leadership with caution and care. We were afraid that our  writing could be interpreted as promoting narrow regionalism and  striking at Jordan's national unity. However, the road chosen  by the PLO leadership, especially after it signed the Oslo  accord with the Zionist enemy and its agreeing to an unequal  alliance with the Zionist entity -- an alliance of service,  exploitation, and relinquishment of most of the Palestinian  territory and rights in return for a meager authority -- has  stripped this leadership of its claim to be representing the  Palestinian people. This leadership is now no more than a party  that controls Palestinian decisonmaking. This is an established  fact despite the recognition of this leadership by the majority  of nations, because what is important is the extent of  recognition and respect extended to this leadership by the  Palestinian people, who adhere to their cause and rights.    I wrote this introduction to point to the high commissioner  spirit displayed by some PLO leaders in their reaction to some  local Jordanian developments and their provocative interference  in Jordanian issues. Observe how Hakam Bal'awi a few weeks ago  conveyed protests from his president against mosque preachers,  the Jordanian press, and the activity of some people who oppose  a Middle East peace settlement, such as the Hamas Movement and  Hani al-Hasan. Mr. Bal'awi was not satisfied with direct  protest. The PLO leadership has had recourse to the U.S.  Administration and its ally, the Zionist enemy, to put pressure  on Jordan. Thus, we heard Zionist threats against Jordan to  stop the media and political activity of Hamas on its territory.    His excellency the Palestinian ambassador in Amman has also  been doing the same thing for quite a while. He has interfered  with some newspapers, threatened some writers, and tried to buy  some others. All these practices are done in public. The most  recent example of this is his protest against some of the  writings of Khalid Mahadin about some PLO stands. This prompted  the prime minister to order censoring the writings of Mahadin or  preventing his writing.    The PLO leadership does not like to see Jordan lead a  democratic life. It is unhappy with the freedom we are  experiencing. We thank God that we are not among the subjects  of Mr. 'Arafat and his democratic leadership. If this were the  case, gallows would be erected and harsh sentences would be  passed against whoever opens his mouth. We feel sorry for our  brothers who will live in the Gaza-Jericho protectorate under  the democracy of the PLO leadership.    The PLO leadership should stop interfering in Jordan's  affairs and manifesting the spirit of the high commissioner in  the way it deals with the Jordanian arena. This leadership does  this because it feels that it is supported by the U.S.  Administration and the Zionist enemy. This leadership has no  right to set a ceiling to our democracy. We are more concerned  about observing laws, regulations, and the Constitution and we  will not exchange this ceiling for the whims and wishes of this  leadership.    I reassert that we are talking here about a powerful faction  of the PLO that is now linked strategically with the Zionist  enemy and is conducting itself according to the enemy's desires  and terms at the expense of the rights of the Palestinian people  first and the rights and sovereignty of some Arab countries.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Cummins ahead at Dollars 54.6m for first term Cummins Engine Company, the US manufacturer of heavy-duty diesel engines for trucks, school buses, and power generation plants recorded a strong improve-ment in first-quarter net earnings. The group lifted net income to Dollars 54.6m, or Dollars 1.35 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.1bn, up from Dollars 41.1m or Dollars 1.12 a share, on sales of Dollars 1bn in last year's first quarter. 'We are pleased to show continued improvement in our results as we benefit from good business conditions in most of the markets we serve,' said Mr James Henderson, Cummins' president. 'We expect second-quarter performance to be strong, with results above those achieved in the first quarter.' Sales of engines for heavy duty trucks in the North American market were particularly strong in the quarter, leading to increased production schedules at Cummins' Jamestown, New York plant. Cummins said sales to industrial markets also increased significantly over the 1993 fourth quarter, particularly in the agricultural and con-struction segments of its business. Sales of power generation equipment declined from the fourth quarter, and sales of mid-size engines also weakened. This was the result of some business being pulled from the first quarter into the fourth to avoid price increases associated with emission changes in engines or equipment price increases.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Arts: Twinkle of a fresh talent - Concert IN THE Queen Elizabeth Hall on Wednesday, a concert by George Benjamin and his young Premiere Ensemble included a remarkably appealing discovery: Unsuk Chin, a 32-year-old Korean composer from Seoul. Benjamin came upon her Seven Fairytales just a few months ago, while serving on a Paris competition-jury. Taking her inspiration from mini-tales secreted in Alice Through the Looking Glass and Michael Ende's The Endless Story, Unsuk Chin has fractured those texts - hence her subtitle, 'Akrostichon-Wortspiel': perhaps you need to be Korean to believe that Western words sung backwards will retain their 'symbolic meaning' - and has set them for soprano and a tingling little ensemble. The results betoken a clever, original ear. Not so original as to conceal debts to her teacher Ligeti and to Gyorgy Kurtag; but overall the bright fantasy, economy and pungency of this sequence ring too consistently true to be anyone's but her own. Though the seven settings share a family resemblance (a taste for whispered, spidery intricacies, for piercing pedal-notes in extreme registers, for sudden plainness after busy instrumental textures), each has its special ear-catching character. Genuinely fabulous, they twinkle and tantalise. We must hear more of her. We had a lot of Benjamin, in his expert and various roles as conductor, pianist and composer; in his own programme-notes, too, with some discreet polemic about Webern's restricted, 'weightless' style (which 'proved so thrilling to the ears and minds' of 1950s composers, 'although that time is now well past': Benjamin is an 1980s composer) and conversely about the 'egotistic excesses of romanticism, still resonant in our own decade'. He conducted Webern's gentle 12-note Symphony op. 21 quite simply, without special pointing, though as pianist in the accompanying trio for Ravel's three Chansons madecasses he underlined the most telling strokes with a fellow-professional's relish. After her poised Fairytales, the soprano Penelope Walmsley-Clark sang the mould-breaking Ravel triptych so beautifully, and fixed the distinct persona of each song with such assured elegance, as to disarm my settled prejudice against non-mezzos in this music. Her clear, cultivated French almost compensated for the omission of the texts from the programme-book. Gerard Grisey's microtonal experiments for a pair of horns, Accords perdus, generated some intriguing aural cross-talk, but little more. In Varese's Octandre Benjamin concentrated on hyper-subtle detail, at some cost to its raw energy. His own At First Light, which had a rapturous welcome in 1982, sounded more prettily episodic and less gripping than one remembered it from London Sinfonietta performances. The Premiere Ensemble, excellent though it is, has not risen yet to the Sinfonietta's level of forceful, single-minded conviction.</p>

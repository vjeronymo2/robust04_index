This is the biggest street demonstration since general election campaigning started three weeks ago. 'The biggest enemy is corruption not inflation,' leaders of the Indonesian Democratic party (PDI) told a big crowd in Jakarta. They said police reported that 3m PDI supporters had gone into the streets, dwarfing Saturday's estimated 1m people campaigning for the ruling Golkar party.</p>

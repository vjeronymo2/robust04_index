			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / MPs vote against treaty referendum MPs early this morning voted decisively against a British referendum on the Maastricht treaty, marking a further victory for the government over Tory and Labour Euro-sceptics. The rejection of a referendum by a majority of 239 votes came as the Commons was expected today to complete its detailed line-by-line consideration of the Maastricht bill, which it began last December. Although a comfortable win had been expected, the vote is an important milestone in the government's battle to secure ratification of the treaty and will come as a welcome boost to its morale. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, argued that to allow Britain's final verdict on Maastricht to be delivered in a referendum and not by parliament would amount to 'a shirking of the responsibilities' MPs were given in the general election last April. Labour's front bench made common cause with the government by voting against a referendum but opposition came from Euro-sceptics in both leading parties. The Liberal Democrats were split, with about half voting for a referendum. The result, delivered just after 2am, left referendum supporters pinning their hopes on the House of Lords where a debate on the subject  - with the possibility of a less clear-cut outcome - is anticipated in June or July. Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, and Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, are expected to spearhead a campaign in favour of a referendum when the bill reaches the upper house after its third Commons reading later this summer. Lord Healey, former Labour chancellor, this week served warning that the Lords vote could present a significant obstacle to the government's plans when he said its recent Commons manoeuvrings had made 'a lot of people like myself' more inclined to vote for a referendum. The government's next concern will be to shepherd the bill through its Commons report stage, which it hopes to complete before the second Danish referendum on Maastricht on May 18. Labour still hopes to use this stage to corner the government into embracing the treaty's social chapter. If the Danes vote Yes, a third Commons reading would be expected to follow before the end of May. Cross-party unity thwarts referendum move, Page 12</p>

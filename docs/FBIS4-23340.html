			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>   [Text] Pretoria June 2 SAPA -- Rightwing demands for new  amnesty provisions for political offenders apparently failed in  Pretoria on Thursday [2 June]. Conservative Party [CP] leader  Ferdie Hartzenberg headed a delegation to see Justice Minister  Dullah Omar to discuss a relaxation of constitutional provisions  for criminal offenders motivated by political gain.    Dr Hartzenberg said before his meeting he would raise the  issue of long-time CP member Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus,  who are on death row for the murder of SA [South African]  Communist Party leader Chris Hani. He disclosed that his  request for the extension of the December 6 cut-off date for  amnesty application was to accommodate right-wingers who  unleashed a terror bombing campaign before the April elections.    Dr Hartzenberg came away from the meeting saying the CP had  made its proposals and the minister had undertaken to consider  them. In a statement later, delegation member and the CP's  justice spokesman Jurg Prinsloo outlined the CP's proposals. He  said the minister had undertaken to reply to them after internal  consultations.    The CP asked the minister to give "temporary immunity" to  convicted prisoners, to those awaiting trial, to those who had  been identified as suspects, and to those who had not yet been  identified but whose acts were being investigated.    Mr Prinsloo said the minister had not closed any doors.  However, he said the minister had issued a statement shortly  after the meeting. He had a copy of the statement which  repeated the minister's use of the December 6 cut-off date.    Mr Omar said in considering the criteria for political  offences, one should not assume that these would be as broad as  to enable Derby-Lewis and Walus to be accommodated, and he  apparently said a "truth commission" would be established.    The minister's spokesman was not available for comment.    Mr Prinsloo said the CP would give its reply on Friday to  the  minister's rejection of its proposals.</p>

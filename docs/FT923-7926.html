			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Issues suffer as Moody's downgrades Italy's rating AFTER months of poor performance, Italian government bonds and Eurobonds were dealt a further blow yesterday, when Moody's downgraded Italy's foreign debt rating from Aa1 to Aa3. Italian bond prices have followed a downward spiral since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union in June, which re-awakened worries about Italy's ability to tackle economic difficulties, possibly without the constraints of tough economic targets. Since the Danish vote, the 10-year Italian bond future on Liffe has fallen from 98.29 to 92.45 at yesterday's close. The Liffe contract shed a further half point on news of the downgrade. Italy's Eurobonds, once the most actively traded in the market, have been suffering from widening spreads and declining liquidity. Italy's 20-year Ecu Eurobonds, which prior to the Danish referendum traded at a spread of 25 basis points above the French 20-year Ecu OAT, are quoted at a spread of 80 points, having widened a further five basis points yesterday. In the dollar sector, Italy's 8 3/4 per cent Eurobonds due 2001 widened from 43 basis points over the new 10-year US Treasury yield to 48 basis points yesterday. Dealers noted that any further downgrade, taking Italy's rating to single-A, would have a dramatic effect. Many investors cannot hold bonds rated lower than single-A. 'A lot of central banks hold Italian Eurobonds. Even if they don't start lightening up, they certainly will not be buying any paper,' a dealer said. One government bond trader pointed out that Spain and Finland both have better ratings than Italy. 'This is very important for a country like Italy which claims to be the fifth largest economy in the world - we expect that investors will now be more attracted to Spain than Italy.' Italy has not tapped the international bond market in over a year, relying instead on its domestic bond market. Its Dollars 21bn of foreign debt had been placed under review for possible downgrade in June - following the Danish referendum - having lost its prized triple-A rating a year earlier. The debt has an implied rating of double-A plus from Standard &amp; Poor's, the other leading rating agency. The latest downgrade reflects the prospects for only a gradual reversal in the weakened state of public finances, and political uncertainty over European unification, as well as the 'fluidity' of domestic politics. However, Moody's described the steps taken by the new government, for example, to lower the budget deficit and stabilise the debt/gross domestic product ratio, as positive. As a result of the downgrade, the foreign debt ratings of Enel, Cariplo, Istito Mobiliare Italiano, Credito Italiano and Mote dei Paschi di Siena have also been lowered to Aa3.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIFT FOR THE KID WHO HAS EVERYTHING: A CREDIT CARD  </P> <P> A bank dedicated to young customers is offering what it says is the first  credit card for children.  </P> <P> Young Americans Bank introduced the credit cards at a party marking the  institution's second anniversary.  </P> <P> Like most credit cards, these have restrictions. Youngsters must talk a parent  or other adult into co-signing and guaranteeing payment on their accounts.  </P> <P> Although cardholders must be at least 12 years old and cannot exceed a $100  credit limit, the bank will consider increasing credit limits and lowering age  requirements for particularly credit-worthy children, said Leanne Cadman, who  heads the bank's loan department.  </P> <P> Otherwise, the MasterCards, issued by United Bank of Denver, are just like  mom's and dad's. Monthly statements will tell kids they can make a minimum  monthly payment or pay off the whole balance. Interest will accrue on the  balance at the annual rate of 18.8%, Cadman said.  </P> <P> Young Americans Bank, a full-service, state-chartered and federally insured  bank, already offers checking accounts for children 12 or older. In its two  years of service, it has signed up 10,000 depositors.  </P> <P> "We tell them they need to use credit cards with care and not to abuse them,"  Cadman said. "And of course, we impress on them that whatever you charge you  have to pay back."  </P> <P> The bank was founded two years ago by Denver cable-TV executive Bill Daniels.  </P></p>

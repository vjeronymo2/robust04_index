			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Most companies unprepared for HIV Most multinational companies will find themselves inadequately prepared if an employee is diagnosed HIV positive, according to a Harvard study presented in Yokohama yesterday at the end of the 10th international conference on Aids. The survey received responses from 27 large companies with headquarters in 15 countries. It concluded that while nearly all had briefed their managers on the issue, and two thirds had an employee programme for Aids prevention, the application of policies was largely left to the initiative of local managers. Training of these managers was not systematic, and big western companies appeared to be motivated as much by fear of potential litigation - whether on the part of their staff, suppliers or customers - as by any overriding concern for the well-being of their workforce. Some 30 per cent thought they would suffer direct costs through increased medical or insurance expenses. The findings were announced in the final hours of a conference which has served largely to emphasise the long haul ahead to any cure or vaccine. Among the few breakthroughs unveiled were the role of the AZT treatment produced by Wellcome of the UK in reducing the risk of a pregnant woman transmitting HIV before or while giving birth to her child, and the success of a three-drug cocktail in halting the virus - but so far only in the test-tube. The event - which this week brought together some 10,000 scientists, pharmaceutical executives, health workers and Aids activists - is the last annual conference of its kind. The next is not due to take place until July 1996 in Vancouver. It was, however, the first such session to have been held in Asia, which epidemiologists expect will soon have the highest rate of new infections. The Japanese government drew criticism yesterday from campaigning groups for an immigration policy which would exclude visitors known to be HIV positive, unless they arrived this week as a delegate. But it also gained plaudits for using the conference to heighten Aids awareness among its own population. Only a handful of Japanese are openly HIV positive, and 97 per cent of the 620 Tokyo listed companies which responded to a survey backed by the labour ministry said they had never encountered any problem related to the virus. But the study, conducted among others by representatives of Sanwa Bank and the Nippon Express transport company, reported that 37 per cent had taken some action to counter the spread of the disease. Of those, more than nine out of 10 said they had provided preventative education, and over half added that this was also aimed at reducing discrimination or prejudice.</p>

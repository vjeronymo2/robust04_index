			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 1--Mr. P.R. Kumaramangalam, Union  Minister of State for Science and Technology as well as  Parliamentary Affairs, has been "ejected" from the Cabinet by  the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, on the eve of the winter  session of Parliament, commencing tomorrow, apparently for  criticising him (Mr. Rao) for the party's poll debacle in Uttar  Pradesh.    The formalities in this respect have not been completed, as  the President, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, is away. But the  acceptance of the resignation forwarded by the Prime Minister is  a mere technicality.    The President is expected back tomorrow. The recommendation  to drop Mr. Kumaramangalam from office has been sent to him.    The Minister himself was not available for comment, but  sources close to him said that he had not written to the Prime  Minister offering to quit. This tended to confirm the report  that the Minister's resignation had been sought by Mr. Rao.    Mr. Kumaramangalam is the third Minister from Tamil Nadu to  go out of the Union Council of Ministers, the earlier two being  Mr. K. Ramamurthy and Mr. P. Chidambaram. Interestingly, Mr.  Kumaramangalam had offered to quit the Government when the  Cauvery water issue hotted [as printed] up between his State and  Karnataka.    Clearly, Mr. Kumaramangalam's stinging letter to Mr. Rao on  the party's election debacle in U.P. and Delhi, in which the  Prime Minister was criticised for his handling of the party  affairs, and the virtual dismissal of the entire Congress  Working Committee (CWC) sought, has cost him his job.    Mr. Rao moved against the Minister on the eve of a meeting  of  the CWC which is likely to go into the kind of issues  highlighted by Mr. Kumaramangalam. It is to be seen if this has  a sobering effect at the CWC.    Mr. Kumaramangalam, in his letter, had also said that he  would be obliged to take "further steps" if his suggestion for  the resignation of the entire CWC was not accepted. This was  widely interpreted as an offer of resignation. Subsequently,  however, the Minister clarified that his was not a case of  revolt, and that he was not criticising the Government, but the  conduct of party affairs.    During his tenure under the leadership of Mr. Rao, the  outgoing Minister was engaged in some important Government  activity, including the attempted resolution of the Ayodhya  crisis before the demolition of the disputed structure.    However, sources said that Mr. Kumaramangalam had developed  differences with the thrust of the Government's economic  policies and had lately been voicing his concern in official  quarters.</p>

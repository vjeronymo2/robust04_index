He appeared before Congress as a  witness rather than defendant in a case investigating possible  links between the MIR [Leftist Revolutionary Movement] and drug  trafficking. This is what the Constituent Commission must  determine, and this is why the former president of the Republic  was summoned to testify.    The following is Amalia Pando's report:    [Begin recording] Pando: The  information that former President Jaime Paz Zamora today gave  the Constituent Commission confirms his close friendship with  Isaac Chavarria, who has been arrested under charges of drug  trafficking. Paz Zamora, however, repeatedly denied having been  aware or even suspected that his friend was linked to drug  trafficking.    Paz: As I have already stated, it started off as a  political relationship. He wanted to work, from the political  viewpoint, with the MIR and for the candidacy of Jaime Paz  Zamora. But this relationship turned into a friendship in view  of his moving background, which he himself disclosed, and the  work and personal contacts he maintained. This is why if you  were to ask me how many times I met with Isaac Chavarria, I  would not be able to answer you. It is the same as if I were to  ask you about any of your friends, and you started telling him  how many times you saw him, where you saw him, how many times  you met with him, etc. It should be pointed out that this  friendship grew stronger, especially in 1987, and a little less  in 1988. But we hardly saw each other in 1989, and almost never  during my four years in the presidency of the Republic. This  relationship, through me, spread to my family. Well, not all my  family, but to my two sisters. I want to point out that this  relationship never involved any type of crime. I also want to  point out that Mr. Chavarria was always willing to work, to  undertake projects. He always showed a great civic and  patriotic spirit. I think he longed for his years in the Army.  [passage omitted]    If my great friend Isaac Chavarria now has the misfortune of  being involved in drug trafficking, I deeply regret it. But  this fact by no means can stain the spotless relationship I  maintained with him in the past.    Pando: When the so-called narco-photo [showing Paz  Zamora together with Chavarria] was published, Chavarria was  identified as a drug trafficker, but not even on that occasion  did Paz Zamora suspect anything. He said that the reason was  that on that occasion Chavarria disclosed his address, but that  the Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] did not visit him.    He also referred to the position of his social defense  secretary at that time, Alderete.    Paz: The interesting thing is that on 11 June, I  think, the media carried Alderete's answer to Deputy Gonzalez  Quintanilla. As a result of the anonymous photograph attached  to a letter sent to Congress, Alderete, the social defense  secretary under Paz Estenssoro's government, promised  Quintanilla, Congress, and the Bolivian people that in a week's  time he would have a list of Isaac Chavarria's crimes, which he  would send to all FELCN offices throughout the country. The  country is still waiting for this information, which he had said  would be ready in one week's time.    Pando: MIR Deputy Luis Vasquez asked Paz Zamora  whether the MIR leaders had ever warned him about the risks his  friendship with Chavarria entailed.    Paz: I want to reiterate what I have already said.  I never suspected that Isaac Chavarria was involved in any  crime. What fellow partisan Susana Seleme [Paz Zamora's private  secretary] disclosed here before Congress does not belong to a  specific meeting in Santa Cruz. I was never told: Fellow  partisan Jaime Paz, come, sit down, we want to talk to you about  this problem. What I did notice was that some [MIR] members did  not like him. That is a fact. But MIR leader Guillermo  Capobianco and other high-ranking members, for example, didn't  have this problem.    Pando: In 1990 Chavarria's home in La Paz was  raided. Jaime Paz Zamora heard about this, and ordered his  private secretary to find out about it at the FELCN.    Paz: It was not a precise order. What I did do  was to ask her to find out what had happened because, as I have  already stated, the private secretary never gave instructions;  in this case, she only asked for information on what had  happened to determine whether there was anything illegal about  the charges. That is what happened. Susana Seleme, as [name  indistinct] mentioned and also reminded me, informed me that she  had phoned (General Anez) who told her it was a routine  operation among the hundreds and hundreds of routine operations  the FELCN carries out. I think they call them warning  operations. And that was the end of that. After receiving that  information I forgot the issue but now, after years, I realize  through some documents mentioned here in Congress that the  operation was not directed against Isaac Chavarria.    Unidentified legislator: Didn't this information  about the FELCN operation against Chavarria's home, linked to a  recent event, raise any suspicions? We are talking about  something that happened in the year 1989 or 1990, when you said  that the charges that Chavarria was involved in drug trafficking  were outrageous. Didn't the information on the FELCN operation  against Chavarria's home cause you to suspect anything?    Paz: The truth is that I accepted the explanation  I was given, because in my capacity as president I had a  thousand and one other things to think about, and forgot the  issue. As I have already stated, my contacts with Chavarria had  become very sporadic. At that time it had been almost a year  since I had last seen him.    Pando: After Chavarria's home in Irpavi was raided  by the FELCN, Paz Zamora met with Chavarria at Edith Paz  Zamora's home. He was asked whether on that occasion Chavarria  ever mentioned the FELCN raid on his home in Irpavi.    Paz: I do not remember. I am afraid I do not  remember. Aside from our talks on the railroad ties--because he  explained the problem, and I told him I would learn more about  it before I decided what should be done--the meeting lasted  longer than ever because we discussed politics. Chavarria is  very interested in politics.    Pando: Paz Zamora definitely did not find out  before, during, or after his government that Chavarria was a  drug trafficker. He also said that neither social defense under  secretary (Gonzalo Torricos) nor the FELCN had warned him that  Chavarria was involved in illegal activities. At this point  Deputy Juan del Granado read 13 press reports from PRESENCIA,  HOY, and other newspapers published in 1991, accusing Chavarria  of drug trafficking.    Del Granado: ...PRESENCIA reports that Isaac  Chavarria, I mean Isaac Etcheverria, heads a list of the nine  most sought after drug traffickers by Bolivian courts and  anti-drug agents the United States had stationed in Bolivia.  Didn't you read this information?    Paz: No. I didn't. Well, there was another drug  trafficker called Etcheverria who I believe was taken to the  United States, but I think it was before then. I think he was  the one who produced the evidence against [name indistinct].  But, well, in any case it does not refer to that Etcheverria.  I did not learn about this, but what I wonder is, if it is  true, why I was not informed directly? The FELCN is  semi-autonomous. Why was there so much noise and no action?  Alderete announced something in 1988, but never did anything  about it. I think that worse than the fact that I did not read  that press report, is that if the information was true nothing  was done about it.    Pando: But there were 13, and not only one, press  reports published around the same time mentioning Isaac  Etcheverria and Isaac Chavarria as two of the most important  Bolivian drug traffickers. Why didn't the FELCN arrest  Chavarria during Paz Zamora's government? Paz Zamora himself  asked this question which, some way or another, the Constituent  Commission must answer. The second important aspect of Paz  Zamora's statements to the commission were his charges,  sometimes in a direct and others in an indirect manner, against  the U.S. Embassy and the FELCN of having orchestrated this plot  to destroy the MIR, his family, and him. [passage omitted]    Paz: I want to fully reiterate what I said in my  message to the Bolivian people on 26 March. I reiterate my  intention to withdraw from politics. I have realized there is a  plan, through me, to damage the country, its image. There is a  plan to harm the Republic, to harm values for which all  Bolivians have worked hard, such as the values of democracy,  national coexistence, national unity. I have also realized that  there is not only a plan to harm our country, through me, but  also my party.    Pando: On this occasion Paz Zamora tried to change  from playing defendant to plaintiff, and for this he railed  against the FELCN, which is not very popular and on many  occasions has been repudiated by the people. We will have to  await the Constituent Commission's final report to know whether  Jaime Paz' charges against dubious FELCN procedures will clear  all that has been said about the connection he, his family, and  the MIR reportedly maintained with drug trafficker Isaac  Chavarria.

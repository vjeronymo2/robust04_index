			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Feb 20 SAPA--The Afrikaner Volksfront's  [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] official spokesman on Sunday  denied any knowledge of allegations that right wing plans for  starting a civil war were well-advanced, and that hostilities  could begin when Parliament reopened. AVF spokesman Stephan  Maninger also rejected as ridiculous a secret document,  partially reproduced in the Afrikaans Sunday newspaper RAPPORT,  which detailed the treatment of "prisoners of war".    RAPPORT said impeccable sources averred that about 50 young  retired South African Defence Force soldiers, mainly brigadiers,  colonels and commandants, had been hatching war plans for the  past few weeks. "V-day," [volkstaat day] when the action would  commence, could be when Parliament re-opened next month, the  report said.    The AVF's leadership and interim government were unaware of  these plans, the report said. Said Mr Maninger on Sunday: "The  AVF has made it clear in the past that it would seek every  possible peaceful alternative before considering any military  action whatsoever.    "We are of the opinion that if there is such a document its  origins are within those organisations who intend to discredit  and demonise the AVF," Mr Maninger said.    A government intelligence source said on Sunday the  developments, if true, would be in line with information of a  schism between the militant commando factions of the AVF and its  leadership which was still pursuing a political solution by  means of talks with government and the African National  Congress. The source said the militant faction mistrusted some  AVF leaders, suspecting them of being government agents.    AVF leader Gen Constand Viljoen said on Saturday certain  intelligence services were making attempts to cause division  among right wing Afrikaners, SABC [South African Broadcasting  Corporation] radio news reported earlier. Gen Viljoen said  Afrikaners were vulnerable to infiltration, and it was a  technique of intelligence services to infiltrate such ranks and  sow division.    He later told SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]  radio news staff that it was possible the government's  intelligence service was involved.    Gen Viljoen would not give examples of the alleged  infiltration, but said certain things were happening which  caused him to draw this conclusion.</p>

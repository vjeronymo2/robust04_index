			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: British Airways The market was caught on the hop yesterday by BA's fivefold increase in third quarter profits. The company's figures, to be fair, are always difficult to predict, but in retrospect it was perhaps naive to assume that passenger yields would not show much improvement compared with a period depressed by the build-up to war. That said, BA's management has skilfully avoided an expensive dogfight on fares over the North Atlantic and has once again kept its promise to cut costs. Yesterday's 10 per cent jump in the shares was therefore a well-earned reward. But with American Airlines and United Airlines certain to be back with a vengeance this summer and European liberalisation likely to take a few more faltering steps forward at the end of the year, competition continues to hot up. That is why progress - or the lack of it - in BA's negotiations with KLM is likely to be the most important influence on the share price in the coming months. The prospects for a successful tie-up at this stage remain as obscure as ever. If noises coming from Amsterdam are to be believed, the principle of a joint company has now been accepted, but the sticking point could yet be price. The market value of BA is three times higher than KLM's, but the Dutch will no doubt be bidding for more than 25 per cent of the joint action. KLM's declared profits, after all, may be subdued, but its recent yield figures were superior to, and its prospective cash flow multiple lower than, BA's. Lord King has a fight on his hands.</p>

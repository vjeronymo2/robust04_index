			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: ALL WE WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS A PARKING SPACE . . .;  </P> <P> MALL TREKKERS CAN BE NAUGHTY, OR NICE  </P> <P> OK, Thanksgiving is just a bad case of left-over indigestion. Now 'tis the  season to be jolly, right?  </P> <P> Get real. Today is D-Day at a local mall near you, the busiest shopping day of  the year. It's time to pack up the kids and your nerve and head out on the  highway lookin' for consumer adventure -- or maybe just a good parking spot  near Nordies.  </P> <P> You and hordes of holiday shoppers will be vying for a finite number of parking  spaces. It'll be war out there in the department store parking lot, a battle  ranking up with Antietam and Dunkirk. Don't fret. You can conquer the long and  winding road that leads to the department store door.  </P> <P> "Everyone should be prepared for people who will be discourteous in the parking  lot or out on the road," advised Officer Linda Burrus of the Highway Patrol's  Santa Ana office. "It's not worth playing chicken to see who gets that parking  spot first."  </P> <P> Burrus recommends driving slowly in parking lots during the crowded shopping  rush. The crunch of traffic and pedestrians makes the season ripe for fender  benders or worse.  </P> <P> Lt. Jim Winder of the Brea Police Department said people often concentrate so  much on getting a parking space that they forget the regular dangers of  driving. He's seen motorists make unsafe turns or other errant maneuvers while  they hunted for spaces.  </P> <P> "Their attention is spread between a number of things," he said. "On a routine  shopping day, they know they're going to find a space and so they focus more on  their driving."  </P> <P> The sensible ones among us know we should stay home during these first frenetic  days of the holiday shopping rush. But, hey, this is Southern California! How  could we?  </P> <P> So out we'll go, packing a wallet fat with credit cards and an ankle-length  list of toys for children of all ages. As if such consummate consumerism isn't  stressful enough, there is the chore of just getting safely inside the store.  </P> <P> There are the holiday vultures circling the lot in their cars. There are the  dingbats, folks who make a ritual of gouging your Beamer's shiny sheet metal  with their clunker car doors. There are autos queued up for that single spot  opening up a quarter mile down the row. There are the tigers in their '72  Toyotas, ready to pounce.  </P> <P> Faced with all that, motorists should concentrate on keeping their stress level  in check, experts advise. Losing a parking spot or waiting for some klutz to  clear out of the way is no reason to blow a piston. Hum a Christmas carol. Let  sugarplums dance in your head. Do anything to avoid rage.  </P> <P> "The key thing is to realize its not going to be just another normal day at the  mall," said Andrew Lesser, a physician specializing in stress-management and  author of "Drive With Less Stress," a handbook of tips to keep your Angst in  check behind the wheel. "People should tune in to the radio and tune out on the  traffic. And they should go into the holiday shopping experience not expecting  to get a parking spot at the front. Then it's easier to accept having to walk a  bit."  </P> <P> Lesser said a cardinal rule is to never fight over a parking spot. It's just  not worth it.  </P> <P> "Simply because you see one doesn't mean your name has been automatically  written on the curb stop," he noted. "People take possession of a parking spot  in their minds and are unwilling to give up something that they believe is  theirs, but it's not."  </P> <P> Managers of the malls share many of the same tips.  </P> <P> "You're going to be walking a lot anyway, so when you see a spot, take it,"  Huntington Center Marketing Director Pat Rogers advises. She also urges  politeness. "Try to be courteous, we're all in this together."  </P> <P> Rogers has seen car passengers jump from vehicles and run to open spaces and  then stand and wave off would-be parkers to hold the space for their friends.  "That to me is kind of cheating, but people do it," she said.  </P> <P> Susie Plummer, Fashion Island's assistant marketing manager, said that the time  people spend looking for an up-front spot amazes her. "When I moved to  California, I couldn't believe people spent so long looking for a spot," said  Plummer, who generally takes whatever space is open and walks.  </P> <P> Out on the freeway, traffic can get a bit heavier, but the only mall where cars  regularly back up down the off-ramp during the holiday shopping season is South  Coast Plaza, Burrus said.  </P> <P> As a result, motorists should be careful along San Diego Freeway at the Bristol  Street exit. Burrus suggests coming in the "back way" off the Costa Mesa  Freeway along MacArthur Boulevard.  </P> <P> Other tips from traffic experts and mall managers include:  </P> <P> * Arrive before noon or shop in the early evening, when many people eat dinner.  Avoid arriving between noon and 4 p.m. Most shoppers will be ensconced in their  favorite stores, so parking lot turnover will be slow.  </P> <P> * Use side streets to avoid major thoroughfares, often congested with motorists  more concerned with getting to the mall than avoiding an accident. Also, every  mall has side street entrances that will give you quicker access to parking  lots. Seek these out.  </P> <P> * When you see a space, take it, rather than cruise around looking for a better  one. By the time you get a prime space, you'd probably could have already been  in the mall shopping. Some malls offer an escort service back to your car if  you park in remote areas, so safety need not be a concern. Ask store managers  or at mall information booths about whether your mall offers this service.  </P> <P> * Plan your shopping. Work your way around the mall, if possible, and back to  your car. Handicapped and elderly shoppers should check with mall security to  see if assistance with packages is available.  </P> <P> Getting THERE: The ins and outs of all the other malls. B2  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ways to Avoid the Crowd  </P> <P> GETTING THERE:  </P> <P> Arrive before noon or early evening, when many people eat dinner. Use side  streets rather than congested highways for quicker access to mall parking lots.  Use parking structures, usually linked to mall by bridges.  </P> <P> TIPS:  </P> <P> Know what you're looking for, and work your way around the mall, back to your  car. Ask if mall offers services such as babysitting, parking lot escorts or  package assistance for elderly or handicapped shoppers.  </P> <P> FASHION ISLAND  </P> <P> OPEN: 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> AVOID: Entering from Coast Hwy.  </P> <P> USE: MacArthur Blvd. or Jamboree Rd.  </P> <P> PARKING: Good on upper levels of structure near Broadway and behind structure.

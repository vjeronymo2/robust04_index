			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has sent a letter  to President Konstandinos Karamanlis. Government Spokesman  Evangelos Venizelos confirmed that the letter has been sent, but  he is not yet aware of its contents.    The letter reportedly refers to issues of the Workers Party  of Kurdistan. Referring to Turkish claims that Kurdish  guerrillas are being trained in Greece, the spokesman explicitly  reiterated that such claims are slanderous and unfounded. He  added that the Greek position is well-known, and mentioned the  case of the Kurd who was arrested in Turkey and, after being  tortured, supposedly confessed about the training of Kurds in  Greece.</p>

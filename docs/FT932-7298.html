			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / 'Failures' admitted by ECGD THE EXPORT Credits Guarantee Department, the government-owned export credit agency, yesterday admitted that it had failed to observe Treasury rules, failed to report fraud and failed to keep records in a transaction in which it lost Pounds 41.4m. The loss was disclosed in the ECGD's most recent accounts, which reveal the department's involvement with a Mexican oil rig operator which left it the owner of two rigs. Details of the ECGD's handling of the affair emerged yesterday when Mr Brian Willott, head of the department since January 1992, gave evidence to the Commons public accounts committee. He said the affair was a 'built-in disaster'. Admitting to the 'very large number of serious management failures' listed by Mr Robert Sheldon, committee chairman, Mr Willott insisted that the ECGD had taken steps to tighten its claims and underwriting procedures: 'The lessons of this case are branded rather deep in the collective conscience of the ECGD.' The affair dated back to 1980, when the ECGD insured loans totalling Dollars 53.5m for the Mexican company Perforaciones Maritimas del Golfo (Permago) to buy two oil rigs built by the Marathon yards in Scotland. In 1982, almost immediately after delivery, drilling contracts for the rigs were cancelled and the company defaulted on loan repay-ments. Over the next 10 years, the ECGD opted to refinance the company rather than press for sale of the rigs; discovered two frauds linked with Permago, which it did not report to the government's Fraud Investigation Branch; failed to keep records of meetings about the case; and provided overdraft facilities in contravention of Treasury rules. It made the refinancing decision without seeking advice on prospective oil price movements - critical to the likely profitability of the rigs. It failed to have departmental lawyers present in negotiations with Permago. The case was not referred above the ECGD's claims department until late stages. Mr Willott did not even pay 'serious attention' to the case until July 1992, six months after assuming office, he told the committee. In February this year the ECGD repossessed the rigs, but not before a lack of main-tenance resulted in repair costs rising from Dollars 500,000 to Dollars 5m. It is now trying to sell the rigs, and hopes to recoup between Pounds 12m and Pounds 20m - leaving taxpayers to carry a net loss of Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m. Mr Willott admitted that for most of the period concerned, the ECGD had failed to consult with other government departments, since 'it tended to regard itself as having the sole expertise in this area. We are now less reluctant to consult others'. He said no one in the department had been punished, but said all concerned had retired.</p>

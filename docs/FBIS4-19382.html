			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Turkey has announced that in the existing sensitive  atmosphere in the region, it is important that all Balkan  countries refrain from actions that will further strain existing  tensions.    In reply to a question, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat  Ataman said that reports on a raid organized on 10 April against  a military training camp on Albanian territory near the Greek  border cause regret and concern for the future of the region.  Expressing understanding for the concern felt by Albania in the  face of provocations and threats, Ataman remarked that countries  that plan to pressure their neighbors through the actions of  terrorist groups should realize that they cannot be left out of  the negative developments that stem from such provocations.</p>

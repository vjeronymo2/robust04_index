			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 9 May (NA) -- A Coast Guard cutter has  intercepted and captured two trawlers flying foreign flags. The  trawlers were fishing illegally in the Argentine exclusive  economic zone, without the appropriate authorization.    The Coast Guard cutter "Mantilla" yesterday discovered a  foreign trawler fishing near the port of Quequen. Upon boarding  the trawler, Coast Guard personnel confirmed the existence of 79  metric tons of squid, hake, and codfish in the trawler's hold  and processing line.    Shortly thereafter, the same Coast Guard cutter discovered  another trawler that had already caught 146 metric tons of squid  and rays.    Both trawlers were captured for violating the National  Fishing Law, and were escorted to the port of Quequen where the  appropriate proceedings were conducted.</p>

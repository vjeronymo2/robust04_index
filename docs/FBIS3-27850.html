			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- The following were details  of the political reform compromise package signed early Saturday  [29 January] between the ruling coalition of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party.  The compromise makes it likely the Diet will now approve the  government's reform bills during its Saturday session.  <H5>  (House of Representatives) </H5>   The lower house would have 500 seats, compared with 511 at  present. This would include 300 from single-seat electoral  districts and 200 chosen by proportional representation.    The coalition originally proposed a combination of 274  single- seat constituencies and 226 chosen by proportional  representation.  <H5>  (Voting) </H5>   Voters would cast two ballots, one for a single-seat  representative and another for a party on the proportional list  divided into 11 regional blocs.    The coalition originally proposed candidates for the  proportional representation seats be chosen from a single  nationwide list.  <H5>  (Party Fund-Raising) </H5>   A politician may designate a single fund-raising  organization  to which donations can be paid. Companies may contribute up to  500,000 yen a year to an organization. The organizations would  be banned after five years.    The coalition originally proposed an immediate ban on  company  donations to politicians' support groups.  <H5>  (Political Parties) </H5>   A party must poll at least 2 percent of the proportional  representation vote to qualify to win a seat.    Under existing regulations, the figure is 3 percent.</p>

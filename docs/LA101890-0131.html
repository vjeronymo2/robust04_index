			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES: WARM WATER HELPS KEEP THE FISHING HOT  </P> <P> October's ocean sportfishing has been the best in nearly a decade.  </P> <P> The bluefin tuna run at the outer banks continues, with a good showing of fish  weighing 50 pounds or more.  </P> <P> Anglers fishing on the three-quarter and half-day boats have been returning  from horseshoe kelp with impressive catches of barracuda to eight pounds and  yellowtail 15 pounds and up.  </P> <P> Redondo Sportfishing's Dan Armstrong reports the bonito moved from rocky point  to deeper water and the fleet has been catching some fish heavier than 10  pounds.  </P> <P> Department of Fish and Game biologists attribute the excellent fishing to  unusually warm water temperatures.  </P> <P> At the request of dedicated rock cod anglers, South Bay landings will soon be  scheduling deep water trips.  </P> <P> The Outerlimits from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing returned from Cortez Bank over  the weekend with a good catch of tuna and yellowtail.  </P> <P> Mike Tagm of Gardena caught a 42-pound bluefin tuna and a 28-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> San Pedro fishermen Frank Ibarra and Michael Dorbah landed 41 and 42-pound  bluefin tuna.  </P> <P> L.A. Harbor's Pacifica worked Tanner Bank and returned Monday with 26 bluefin  tuna.  </P> <P> John Dicemann of Long Beach won the jackpot on the two-day trip with a  77-pound, 3-ounce bluefin tuna.  </P> <P> Won Kim of Redondo Beach hooked a big calico bass fishing aboard the Matt Walsh  at horseshoe kelp.  </P> <P> Kim was using a small sardine bait and catching legal size calico bass and  barracuda.  </P> <P> He made a cast from the stern of the boat where bass were boiling and he set  the hook on what turned out to be a trophy-size calico bass.  </P> <P> He was reeling the fish toward the surface, but as soon as the bass sighted the  boat it peeled line and went down to the kelp. Captain Don McIntyer, standing  by with a net, urged Kim to reel in slowly. McIntyer said if the fish was not  lost, he would like to donate it alive to the Cabrillo Marine Museum.  </P> <P> Kim agreed and after 15 minutes, the bass came out of the kelp and was reeled  in. The hook was carefully removed and the fish was placed in a bait tank.  </P> <P> The museum's tank truck met the Matt Walsh and transported the 9-pound, 3-ounce  calico bass to the museum. Larry Fukuhara, museum director, said the fish is  being placed in a display tank and is one of the largest calicoes they have had  for viewing.  </P> <P> Diver Stephan Alford of Malibu was declared the winner of the 14th annual  Hermosa Beach dive on the opening day of the lobster season. Alford brought up  an 8 1/2-pound lobster from 30 feet.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches -- Tom Santos of Hawthorne, fishing at Cortez Bank aboard the  Blackjack, caught the whopper of the week, a bluefin tuna that weighed 50  pounds.  </P> <P> Howard Cabe of Marina del Rey returned from an eight-day trip aboard the  American Angler off Cedros Island and caught a 43-pound yellowfin tuna.  </P> <P> Jane Brown of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Spitfire in Santa Monica  Bay, caught a 42-pound white sea bass.  </P> <P> Joe Awesome of Torrance, fishing at Cortez Bank aboard the First String, caught  a 38-pound bluefin tuna.  </P> <P> Hiram Levy, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at horseshoe kelp, hooked a  yellowtail and the Palos Verdes fisherman bounced his 23-pounder to the deck as  a shark was about to nab it.  </P> <P> Fish Reports -- White sea bass have put in an appearance at Santa Monica Bay  along with yellowtail.

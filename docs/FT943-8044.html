			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Moscow still holds strings The authorities in Moscow may be struggling to exert control over Russia's oil industry. But they seem to be doing better at influencing events in the energy-rich former Soviet republics bordering the Caspian Sea. Two years ago western oilmen began offering 'sweeteners' to officials in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan to allow western companies into the oil industry. The thinking at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union, according to one western oil consultant in Alma-Ata, capital of Kazakhstan, was that because the region was just opening up, western companies 'could define the rules'. It now appears that Moscow - not the other republics' governments - will make the rules on the development of the region's vast energy reserves. Over the past year, Russia has stressed it not only wants to retain control of the region's main export pipelines, which pass over Russian soil. It also wants a say in the development of big oil and gas fields discovered during the Soviet era in the region. Some observers believe its goal is to re-exert control over the energy resources of the former Soviet Union. The clearest expression of this intention was in a letter sent this year by the Russian foreign ministry to the British embassy in Moscow. It said that, because there had been no allocation of rights to resources under the Caspian Sea, 'all issues of activities, including resource development, have to be resolved with the participation of all Caspian countries'. That included Russia. Russian attempts to control the region's oil development began with a demand that Lukoil, one of Russia's new integrated oil companies, should be given a 10 per cent share in the British Petroleum-led project to develop the Azeri and Chirag fields in Azerbaijan. Western oil executives in Alma-Ata report that Moscow also wants equity stakes in Kazakh projects, including the proposed multi-billion-pound development of the Karachaganak gas fields by British Gas and Agip of Italy. Many western companies say that Russian demands to take part in the projects have not come as a surprise. As one senior executive involved in the Azeri deal says: 'We always knew Russians would have to be involved, as we need them to get the oil out.' Mr Thane Gustaffson, who monitors the former Soviet Union for the consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates, believes Russia's demands are not 'sinister'. Instead, they are a sign that the old relationships which governed the integrated structure of the former Soviet oil industry are beginning to reassert themselves. But western oil companies wonder how far Russia's demands will go. One executive notes that the obstacle holding up development on oil fields in the region 'is not between the oil companies and the countries (of the Caspian). It is between Russia and the southern republics and their status as truly independent states'. The fear of western companies is that Russia's attempts to exert its political authority will jeopardise the deals they have struck with the individual republics. 'The issue then is whether Russia will still want foreigners involved. They may simply say 'we still want your money and technology', or they may want that kind of deal torn up as well,' one western oil company executive says. For now, such fears seem exaggerated. BP recently expressed confidence that the negotiations over the Azerbaijan deal will soon be completed satisfactorily. But for western oil companies, making in-roads in the region is proving as difficult as in Russia. Report by Robert Corzine, Steve LeVine and John Lloyd</p>

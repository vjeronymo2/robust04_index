			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Action over tax loophole LEGISLATION will prevent the transfer of an insurance business to or from the UK branch of an overseas life assurance company being subject to capital gains tax. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday that an error in the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 - a consolidation measure - would have the effect of denying relief from capital gains tax conferred by the 1970 Taxes Act. Mr Dorrell said a provision to be included in next year's Finance Bill would rectify the error and apply to transfers of insurance business which took place after July 16 1992.</p>

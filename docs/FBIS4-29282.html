			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wednesday -- The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs will seek a clarification from the British Foreign  Office over British Trade Minister Richard Needham's remarks  that Britain may take retaliatory action against Malaysia over  the freezing of new government contracts for British companies.    Acting Foreign Minister Datuk Abu Hassan Omar said the  cabinet will discuss the remarks only after obtaining the  clarification from the British Government.    "At this point, the government has no plan to issue any  statement and will wait until the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  seeks the British clarification, including on the authenticity  of the source of this news report," he said during a news  conference here today.    The REUTERS report carried by several newspapers here today  quoted Needham as saying that British Prime Minister John Major  will be under pressure to retaliate if Malaysia continues the  sanctions.    "The longer they leave it, the more likelihood there is of  retaliation by the British side. The longer it goes on, the  more voices will be raised against it," REUTERS quoted Needham  as saying.    Malaysia froze the awarding of new government contracts to  British companies after the British media slandered government  leaders, including Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed.    The British leaders have ever since been divided over the  matter, although not a few of them have blamed their media for  it.    Needham left for home yesterday after concluding his second  visit in two weeks to the country. Needham, who led a  delegation of private British investors and companies, met  several national leaders during the visit.    Commenting on Needham's statement that the sanction may be  lifted within six weeks, Abu Hassan said the government has not  issued any decision.    "We do not reject private British companies, especially  those  involved in technology transfer. However, they must respect the  government's stance," he said.    Commenting on Britain's readiness to help Malaysia counter  pressure on the generalized system of preferences [GSP] by  increasing trade with the European Union, Abu Hassan said the  government welcomed any proposals that could increase the  country's trade.    "However, this should not be used as a reason for Malaysia  to  lift sanctions against Britain. The two issues are entirely  different," he said.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (9): Expectations may be too great - Development SOWETO-ON-SEA, one settlement has been dubbed. Families living in shacks in a river flood plain in the Eastern Cape city of Port Elizabeth are being moved there en masse. But this is not the dawn bulldozer raid of the old South Africa - the squatters are going, voluntarily, to set up home on a plot of land which each will own. Another shanty town, in Welkom in the Orange Free State, is relocating to a new settlement nearby which they have called Vukuzenzela - in translation, 'Wake up and do it yourself.' The name is apposite, because the squatters are not being rehoused. What they get is a 'serviced site,' with at least water and sewerage laid on. The building work is up to them. The two are among the 100-plus such projects around the country undertaken by the Cape Town-based Independent Development Trust since it was launched in 1990 with the political endorsement of the African National Congress and Inkatha and R2bn of government money. Further project funds have since come from other donors such as the European Community. The IDT has spent some R850m establishing more than 110,000 sites, in the process becoming the biggest provider of new homes without ever having built a house. The number represents nearly 10 per cent of the 1.2m households it estimated had no proper roof over their heads, no mean feat in three years. But that figure is rising as blacks gravitate towards the cities to seek elusive employment, and the trust's 'toilet towns' - that is their sole fitting - are barely holding the line. Some 10m people are without drinking water at home, 15m lack sanitation, and 23m have no electricity. The IDT estimates that the country is short of 50,000 classrooms, a number which it expects to double by 2000. Some 1,000 more primary health facilities are needed. Redressing this legacy will be a daunting task. Eskom, the state-controlled electric utility, for example has a five-year programme to electrify 1m households, and new connections are running at 25,000 to 30,000 a month. However, this still leaves some 30 per cent of homes without power by 2000, beyond the five-year life of next year's transitional administration. Mr Derek Keys, finance minister and former head of mining house Gencor, says bluntly of the country's social infrastructure needs: 'I don't think the market is going to do it.' His downbeat view echoes that of many in the private sector who insist that institutions with the financial clout which could make a tangible difference, notably the life assurance offices, have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders or policyholders which would not allow them to justify investing in or lending to ventures where the risks are large and the returns uncertain. But the market is at least trying. Mr Steven de Bruyn, assistant general manager of UAL, the merchant banking arm of the Nedbank group, says ways need to be found to make the risk palatable. These would often require government involvement, say in setting up a US-style mortgage guarantee fund so home loans could be extended to those without the financial track record which usually only whites can meet. Such a loan book could then be securitised. This is not too far a jump from the capital markets issue which UAL this year put together for Eskom, the state electricity supplier, to fund its electrification programme aimed mainly at black residential areas. The R590m first tranche was fully subscribed locally after the Reserve Bank deemed the detachable warrants on the bonds allowed foreigners too much scope to exploit the country's dual exchange rate system. Preventing defaults on mortgages may be less easy, but at least there is supposed to be an income stream to repay an investment outlay. What of education and health, where no such evident return exists? Even here, schemes are being examined. In tertiary education, for instance, a loan fund has been mooted along the lines of a model being explored in Australia. Borrowings would be repaid from students' eventual earnings, debited directly, and the fund would become self-sustainable as these flows gain pace. Outside agencies will now play a greater role. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund themselves arouse both hopes and fears, given the stringency of their prescriptions in the rest of Africa. A letter of intent between South Africa and the IMF is ready for signing next month (but loans from the Washington institutions are in the main thought likely to be used initially to refinance existing bank borrowings rather than provide a slew of new development cash. In a recognition of the scale of the task, Derek Keys says large-scale community upliftment 'needs an entrepreneur - maybe it needs 10,000 entrepreneurs - to organise. I hope a representative government is in a better position for that than our government.'</p>

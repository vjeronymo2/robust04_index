			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Leo Custers: "The Generals and the </F> Politicians"]    [Text] It is almost irrelevant whether or not General  Francis Briquemont's resignation as UNPROFOR II [UN Protection  Force] commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina is due to the "high  stress level," as Defense Minister Delcroix put it, or to his  plain criticism of the United Nations and the European Union  [EU]. The fact remains that Gen. Briquemont is the third  high-level military officer to have bluntly criticized the EU  and UN ambiguity. French Gen. Philippe Morillon, his  predecessor, was not mild in his criticism either, and thanks to  his actions, which at some points ran counter to UN and EU  directives, he became a hero to French public opinion.    Gen. Briquemont addressed his criticism to UN and EU  diplomats, who vote one resolution after another but neglect to  provide the means for their implementation. Deciding that the  Muslim enclaves threatened by the Serbs should become "safe  areas" is one thing; making sure that the necessary people and  equipment are provided to effectively create "safe areas" is  another. One more duty, providing emergency aid to the ailing  population, has been made impossible by the lack of troops and  supplies. Not to speak of the harassment from all parties to  which the UN troops are not allowed to respond. Gen. Briquemont  said with contempt that he no longer read the UN resolutions  because they were useless.    French Gen. Jean Cot, commander of the UNPROFOR troops in  the  former Yugoslavia, was also very harsh. He attacked the  diplomats sitting "in their Geneva palaces," while his troops  had to do the actual fighting. Gen. Cot said he would no longer  agree to allow his Blue Helmets to be helpless targets and  hostages to the arbitrarily operating Serbian, Croatian, or  Muslim militias in Bosnia.    Briquemont and Cot hold all warring parties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina responsible for the harassment and  humiliation, although the Serbs have been mentioned with more  emphasis.    Grumbling generals are not uncommon. Generals at the  frontline always complain about the gap between the words and  the actions of politicians. As regards ex-Yugoslavia, however,  dissatisfaction is very easy to understand. The inconsistencies  between the decisions made by politicians and diplomats and the  means available on the spot are obvious and have made many UN  soldiers desperate. In France and Great Britain, suggestions  have already been made to recall the Blue Helmets. EU mediator  Lord Owen also stated that a withdrawal of UN troops might be  considered if no substantial progress in the peace talks is made  over the coming two months.    It was also suggested that, if the warring factions do not  observe the UN resolutions more rigorously, "other means" should  be sought. This may mean that the West is prepared to use  stronger military means to implement the resolutions, or else --  and is not unthinkable either -- decide to withdraw all blue  helmets from that hornet's nest.    For Belgian UN troops in Baranja, this would be the best  thing to do. According to UN resolutions, UN troops were  supposed to disarm the militias, make sure that the Croatian  population was able to return home, and return the area under  Serbian occupation to the authority of the Croatian state. As  the situation is now, the Blue Helmets are indeed contributing  to a consolidation of positions, although these favor the Serbs.  In reality, UN troops are of no use in implementing UN  resolutions, but they are an accessory in keeping an illegally  occupying power in place. This cannot be the goal of a  peacemaking operation.</p>

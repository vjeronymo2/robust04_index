			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELMS' LETTERS  </P> <P> Parachini's article creates a misimpression by suggesting that Sen. Helms  supported me for NEA general counsel in order to extend his influence over the  NEA. Nothing could be farther from the truth.  </P> <P> Sen. Helms' Nov. 24, 1989 letter indicated that on the advice of a trusted  friend he had reason to believe I would make an excellent general counsel, and  it suggested that the NEA chairman meet with me and make his own assessment.  </P> <P> This mild and indirect support of my candidacy can hardly qualify as the  exercise of undue influence over the NEA. Furthermore, the letter had no  bearing on obtaining an interview with NEA Chairman Frohnmayer, since I had an  interview with him on Nov. 6, i.e. before the letter was received.  </P> <P> It should also be noted that my candidacy was supported by Sen. Edward M.  Kennedy. I am grateful for the support of both Sen. Helms and Sen. Kennedy that  hopefully indicated to the chairman that I had the ability to work effectively  with persons of radically different political persuasions.  </P> <P> EDWARD J. DAMICH, Associate Professor of Law, George Mason University,  Arlington, Va.  </P></p>

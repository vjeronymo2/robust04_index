			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Yeo defies calls to resign over affair Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister, yesterday rejected calls for his resignation over an extra-marital affair with a Conservative councillor. Mr Yeo has been criticised by officials in his South Suffolk constituency since admitting last month that he is the father of the councillor's child. Senior backbench Tories have contrasted Mr Yeo's behaviour with his comments on the need to reduce the number of single mothers, and the government's promotion of traditional family values. However, he has the support of Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman. Mr Yeo said yesterday: 'I am absolutely confident that I won't have to resign.' Interviewed on BBC Radio, he said he regretted his 'foolish' behaviour. But he added: 'I don't believe that in any government there are such demanding standards that those individuals who make mistakes should be regarded as unfit for office when it is quite clear that none of those actions have any direct relevance to the tasks which those ministers perform in the government.' Last night Mr Yeo met constituency officials, who said a statement would be made this morning. Formal criticism by the local party executive could force his resignation from the government.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: US broadcasting group ahead 27% in third quarter CAPITAL Cities/ABC, the US broadcasting group, yesterday announced a 27 per cent increase in earnings for the third quarter. The ABC television network, which returned to profit after posting an operating loss in the 1992 third quarter, was largely responsible for the improvement. Wall Street reacted enthusiastically to the news. At the close, the share price was up Dollars 11 at Dollars 626. The results follow the announcement by CBS last week that its third-quarter earnings were nearly three times greater than its income a year ago. For Capital Cities/ABC, consolidated net income was Dollars 78.2m, or Dollars 4.75 a share, against Dollars 62.1m, or Dollars 3.74, in the corresponding quarter of 1992. The results reflect a provision for a federal tax increase enacted earlier this year. Net revenues climbed to Dollars 1.3bn, a gain of 7 per cent on last year. Revenues from broadcasting operations were up 11 per cent, with the ABC network benefitting from improved advertising rates and the absence of last year's broadcast of the summer Olympics on a rival network. Revenue from the group's video operations continued to climb, largely due to the growth of ESPN, the cable station featuring 24-hour sports programming. Turnover from radio was moderately up, while publishing, excluding the effect of acquisitions, disposals and start-up, showed a 3 per cent sales increase. For the first nine months, consolidated net income before extraordinary charges was Dollars 300.6m, compared with Dollars 251.4m, before the cumulative effect of accounting changes, in the 1992 period.</p>

The document is a formal report compiled by the Russian  Government which long helped North Korea develop nuclear  technology.    The document is entitled: "The Russian Federation's Basic  Military and Political Concept on the Current Military Situation  in the Asian and Pacific Region."    The document is a classified report that was compiled on 22  October 1993 by the Russian Federation's Defense Ministry for  Defense Minister Grachev.    The report, compiled by the Military Strategy Research  Center  under the General Staff of the Armed Forces, was also submitted  to the Russian Government leaders. According to information I  have obtained, the report has been sent to the U.S. Defense  Department at President Yeltsin's instruction. In other words,  the report is not a highly classified document. As the title  indicates, the report proposes Russia's strategic blueprint for  all of Asia. What draws our attention in the report is North  Korea's nuclear development. It devotes five pages out of 36 to  North Korea's nuclear development.    The report gives a general picture of North Korea's nuclear  development.    It says: "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK]  has announced its decision to pull out of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the DPRK has test-fired  medium-range ballistic missiles. It has also refused to allow  nuclear inspections by the committee of the international atomic  organization [name as received]. These moves by the DPRK have  heightened the potentially tense situation in the region."    The report also indicates that North Korea's threat to the  security of Russia, the United States, and Japan is drastically  growing.    What is of great interest to the Japanese is a section on  page 20 of the report. The section was written about North  Korea's nuclear development for senior officers of the General  Staff of the Armed Forces and Russian Government leaders.    The section entitled "Technology Information" says: Now,  nine  people with Russian citizenship are working as nuclear  physicists in North Korea. Seventeen experts are working on the  missile manufacturing technology and four of them recently  returned to their countries.    Soviet experts were most active in North Korea in the later  half of the 1980's. At that time, North Korea was engaged in  developing Nodong-1 medium-range ballistic missile with the  direct assistance of the Soviet Union. The Nodong-1 weighs  1,000-1,500 kg with a warhead tip. The missile has a range of  1,000-1,600 km with a 100-200 meter margin of hit probability.  Its explosive warhead ranges from one to two megatons. The  warhead is of the Hiroshima type. The missile flies at the  maximum speed of more than Mach nine and tipping the missile  with nuclear warheads is in the final stage.    At the same time, North Korea is developing Nodong-2. The  major task for North Korea is to improve the performance of the  Nodong-2 -- extension of range and miniaturization of warheads.    According to the report, North Korea now has 10-12 kg of  uranium-235 and 20 kg of plutonium-239. According to Russian  nuclear experts, they are enough to manufacture three to five  nuclear warheads. The massive nuclear complex is located in  Yongbyun, 90 km north of Pyongyang. The Soviet Union provided  North Korea with a centrifugal separator which is capable of  greatly increasing the effect of enriched uranium.    The report describes North Korea's suspected nuclear  development as in the "final stage" which has attracted  attention of the American and European journalists and the  world. Since the report is an official document that the Russian  military, which continued to help North Korea's nuclear  development, compiled on the basis of interviews with Russian  engineers who returned home from North Korea, it is 100 percent  reliable.    In an interview with me, a senior officer with the Military  Strategy Research Center under the General Staff of the Armed  Forces, which compiled the report, gave details of North Korea's  nuclear development. In the interview, he revealed not only the  existence of nuclear arms in North Korea, but fearful facts. The  following are questions and answers:    [Unidentified officer] "In my view, nuclear inspections are  a  ridiculous story. North Korea has already completed the  development of Hiroshima-type atomic bomb and it is widely known  among us that North Korea has at least one atomic bomb. The  North Koreans are using Russian scientists to promote the  manufacturing of a few atomic bombs according to the `Nuclear  Development Project' which they have worked out on their own.  Perhaps they have already completed manufacturing them."    "According to an analysis by Soviet nuclear physicists in  1992, it was said that North Korea was promoting a plan designed  to produce at least three atomic bombs, similar to the atomic  bomb dropped on Hiroshima, by the end of 1994. Therefore, it is  highly possible that they have already finished building a bomb  or two."    [Kato] What makes you so positive?    [Unidentified officer] "It is a matter of common knowledge  that the former Soviet government supplied low level radioactive  materials to the north. However, North Koreans are enriching  these materials and producing high-grade uranium and plutonium  by using centrifugal separators, which the former Soviet Union  gave to North Korea, at an underground nuclear reprocessing  plant in Yongbyun. Moreover, it was confirmed that there are  several rich uranium veins in the north.    In the past, the Soviet Union provided North Korea with  uranium mining knowhow and technicians as well. The Soviet  Union did all that for smooth promotion of nuclear development  in North Korea. Because of the help from the Soviet Union, the  north now has 20 kilograms of plutonium. Roughly speaking, it  is possible to make one nuclear warhead if you have eight  kilograms of plutonium. Judging from the quantity of plutonium  they have, I do not think my view is far from the truth.  However, we know the details and actual conditions of the  development program because we have interviewed scientists who  came back from there."    [Kato] But, Russia is officially saying it is not supporting  North Korean nuclear development.    [Unidentified officer] "That is right but the fact is  different. As is written in the report, Russian technicians are  engaged in North Korean nuclear development. They get paid  $3,000 or $4,000 per month. In addition, they are given high  quality houses, cars, clothes, and other daily necessities.  They are given special treatment. The total number of Russian  technicians, who were sent to North Korea, was well over 100.  However, some of them are not coming back. They are staying  there and obtaining North Korean citizenship and changing their  names. Now, you understand that the scientists were not ordered  by the government to go to Pyongyang. We know all about their  movements, including the number of scientists who emigrated to  third nations after they went to Pyongyang."    [Kato] According to a news report, it is said the Nodong-1  will be deployed soon. Is that true?    [Unidentified officer] "After the experimental launching of  the Nodong-1 in the Sea of Japan on 29 May last year, several  missiles, including a new remote control system which was  successfully produced, were sold to Iran. However, judging from  this fact, there is no doubt that North Korea is steadily  perfecting its missile development."    He also disclosed surprising facts.    "Currently, North Korea has three different kinds of  missiles, which are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. They  are Scud-A, B and C types which were manufactured in the north  under a production license, and they have 300 such missiles in  all. The missile, called Nodong in Japan, is called Tsurudo [as  published] in Russia. Its capabilities are written in the  report. However, what we should pay attention to is the  Nodong-2, which North Korea is developing as a weapon to replace  Nodong-1. Reportedly, the flight range of the Nodong-2 is 6,000  kilometers. Therefore, we can say it is a real intercontinental  ballistic missile [ICBM]. Of course, it will be capable of  attacking not only the entire Asian region but also part of the  United States."    [Kato] Just a minute. Why does North Korea need an ICBM?    [Unidentified officer] "We do not know that for sure.  However, we can take a guess. Probably, the Gulf war became a  motive. That is because Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il saw  Tomahawk's attack the Iraqi military with pinpoint accuracy  during the war and clearly realized that North Korea will  immediately suffer crushing blows once it engages in a war.  They do not need to develop missiles which have the same  capabilities as American rockets. However, I suppose they  immediately started to develop the Nodong-2, feeling the need to  own an ICBM to use as a long-range assault weapon."    [Kato] Does that mean the Gulf war made North Korea change  its missile development plan? Do you have some concrete  evidence?    [Unidentified officer] "Of course. Previously, North Korea  was using a liquid fuel method for all of its missile  development. However, the Gulf war revealed that this method had  a fatal defect. It was proved that missile bases, no matter how  well they are hidden underground, are helpless against cruise  missile attacks as long as their locations are known.    "For that reason, Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il have  reportedly made an urgent decision to develop solid-fuel-type  rockets like the SCUD missiles developed by Iraq. It may be  safe to say that their decision is proved by the fact that the  North has recently asked the Russian Defense Ministry through  the Moscow Embassy in North Korea to provide it with more  advanced missile development technology, including know-how of  developing missiles with the sold fuel type method. Whatever  the case may be, North Korea's demand concerning ICBM  development technology is persistent and urgent."    If what the senior officer said is true, not only Japan but  also all other nations will be exposed to the nuclear threat of  Kim Il-song. In fact, reportedly, the United States and Russia,  fearing North Korea's suspected nuclear development, have  already started preparing for the North Korean threat.    Actually, the senior officer said the report described above  has been written on the assumption that the world will be  exposed to North Korea's nuclear threat.    As he said, the report emphasizes that Japan, the United  States, and Russia should jointly cope with the North Korean  threat.    The following are the major points of the report:    1) Within the Russian military authorities, there are some  groups cooperating with North Korea in nuclear development.    2) It is impossible to ensure the future security of  Russia without joint cooperation with Japan, the United States,  and South Korea.    3) Should the military authorities cooperate with North  Korea, it would double Japan's and South Korea's distrust of  Russia. Therefore, in view of ensuring security, it is extremely  dangerous to cooperate with North Korea.    4) In particular, Russia's relations with Japan are  important to improving its relations with the United States, and  Russia should not incite Japan.    5) Russia's plan to establish a regional missile  interception network in cooperation with the United States and  Japan is for regional defense purposes. Therefore, it is absurd  to cooperate with North Korea in nuclear development.    In conclusion, the report even proposes that the outflow to  North Korea of Russian experts for missile development, of  materials for missile development, and nuclear resources should  be prevented; that an accord between Russia and North Korea on  missile development technology should be abolished; and that  Russia should not help North Korea smuggle its missiles to the  third countries.    The senior officer also disclosed another astonishing fact.    He said: "Concerned over the threat of North Korea,  including  nuclear attack in the Far East and the Pacific region, Japan's  Defense Agency, the Russian Defense Ministry, and the U.S.  Department of Defense are conducting meetings to seek a possible  tripartite emergency defense system aimed at coping with a North  Korean missile attack.    "Particularly, they have agreed that it is necessary to  urgently come up with measures to deal with ICBM missiles which  North Korea is developing secretly.    "As far as I know, when the summit was held, (then) Director  General of the Defense Agency Nakanishi, who accompanied Prime  Minister Hosokawa on his visit to Vancouver, reportedly met with  a high-raking official of the U.S. Department of Defense and  obtained information on progress in North Korea's nuclear  development.    "Meanwhile, a high-ranking Japanese Defense Agency official  visited Moscow, and his visit was briefly reported by ITAR-TASS  saying a meeting was held between Japanese and Russian defense  officials. However, in fact, at the meeting, in-depth  discussions were held on such topics as progress in North  Korea's nuclear development, and its strike capability.    "At the meeting, they agreed to hold a Japan-Russia meeting  of defense officials in Tokyo around February 1994 (recently the  meeting was scheduled for 1-2 February). When the meeting is  held, Russia will bring a more detailed, precise report on North  Korea's military power. Actually, the Military Strategy  Research Center has been ordered to work out a report needed for  the meeting."    It is true that former Director-General of the Defense  Agency  Nakanishi was eager to develop a Theater Missile Defense (TMD)  system jointly with the United States. It is also true that  after Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to the United States for  the summit meeting, Japanese ministries and agencies concerned  with North Korean issues have started seriously studying  possible economic sanctions against North Korea.    I think it is time for the Japanese Government to tell the  people about how nuclear bombs and missiles are being developed  by North Korea because the North Korean issue directly affects  the future security of Japan. Meanwhile, the government is  seeking a new framework for security. The situation is getting  serious, and for Japan, this is no time to be carried away by  "Hosokawa's performance."    The senior officer also said: "Russia is not the only  country  which provides North Korea with nuclear resources. You probably  do not know that China has been cooperating with North Korea.  It has been confirmed that a great volume of uranium has been  brought in to North Korea only recently.    "It is said the source of that uranium is factories in  Mordai  [as published] and Choera [as published] in China. If so,  nuclear material brought in to North Korea must be low-level  radioactive material. However, if it is so inclined, North  Korea can collect nuclear development and materials know-how.    "What you should not forget is the fact that North Korea  already has at least one atomic bomb and 1,000-kilometer range  missiles."</p>

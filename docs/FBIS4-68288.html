			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Vladimir Churanov, chief of </F> the rear services of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,  by Petr Altunin on behalf of the readers of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA:  "Problems Arise Every Day"]    [Text] The rear services  play a paramount role in ensuring the vital activities of the  troops and forces of the navy. This is understandable, for a  soldier must be provided with shoes and clothing and given a  full meal three times a day and tanks and aircraft will not move  without fuel.... And it is not surprising that the lion's share  of letters to the editor's office involve questions of rear  services and the everyday needs of service personnel. After  grouping the most important of them, we asked Col. Gen. Vladimir  Churanov to respond to them.    [Altunin] Vladimir Timofeyevich, about a year ago the  newspapers were writing about some changes in the rear services  of the armed forces. What has been done?    [Churanov] Reforms are under way in accordance with the plan  and stages of the development of the armed forces. But I want to  emphasize that reforms in the rear are not a goal in themselves  and especially are not aimed at demolishing the things of value  that have been created--I am not afraid to say it--from the days  to Peter to our own time.    In the course of the year experiment in converting to a  territorial system in support of the troops that is being  carried out in the Moscow Military District, we were once again  convinced of its prospects. Consideration of the special  features of the stationing of troops and the economic  possibilities of the region make it possible to optimize  administrative-economic, transportation, information, and other  ties. And accordingly, under the conditions of the  decentralization of the supply process on the scale of the  country, we will be able, in the first place, not "to lose"  stability and autonomy in the support of the troops and,  secondly, to organize and strengthen interaction with local  authorities and, the main thing, with suppliers. In any case, we  will be able to buy perishable food products and seasonable  produce at relatively low prices, which is especially important  at this time.    As in any innovation, there are difficulties here. I would  say that there is still much that needs to be smoothed out and  made more logical. For this reason, we are expanding the base of  the experiment and planning to carry it out in other regions of  Russia this year.    Recently, as a member of a commission under the leadership  of  the minister of defense, I had the occasion to work in  Kaliningrad Special Defense Area. Under the conditions of its  remoteness, precisely the territorial principle was made the  basis of the material support of the troops and forces of the  navy.    Still another problem that one must pay attention to is the  financing of the needs of the rear. In 1993, only 56 percent of  these needs were met. Of course in the end they got by but at  what a price! The reduction of the consumption of fuel and the  extension of the time for the wearing of items of clothing went,  as they say, to the extreme limits allowed. The only thing that  they did not cut back was the food for the soldiers. One cannot  save on this.    In closely analyzing the existing system for the financing  of  the needs of the rear from the center to the military unit, we  come to the conclusion that it must be changed. After all, we  have such rigid expenditure items--food, clothing, material  supplies, and fuel--essentially not subject to adjustment that  the money for these needs ought not to be in some common pot  somewhere but rather must come to us in special allocations. We  do not yet have this.    [Altunin] Our mail includes many letters from aviators.  Planned flights were continually being disrupted because of a  shortage of kerosene and various lubricating oils. What will  happen this year?    [Churanov] I have already touched on this question. It may  be  that they feel the shortage of fuel more acutely in aviation  than elsewhere but unfortunately the picture is similar in other  branches of the armed forces as well--in the navy, for example.  Again, we are seeing the effects of our direct dependence upon  the situation in the country's fuel and energy system. Judging  by everything, this situation will not change this year either.    What should be done here? There is just one answer, save  wherever we can. We are also seeking other ways. We will soon  begin to produce some kinds of oils and lubricants independently  using our own capacities. A scientific research institute of the  Ministry of Defense and industry are carrying out work to select  critical oils.    [Altunin] "In the enlisted mess, they often serve canned  products instead of fresh meat and there is a shortage of other  items. What is the explanation for this?" write our readers,  soldiers in compulsory service in the Siberian Military District.    [Churanov] That is a very important question and I would say  that it is fundamental for us. After all, the food for the  personnel largely determines not only the physical but also the  psychological state of the soldiers. The main task here remains  the same: The soldier's table must have a full complement of  products corresponding to the established norms.    What is the reason for this situation? Unfortunately, it  lies  in the country's reduced food potential. Last year the cost of  the daily ration for the military as a whole increased from 140  to 1,200 rubles [R] and, as I have already said, the financing  is limited. In the first three months of the year, we received  less than half of the money needed for the purchase of food. We  are borrowing with incredible assurances. We must recognize that  our past reserves are still helping us out. We eat them and then  we replenish them.    The high duties recently introduced on the importation of  foodstuffs have practically not affected us so far (imports are  insignificant for us) but if they go into effect and extend to  the countries of the near abroad, then we will doubtless feel  their pressure, especially in the procurement period.    The overwhelming majority of specialists in the food service  are persistently assimilating market mechanisms and are striving  to buy products more cheaply and to expand and diversify the  assortment of dishes being prepared. Much is being done in this  direction in the garrisons of Moscow, Siberian, Leningrad, and  other military districts, where the preparation of two second  dishes has already become the norm at enlisted mess halls.    But it is not so everywhere. Checks are revealing cases of  pilferage of products from warehouses and instances where the  norm does not reach the individual soldier as it should.  Decisive measures are being taken in such cases, even to the  point of prosecuting those who are guilty.    [Altunin] And this is from a letter by reserve officers who  formerly worked in the rear services: "We see on television that  agricultural equipment has broken down at many farms and is not  prepared for the sowing season. What is happening at our  military sovkhozes?"    [Churanov] There can be only one answer to this question:  Under difficult economic conditions, military sovkhozes and the  subsidiary plots of military units act to some extent as the  guarantor of stable production of agricultural output for the  needs of the army and navy.    Overall, things are getting better for them. As of 1 March,  70 percent of the tractors had been repaired for the spring  sowing, most other farm equipment had been made ready for the  sowing campaign, and the necessary quantity of seed material had  been procured....    [Altunin] "New uniform. We in our unit see it primarily on  television and in the newspapers. When will it be issued to us?"  asks Warrant Officer [praporshchik] S. Gusev (Ural Military  District).    [Churanov] In accordance with the previously affirmed plan,  the full conversion of the service personnel of the Armed Forces  of the Russian Federation to the new uniform is taking place in  stages and is supposed to be concluded by the end of 1995. But  those same disruptions in the financing of the rear services may  also put into doubt the reality of this deadline. Thus, only a  little more than half of the money needed for procurement of the  new military clothing was allocated in 1993.    Enterprises of light industry that have traditionally worked  for us are in a critical situation. Because of our nonpayment,  their inventories are piling up, they stand idle, they are  failing to pay wages to workers, and some of them are closing.    Of course, the clothing service is not idle and all possible  measures are being taken to correct the situation. In our  reciprocal accounts, we are forced to select the most necessary  items: striped undershirts, camouflage, new model shoes, and the  like, without which the service simply cannot function today,  and to "borrow" sheets and pillowcases, for example, from our  warehouses. First of all, as provided for by order of the  minister of defense, we are now supplying service personnel in  the Moscow and St. Petersburg garrisons, graduates of military  schools and academies, soldiers at garrisons where staffs of  military districts and fleets are located, and other military  units taking into account the peculiarities and specific nature  of their military service.    [Altunin] "It was reported in the newspapers that in  military  trade, as a check revealed, there are many serious shortcomings  of various kinds. What specifically is happening there? What  measures are being taken?" This is the question of Captain S.  Bogachev from St. Petersburg.    [Churanov] Yes, recently there have indeed been less than  flattering articles in the press about the work of military  trade but from them one cannot draw the conclusion that there is  nothing but crime there. After all, military trade is not just  stores and warehouses. Its system includes more than 18,000  enterprises of various kinds located throughout the territory of  Russia and beyond its borders and, finally, about 100,000  employees, the overwhelming majority of whom are working  conscientiously despite the difficulties that are worsening  every day--a shortage of working capital and rising prices.    And as a result, the commodity turnover last year amounted  to  more than R600 billion, seven times what it was the previous  year. Military trade contributed about R25 billion to the state  budget.    Overall, the agencies of military trade and its system are  continuing to improve. The organizational staff structure is  changing, parallel links and superfluous administrative agencies  are being eliminated, wholesale-retail associations are being  established, and domestic trade enterprises are being included  in the territorial system of rear services.    A new normative-legal base is being developed, with the  adoption of which, in particular the "Statute on Military  Trade," it will be possible to eliminate contraditions with  existing legislation and to fulfill the corresponding statutes  of the Law of the Russian Federation "On the Status of Service  Personnel."    I do not deny that the leadership of the rear services as  well as local people have a lot of grievances against the work  of military trade. And it is no secret that there are also  people there with dirty hands and there is cheating and  miscounting. Complaints about this are not ignored.    The miscalculations made in 1991-92 continue to be  eliminated, especially in external trade. Contracts made with  insolvent firms by former managers of military trade at  different levels are being canceled and the invested money is  being returned to the account of the Main Trade Directorate of  the Ministry of Defense. Criminal suits have been brought  against liable persons who permitted unjustifiable trade deals.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "Advertisement Smacks of Scam"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, April 11--An advertisement placed by the  defence ministry in specialised national and international  aviation journals inviting global tenders for sale of certain  Indian Air Force equipment has left a trail of unanswered  questions, hinting even at a possible scandal.    Among the listed items in the advertisement placed by the  Special Surplus Stores Disposal Committee (SSSDC) of the  Ministry of Defence are approximately one lakh pairs of blue  grey winter uniforms comprising trousers and tunics with belts  and brass buckles. Surprisingly, all these uniforms are stated  to be in an absolutely new and unused condition of various sizes.    Enquiries, however, reveal that the number is much more. The  figures of these winter uniforms are in fact 94,000 full pairs  (tunics and trousers) and 38,000 tunics.    The other items, which indeed are of sensitive nature, are  161 lines comprising electronic equipment for the Russian made  Surface to Air (SAM-II) missiles guidance system, 126  serviceable missiles, 35 SAM-II launchers, and missile liquid  propellants--namely 92 litres of "O" fuel (nitric acid), 53,124  litres of "G" fuel and 20,785 litres of IPN [expansion not  given].    The "O" and "G" fuels are used in the Intermediate Range  `Agni' and surface to air Prithvi missile programmes. It is not  clear whether the IAF [Indian Air Force] has applied its mind to  the possible violation of the country's policy of not exporting  missile technology or materials. As a senior IAF officer pointed  out, "This could well tantamount to adding to proliferation of  such dangerous and sensitive equipment," adding "how can we be  sure that it won't unwittingly end up in Pakistani hands. After  all it is a global tender and the Pakistanis can buy it, if not  directly, through indirect means."    Among the miscellaneous aircraft spares are 596 line items  of  the U.S. origin B-24 Liberator bomber aircraft which  interestingly was phased out of the IAF in the mid-1960s. Among  the 10 AN-12 transport aircraft put up for sale are two such  aircrafts which have flown just 171 and 671 hours each after  their last overhaul. But then this compares better with the 140  indigenously developed HE-24 Marut ground attack aircraft which  was sold as scrap in the early 1980s.    Of these 140 Maruts, 40 of them had flown just 20 hours  each.  Rather than have further developed on the HF-24, which had cost  the IAF Rs 69 lakh a piece, its replacement in the form of the  British Aerospace manufactured Jaguar had then cost the state  exchequer Rs 8 crore a piece. Today the price per piece of the  Jaguar is over Rs 60 crore.    What has raised special interest in defence circles is the  large number of winter uniforms in new and unused condition.  While the Royal Air Force (RAF) of Britain has never changed its  uniform since its inception, changes have been introduced into  the IAF uniforms by almost every air chief. However, generally  speaking, the IAF which provides free uniforms to the 75,000 to  80,000 airmen, allows for a long changeover period in order to  ensure complete and proper utilisation of its stocks. On the  other hand IAF officers are not provided free uniforms and are  instead entitled to a uniform allowance of Rs 3,000 every seven  years.    When contacted an official spokesman of the IAF said that  the  uniforms in question were up to 34 years old dating back to 1960  and had been accumulated over a period of time. Enquiries with  the SSSDC, however, revealed that the uniforms were up to 18  years old.    But there is no convincing answer as to how and why such a  large number of uniforms have been lying, to quote the  advertisement, in a "new" and "unused" condition for so many  years. Does it not amount to an unnecessary loss to the state  exchequer?</p>

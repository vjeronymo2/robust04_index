			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Robusta coffee producers expected to suspend export retention Robusta coffee producers are expected to stop withholding exports following a rise in the international price. Last week producers of arabica coffee dropped the amount of exports they are holding off the market from 20 per cent to 10 per cent following strong gains in prices of that variety. The latest rise came at the end of a meeting of coffee producers and consumers in London that adopted a new 5-year international coffee agreement, to take effect in October. The export retention scheme has helped to lift prices since it began last October, but analysts attribute the market's current strength to a supply shortage from most producing countries. 'The decline in production is due to the lack of investment over the last few years because prices have been so low,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles of brokers GNI.</p>

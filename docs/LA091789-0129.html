			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK:: JACKSON GETS THOUGHTFUL;  </P> <P> JANET JACKSON "JANET JACKSON'S RHYTHM NATION 1814." A&amp;M ***:***** GREAT  BALLS OF FIRE:**** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S:*** GOOD VIBRATIONS:** MAYBE BABY:*  AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> If you were looking for more great dance music from Jackson -- a "Control II"  perhaps -- you may be disappointed by this transition album. While clinging to  her dance-music roots, Jackson has decided to branch out in other directions.  </P> <P> With 1986's "Control," a commercial blockbuster, she established herself as  queen of the young dance-music divas, paving the way for the likes of Pebbles,  Paula Abdul and Samantha Fox. But she is now stepping beyond that bunch. Her  goal apparently is to be another Madonna -- the kind of dance-music queen who  can also sing ballads and pop tunes.  </P> <P> The album, which she largely co-wrote, runs the gamut -- from social commentary  to lusty, sensual tunes, from dance music to songs laced with jazz and  Brazilian textures. Vocally, Jackson exposes herself more -- not hiding behind  technological wizardry as much as she did on "Control." Her voice, however,  remains somewhat thin and wispy. For what she's trying to do, she needs more  vocal power.  </P> <P> What's lost, for the dance fans, is crispness and punch. The dance tracks on  the new album are generally busier and more subdued than they should be. What  she hopes to gain is artistic credibility. Working again with  producing/composing team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Jackson has made an  intriguing album. It's certainly more complex, challenging and thoughtful than  "Control."  </P> <P> The move to social commentary, however, is a rocky one. "State of the World"  and "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)" aren't interesting enough musically  to carry the messages, though the dance rhythms better support the lyrics on  the title song and "The Knowledge."  </P> <P> The highlights are the bouncy "Escapade" and "Someday Is Tonight," a long,  steamy tale of romantic surrender, backed by a memorable, muted Herb Alpert  trumpet solo that recalls Miles Davis' sultry '50s sound. More than any other  number on this ambitious, if uneven album, "Someday Is Tonight" is a signal  that the woman who once seemed doomed to always be known as Michael's little  sister has grown up.

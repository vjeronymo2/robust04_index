			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE JOY AND THE PRIDE OF TEACHING A CLASS, NOT A MOB  </P> <P> I am sitting at my desk at Bell High School, reading compositions written by my  9th-grade English class. My students have written essays in the form of news  reports. Their topic: the death of Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet. I am  bursting with pride and anger.  </P> <P> No "gifted" students these. They are labeled "average." Their essays are among  the best I've ever seen for that grade level, and I've been looking for 15  years.  </P> <P> How is it possible to get such superior work out of "average" kids?  </P> <P> The answer is that there are only 13 kids in the class. (How did I get such a  small class? A scheduling fluke.) A class of 35 to 40 "average" 9th-graders  would never produce such high-quality work. With such big numbers the teacher  has to spend as much time dealing with behavioral problems as he or she does  teaching. There is virtually no time for individualized instruction, and the  increased time spent on paper-grading means proportionally less time for  creative lesson preparation.  </P> <P> This is nothing new. Everyone connected with education knows the effect of  class size on student accomplishment. And that's why I'm angry. Piled on my  desk is the clearest evidence I've ever seen of what my colleagues and I can  accomplish, given a reasonable chance to reach students' minds. Why are we not  given a chance? How many more uninspired imaginations and undereducated  intellects are we going to shove out the schoolhouse door, clutching worthless  academic diplomas in their hands, for a march into substandard jobs and  economically deprived lives.  </P> <P> A few days ago, I was stopped on the school quad and informed that because of  the small number of students this class will be closed next month. I need to  rush and teach them all I can before they become lost in the mobs that populate  our other classrooms. How will anyone reach them?  </P> <P> Of Juan Aguilar I speak, and Armando Gutierrez, and Graciela Gonzales; Ron  Washington, Shawna Jackson and Han Nguyen, victims of overcrowded classrooms  and assembly-line education, an oxymoron in any teacher's terms.  </P> <P> Wake up, America. Their future is our future.  </P></p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Nestle paid Pounds 30m to take over Clarke Nestle, the Swiss-owned food group, is believed to have paid slightly more than Pounds 30m for the majority of the assets and goodwill of Clarke Foods, Britain's second-largest ice-cream manufacturer which went into receivership last month. The deal means that trade creditors might salvage as much as 50p in the pound. Clarke had debts of about Pounds 25m. Nestle is not believed to have taken on Clarke's debts, although it is understood to have reached an agreement over the Pounds 6m Clarke owed to Alfa-Laval. The Swedish company supplied about Pounds 12m-worth of equipment to the ice-cream manufacturer after Clarke's purchase and relaunch of the Lyons Maid brand. Delays in the installation of this equipment meant Clarke was unable to manufacture ice-cream in time for the hottest months of the summer. It lost many retail outlets as a result. The Nestle bid beat an indirect attempt by Mars to gain the Clarke business.</p>

The number of demonstrations had exceeded 100 by the end of  December last year.    The protests involved members of Chongdaehyop, the National  Alliance for Democracy and Reunification (Chongukyonhap) and  other organizations.    They shouted toward the embassy: "Japanese Government, probe  the truth behind the `comfort women for the Army' issue and make  an official apology and compensation".

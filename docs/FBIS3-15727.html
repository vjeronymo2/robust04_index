According to "Gazprom," Ukraine continues to syphon off up  to  25 percent of Russian gas which goes to West Europe through the  Ukrainian territory. As a result, "Gazprom" has to pay big  fines to foreign consumers of Russian gas. Russia's hard  currency losses amount to half a million dollars a day, the  ministry experts said.    Well-informed sources in the same ministry told Interfax  that  Russia may demand Kiev pay the fines to foreign partners and  reimburse its debt for Russian gas already delivered that  experts estimate at 1.5 Tn rubles.    In addition, Moscow intends to demand guarantees of free  transit of its gas through the Ukrainian territory at the talks  between the heads of the Russian and Ukrainian gas complexes  scheduled for March 10.</p>

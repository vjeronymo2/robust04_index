			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Bush and Clinton The foreign exchange market's attention this week will be firmly focused on the results of tomorrow's US Presidential election, writes James Blitz. The markets have already priced in a victory for Mr Bill Clinton and, unlike previous elections, the dollar has benefited form the prospect of a Democrat with an activist policy stance making it to the White House. Dealers believe that Mr Clinton's commitment to a rise in infrastructure spending funded by tax increases and cuts in the defence budget will force the Federal Reserve to stop cutting interest rates.  The Fed may have to tighten policy to counteract the effect of the boost in fiscal spending. As a result there could be a short-term rise in the dollar this week, following through to next year.  However, two factors may force the dollar's rist to be c hecked. First, even if Mr Clinton is elected, interest rates may still fall. 'Regardless of who wins,' says Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, 'the Fed will be under pressure to cut rates again, and to keep them at low levels until the economy and the banking sector show stronger signs of recovery.' The second possibility, of course, is that Mr George Bush will win tomorrow.  One opionion poll on Friday put them neck-and-neck. Ironically, a republican victory could trigger a fall in the dollar/D-mark rate.  Dealers have become convinced of the merits of a Clinton victory to such an extent that, if he loses, some bullish positions will have to be unwound. Moreover, a Bush victory would probably change little in US economic policy in the short-term.  This would throw the market's focus firmly back on to the sluggish upturn in the US.</p>

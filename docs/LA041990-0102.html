			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY UNIT URGES PAY-RAISE ROLLBACK  </P> <P> The 21% to 43% salary raises for top California State University officials  should be rolled back to only 3.7% and an audit should be done of the  university's administrative costs, an Assembly subcommittee urged in  Sacramento. The unanimous action by the Ways and Means Subcommittee on  Education clearly was intended as a message to the Cal State Board of Trustees,  which will be meeting to deal with the controversial pay hikes and allegations  of secrecy surrounding them. Subcommittee chairman Robert J. Campbell  (D-Richmond) said his budget amendments were intended to make the 20-campus Cal  State system "more responsible, more responsive and more open."  </P></p>

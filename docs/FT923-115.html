			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Sears It seems the market wants to fall in love with Sears. Having missed the boat with the likes of Storehouse and Next this year, fund managers are determined to be aboard any recovery stock in the stores sector. After Sears' interim figures, brokers have a nice story to sell them. A cut in the interim dividend by a third to 1p follows hard on the heels of the painful and expensive exit from menswear retailing. Both suggest that the new chief executive, Mr Liam Strong, is determined to confront the company's problems. Even the reduced dividend provides some underpinning for the shares. If the company pays a total of 3.5p as expected, they will still yield 6 per cent at yesterday's close of 80p. But investors should not get carried away. Down-at-heel British Shoe still has substantial difficulties and the 22 per cent profits fall at Freemans is alarming. Perhaps even more importantly, the whole group needs the magic of attractive new store presentations and innovative retailing ideas, things which Mr Strong has yet to show he can provide. One may also wonder about an asset valuation of 83p a share made in 1988 when recent disposals have been accompanied by red ink. Mr Strong has made a promising start, but he must be all too uncomfortably aware that attempts to change corporate cultures fail more often than they succeed.</p>

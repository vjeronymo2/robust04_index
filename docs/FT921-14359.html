			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / FIS leader urges non-violence Mr Abdelkader Hachani, the FIS leader, told followers yesterday not to clash with the army, saying they could achieve an Islamic state without violence in spite of the scrapping of this week's parliamentary election, Reuter reports from Algiers. Mr Hachani said a junta had staged a coup d'etat but predicted the army would split if ordered to move against the people. 'Confrontation with the army will lead to the break-up of the armed forces, which are one of the Algerian people's achievements.' He appealed to the army not to act as a 'strike force for the junta' and he vowed to pursue his struggle through peaceful means. 'We will arrive at the Islamic state progressively, without concessions. . . with wisdom and political legality,' he added.</p>

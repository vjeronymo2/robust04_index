			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Geneva, June 3 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces  remained within an UN-ordered exclusion zone around Gorazde  Friday, blocking the resumption of truce talks here, the  commander of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, General Bertrand de  Lapresle, said. There were still "barely a few dozen in three  pockets in the exclusion zone," he said.    UN officials have called for a meeting here with Bosnian  Serb  leader Radovan Karadzic to discuss the presence of around 150  Serb forces in Gorazde. The Bosnian Government has demanded  their complete withdrawal in compliance with an April 22  ultimatum as a condition for their attending the talks, called  to arrange an overall ceasefire throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Late Thursday a UN military spokesman said the Serbs had made  no move to withdraw from the exclusion zone, contradicting an  announcement by UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi that they had  begun their pullout.    "There is no evidence at all that the Serbs are  withdrawing,"  UN Protection Force spokesman Dacre Holloway said in Sarajevo.  "Our information is that the situation is exactly the same," he  said, charging that the armed Serb forces had merely donned  civilian clothes and were pretending to be refugees while  continuing to carry guns.    Negotiations due to have opened Thursday were postponed when  it became clear that despite pledges from Karadzic that they  would retreat the Bosnian Serb units had remained in place.  Akashi on Thursday evening said the Serb forces had launched  their withdrawal. "I have received positive news," he told AFP.  "They have started their evacuation, but there are still some  places where they have not moved."    Akashi's spokesman, Michael Williams, later added that about  100 policemen had left the exclusion zone before nightfall. The  reports were flatly contradicted by Major Holloway in Sarajevo.  "The police and militia are wearing civilian clothes," he said.  "But they are still carrying guns. They took their police  uniforms off and claim to be refugees."</p>

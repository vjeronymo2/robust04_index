			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "National News </F> Hookup" program]    [Text] On the morning of 10 May local time, Swedish Prime  Minister Carl Bildt met with Li Ruihuan, chairman of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC], in his office.    Li Ruihuan said: China and Sweden are far away from each  other and have no conflict of basic interests. On the contrary,  there are broad prospects for economic cooperation because the  economies of the two countries are mutually complementary.  China is carrying out large-scale economic development, and  there is much in Sweden's advanced technology and management  experience that we can make use of. During my visit to your  country, I have personally witnessed Swedish entrepreneurs'  desire to strengthen cooperation with China. Our two countries  should exert joint efforts to push bilateral cooperation to a  new stage, which corresponds with the common interests and  aspirations of the two peoples.    The Swedish prime minister said that bilateral relations  between China and Sweden have developed rapidly in recent years,  and he expressed his hope that they will develop further. He  also expressed Sweden's support for China's reentry into the  GATT.

Li Ruihuan said: While developing the  economy, China pays great attention to promoting socialist  democracy and legality. In this regard, the CPPCC is playing an  increasingly important role. Speaker Troedsson said that  experience has shown that Swedish- Chinese cooperation and  exchanges are in accordance with the fundamental interest of the  Swedish and Chinese peoples.

After successfully concluding his visit to Sweden, Chairman  Li Ruihuan left Stockholm by a special plane and, less than an  hour later, arrived at (Kathmond) Airport in Oslo. Upon his  arrival, Chairman Li Ruihuan said in a written statement that  China attaches importance to developing exchanges and  cooperation with Norway in all fields. China wishes to develop  a long-term, stable friendship with Norway.    Bjorn Tore Godal, Norwegian acting prime minister and  foreign  minister, greeted Chairman Li Ruihuan and his entourage in the  hall of the hotel where Chairman Li is staying.    Chairman Li Ruihuan is making an official goodwill visit to  the Kingdom of Norway at the invitation of the Norwegian  Government.</p>

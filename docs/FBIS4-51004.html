			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Aiming to further introduce  [as received] production costs as they seek to sharpen their  competitive edge on the international market, some of the  world's major computer firms, including IBM, Apple, Compaq, and  Hewlett Packard, have decided to increase purchases of locally  made computer products.    Many leading computer companies have set up international  procurement offices here to facilitate purchases of Taiwan-made  computer products as those products have become more competitive  internationally, business sources said.    In the past, IBM has always been the leading foreign buyer  of  computer products in Taiwan. Last year alone, it bought US$382  million worth of Taiwan-made computer products, and the figure  is expected to further grow this year, an executive at the IBM  Taiwan corporation said.    Apple Computer Inc., which will double its purchases here to  US$400 million-US$500 million to make it the largest foreign  buyer of computer products this year, mostly will purchase  family-use computers, monitors, motherboards, notebook  computers, and semiconductors, said Cheng Hung-yu, manager of  the Apple Taiwan branch.    Apple's Taipei Procurement Office will also be expanded to  handle purchases in Mainland China and Hong Kong, Cheng added.    Another active foreign buyer, Hewlett Packard, will also  increase purchases here, purchase manager Chan Chiu-ming said.    Hewlett Packard bought US$60 million worth of Taiwan  computer  products in 1992 and US$90 million in goods last year. The  figure is expected to set a new high of US$100 million this  year, Chan predicted.    In addition to monitors and rectifiers, Hewlett Packard will  increase purchases of motherboards this year, Chan said, citing  the flexibility and advanced know-how of Taiwan computer makers  as the main reasons behind the increased purchases.    And although Compaq has only bought less than US$100 million  worth of Taiwan computer products in each of the past three  years in that figure may swell markedly to US$300 million this  year, Sun Yung-hsiang, managing director at Compaq Taiwan branch  office, said.</p>

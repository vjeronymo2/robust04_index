			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Caparo, Bank of Nova Scotia in India move Caparo, the UK-based industrial group controlled by Mr Swaraj Paul, the prominent expatriate Indian industrialist, and Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia have sought approval from India's government to set up a jointly-owned bank. The new bank, which will provide a full range of retail and commercial services, is expected to have an initial capital of about USDollars 100m. Mr Peter Godsoe, Scotiabank's chief executive, said the partners hoped to obtain official clearance 'relatively early in the new year'. The venture is the latest in a series of moves by foreign financial institutions to take advantage of India's economic reform programme. The UK's National Westminster Bank recently unveiled plans to buy a 20 per cent stake in HDFC Bank, which is promoted by India's Housing Development Financing Corp. Scotiabank, which has the most international ties of Canada's 'Big Six' banks, last week opened its second branch in India. Its business there has so far comprised mainly trade and shipping finance.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Tsongas closes on Clinton A LATE surge by former Senator Paul Tsongas, pictured above at a weekend rally, has turned next week's New Hampshire Democratic primary race into a virtual dead-heat, Lionel Barber writes from Salem. Polls published yesterday show Mr Tsongas within a hair's breadth of Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early favourite in New Hampshire. A month ago Mr Tsongas, who comes from neighbouring Massachusetts, was written-off by the media which mocked his self-effacing humour and unglamorous character. These have now turned into a virtue as allegations of adultery and draft-dodging have hurt Mr Clinton. According to weekend Boston Globe and USA Today/CNN/Gallup polls, Mr Tsongas has drawn within 3 points of Mr Clinton, whose support has slipped to just over 30 per cent. Senator Bob Kerrey, the Vietnam war hero from Nebraska, remains in third place, some 15 points behind Mr Tsongas. Mr Kerrey insisted yesterday the race in New Hampshire was fluid. A complicating factor in the New Hampshire primary will be the degree of 'write in' support for Governor Mario Cuomo of New York. Mr Cuomo is not an official candidate, but voters are allowed to write the name of a candidate of their choice on ballot papers. Mr Tom Harkin, as the home state senator, was thought certain of victory in yesterday's Iowa Democratic caucuses.</p>

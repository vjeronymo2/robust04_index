			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / New bank to finance Russian projects THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is taking a 35 per cent stake in a new bank to provide long-term project finance in Russia. The EBRD board this week approved participation in the Russian Project Finance Bank, a Moscow-based institution which will provide much-needed corporate finance and project finance in the former Soviet republic. The bank will have an initial capital of Dollars 6m, which will rise to Dollars 100m (Pounds 50.7m) after two years. It is starting operations with a staff of 30, some of whom are non-Russian experts seconded by western banking institutions. The bank should employ 125 people by the end of its second year. Ten Russian banks and enterprises will hold stakes amounting to 49 per cent of the bank's capital, while the remaining 16 per cent of the bank will be reserved for the bank's staff under a share ownership scheme. The EBRD hopes to attract western institutions as investors in the bank and will pare back its holding accordingly over time. The project is the brain-child of Mr Sergei Konyachev, aged 37, a former managing director of the Moscow Narodny bank in London, who will be the new bank's first president. The project has involved a significant international effort. The European Commission will provide staff training worth around Ecu7m (Pounds 5.1m). As well as providing medium- and long-term credits, the new bank will carry out treasury and capital market operations. The bank's first chairman comes from the EBRD. He is Mr David Hexter, head of the financial institutions group of the EBRD's merchant banking division. He joined the EBRD recently after working for many years on eastern Europe for Citibank, the US bank.</p>

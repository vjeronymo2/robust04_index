			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: CST Emerging Asia to dismiss fund managers THE BOARD of CST Emerging Asia Trust said it intends to dismiss Jupiter Tyndall, its fund managers, writes John Authers. Jupiter Tyndall has a 29.9 per cent stake in CST, and yesterday proposed the appointment of three new directors to the board. Mr Michael Seal, chairman of CST, said yesterday that this would create 'an unacceptable risk of conflict of interest'. He said: 'Jupiter Tyndall's resolutions amount to an attempt to gain control of the company's board without making an offer of shares.' The CST board said that Jupiter Tyndall's performance as an investment manager in recent months had been poor, and that the company had been 'consistently inflexible' in its approach to negotiation. Mr Seal said that the board had therefore given Jupiter Tyndall 12 months' notice of termination of its contracts as investment manager and administrator. The board is also proposing a special resolution to wind up the company at next year's annual general meeting - three years before it had been planned to do so. The board made it clear that it was reluctant to shorten the life of the trust by three years, but believed the measure would reduce the current discount of the share price to net asset value per share.</p>

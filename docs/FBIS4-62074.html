			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent yekaterina zhilyakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Former Russian Vice-President  Aleksandr Rutskoy was excluded from the list of people invited  to the international week of cooperation of future leaders that  opened in Moscow today, following his call for changes in the  existing system in Russia made at a V-Day rally on May 9.    In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday,  Aleksey Koshmarov, chairman of the Russian movement "Future  Leaders of the New Millennium," said that about 200 young  parliamentarians and members of various parties from Russia, the  United States, France, Germany and other countries will try to  shape up a new image of the political leader for the 21st  century.    "A new type of politics must be distinctive in its  unpredictability, ability to conduct a dialogue and seek a  compromise, rather than conflicts," Koshmarov said.    He stressed that the members of the movement have been  trying  to avoid extremism, both right and left, since it was set up two  years ago.</p>

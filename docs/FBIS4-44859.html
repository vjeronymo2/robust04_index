			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bacteria Produce Interferon Gamma"; </F> "Fraunhofer: The Yield Reaches One Gram Per Liter of Bacteria  Culture"]    [Text] Frankfurt. At the Fraunhofer Institute of Toxicology  and Aerosol Research in Hannover there has been developed an  interferon gamma which is said to be even more effective than  its natural prototype. In the human body interferons are by T  cells and activated wherever cells become diseased or are  threatened by a virus. The interferons attach themselves to  receptors at the appropriate locations on the top side of a cell  and from there send their signals to its nucleus. This, reports  the Fraunhofer Society in Munich, causes the cell to boost its  defenses.    In their work the researchers, Dr Bernd Otto and his  associates used what may be called a trick: the DNS chain  containing the information necessary for protein buildup was  shortened at the critical place so that the proteins lost a few  amino acids. Upon being inoculated with a molecule of this  modified genetic substance, bacteria produce highly effective  interferon gamma.    It is further claimed that the bacteria strains produce each  one gram of interferon per liter of bacteria culture. Because  the bacteria do do not excrete the interferon during metabolism,  they must be kept in a pressure container. The thus retained  protein clusters must be decomposed, renatured, and purified.    The process of manufacturing the new active interferon gamma  has, according to the reports, already passed the laboratory  stage and been further developed. It is now to be marketed by  the Rentschler GmbH [GmbH = Ltd] in Laupheim. The new interferon  gamma is expected to be ready within a few years for clinical  tests.    The tests will show whether and how this market will  develop,  hopes Friedrich E. Rentschler. It is expected that this  interferon will be just as helpful in rheumatic and contagious  diseases as against allergies and chronic diseases of the immune  system.    The interferon thus produced by genetic engineering and the  process by which it is extracted have already been patented in  Germany, patents covering both European and American markets  having been applied for, reports Dr Bernd Otto at the Fraunhofer  Institute of Toxicology and Aerosol Research ITA (1  Nikolai-Fuchs Str., 30625 Hannover; Tel 0511-5350-273, Fax  0511-5350-155).</p>

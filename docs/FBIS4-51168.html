			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "National News </F> Hookup" program]    [Text] While inspecting the social order situation in  Hebei Province's rural areas 18-20 May, Luo Gan, state  councillor and secretary general of the State Council, stressed:  Leaders at various levels must properly handle the relations  among reform, development, and stability and must list the tasks  on maintaining stability in their work schedule. While carrying  out economic construction, they should also simultaneously  handle tasks on maintaining stability. Nationwide stability  mainly depends on rural stability. Once the rural areas are  stable, the whole country will be stable. [video shows Luo Gan,  accompanied by unidentified local rural leaders, visiting and  inspecting various rural localities and addressing and holding  talks with different groups of local people]    Luo Gan said: Hebei's drive in strictly cracking down on  various crimes in most of its rural areas has yielded a very  effective frightening impact. Party and government cadres and  personnel of political and law commissions at the forefront have  worked very hard, have made concerted efforts, and have made  important contributions to safeguarding social stability.    Commenting on ways to maintain rural stability, Luo Gan  pointed out: We should properly handle two events: First, we  should develop production. Second, we should properly and  comprehensively manage social order in rural areas. We should  strengthen the development of grass-roots administration and  organizations. Once a strong rural leading body is established,  it will be able to lead the masses to develop the local economy  and safeguard rural stability. We should let mass autonomous  organizations, including village self-defense committees [chun  zi bao hui] play their proper roles; should intensify the  dissemination of general legal knowledge; and should let the  broad masses of peasants be more familiar with the law. In  particular, we should begin teaching youngsters general legal  knowledge. We should resolve contradictions that arise under  new historic conditions when they are young and are beginning to  develop at an early stage. It is necessary to resolve  contradictions at the grass-roots units. By carrying out  comprehensive management, we should reduce crimes to the lowest  possible level.</p>

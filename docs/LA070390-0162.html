			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> GOLF STORY WAS A FISH TALE  </P> <P> It was apparently just a typical case of trying to make the boss look good when  expert golfer Dan Quayle spread the word that President Bush had beat him on  the links.  </P> <P> "He was just being pleasant, I'll bet," Bush said of his vice president today.  </P> <P> Quayle somewhat sheepishly told reporters. "He won on the first tee."  </P> <P> "Won one hole. That's what he meant," Bush clarified.  </P> <P> Quayle had told reporters on Monday when setting out to golf near Bush's  seaside vacation home that he was "destined to lose."  </P> <P> Quayle is renowned in Washington for his expertise on the golf course. Bush on  the other hand, is trying to improve his somewhat ragged game.  </P> <P> When asked later Monday who won the game at the Cape Arundel Golf Course,  Quayle said, "The President won." Suspicion was widespread that he was speaking  tongue in cheek.  </P></p>

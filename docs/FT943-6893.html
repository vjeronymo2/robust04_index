			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Hand movement restored Surgeons at Salisbury District Hospital plan 12 operations to restore hand movement to patients paralysed by spinal injury, writes Andrew Derrington. Implanted electrodes will stimulate muscles that have been disconnected from the brain. In some cases muscle tendons will be transplanted to give better control. The stimulator will be controlled by shrugging the opposite shoulder. The operations at Salisbury are part of a larger test series, co-ordinated from the US, says Jack Gardner of Inspire Foundation, which is paying for the electronic equipment.

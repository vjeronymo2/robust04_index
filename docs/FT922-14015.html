			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops below 18,000 to five-year low Tokyo THE NIKKEI average fell below the 18,000 level for the first time since November 1986 on arbitrage unwinding and heavy selling of banking shares by foreign investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The final reading for the Nikkei was 644.82 or 3.5 per cent down at 17,791.55, after a high for the day of 18,449.82 and low of 17,775.39. Volume remained thin at 200m shares. Declines overwhelmed rises by 895 to 100, with 111 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks dropped 45.04 or 3.4 per cent to 1,279.57, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 6.80 to 1,016.91. Most dealers were surprised by the weakness in the Nikkei. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said: 'I am really shocked, especially since sentiment seemed to show signs of recovering on Monday.' He added that many foreign investors, who had been looking for bargains, had refrained from activity due to the bearishness. The sharp falls in the Nikkei futures on the Osaka market were triggered by a plunge in the Nikkei 225 futures on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange. Rumours that Japan's stock exchange officials were considering further restrictions to limit derivatives trading worried some market participants. Foreigners were leading sellers of banking shares. The Nikkei 500 bank index has fallen 20 per cent during the past 10 trading days, against a 12 per cent decline in the Nikkei. Mr Alan Bell, deputy head of research at Baring Securities, said a further fall in the banking sector could pull the Nikkei average down by a further 1,000 to 2,000 points. Prominent losers in the financial sector included Industrial Bank of Japan, down Y120 to Y1,520, Mitsubishi Bank, Y170 weaker at Y1,520, and Fuji Bank, which fell by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,270. Less liquid shares in the Nikkei 225 fell on arbitrage-related selling. Shinagawa Refractories lost Y58 to Y843 and Daito Woollen Spinning and Weaving declined Y50 to Y850. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone finished Y14,000 down at Y600,000 on depressed sentiment. Investors were also discouraged by the company's plans to lower prices of long distance calls, which is expected to squeeze NTT's profits by as much as Y80bn. Some industrial blue chips were firm on bargain hunting. NEC improved Y9 to Y984 and Fujitsu edged ahead Y2 to Y659. However, semiconductor-related stocks, which rose previously on hopes of a market recovery in the US, lost ground on short-term profit-taking. Teac, the most active issue of the day, relinquished Y56 to Y825. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 474.65 to 19.410.20 in volume of 8.5m shares. Roundup TOKYO'S 3.5 per cent fall depressed most of the Pacific Rim, with Seoul finishing at its lowest level for 18 months. Kuala Lumpur remained closed. HONG KONG had Monday's losses reversed on bargain hunting and the Hang Seng index gained 29.53 to 4,926.43 in turnover of HKDollars 1.77bn, after HKDollars 1.38bn. HSBC Holdings, which has been driven lower recently on concern over its planned merger with Midland Bank, of the UK, and its exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property group, recovered HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 39.25. SEOUL was depressed by news that the central bank planned to tighten money supply later this month. The composite index fell 10.93 to 579.09 in turnover of Won287,84bn. SINGAPORE was slightly easier, the Straits Times Industrial index ending 1.34 off at 1,385.73 in turnover of SDollars 85.3m. TAIWAN fell on late selling. The weighted index declined 38.36 to 4,613.74 in turnover of TDollars 12.37bn. against TDollars 11.8bn. MANILA's composite index rose a further 8.39 to 1,139.82 in turnover of 135m pesos. Philippine Long Distance Telephone put on 15 pesos to 845 pesos following a good overnight gain in the US. BANGKOK rose on expectations that the new prime minister would soon be appointed. The SET index added 5.77 at 832.39 in Bt5.6bn turnover. BOMBAY's fall continued, with the BSE index ending 39.46 lower at 4,023.11. AUSTRALIA closed off its intraday high as the market reacted to the fall in Tokyo. The All Ordinaries index, which had risen 16 points earlier, finished just 6.9 ahead at 1,583.7 in turnover of ADollars 258.5m. News Corp was 12 cents firmer at ADollars 17.82, Coles Myer rose 14 cents to ADollars 11.68 and BHP advanced 8 cents to ADollars 13.52. NEW ZEALAND was pulled lower by weakness in Telecom shares. The NZSE-40 index shed 10.47 to 1,390.83 in turnover of NZDollars 20m. Telecom declined 12 cents to NZDollars 2.02.</p>

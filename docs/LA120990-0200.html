			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OUTAGE GROUNDS 'GLORY' ANGELS  </P> <P> The flying angels of "The Glory of Christmas" were temporarily grounded  Saturday when a transformer failed in the Crystal Cathedral, forcing the  cancellation of an afternoon performance of the Christmas pageant and delaying  two evening shows.  </P> <P> Cathedral officials said the 1 p.m. outage resulted in chaos for the cast --  including an assorted menagerie -- and crew in the extravagant production, a  $2-million retelling of the birth of Christ.  </P> <P> "It was total panic," said Crystal Cathedral Manager Terry Larson. "We were  trying to talk to people with tickets. . . . The crews were running around  trying to fix it."  </P> <P> Some 3,000 people who had bought tickets to the 4:30 p.m. performance had to be  turned away. The show was cancelled after a transformer that controls all of  the theatrical lighting failed. Two later shows were delayed an hour.  </P> <P> "We have four emergency generators, but they can't handle all of the theatrical  lighting that goes on with the show," Larson said.  </P> <P> The elaborate show includes a live menagerie of lambs, goats, sheep, horses,  donkeys, an ox and a cow, plus eight angels suspended by wires to fly through  the cathedral's expanse.  </P></p>

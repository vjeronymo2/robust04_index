			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] For nearly one hour and a half Polish Television has  transmitted a meeting between President Lech Walesa and  journalists at the Gdansk television studios. At this televised  news conference Walesa replied to many questions. Among other  things he said the Constitution should be adopted before the  presidential elections. We have for you but a few minutes from  this long meeting. There are three questions, the first one  about political options.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You have  recently called the right-wing leaders nincompoops. You said  about the leader of the left that his idol was Stalin. About  Solidarity you say it is no longer your Solidarity. So I wanted  to ask what is your option.    [Walesa] I am carrying out precisely that which I have been  asked to do by politicians, political parties, and the public.  Recall, ladies and gentlemen, that during the period when I was  forming the Belweder [presidential palace] set up, everyone  thought that the president should be above parties, that he  should not be linked to anyone, that he should be a mediator,  that he should stand guard over, and so on. That is precisely  what I have carried out. In connection with this today, I do  not represent an option directly, although I have one. I hope I  will not have to change this conception, which I also like.    [Unidentified correspondent] Your choice, as far as the  latest foreign visit was concerned, was Latvia. Latvia, as we  all know, is probably the country most at conflict or at odds  with the Russian Federation because of its Russian minority. At  the same time the president voiced hard words--received, by me  for instance, with satisfaction--addressed at Russia. Is the  president playing out some sort of major issue here of, say,  positioning with respect to a powerful neighbor?    [Walesa] Ladies and gentlemen: As far as my trips outside  the country are concerned, this too is perceived in a variety of  ways by the public. My trips are programmed by the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. It is not my whim that I want to go somewhere.    Whereas as far as Latvia is concerned, it is indeed a big  problem, and as far as Russia is concerned that is another  problem. Ladies and gentlemen: Here there is--and yesterday,  this sort of quarrel with you comes from us having enormously  grand topics. [sentence as heard] For example, Russia and  Latvia. Well, we have to speak about them. Is it just me who  is supposed to speak about it? After all, we have stopped  calling them to account for Katyn [burial site of murdered  Polish officers in World War II], for the murders. The things  that had been done, the things old Russia and the Soviet Union  used to do, you just would not believe it; Hitler was a mere  understudy. Don't you know that?    Now it is like this, we are now forgiving them, because it  is  no longer the same Russia, because there is no Soviet Union, we  behave--we, we understand this. How does Russia reply to this?  It wants to be a superpower! It wants us again in its embrace!    You have to--of course not like me just now, not so  emotionally--you have to write about this, you have to tell the  world: Listen, then it was our grandfathers and tomorrow it will  be you, unless the whole of Europe defends itself against this,  unless the whole of Europe says: Hang on a minute, is Poland  free, Minister Kozyrev? Is it entitled to make independent  decisions? What business is it of yours?    We do not threaten--we want a free Russia, we are going  to--we are prepared to defend a free Russia. But say it the  other way. Poland chooses its own partners. For as long as I am  president no one is going to choose partners for me. I am going  to do it in accordance with the will of the people. Will the  Western partner withstand this? Well, here, as you can see,  things vary.    During my term of office, I am going to want to bring about  greater security in Europe, I am going to want greater  prosperity. As I say, I am going to say what I think both to  President Clinton and to President Yeltsin. I am not going to  wear kid gloves. The truth will always be the truth and  Poland's freedom will be Poland's freedom.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, regarding this  question from the viewers, why are you overthrowing the  government, why are you questioning the legality of the  government, how do you intend to resolve your conflict with  parliament? A whole series of questions, well, accusing you of  badly arranging your relations with parliament and what are your  answers...    [Walesa interrupting] Hang on a minute, hang on a minute,  why  is it that some people are always seeing me as the guilty one.  I do not want to overthrow any government. I am just saying  that the coalition said one thing and is doing another, that it  proposed one program and is proposing another. That is one. I  am not overthrowing any government.    Well, I think that the government should rule as long as  possible but it should rule in accordance with the will of the  people. But (?first)...    [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to pick up here,  is  that all right?    [Walesa] Hang on a minute, hang on a minute. So far, as you  have noticed, between the government there have been no large  conflicts. Of course there might have been some squabbles  dragged into the daylight by journalists, but so far there has  not been any conflict, let us make it clear, there is none from  my side.    On the other hand with parliament, well, it arose not  through  me--there too there hadn't been a conflict, in spite of  everything we walked about together without stepping on each  other's toes. It was only when they rejected the first  reading--and that was arrogance, that was spite--so I am not  going to play spite. Ladies and gentlemen: I am, in spite of  everything, the president. That is, even if I am merely  submitting a draft, they should start discussion. I am not a  little boy. In connection with this, it was not I who made this  conflict, I would not have made it, I am a very accommodating  man. But no one is going to walk all over me. [end recording]</p>

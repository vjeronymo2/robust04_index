			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Petr Bakovsky: "Baudys Described the Partnership </F> for Peace Project as Clinton's Success"]    [Text] Prague -- The Partnership for Peace is a call and  an offer for closer cooperation among those who will join it.  It can create the conditions for establishing a safe zone in  Europe, Defense Minister Baudys said.    "A number of critics say that the process is very slow.  However, we have been unable to find anything better so far,  something that would be accepted by all NATO members," Baudys  said and continued: "I see the fact that all parties were able  to reach a complete agreement as a significant success of  Clinton's administration, and also his own personal success."    According to Baudys, it is also theoretically possible to  look at the matter like thus: If NATO decided to admit several  new members now, then all the Partnership For Peace processes  would have to be started anyway. The only difference would be:  We would have security guarantees from the very beginning.  Baudys also believes that guarantees are not an issue at this  time. "We can see no actual danger in Europe, for the time  being."    Baudys explained what the Partnership For Peace program  demands of the army. He said that we would have to find a  certain number of very capable young officers to undergo foreign  language training. "We would give them a six-month course of  intensive language training, international law, and NATO  organization. They should acquire the necessary knowledge of  coordinating, planning, and organizing activities, so they can  represent us in NATO institutions."    The preparation of joint exercises and actions is the second  step. Baudys said that several military exercises were agreed  with France outside the Partnership For Peace program. Joint  exercises with smaller units from Holland have also been  planned. Baudys said that in consultations with NATO countries,  we were informed beforehand and had time to prepare ourselves.    Baudys described as the most important prerequisite for our  joining NATO equipping our army with NATO-compatible  communication and telecommunication systems. Replacement of the  arsenal will continue in the years to come, but this is not the  most important factor.    It is expected, according to the Partnership For Peace  program, that individual countries will be able to provide some  of their forces in case of need. According to Baudys, apart  from other units, the fully professional Rapid Deployment  Brigade could be used for this purpose. This brigade is in the  process of being established and will be given priority when  providing new equipment to army units. The brigade should have  some 3,500 people. Baudys sees a problem in the selection of  proper people for the brigade. This is why the Defense Ministry  is preparing a publicity action to help acquire proper people.  The ministry is examining all the possibilities of financing  the brigade in such a way as to make service in they brigade  attractive.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Bosnia fighting flares as UN seeks ceasefire Serb and Bosnian government forces at the weekend fought for control of strategic supply routes, as the UN said a new round of talks aimed at brokering a ceasefire would convene this week, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. Despite ongoing clashes, Lord Owen, EU negotiator, said: 'I think there's a fairly good chance of getting a ceasefire in the next few weeks.' But he appeared uncertain as to whether the warring factions would endorse a settlement on Bosnia's partition. International mediators last week put forward a revised version of a settlement giving the new Moslem-Croat federation 51 per cent of Bosnia and the Bosnian Serbs 49 per cent. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said he would rejoin peace talks, making clear that his side will back a ceasefire, but stop short of a political settlement. The Bosnian government fears a ceasefire would cement Serb gains, about 70 per cent of Bosnian territory. Mr Karadzic said Serbs were ready to sacrifice land if sanctions are lifted but remain far from accepting proposals for a 49-51 ratio. 'Maybe we could accept 49 per cent, if they give us Tuzla and Sarajevo,' he said yesterday, reported Vecernje Novosti, the Belgrade daily. In remarks likely to raise Bosnian government fears, Mr Karadzic said: 'It is now certain that we have a state, we just must take care for it to be as big as possible.' Meanwhile, both sides claimed civilian losses in fighting in the strategic Sava River valley, northern Bosnia. Serb forces had appeared to regain strategic high ground near Tuzla, the Bosnian stronghold in the northeast.</p>

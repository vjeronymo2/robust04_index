			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Arts: Essence of domesticity - Architecture Looking at architecture today, the most satisfactory new buildings are those that achieve a symbiosis between contemporary innovation and tradition. It was probably always that way. When Michelangelo converted the buildings on the Campidoglio in Rome, he was bringing an innovative classicism to a traditional civic space. There are some architects who can do this today, but they are few and far between and often the object of ridicule from a dogmatic profession that only wants to promote hard-line modernism. It is worth looking back to the recent past when there were many architects, working in and around the arts and crafts movement, who successfully and enjoyably combined a sense of tradition with inventiveness. One of the very best, and one who has been somewhat neglected by critics and scholars, is Charles Voysey. Known as CFA Voysey (1857-1941), he designed interiors and furniture as well as buildings and his work is the subject of an important small exhibition at the Design Museum. Anyone who has worked with an architect in a domestic setting knows how rare it is to find one interested in furniture or accomplished in the field of interior design. The rise of the professional decorator in this century has been helped to no small degree by the contempt so many architects have shown to colour, decoration and interior design. Voysey's exceptional vision of the composite whole has never had quite the recognition given to designers like Pugin, Morris and Mackintosh. This exhibition is a success for two reasons. It is small and well chosen and it is as much about the man as his work. Voysey's life was unconventional. His clergyman father was dismissed from the Anglican church for teaching questionable doctrine and went on to set up his own Theistic Church, which developed a substantial middle class following. Charles Voysey, in his work and in his private life, inherited his father's strong sense of individuality. He was no follower and his very best works - the series of important houses built mainly in the 1880s - still appear today as highly original and immediately recognisable as 'pure Voysey'. His style achieved an essence of domesticity that influenced the development of English house design at all levels. Because he believed that art affected all aspects of life he developed a belief in simplicity of design and a limited palette of materials that brought a huge draught of air into the stuffiness of Victorian England. His work is undoubtedly revolutionary - unpolished oak, whitewash, brass fittings, and a decorative treatment of materials and wallpaper that is almost innocent in its naive contrivance. To have lived in one of Voysey's houses like Broadleys on Lake Windermere in the Lake District or in The Orchard, Chorley Wood must have been like sleeping every night in fresh linen sheets. The sense of light, cleanliness and uncluttered life is truly refreshing to body and soul. But Voysey was not without fantasy or sentiment as his designs for furniture, materials and silverware clearly show. The painted clock with its domed top, (you can buy a replica at the Design Museum), is itself a microcosm of Voysey's clean world where birds sing all day and there is an unreal sense of purity. By all accounts Voysey was not an easy man to work with and his rigidity of character lost him many friends. But he is one of those architects and designers that has to be taken on his own terms. He offers a tough but brilliant vision. Everything he designed, and take a close look at the circular silver toast rack in the exhibition, is thought through from the inside out. That is what makes good design. This approach, combined with an understanding of the vernacular and the landscape, where he carefully placed his houses, produced a sense of simple elegance and progressive creation that is full of valuable lessons for us today. He was also economical. By paring things down to a minimum and, for example, not polishing oak or brass, he made his houses look entirely natural with no sense of the extravagant. In many ways he is a man for the 1990s - his sense of the calm home is what we need in an economic climate that has made us value our houses as homes and not just as inflationary investments. A visit to 'Heart and Home' is both timely and aesthetically instructive. As Sir Edwin Lutyens said of him: 'No detail was too small for Voysey's volatile brain, and it was not so much his originality, though original he was, as his consistency which proved such a source of delight.'

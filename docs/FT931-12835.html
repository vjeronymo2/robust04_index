			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Boeing jobs at risk after sharp cut in 747 production THE recession in the world's aviation industry was underscored yesterday when Boeing, the largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, announced a sharp cut in production and Pratt &amp; Whitney, a leading engine supplier, said it would slash employment by a quarter over the coming two years. The production cuts will affect component suppliers worldwide, including Lucas and Smiths Industries of the UK. Output of the 747 will be reduced from five aircraft a month to three a month in the second quarter of 1994. Production of all Boeing's models will drop from 32.5 a month to 21 a month over the same period. Boeing said it had yet to determine the impact of the cuts on employment but it was expected to be 'significant'. The company cut some 7,600 jobs in 1992. The cuts at Boeing include the 747, its biggest and most profitable product and its only model to have avoided production slowdowns over the past year. Boeing also announced fourth quarter net earnings before accounting changes of Dollars 377m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, down from earnings of Dollars 403m, or Dollars 1.17 a share. Sales were Dollars 7.5bn, against Dollars 7.8bn in the fourth quarter of last year. United Technologies, the parent of Pratt &amp; Whitney, yesterday unveiled a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 333m, or Dollars 2.77 a share, on sales of Dollars 5.7bn after taking pre-tax charges of Dollars 701m or Dollars 3.45 a share. That compares with a loss of Dollars 1.22bn, or Dollars 10.33 a share, in the same period of 1991. The charge - against the operations of Pratt &amp; Whitney, as well as United Technology's flight systems division and general corporate expenses - includes Dollars 447m for credit and other exposures to the airline industry, Dollars 169m for contract matters, and Dollars 85m for additional restructuring. Pratt &amp; Whitney, which lost some Dollars 500m last year, said it planned to cut employment to no more than 30,000 by the end of 1994, from 40,664 at the start of this year. Boeing insisted its cuts were not tied to any particular customer. However, Japan Airlines, one of the biggest 747 customers, indicated earlier this month that it would delay taking delivery of some of the aircraft and analysts said two US carriers, Northwest and United Airlines, wanted a stretched delivery time-table.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>   [Text] Jurmala, 26 Apr -- Groups of experts from the two  countries' delegations started work in Jurmala today within the  framework of the preparations for the meeting of the presidents  of Latvia and Russia. Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian  delegation, noted that amendments cannot be made to the already  initialled package of agreements, which consists of four  documents. However, the interests of the Latvian side will  possibly be taken into account during discussion of the  mechanism for implementing individual points.    Reaffirming Russia's willingness to withdraw its troops from  Latvia by 31 August, Zotov stressed that only the signing of the  entire package of documents relating to the withdrawal of the  army units would be acceptable to Russia.    In his turn Guntis Ulmanis, as was reported at his office,  is  insisting on the introduction of substantial corrections into  the agreement on social protection for military pensioners  resident in Latvia. Today representatives of the foreign policy  departments of the two countries will set the date in Moscow for  the meeting with President Yeltsin.</p>

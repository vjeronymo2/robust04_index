			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling in the frame Not only did sterling's close yesterday of DM2.915 put it well within its narrow band range for the first time since November, but the British currency finally ceded bottom place in the system to the Danish krone. No doubt there will be clamour for Mr Norman Lamont to celebrate by moving to narrow bands and cutting interest rates. Such hopes still look premature. Part of sterling's gain was due to D-Mark weakness on worries about political instability in Russia. Such alarms have a habit of being transitory, as the response to last year's abortive coup showed. It would be dangerous, too, to base expectations for monetary policy on the latest report of the five top German economic institutes. Their call for the Bundesbank to cut rates later in the year is likely to go unheeded as long as money supply is growing three percentage points above its target ceiling. The US may have shaved its rates, but there is no reason for Japanese financial turmoil to deflect the Bundesbank from its obsession with reducing Germany's 4.7 per cent inflation rate. Sterling's higher level against the D-Mark may thus prove temporary. If not, the government will have to make up its mind on narrow bands. The step could be taken as soon as sterling is both firm and towards the middle of its range. It is worth recalling, though, that sterling might then be harder to defend if pressure built up for a more general realignment. The move to narrow bands would presumably also allow a small cut in interest rates. But the UK's inflation and import performance still leave room for improvement, and there is less hurry now the election is over. There is a case for waiting, even if it deprives the market of the stimulus it craves.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: A storm brewing in the Caribbean - Banana exporters' fears about EU market access Caribbean banana exporters are relieved at the European Court's rejection of a German challenge to the European Union's controversial banana import regime, but they remain concerned about possible attacks on their preferential access to the lucrative EU market. The fears are based on expected challenges to the EU regime from some Latin American producers; a better chance of success for these challenges under new rules at the World Trade Organisation which succeeds the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year, and the position of influential countries, such as the US, which oppose the regulation of trade on which the EU's banana import regime is based. 'The ruling by the European Court is a positive sign and has brought the Caribbean industry some relief,' says Mr Marshall Hall, chief executive of the Producers' Group, which markets Jamaican fruit. 'But there is danger on the horizon with Latin American producers, Germany and the United States still trying to get the Gatt solution implemented.' Mr Byron Blake, assistant secretary general of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), a grouping of all Caribbean regional producers except Surinam, agrees that there are 'some daggers still pointed at the heart of the Caribbean's banana sector'. One of these is a German legal challenge to an agreement reached in March between the EU and several Latin American producers to allow tariff-free imports of 2.1m tonnes a year of Latin fruit. 'The fact that the European Court has rejected the challenge to the import regime would suggest that this other challenge to the EU-Latin American deal will be treated similarly,' says Mr Blake. 'But we would be well advised not to make any such assumptions.' The EU's banana import regime, which was implemented 15 months ago, imposes the quota for Latin American fruit. Suppliers from the Caribbean, Africa and Pacific region have access to the remainder of the EU's needs of about 1.5m tonnes per year, tariff-free. The industry's administrators in the Windward Islands, the source of about two thirds of the bananas imported by Britain, say they are worried about a lobby mounted by US companies which farm bananas in Latin America to maintain the US government's challenge of the EU banana import regime. One St Lucian official said: 'The lobby being mounted by these large, multinational fruit companies, which control the lion's share of the world's banana trade, will strengthen the US resolve to attack our access to the EU market.' Caribbean producers feel most threatened, however, by the planned changes in the way complaints about trade will be treated when the WTO is established. Following complaints by Latin American producers, Gatt panels twice ruled that the EU's import regime was unfair. However, neither ruling was adopted as they did not have the necessary consensus among members. Under the WTO, a similar ruling by a panel will be considered adopted unless there is consensus among members that it should not be. Guatemala, which did not agree to the new quotas for Latin producers, has already indicated that it will make an early complaint to the WTO. Caribbean banana exporters are aware that the new trade rules will force them to compete with other producers on the same terms. The necessity to cut production costs is accepted, but difficult to implement, according to the industry's administrators. Small producers on the islands cannot hope to enjoy the economies of scale of the Latin American multinationals. 'There will have to be a change in the relationship between producers, administrators and those who market the fruit,' says Mr Blake.</p>

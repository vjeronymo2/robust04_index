			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Management: How to bridge the culture gap - Tips for exporters Successful exporting is not simply a question of learning the language. The real problem for the exporter engaged in direct selling abroad is to understand the culture, suggests George Young, author of The New Export Marketer.* To the European businessman or woman tight schedules are taken as a sign of status and efficiency and an opposite number with an empty and endlessly accommodating diary arouses suspicion. Expectations are often quite otherwise in Asian or Middle Eastern countries where setting a prior deadline or putting a guillotine on discussion may be seen as quite insulting. To be kept waiting in an outer office is seen by a Western businessman as a snub but in Latin America to be kept waiting for an hour is of little significance. The same attitude often applies to correspondence. A delay of a month or two in a reply from a Japanese businessman does not necessarily mean a loss of interest. It is often a sign that your proposition is being investigated from every angle. Greetings and leave-taking also vary in different cultures. The British do not shake hands as much as many continental Europeans. In the Middle East, in a casual encounter, men almost always shake hands on meeting, chat for a few minutes and then shake hands on leaving. A second encounter on the same day would follow the same sequence. The subjects which can be brought up in 'warm-up' conversations must be chosen carefully. A Frenchman would be acutely embarrassed if you raised the issue of the financial status of his company while a Canadian would not think twice, Young suggests. An Arab would be upset by being asked about his wife and children in casual conversation; an American would react differently. Small businesses are unlikely to have the resources to afford the cultural training undertaken by some large companies but by consulting libraries, making exploratory visits and noting the accounts of experienced travellers valuable knowledge can be gained. Elsewhere in this volume the author looks at issues such as market research, export pricing, promotion and dealing with export administration. *Published by Kogan Page. 120 pages. Pounds 16.95.</p>

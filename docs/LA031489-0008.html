			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Muslim-led troops bombarded Beirut's Christian-held port in a new round of  sectarian moves against air and sea traffic, security sources said. The port  came under Muslim fire despite a conciliatory move by the Christian premier and  army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, who lifted a two-day shutdown of  Beirut's international airport. The rival Muslim Cabinet of acting Premier  Salim Hoss ordered the closing of Beirut's main port and Juniyah harbor,  controlled by a hard-line Christian militia, in retaliation for Aoun's ban on  flights. The Christian crackdown on the airport came in retaliation for weekend  battles with Druze militiamen, sparked in turn by Aoun's blockade of smaller,  militia-controlled ports used for bringing in weapons.  </P></p>

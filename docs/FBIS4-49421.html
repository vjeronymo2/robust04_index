			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kenneth Ko] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Radio, Film and Television of China  has signed an agreement with Asia Satellite Telecommunications  Co (AsiaSat) to buy two Ku-band transponders on AsiaSat-2  satellite.    With the latest purchase the ministry is committed to buy  three Ku-band transponders on the satellite.    The ministry also signed two five-year lease agreements with  AsiaSat for the renewal of two C-band transponders on AsiaSat-1  satellite.    Peter Jackson, chief executive of AsiaSat, said: "AsiaSat  has established a wide customer base in China, and we believe  the reason is our reputation for quality in the marketplace.    "We are proud of our association with China and that we are  able to provide our services to its people. Our cooperation  will be further strengthened with this commitment from the  Ministry of Radio, Film and Television."    AsiaSat-2 is set for launch in the first quarter of next  year. It has 24 C-band transponders and nine Ku-band  transponders.    C-band transponders' coverage stretches from Turkey to Japan  and from the Commonwealth of Independent States to Australia and  New Zealand. Ku-band transponders cover mainly China and its  neighbouring countries.    China now leases 6-1/2 transponders on AsiaSat-1 to 16  customers.    AsiaSat's applications in China range from television  broadcasting to public and private networks, used by  high-profile industry leaders and ministries.    The PEOPLE'S DAILY newspaper is using AsiaSat 1 for its  distribution in China, the People's Bank of China for its  national clearance system and Civil Aviation Administration of  China for air ticket reservations network.</p>

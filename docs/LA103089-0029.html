			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> A VERY SERIOUS 'IDOMENEO' AT WAR MEMORIAL IN SAN FRANCISCO  </P> <P> There are scholars who regard "Idomeneo" as Mozart's masterpiece. It is  grandiose, graceful, eminently noble. It documents a daring expansion of  conventional idioms and Baroque forms. It stands as an archetypically serious  example of the ancient genre known as opera seria.  </P> <P> With its symmetrical set-piece rituals, its concern for a vaguely heroic  antiquity, its unabashed length and its blithe manipulation of Greek mythology,  "Idomeneo" has never appealed very much to the masses. First performed in  Munich in 1781, it didn't reach America until 1947, when Boris Goldovsky  ventured a modest production in Tanglewood. The San Francisco premiere occurred  only in 1977, and the mighty Metropolitan didn't get around to the challenge  until 1982, when the title role served as an unlikely vehicle for Luciano  Pavarotti.  </P> <P> The new production at the San Francisco Opera, seen on Friday, is essentially a  labor of love on the part of John Pritchard, the resident music director. He  had assisted Fritz Busch in the epochal Glyndebourne premiere back in 1951.  After the death of the great German conductor, Pritchard took over the baton  the next summer. He went on to lead numerous revivals as well as a historic  recording. This man knows "Idomeneo."  </P> <P> At least he knows one version of the opera. It is a version based, rather  loosely, on the edition Mozart prepared for an amateurish production in Vienna  five years after the Munich premiere. This version, arranged at least in part  by the uncredited Hans Gal, re-aligns some portions of the score, sanctions  generous cuts and transposes the castrato role of the prince, Idamante, for a  tenor. (Some modern stagings have coped with the vocal and sexual identity  crisis by casting a mezzo-soprano in the part.)  </P> <P> One can argue that there are better ways of performing "Idomeneo." Even the  excellent San Francisco program magazine makes that argument ("It would be a  mistake," writes Max Loppert, "to insist that this Vienna version represents  the composer's last word"). One also can argue that Pritchard's affectionate  scheme of music making -- suave, clean, eminently poised -- is somewhat at odds  with the more vital, more florid style sanctioned by contemporary musicology.  </P> <P> Still, the dedication and authority at work here are admirable. "Idomeneo" can  be more exciting, more flamboyant, more authentic than San Francisco suggests.  It certainly can be better embellished. But if this "Idomeneo" errs, at least  it errs tastefully.  </P> <P> The physical production, directed by John Copley and designed by John Conklin,  reflects complementary conservatism. The quasi-Cretan sets -- a clever network  of overlapping scrims and sliding wall panels -- project stylized vistas that  accommodate classical cliches, literal details and gently surreal distortions.  The costumes adhere to the banal but elegant anachronism of 18th-Century  fashions for survivors of the Trojan War. The action scheme savors the economy  of repose.  </P> <P> The cast, generally able, turns out to be more notable for eagerness than for  virtuosity. Wieslaw Ochman conveys the mature agonies of the titular king with  knowing restraint and sings eloquently despite limited agility. Hans Peter  Blochwitz -- a tiny jewel glittering oddly in his ear -- personifies refinement  as his potentially sacrificial son. The other tenors in this tenor-heavy  ensemble are William Lewis, a dignified Arbace sadly deprived of his arias, and  Randall Outland, a High Priest with a high and feeble voice.  </P> <P> The central women cannot provide the wonted conflict of lyricism vs. drama.  Karita Mattila looks exquisite and sounds limpid as the virtuous Ilia. Nancy  Gustafson looks equally lovely and sounds just as radiant as the nasty and  tempestuous Elettra. Neither musters much force when it comes to the demands of  ornate flight.  </P> <P> Kenneth Cox, the lone bass on the premises, intones Neptune's deus-ex-machina  pronouncements from afar -- too far afar. The chorus, trained by Ian Robertson,  performs with resonant splendor and even a trace of urgency. In this context,  one is grateful for any trace of urgency.  </P> <P> Incidental intelligence: The huge nylon net suspended just below the ceiling to  catch falling post-earthquake plaster has thus far caught very little. Nor does  it seem to have had any adverse effect upon the reverberant acoustic of the War  Memorial Opera House.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> ANTI-CRIME MEASURE QUALIFIES FOR BALLOT  </P> <P> A court-reform initiative sponsored by Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) was  certified Tuesday to appear on the June 6 ballot, Secretary of State March Fong  Eu announced.  </P> <P> Eu said in Sacramento that random sampling conducted by her office indicated  that 665,162 of the signatures submitted with the Royce initiative were valid.  To put a measure on the ballot requires 655,034 names.  </P> <P> With Tuesday's certification, the Royce measure becomes the first initiative to  qualify for the June ballot, which also features nine other legislative  proposals, including a gas tax increase.  </P> <P> Royce's measure, known as the Crime Victims' Initiative, is designed to  streamline criminal trials by changing the way jurors are selected and by  imposing time constraints on court-appointed attorneys. It also expands the  definition of first-degree murder and broadens the use of capital punishment  for murders committed under special circumstances.  </P></p>

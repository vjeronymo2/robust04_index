			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Muharrem Seseri: "The Publication of Maps Is </F> Culture"]    [Text] The technical-engineering personnel of the Army  Topographical Institute should be thanked for publishing a road  map of Albania. We hope that this map will be followed by others  to fill in the gaps in Albanian cartography. We know that every  map, in addition to the subject matter which it treats, also has  a political influence. For example, in the bookstores of Skopje,  Macedonians were selling their maps which included all of Lake  Ohrid and two lakes in Prespa. But the Greeks are producing, and  even bringing into Albania maps on which their border extends as  far as Lake Shkumbi. The road map was prepared and published  this year. Therefore, it is unexplainable why the name of the  state to the north and northeast of Albania continues to be  listed as "Yugoslavia," when it is known that the republic of  Kosova has been recognized by the Albanian parliament. The  presentation on our geographic maps of the places of residence  of Albanians is a patriotic necessity. Today, when a number of  states are taking action for the defense of Kosovo, we should be  doing more. Concretely, the road map published by the Army  Topographical Institute should include all of Kosovo. Indeed,  Cameria [part of southern Albania which is under Greek rule]  should also be included in a map of all the Albanian lands. In  the mileage tables, there is no reason why the distance to  Pristina, Gjakovo, Tetovo, or Filati should not be shown. The  republic of Macedonia has been recognized by the Albanian state  but the map published by Albanians in Tirana ignores this name!  Thanks to democracy, Albanians now move freely and do business  outside the Balkans. The maps could show the routes which they  could take and give comparative mileage. As soon as possible,  maps should be published for foreign businessmen and tourists. A  prepublication review would improve their content and appearance.</p>

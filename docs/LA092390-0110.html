			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER COMES TO AN END IN NAME ONLY  </P> <P> Convertible tops were down all over town on Saturday as summer came to an end  in Los Angeles on a toasty warm day filled with mixed signals of the changing  seasons.  </P> <P> With only a smattering of puffy clouds and the thermometer touching 81 at the  Civic Center and 74 at Santa Monica beach, the weather was summer all the way.  </P> <P> Today's weather is expected to be much the same, according to the forecast from  WeatherData Inc., which supplies meteorological information to The Times.  </P> <P> Though a shirtless, barefoot man padded toward the beach in Santa Monica at  noon, there were other indications throughout the region that the book was  closing on summer.  </P> <P> Petunias were drooping. Crisp apples were crowding out juicy peaches on  supermarket shelves. At a Sav-On drugstore on Sepulveda Boulevard, the beach  hat shelf was bare, but aisles were overflowing with Halloween candy and  plastic pumpkins. There was only one floating lounge chair, but a whole rack of  Christmas cards.  </P> <P> In Pasadena, the annual ritual of choosing the 1991 Tournament of Roses Queen  got under way. At local beaches, about 2,000 gathered to clean up from what  amounts to a three-month beach party, fanning out with blue and green sacks to  collect the summer's discards.  </P> <P> The event, part of the sixth annual nationwide Adopt-A-Beach Coastal Clean Up  Day, yielded everything from underwear to an electric clock, said Susan McCabe  of the Santa Monica Bay Restoration project, one of the sponsors of the  cleanup. The most common item found on the beach was cigarette butts, she said.  </P> <P> According to a spokesman for the California Coastal Commission, 12,000 pounds  of trash and 3,000 pounds of recyclable materials were collected from the sand  at Los Angeles County beaches.  </P> <P> Another group of about 150 had a heavenly purpose for spending the last day of  summer gathered at the water's edge. The choir, from the Baptist Tabernacle  Church in downtown Los Angeles, tried mightily to compete with the sound of the  surf, while children frolicked nearby in the sand.  </P> <P> The crowd, which had encircled a portable altar, parted and two men of the  cloth waded out into the ocean and turned back toward the sand. Each fully  clothed member of the flock pushed past the waves for a baptismal dip in the  Pacific.  </P> <P> Across town in Pasadena, the first step was taken in the selection process for  the 1991 Pasadena Rose Queen and her court. As birds chirped and pink blossoms  fell from a kapok tree, 500 young women, most of them in flowery summer  dresses, walked across a curved path in the Rose Garden at Tournament House.  </P> <P> Each had about 15 seconds or so to tell the nine blue-shirted men why she  wanted to be Rose Queen. The next step was a photo with one of two bouquets of  roses that were passed from candidate to candidate.  </P> <P> Phyllis Bradley, 17, a senior at John Muir High School in Pasadena, got a big  laugh from the judges. "I told them if I wouldn't have come my mother would  have had a heart attack," she said afterward.  </P> <P> At Westwood Park, another group of mothers and fathers were heavily involved in  a seasonal ritual. Soccer season was under way and while a swarm of 6 and  7-year-old boys in droopy shorts and knee socks chased a ball around the field,  their parents shrieked encouragement from the sidelines. "Come on, Michael,"  yelled one mother. "Come on, kick the ball," said another.  </P> <P> At halftime, the coach let one player know that this is the time of year to get  serious. "You're going to be out the whole second half if I have to yell at you  once more."  </P> <P> Mary Appleton, mother of one of the players, said that for her summer ended  when school started. For a volunteer from Heal the Bay, summer's end was  signaled by empty parking places in the beach lots.  </P> <P> For the homeless, who slept in the sun on Saturday in the grass at Palisades  Park overlooking the ocean and on a park bench across the street from the  Biltmore downtown, the end of summer meant impending months of cold, damp  nights.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Lifeguard Capt. Steve Saylors, who was patrolling the beach,  had a different way of looking at the seasons. "From a lifeguard's point of  view, it doesn't matter what the calendar says. If the temperature hits 75  degrees downtown, everybody goes to the beach," said Saylors. "There is no end  of summer at the beach.  </P></p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retail sales gain undermines base rate hopes - Market Report The reverberations from Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn purchase of Cheltenham and Gloucester, Britain' sixth largest building society, dominated a UK stock market subdued yesterday by a further, and possibly final, blow to near-term optimism on base rates. The announcement of a 0.8 per cent gain in domestic retail sales in March - well above expectations - was widely seen as wiping out chances for a base rate cut, at least on economic grounds. The FT-SE Index struggled back above the 3,100 mark, but only with the help of a sharp rise in Lloyds Bank shares which was worth nearly four points on the Index. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,101.2, up 2.9 on the day, with London benefiting at the close from a gain of 17 Dow points in early trading in New York. The stock market took a highly favourable view of Lloyds Bank's deal, regarding it as a potentially highly profitable move into the premium area of the housing finance sector at an attractive price. Trading volume in Lloyds' shares approached the highest daily figure for the past six years, and there were signs that investment funds were switching into Lloyds from some other financial sector issues. However, with its views on the implications of the March retail figures largely confirmed by gains in sterling and falls in short-dated government bonds, the equity market made little headway. Analysts refused to take an entirely negative stance, however, commenting that equities might benefit as the market turned away from its fixation with base rates and paid more heed to the flow of higher dividends and earnings from UK companies as the domestic economy extends its recovery. The possibility that base rates will be cut for political reasons remains but equities could well react badly to such a move, according to some analysts. Seaq volume increased to 795.7m shares from Wednesday's 675.5m. But around 6 per cent of yesterday's volume came in three stocks - Lloyds Bank, Lasmo and Rank Organisation. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed just 0.1 off at 3,782.5. The market was helped by firmness in the pharmaceutical sector although this was offset by a slower performance from the leading oil stocks which have been moving up sharply since views on crude oil prices turned more positive. The bank sector, in spite of the strong gain in Lloyds Bank shares, ended weaker on the session as the withdrawal of base rate speculation suggested that the investment focus might shift to the manufacturing sectors of the stock market. Strong gains were recorded among the store and retail stocks, with the favourable implications of the March retail figures clearly outweighing the fading of base rate hopes. Among stocks with international associations, the cut in intervention rates by the Bank of France was a favourable factor. Some strategists suggested that the March retail sales figures, which contrasted with the tone of the survey published earlier this week by the Confederation of British Industries, should be treated with caution. Some nervousness was also expressed over the continuing hints from the forward sterling markets that UK interest rates might head higher sooner than expected. Statistics on domestic M4 money supply are due this morning, but next week the stress will be on data on the US economy.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AT LAST, COSTA MESA SHOWS GOOD SENSE;  </P> <P> A REJECTED PROPOSAL TO BAR PUSHCART VENDORS FROM THE CITY WAS -- AGAIN --  EXTREME  </P> <P> Several times in recent months, the Costa Mesa City Council has plunged  unwisely into muddy waters, leaving good sense and compassion for minorities  and the poor behind. On Tuesday, the council majority showed reasonable  restraint in refusing a chance to do it again, this time against pushcart  vendors trying to make a living on the city's streets.  </P> <P> In the past, the council acted to prohibit dayworkers from using the streets to  solicit work, and it also tried to make charities an arm of the federal  government by holding them responsible for screening those seeking help, as a  way to weed out illegal aliens. Both actions, halted by the courts in one  instance and by the federal government in the other, were aimed at forcing  illegal immigrants out of the city.  </P> <P> So it was not surprising that critics of the proposed plan to bar pushcart  vendors from the city's streets viewed the latest action as but another move in  the same direction, especially because most of the vendors, and their  customers, are Latino.  </P> <P> The argument raised by Councilmen Orville Amburgey and Ed Glasgow in pushing  for the ban was that the vendors who sell food from the carts are a threat to  the public's health and safety. To their credit, Councilwomen Sandra L. Genis,  who led the opposition to the ban, Mary Hornbuckle and Mayor Peter F. Buffa  were not buying into that extreme approach.  </P> <P> If there's a problem, existing regulations cover it. Vendors must have a city  business license and a county heath permit to take their food carts onto the  street. In one 10-day period last month, police cited 22 vendors for  violations, code enforcement officials reported. All the city needs to do is  continue to enforce those regulations. If police can't, or consider it too  troublesome to try to do so, why punish every vendor by barring them from  earning a living?  </P> <P> Restaurants must also have business licenses and health certificates, and if  any eatery is found to have unsanitary conditions that are not corrected, it is  closed -- not every restaurant in town. The same approach should prevail for  those who sell their wares from carts.  </P> <P> The council judiciously recognized that contradiction and is considering  stricter regulations that will require vendors to display their business and  health permits and picture identification. We hope that the city's reasoned  restraint on Tuesday signals a new, more responsible approach in its dealings  with Latinos and the less affluent in its midst.  </P></p>

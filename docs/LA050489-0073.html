			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ROAD HAZARD'  </P> <P> Your editorial ("Road Hazard," April 14) on the Automobile Club of Southern  California and its failure to provide the necessary instruction to assist a  motorist in distress is one more confirmation of an uncaring, negligent  attitude.  </P> <P> For years as a member, I have been begging the club to provide appropriate  decals, emblems, or numbers for disabled members. Personnel providing emergency  roadside assistance would then be immediately aware of the need to provide  something more than just the usual standard service for the able-bodied.  </P> <P> All members are limited to four (free-of-charge) assistance calls per year,  notwithstanding the disabled require more and are hesitant to call for fear of  the cost. Perhaps now, with a lawsuit pending on the rape issue, the club will  feel compelled to address itself to the needs of the disabled as well.  </P> <P> NATHAN L. CHROMAN  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Transportation Commission  </P> <P> City of Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BABAR' DEBUT ON HBO HOLDS A TRUNKFUL OF CHARM  </P> <P> "Babar," a new animated series that debuts on HBO Sunday at 8 a.m., captures  the look and much of the charm of Jean and Laurent de Brunhoff's popular  children's books.  </P> <P> Babar, the king of the elephants, never allows his duties to interfere with the  needs of his children. Most of each program is devoted to a story about his  childhood that shows his offspring how to deal with a problem.  </P> <P> In the second episode (airing April 9), Babar finds his son, Cornelius, trying  to impress a new friend. In the ensuing account of a party he almost ruined by  affecting a false charm, Babar (along with writer J.D. Smith) makes his point  without becoming smarmy or pompous.  </P> <P> The designs for the characters and the simple animation capture the essence of  Jean de Brunhoff's understated watercolor illustrations. The artists  occasionally seem to loose their sense of the characters' size and weight: The  young Babar jumps and climbs in ways that seem very unelephantlike (but very  few elephants wear uniforms and crowns, as the adult Babar does).  </P> <P> As the voice of Babar, Gordon Pinsent ("The Thomas Crown Affair") gives the  elephant king a reassuring presence and keeps the mildly didactic stories from  bogging down in moralizing. Child actors provide the voices for the young Babar  and his friends, which makes the show sound a lot like a "Peanuts" special at  times.  </P> <P> Created by the Canadian Nelvana studio -- the producers of the entertaining "My  Pet Monster" -- "Babar" manages to be endearing without sliding into the  saccharine cutesiness of "Hello Kitty." Parents with children in the  4-to-10-year-old range should plan on setting their VCRs: The kids will  probably want to watch "Babar" more than once. CHARLES SOLOMON  </P></p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Observer: Collector's item Memo to Roger Regan, new chairman of Spring Ram, the bathrooms and kitchens group, which is being stalked by predators. Good luck with the spring cleaning and don't take any nonsense from founder Bill Rooney. And one small tip - don't cancel the company Christmas card sent to shareholders. The limited edition prints by Pennine landscape painter Peter Brook are one of the few reasons many small shareholders retain any loyalty to the firm.</p>

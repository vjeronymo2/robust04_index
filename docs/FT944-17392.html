			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Uncertainty over a semitone Sir, In his review of Opera North's new Il trovatore ('Outbreak of symbolism in Leeds 'trovatore' ', October 4), Richard Fairman writes disparagingly of the tenor's high notes in the famous cabaletta being 'high Bs rather than Cs, if I am not mistaken'. On the one hand your critic is admitting that he does not have perfect pitch (a rare gift anyway), but on the other he is implying that he is clever enough to tell that the cabaletta was sung a semitone lower than written. Surely, if he felt it necessary to make this point, Fairman could have swallowed his ignorance and actually asked someone at Opera North] M D Varcoe-Cocks, 5 Brackenbury Road, London W6 0BE</p>

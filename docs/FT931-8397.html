			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Letter: Tax cap at 75% would help those in benefits trap Sir, It is reported that the UK government is prepared to 'think the unthinkable' to narrow the fiscal deficit. Might I suggest that it considers taxing the incomes of the poor at 75 per cent? This would in fact be a reduction on the present maximum effective marginal rate of tax of 97 per cent on the earnings of those people receiving benefits. It would require no more than a new class of income, taxed at 75 per cent and ignored for all other fiscal purposes, including entitlement to means-tested benefits. Such a cap on the effective marginal tax rate is one of the few ways of guaranteeing a means of escape from the benefit trap. If the rate at which we effectively tax the income of those aspiring to leave the benefit trap were reduced from the present maximum level of 97 per cent there would be some incentive for the acceptance of part-time, low wage or occasional employment. It would at least give benefit recipients greater control over their own lives in a way that cannot be achieved by workfare. The reported direction of the present review of social spending appears to pose a severe danger of further expansion of the benefit trap. Enlarging it without improving the means of escape can be described as, at best, unthinking. R A Ledingham, Rose View, Hethe, Oxfordshire OX6 9HD</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WESTSIDE  </P> <P> In Robert Glover's sculptures art imitates life, or more exactly nature.  Long-time contributor to the L.A. sculpture scene, Glover shows  less-than-life-size vertical pieces wrought from unglazed, buff-colored clay.  All are roughly based on the upright cylinder, but Glover hand works the clay  so that it lumps, coils and fans around itself in an upward motion that looks  like aged bone fossilizing into weird organic shapes as we stand there.  </P> <P> Glover has a knack for duplicating the randomly accumulating, yet still  intelligent order of a coral reef or a shell. The conceptual twist here is  that, like Stonehenge, the very placement and disposition of the works imply  some votive and ritual function grafted onto organic matter by man; the tension  between nature and society here adds interest. More than Glover's squat mounds  of pewter and terra cotta (also on view), the blanched clay works have a  puzzling grace that is appealing and sophisticated.  </P> <P> Also on view are large acrylic and pastel abstract drawings by Roberta  Eisenberg. The good news here is that Eisenberg's very personal, sure-handed  Abstract Expressionism doesn't seem rehashed and you don't need to read titles  like "Submersion" or "Breakthrough" to feel these phenomena moving through bold  swaths of sky blue, grayed whites and black.

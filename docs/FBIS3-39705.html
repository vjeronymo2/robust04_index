			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Annette </F> Schmidt on 21 February, place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Schmidt] How do you assess the current situation?    [Kinkel] I think we are all pleased that it was not  necessary  to carry out air strikes in and around Sarajevo. Now it will be  important to finally stabilize the situation in and around  Sarajevo. It will be important to make sure that a cease-fire is  achieved also in the other parts of former Yugoslavia if at all  possible. We must not forget that Sarajevo is only a very very  small part and only a beginning on an important path. It will  now be important to make use of the political momentum and  achieve a political solution. The chances for this have now  become a little bit better.    [Schmidt] NATO Secretary General Woerner has said that the  success is above all due to determined action by NATO. Was the  ultimatum the decisive point?    [Kinkel] I believe the ultimatum was a very, very important  measure. I personally believe that without the ultimatum the  Serb side would not have been prepared to accept the Russian  proposal. Several factors had an impact; the involvement of the  Russians who were able to influence the Serbs in a way that  resulted in their willingness to withdraw was very important.  There were also certain diplomatic efforts by the German side,  by the Chancellor and myself. Now let's wait and see how things  go. I think at the moment there is not yet any reason for joy  and euphoria. Again: only a first small step, albeit an  important one, has been achieved.    [Schmidt] If we look at the ultimatum, after eight days, it  lasted ten, there was still no movement yet. At the end of the  day the breakthrough came with the Russian initiative from  Moscow, Yeltsin's letter to Karadzic and the deployment of 400  Russian soldiers in the Sarajevo region. How should we see the  Russians and Russian diplomacy in this situation? Was this  eventually the decisive point and what consequences has this in  the context of the NATO initiative Partnership for Peace for the  states of East and Central Europe? After all Russia had been in  danger of becoming isolated on the international scene?    [Kinkel] If I can start at the end, the NATO summit with its  Partnership for Peace also contained a fundamental offer to  Russia for it to move closer to NATO. Partnership for Peace is  not just an offer to the countries undergoing radical change in  Central and East Europe, but basically also to Russia and  Ukraine, although we must differentiate here between de jure and  de facto possibilities.    It is the case that this Russian participation has shown we  certainly cannot achieve peace in the region, in former  Yugoslavia, without Russia. This is also quite simply linked to  the fact that individual countries have their own relationship  with the warring parties -- just think of our relations with the  Croats and our relations with the Muslims -- and the good  relations between the Russians and Serbs have helped here. But,  I repeat, a number of factors have come together here.    [Schmidt] In this regard, and you mentioned it yourself  earlier, what about the possibility of Germany taking on the  role of mediator -- there was a conversation between the  chancellor and Boris Yeltsin on Friday and your efforts, your  frequent talks with Foreign Minister Kozyrev. How important are  Germany's role and Germany's relations with the Croats which you  mentioned in this regard?    [Kinkel] I do not think that we can talk about taking on the  role of mediator, but only about mediatory efforts. If I am  right this is a little less than the role of mediator. It is  also true that so far we have not been passive toward the whole  conflict. French Foreign Minister Juppe and I initiated and  pursued the European plan of action. We have shown very great  commitment to the humanitarian effort. After the United States,  we are probably the country that has given the most in financial  support. Germany has taken in most of the refugees from former  Yugoslavia and we will be asked by the others the day after  tomorrow, sorry tomorrow, at the conference of political leaders  to take another step toward granting more aid. I do not know  where this will lead at the moment, but I think it is very  important that these talks are taking place in Germany.    [Schmidt] On what initiative is this conference of political  leaders based? What will it discuss mainly and is it perhaps  actually a preliminary stage for the summit meeting of heads of  government which has been discussed so often?    [Kinkel] It was my idea during our troika meeting in Athens  with Kozyrev last Friday. I consulted the chancellor about  this, and then we both made a lot of phone calls. Let's wait  and see. I do not want to be euphoric here either, rather I  want to see what comes of these talks tomorrow. Further  meetings, for example between foreign ministers, could follow,  but this is not yet definite.    [Schmidt] If you look at the influence you have, the  relations with the Croats, but on the other hand there is  criticism from Bonn, from the Bosnian ambassador, that all this  was a tactical exercise and generally the West attached too much  significance to it. How do you assess this, that the Bosnians  are rather sceptical about the developments of the last few  hours.    [Kinkel] It is certainly true that the Serbs have  frequently led us up the garden path before. I have always said  that words must be followed by actions. However, this time a  concrete result was actually achieved, therefore I think the  ambassador's assessment is not quite correct. Now further steps  must be taken. Above all we must try to bring the Croats and  the Bosnian Muslims, who have drifted quite far apart, closer  together.    We now also have a much, much stronger commitment by the  Americans than before. In about the last fortnight the  Americans have joined in a very committed way the efforts to  find a political solution. I think this is very important  because later it will be necessary to implement a peace plan in  practice. For this soldiers are needed, many soldiers, UN  soldiers. Without the help of the Americans this would not be  possible. Incidentally, we also need them because of their  influence on the Bosnian Muslims.    [Schmidt] So is it also true that Bill Clinton's  determination was decisive?    [Kinkel] Yes, one can say that, Clinton has certainly made a  decisive contribution with his more resolute action, with the  resolute willingness to join in.    [Schmidt] To come back to the meetings here on German soil  of  the Croats and the Muslims, for the second time, in Frankfurt at  the weekend. Maybe in Frankfurt also for reasons of location,  because it is maybe easier to get to for both sides, but why  Germany? So little of the [contents of these] talks gets out.  It is only announced that there is a new plan to divide  Bosnia-Herzegovina into seven cantons, that is not really all  that new. Is it a good sign that so little becomes known about  the talks or is it rather a sign that there is no progress?    [Kinkel] For me this is a good sign. You know that Tudjman  and Izetbegovic wanted to meet of their own accord at the  Petersberg [government guest house in Bonn] a few weeks ago.  You know that the meeting between the Croats and the Muslims in  Frankfurt took place at their request. Germany has good  relations with both parties to the conflict and, I'll say it  again, we offer our mediatory services. To be a little more  modest, I do not want to speak of a mediator role.    For me this conference of [political] directors tomorrow is  very important because I can imagine that it will be a  preliminary stage, a step that will continue the peace process.  We still have a very, very long way ahead of us. Even more so  because it appears at the moment that some of the Serb weapons  may resurface in Tuzla, Bihac, and at other places. We will  have to decide how we will react now, but the momentum that the  overall process has gained because of the NATO threats, the  Russian involvement, our mediatory efforts, the help of the  Americans, we must use this momentum.    However, again, I personally and we have been disappointed  too often in the past. I warn against assuming that we already  have the solution in our pocket. That would be too good.    [Schmidt] What will you be doing yourself today? You will be  having meetings in Bonn. Will you be travelling to Brussels to  the foreign ministers' meeting?    [Kinkel] No, I will not be going to Brussels today. Ms.  Seiler-Albring will be there. The talks which had to be held  took place in the last few days. I had a long talk yesterday  with Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN's envoy, and with various  other foreign ministers. The telephone and other technical aids  can be used to communicate with each other to such an extent  that it is not so necessary to meet in the same place. We  European foreign ministers meet virtually every week and we are  almost in daily contact with the U.S. secretary of state.    [Schmidt] What about your plans for this week?    [Kinkel] First, we shall wait and see what happens at the  talks tomorrow. The other countries -- all the important ones  will be there -- will wait and see too. They will evaluate the  situation and consider what should be done next. Redman, the  U.S. special envoy, is here in Europe and he will be there [at  the conference of political directors] tomorrow too, as will Mr.  Churkin who negotiated the action to be taken by the Serbs on  behalf of the Russians. All the critical people will be here  and let's see how we get on. I do not want to raise any false  hopes here either.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: French chemicals group may sell stake RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals company, is considering a public sale of its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-UCLAF, the pharmaceuticals group, on the stock market. The sale of the Roussel stake, which would be worth FFr1.02bn (Dollars 188m) on yesterday's share price of FFr548, is one of a number of options being considered by Rhone in conjunction with Hoechst, the German chemicals group that controls Roussel with a 54.5 per cent holding. Rhone yesterday confirmed a French newspaper report that it was discussing the possibility of a share sale with Hoechst. However, it was also considering other forms of divestment, which were believed to include the transfer of assets and products. Meanwhile, Roussel announced that it planned to extend the mandate of its managing board chaired by Mr Edouard Sakiz until the end of the year to stabilise the company during the discussions over the future of the Rhone stake. Mr Sakiz, 67, had been due to retire at the end of next month. Roussel is a specialised pharmaceuticals company best known for its controversial abortion pill. It saw net profits rise by 72 per cent to FFr1.03bn last year from FFr598m in 1991 on consolidated sales of FFr14.8bn. The fate of the Rhone stake should be decided by the end of this year. Rhone which is 43 per cent owned by the French government, was given the shares by the state in 1990 as part of a general reshuffling of public sector chemical and pharmaceutical interests. Under the terms of the government's agreement signed in June 1987, the Roussel stake was to be held for six years until June 1993 when its ownership would be subject to renegotiation. Rhone is subject to the same terms, but it has secured Hoechst's consent to extend the current agreement until the end of the year.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / White House shots underscore case for gun curbs The Clinton administration yesterday seized on Saturday's shooting at the west wing of the White House to underscore its arguments that President Bill Clinton was right to have pushed for bans on semi-automatic assault weapons. Mr George Stephanopolous, the senior presidential adviser, noted that Mr Clinton had 'talked all year' about the need to ban such guns and that the Chinese-made weapon was bought on the day the president signed into law the crime bill that included bans on some types of assault weapons. The shooting attack on a clear Saturday afternoon was the second apparent assault on the White House in six weeks and has increased concerns about presidential security. Last month a pilot with a history of mental instability was killed after crashing a small aircraft on the White House lawns. The weekend attacker, who was tackled by bystanders before being arrested, has been identified as Francisco Martin Duran, a hotel worker from Colorado Springs. He had been dishonourably discharged from the army in 1991 after being convicted of felony and assault. His camper van parked near the White House was emblazoned with pro-gun stickers. Mr Duran was indicted on two counts yesterday - damaging government property and, because of his criminal record, illegal possession of a fire-arm. A spokesman for the secret service said the charge of attempting to assassinate the president was also being considered. Mr Stephanopoulos said that Mr Lloyd Bensten, the treasury secretary whose jurisdiction includes the secret service, would conduct a complete investigation into all aspects of White House security, with a final report in mid-January. The secret service, whose duty is to protect the president, has long wanted to close Pennsylvania Avenue, the broad street outside the north face of the White House, to vehicular and even pedestrian traffic. Mr Clinton, as Mr Stephanopoulos said yesterday, has been opposed to such curbs on the grounds that the White House is 'the people's house' and should, within reason, be accessible to the public. The president himself was watching a televised college football game in the family quarters as the 22 shots were fired, shattering windows in the White House press room but hurting no one. He had returned on Saturday morning from a trip to the Middle East in which security considerations were very evident. He made light of the incident, quipping that he was glad 'to be back in the safety and security of the White House'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Defense Ministry has denied reports by domestic  papers on 22 April citing a foreign press report that  discussions on the purchase of weapons were held during the  recent talks between the ROK and U.S. defense ministers and has  released its official view.    After Cho Song-tae, director of the Policy Planning Division  of the Ministry, explained the truth regarding the report on the  purchase of weapons, the Defense Ministry distributed to the  press an official written explanation expressing its position  and asked the press to support the present ROK-U.S. cooperative  system, stressing the importance of the system.    The Defense Ministry made it clear that both countries'  ministers did not discuss the purchase of Apache helicopters,  Patriot missiles, and other latest U.S. weapons during their  recent talks.    The Ministry reported: In an effort to improve its  capability to cope with an unexpected situation in connection  with the North Korean nuclear issue, our military has partially  modified the arms procurement program in the Yulgok Five-Year  Plan to adjust the timing for the purchase of weapons, placing  more emphasis on building up our antiartillery and night battle  ability. However, this has no relation to the recent ROK-U.S.  talks.    Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae explained the  result  of the recent talks to reporters in the press room of the  Defense Ministry and said that there was no discussion on the  purchase of weapons at the 20 April talks.    Prior to this, in a news conference with domestic and  foreign  reporters at the Shilla Hotel on 21 April, U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry also said that he and Minister Yi did  not discuss selling U.S. weapons to the ROK.</p>

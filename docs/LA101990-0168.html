			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIRECTOR SEES 'MISS JULIE' AS AT HOME IN O.C.;  </P> <P> DRAMA: THE HEAD OF THE LONDON-BASED THEATRE IN EXILE THINKS STRINDBERG'S  CENTURY-OLD FEMINIST CLASSIC HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT TODAY'S SEX ROLES.  </P> <P> For Joseph Hossein Karimbeik, who heads the London-based Theatre in Exile, the  idea of staging August Strindberg's "Miss Julie" at the Forum Theatre here  seemed a natural.  </P> <P> During his years in London, where he co-founded the troupe with Dario Fo, Hanif  Kureishi and other notable writers, he discovered that "a lot of American  tourists came to see our productions. And I noticed an amazing thing: Many of  them lived in a place called Orange County."  </P> <P> Thus, when he came to Southern California six months ago to star in an  independently financed Hollywood movie, he figured that Laguna Beach might be a  friendly place to set up theatrical shop until filming began.  </P> <P> As for choosing to mount Strindberg's century-old play, Karimbeik cites two  obvious reasons -- its ageless themes of sexism and class antagonism. Despite  the playwright's notorious misogyny, "Miss Julie" is a classic feminist drama  -- among the first in the 19th-Century canon -- and it is fresher in some ways  than those of Strinderg's predecessor, Ibsen.  </P> <P> "One of the first things I noticed when I came here," said Karimbeik, a  handsome, 39-year-old, compactly built Iranian, "is that women are trying to  prove so hard that they are as good as men.  </P> <P> "Well, I thought, that is what 'Miss Julie' is all about."  </P> <P> Another, less obvious reason for staging Strinderg's classic is that there are  only three main characters in the cast, "which makes my life much easier as the  director," Karimbeik pointed out, especially considering what happened at the  open auditions he held in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I put ads in the papers and I got about 500 people," he recalled. "But I was  very surprised: Out of all this 500, two were good. . . . So I had to speak  with somebody for the role of Miss Julie who doesn't have the experience but  who has the quality and the talent."  </P> <P> Perhaps Karimbeik should have been less surprised. He was not offering to pay  any of his actors. In fact, while the theater rental fee and related costs are  higher than expected -- he says they're getting into the neighborhood of  $10,000 -- the production itself is being mounted virtually on a shoestring.  </P> <P> Karimbeik, born and raised in Tehran, left his native country for England 19  years ago, as a university student, when Iran was still ruled by the Shah. He  had been "labeled a troublemaker" by the Iranian authorities, he said, because  of his cultural activities in the poor, semiliterate neighborhood where he grew  up.  </P> <P> By the late '70s, Karimbeik enrolled at the London Drama Centre -- then headed  by Peter Brooke -- and began to make a career as an actor on British  television.  </P> <P> In 1982, Karimbeik also became artistic director of Theatre in Exile, a touring  company that stages the work of many Third World immigrants.  </P> <P> Using a pseudonym, Karimbeik wrote and directed three plays in a four-play  cycle called "Someone Else's Child," about the repression of Iranian women  under the Khomeini regime, which had taken over Iran in October, 1979.  </P> <P> Although Karimbeik has moved to Laguna Hills, where he lives with his wife and  son, the theater's London operation continues, he said.  </P> <P> Karimbeik said he plans to divide his time between California and England,  where he acts in "at least three television shows" a year. Meanwhile, the  Hollywood action movie in which he was signed to star -- called "The Rogue" --  hasn't begun filming because of "the usual complications with the financing,"  he said.  </P> <P> That leaves him in limbo, if not in exile. And the financially risky  undertaking of "Miss Julie" gives him a sense of having embarked on a serious  cause in a fool's paradise.  </P> <P> "You try to do something worthwhile," he said. "But it is very difficult."  </P></p>

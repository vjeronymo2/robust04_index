			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Whitehall isn't working - Political Notebook IT IS the habit in politics to shoot the messenger. The Conservatives are especially susceptible. Those who watched the party's 1990 conference will remember the opprobrium heaped daily on the image-makers. No matter that the very real issues of Europe and the poll tax were driving the Thatcher administration to self-destruction. Somehow the fault lay not with the policies but with the presentation. So it is hardly surprising that Mr Major's team in 10 Downing Street has emerged as a target for the disenchanted, the disgruntled and the plain frightened among the government's supporters. A happy ending is now in sight for the Maastricht bill. The economy is at last showing real signs of life. But it will take a long time for the Conservative party to recover from its year of trauma. The prime minister's policy unit, headed by Mrs Sarah Hogg, is accused of failing to provide drive and direction to the government's policies. His political advisers are said to be out of touch with the mood in the bars and lobbies of the Commons. His press office, headed by Mr Gus O'Donnell, is said to lack the acute political antennae and the professional fire-fighting skills needed in such dangerous times. Witness the public relations fiasco which followed the imposition in the Budget of value added tax on domestic fuel. Even Sir Robin Butler, as distinguished a cabinet secretary as any in recent memory, is accused of dithering and delay. There is no evidence of a dark conspiracy. Some of the attacks can be readily dismissed. There are those in the government still with nostalgic memories of the Stalinist certainties of the mid 1980s. Then no one dared blow their nose without permission from Number 10. They need to be reminded that Mr Major promised to replace his predecessor's conviction with consultation and consensus. The Euro-sceptics find it convenient to attack the Downing Street machine as a way of venting their fury over Maastricht. A still-inexperienced prime minister is being led astray by advisers and officials implementing their own agenda. Others are just fed up with being battered by their constituents and the media. There is no disloyalty in saying Mr Major is being let down by those around him. But the unease is sufficiently widespread - and in enough cases objective - to be taken seriously. The prime minister's office, the underlying message runs, isn't working. And when Downing Street isn't working, nor is the Whitehall machine. Civil servants complain that relatively uncontroversial decisions are deferred. Ministerial pending-trays are full. Out-trays are empty. Instead of driving decision-making across Whitehall, Downing Street is over-cautious. No one is stepping in to break the deadlock in inter-departmental squabbles. Reviews and initiatives are substituted for decisions. There are plenty of examples. Only yesterday the Overseas Development Administration was forced to admit to MPs that Whitehall had still to approve a trade and aid policy promised two years ago. After 20 years of argument on the subject, the Treasury wants yet another review on whether Britain should align its summertime with the rest of Europe. Such non-decisions are trivial in themselves. But there are too many of them. There are more important cases also. Legislation to equalise the pension age has been put back a year amid fears of agitation on the back benches. Number 10 is said to be less than enthusiastic about getting to grips with the Sunday trading mess. Within Downing Street much of the criticism is seen as sour grapes. The prime minister focuses on the big issues of the day. Some departments then feel neglected. In others the complaint is that Mrs Hogg interferes too much not too little. No one could accuse the government of shirking hard decisions over coal or taxation. Once Maastricht is out of the way, it will be clear it has not lost its momentum. Public relations will be spruced up with on-the-record prime ministerial press conferences. That may prove right. But instinctive activists in the Cabinet are among those warning against indecision and drift. A preference for pragmatism over ideology makes it more rather than less important for Downing Street to demonstrate its grip. With the storm clouds over Europe and the economy lifting, Whitehall needs to get back to work.</p>

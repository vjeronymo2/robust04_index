			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Pakistan 'implicated in blasts' INDIA said yesterday that investigations into the series of bomb blasts that rocked Bombay on March 12 clearly revealed Pakistan's organised support and involvement in the 'planning and execution' of the terrorist attack, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. In a statement to parliament yesterday, Mr S B Chavan, the Indian home minister, stated that India had proof of Pakistan's involvement in the blasts, which killed 250 people. Mr Chavan said that the investigation by the Bombay police had revealed, among other things, that there was a conspiracy hatched by Pakistan with Mr Dawood Ibrahim, the Dubai-based don of the Indian underworld, and Mr Ibrahim Abdul Razak Memon, a close aide of Mr Dawood, to destabilise India.</p>

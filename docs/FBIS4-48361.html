			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Cardoso and Arnaldo Abilio: "Difficult </F> Times"]    [Excerpt] The Mozambican peace process is going through  what local observers call "difficult times."    On 13 May, reliable sources told MEDIAFAX that Mozambique  Defense Armed Forces [FADM] instructors, who have already  arrived in Boane, had gone on strike as their salaries have not  been paid. The most recent UN Security Council resolution on  Mozambique refers to the existence of problems regarding  payments.    One of our reporters went to Boane on Saturday. Lieutenant  Colonel Julius Raimundo, head of the FADM Boane Center,  confirmed to us that there had been an "interruption" of work by  the instructors, and that the issue had been referred to other  authorities. MEDIAFAX is still investigating the issue.    The latest UN Security Council resolution on Mozambique is  causing controversy.    Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana yesterday spoke to us about  an issue which the government describes as strange: the  resolution includes definite dates for concluding the process of  confinement, demobilization, and formation of the FADM, "while  the dates for all that are still being discussed in Maputo."    Hunguana said the dates mentioned in the resolution had not  been proposed by Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance].    Hunguana has also confirmed the West is "reigniting  pressure"  to make Joaquim Chissano accept a cabinet arrangement with  Renamo before elections are held.    The minister did not disclose which countries are applying  the strongest pressure. He only added that the pressure now  includes the argument that Mozambique should adopt the South  African model of a government of national unity (GNU).    Hunguana noted that "in South Africa the elections were the  culmination of the liberation struggle against apartheid. One  could say the elections marked South Africa's 25 June.  [Mozambique's independence day]. For us that date is history."  Hunguana reiterated that the government is opposed to the idea  of a GNU.    Chissano has stated time and again that if he wins the polls  he wants his hands free to form a government in line with the  election results and in a manner that gives him the best  guarantees for stability in the country.    Lately Renamo has been proposing a pre-election arrangement.    Richard Edis, British ambassador to Mozambique, has already  told the Mozambican press that his government favors a  pre-election solution without doing away with the elections.    Another British diplomat told MEDIAFAX last week that that  was still his government's position, although it was not  applying pressure along the lines of "either GNU or no money."    There is a great deal of speculation in Maputo that most of  the pressure is coming from Portugal.    Asked to comment on the role being played by the Portuguese  authorities on this issue, a reliable source told MEDIAFAX that  in 1990, when the Rome talks between the government and Renamo  had just started, the Portuguese Government "systematically"  spoke about the need for a "system of pre-guarantees" because  Renamo was "a group representing different interests."    The source said the "system of pre-guarantees" became  clearly  defined in a plan for a transitional government, the first pre-  election arrangement proposal for the Mozambican process.    A government delegation that includes several of the  negotiators of the Rome peace accord with Renamo left for Rome  last night. They are: Ministers Guebuza, Hunguana, and Mazula,  Ambassador Francisco Madeira, and a military man linked to the  formation of the FADM.    Teodato Hunguana told us that the visit to Rome was not  because there was a new government in Italy, but because of the  "importance of relations we have with Italy." [passage omitted]</p>

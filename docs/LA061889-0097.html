			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIKE HEAT, MAJOR SPEECH BY DENG ENVELOPS BEIJING  </P> <P> The whole country has been ordered to read a Chinese document called the  Important Speech of Deng Xiaoping, but on this summer-like Saturday in Beijing,  hardly anyone seemed in a hurry to start.  </P> <P> And, if they wanted to read it, no one knew where to get a copy.  </P> <P> Even newly formed municipal work brigades that surfaced to help clean up debris  left over from the June 3-4 Tian An Men Square violence could be seen reading  kung fu novels, movie magazines, almost everything but a political document.  </P> <P> The weather -- Beijing residents generally dislike heat -- far outstripped  politics as the topic of choice for conversation. The 85-degree temperature  seemed a safer subject than unpleasant events in uncertain times.  </P> <P> "I don't know anything about politics," said a customer at the outdoor Fashion  Sweater and Popsicle Store near Qianmen, the front gate of the city when Old  Beijing was walled.  </P> <P> "It is very hard to understand," he declared.  </P> <P> But the customer, who was buying a Popsicle rather than a sweater, knew  something was coming. It would be hard not to, for the campaign to prepare  everyone to read this particular speech has taken over newspapers and the  airwaves, not to mention walls and railings on the street where banners herald  the coming of a new political line.  </P> <P> The Important Speech -- that's what newspapers and television here call it --  was made by Deng, China's paramount leader, several days ago in a closed  meeting. Foreign observers and citizens alike predict that most Chinese will be  called to meetings in their workplaces and neighborhoods to become familiar  with Deng's every word.  </P> <P> "I believe that in a day or two, my boss will ask us all to listen to the  speech. We will learn all about it," said Bai, a souvenir salesman at the  Summer Palace, once a Qing Dynasty royal retreat on the outskirts of Beijing.  </P> <P> Even though the common people seem not to have seen the speech, there is  already basic instruction available on television giving hints on how to react  to it.  </P> <P> For the past two nights, news programs showed groups of Communist politicians  and officials reading the document. A camera panned slowly from face to face as  each reader dutifully jotted notes and every once in a while nodded in  agreement with some point.  </P> <P> One official or another could be heard praising the speech as "well written,"  or damning student protesters as "counterrevolutionary rioters."  </P> <P> For anyone who missed these reports, the newspapers repeat much the same items.  The People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, featured an article  Saturday headlined "The capital's leading scientists study in an informal  discussion group and conclude that Deng Xiaoping's speech conveys the people's  wishes."  </P> <P> The Beijing Daily advised everyone to "resolutely read Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  Important Speech." The China Youth News said that "the chairman and vice  chairman of the All-China Youth Federation held a meeting to discuss Deng  Xiaoping's illustrious speech." In a preview earlier last week, the People's  Daily gave an outline of the content of the speech.  </P> <P> In the speech, Deng defended the assault by soldiers on demonstrators in Tian  An Men Square, and his tone on this subject is fairly harsh. According to the  newspaper, the pro-democracy demonstrators were an "ideological pimple" that is  being "lanced by Deng Xiaoping's words."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1 Central Position, 2 Points  </P> <P> The aging leader's speech also urged upholding of the "one central position and  two basic points." This is a bit confusing to some Chinese, because the "one  central position" is their impression of the "four basic principals" --  upholding the leadership of the Communist Party, upholding socialism, upholding  the people's democratic dictatorship and Mao Tse-tung Thought.  </P> <P> Mao, who once condemned Deng as a "capitalist roader" trying to overturn  Marxism, has been dead for 13 years. Many of his ideas have been discredited,  and his thought is only selectively upheld.  </P> <P> The two basic points are reform, which means continued decentralization of the  economy, and openness, which means maintaining trade and contact with the  outside world.  </P> <P> Try as one might, it is hard to escape politics these days. The news programs  on television have been lengthened and are shown four or five times a day.  </P> <P> Saturday night, the rundown of national news ran like this:  </P> <P> First, a group of men representing "democratic parties," which in China are  docile skeletons of political movements that have long since dried up, were  shown reading the Important Speech.  </P> <P> The scene switched to children standing at attention on Tian An Men Square. The  children pledged to study harder in memory of soldiers who died putting down  the student demonstrators and their supporters. Tethered red and white  helium-filled balloons carried aloft banners that read, "Long live the  Communist Party!"  </P> <P> For the third night in a row, pictures of crews cleaning and scrubbing the  square were shown. Next came a typical series showing troops engaged in various  martial-law activities: They stand rigid on street corners, keeping watch on  the city; they water plants at the Temple of Heaven; they attend memorial  services for fallen comrades.  </P> <P> There was a letter describing the People's Liberation Army, which killed  hundreds of demonstrators, as "lovable."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foreign Businessmen  </P> <P> Finally, foreign businessmen who stayed in China through all of the turmoil  were put on the air as a display of how normal things are. One Swedish  businessman concluded a deal to run tours to the Great Wall. He exclaimed:  "Afraid? What's there to be afraid of?"  </P> <P> It has been more than a decade since the government mounted such an  all-encompassing political campaign. Some of the harsher rhetoric reminds many  observers of the chaotic days of the Cultural Revolution, which gripped the  country for the better part of 11 years.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the People's Daily published an account of a report it said was  telephoned in by pro-democracy students. The unnamed students supported the  government's decision to expel two American journalists last week.  </P> <P> According to the newspaper, the students called the reporters "gods of plague .  . . who manipulated our hopes for more democratization."  </P> <P> "They used our hot-blooded patriotism to urge us to block cars, beat, smash and  loot, fire guns and kill," the newspaper quoted the students as saying.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Time to 'Disinfect China'  </P> <P> The report concluded: "Now it is time to expel them and disinfect China of this  plague."  </P> <P> Fang Lizhi, the dissident scientist who has taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy,  came in for his share of abuse. One letter published in the official press  referred to him as the "scum of the Chinese nation."  </P></p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / World Trade News: Mahathir assails Uruguay Round labour-trade link Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malay-sia's prime minister, has made a strong attack on moves to link labour standards to trade issues under a new world trading regime, saying that such action would be disastrous for developing countries. However, Malaysia's own Trades Union Congress yesterday backed such a move. 'Our sole advantage is our lower cost of labour. . . there has been talk of levelling the playing field by removing the labour cost advantage we have,' said Dr Mahathir. 'But a level playing field is meaningless for midgets competing against giants.' More than 120 countries are due to meet in Marrakesh next week to sign the Uruguay Round trade accords. The US has said it wants a draft ministerial declaration at the meeting to include references to the relationship between what it calls 'internationally recognised labour standards' and the world trading system. Other developing countries have said labour standards are a matter for individual governments and should not be linked to trade issues. Last week Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) countries agreed to act as a bloc to prevent any 'social clause' being included in future international trading rules. The Malaysian Trades Union Congress has backed the call for a social clause in Gatt as have trade union centres in several other developing countries including Singapore, Pakistan, Uganda, and Ghana. 'We do not seek a global minimum wage, but what we do need is global regulation of the right of unions to exist, to organise and to carry out collective bargaining,' the Malaysian TUC said.</p>

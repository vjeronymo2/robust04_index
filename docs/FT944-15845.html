			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Middle East: US warns Iraq on new build-ups Armed with a new United Nations resolution warning of 'serious consequences' if Iraq once again menaces Kuwait, the US yesterday threatened immediate military action for any repetition of this month's huge Iraqi troop build-up near the Kuwaiti border. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the UN resolution, passed unanimously by the Security Council late on Saturday night, put Iraq's President Saddam Hussein 'on notice ..that he must not again threaten Kuwait. If he does, we feel we have all the necessary authority to act against him. I think next time we'll probably not wait,' Mr Christopher said yesterday. The US does not expect to start withdrawing the tens of thousands of troops it has sent to Kuwait until several weeks after Iraq has completed the reversal of its own troop build-up. US officials said they were still watching two brigades near Nasiriyah, although the Iraqi troops appeared to be moving in the right direction. Washington is anxious not to have to perform the same costly troop deployment all over again, weeks or months from now, if Iraq were to start moving troops back towards its border with Kuwait. The passage of Saturday's UN resolution followed a day of diplomatic wrangling in New York, as Russia and France quarrelled with the tough language proposed by the US and UK. Russia demanded the inclusion of language welcoming 'all diplomatic and other efforts to resolve the crisis,' a reference to the mission of Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, to Baghdad. Mr Kozyrev is due to meet Mr Christopher in New York today; Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, was reported to be on his way to New York for talks with Security Council members. The next review of sanctions will be on November 14, which apparently is why Mr Aziz has decided to conduct yet another lobbying campaign, this time with help from Mr Kozyrev. In a communique issued by Iraq and Russia after Mr Kozyrev's visit to Baghdad last week, Moscow promised to support an easing of the economic sanctions imposed by the UN, while Iraq offered to recognise Kuwait's borders and sovereignty. But the US remains adamant that Saddam should not be rewarded for stepping back from the threat he mounted 10 days ago. It continues to demand Iraq comply with the full list of UN resolutions against it. 'Our goal is to have him comply with all UN resolutions, all of them, including respect for ethnic minorities, including the return of Kuwaiti prisoners,' Mr Christopher added. Arab diplomats say Mr Saddam is convinced the US will never allow the lifting of sanctions so long as he holds power, although he has never come close enough to compliance for this theory to be tested. Any possibility of relaxing sanctions depends on Baghdad's recognition of Kuwaiti independence.</p>

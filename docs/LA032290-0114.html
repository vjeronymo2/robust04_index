			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> POLICE LIEUTENANT PROMOTED  </P> <P> Police Lt. Dan Cross, a 16-year veteran of the department, has been promoted to  captain, filling a vacancy created when former Capt. Joseph Santoro left to  become Monrovia police chief last fall.  </P> <P> A controversy over the selection process and qualifications for a new captain  had pitted former police Chief Ken Hickman against the city's personnel board.  </P> <P> The board said Hickman, who recommended that a captain have a college degree  and at least three years of management experience, told them there would not be  enough in-house candidates eligible for the position.  </P> <P> Hickman said that, according to city rules, in-house searches require at least  six eligible candidates. He said that if the board adopted his recommended job  criteria, which it did, there would not be the necessary number of in-house  candidates. Therefore, he asked that the job be opened to outside applicants.  The dispute triggered a series of events that led to Hickman's resignation last  week.  </P> <P> Fourteen people, including 12 in-house candidates, applied for the position.  Cross, who began his duties as captain last Tuesday, has four years of  management experience and has a bachelor's degree in criminology and a master's  degree in public administration.  </P></p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Duisenberg in strong defence of French currency A STRONG defence of the french franc's parity with the D-Mark was issued yesterday by Mr Wim Duisenberg, chairman of the committee of European Community central bank governors. 'In no way are the fundamentals out of line with existing parities,' he told the European parliament. Interventions by the French authorities and other central banks had defended the franc successfully so far, he said. But he added that these interventions had been accompanied by firm measures by the French authorities. He said the concerted voluntary defence of the french currency was a 'true signal of co-operation within the exchange rate mechanism'. On the foreign exchange markets the franc steadied against the D-Mark, ending a succession of sharp declines, after a show of support from French and German politicians and central bank officials. Currency traders said that sentiment toward the franc had improved and that there had been fairly strong buying interest. But they warned that the instability facing the currency might not yet have run its course. Mr Duisenberg, who is also head of the Dutch central bank, argued that the credibility of the EC's plans for economic and monetary union depended on member states taking tough action to restrain budget deficits. He said said public sector deficits would rise to more than 6 per cent of the EC's gross domestic product this year - the highest ever recorded in the Community's history and double the target set out in the Maastricht treaty's goal of economic and monetary union. He said tackling budget deficits was a prerequisite for easing monetary policy. 'A credible, predetermined and irreversible path towards fiscal balance is essential to improve the potential of the Community's economies, and thus to retain confidence in the successful transition to economic and monetary union.' Mr Duisenberg's appearance at a plenary session of the parliament is rare, reflecting a new assertiveness by the legislature whose powers will expand once Maastricht is ratified. Last spring, the central bank governors submitted a report on last September's crisis in the ERM to the parliament, as well as the European Commission and EC finance ministers. The report blamed a lack of economic convergence among member states, inadequate policy mixes and a deteriorating economy for the crisis and found no structural fault-lines in the ERM. Mr Ben Patterson, a British Conservative MEP, challenged this interpretation in a report to the parliament. 'Why was no action taken to ensure an orderly realignment of currencies before the markets started the chaos,' he asked. 'What advice were the central bankers actually giving to the politicians at that time?' Mr Duisenberg had earlier set out the considerable difficulties in creating a single European currency with uniform banknotes. National experience suggested that it could take up to seven years, possibly even longer - a hint that a real monetary union will not happen this century. In his statement to MEPs, Mr Duisenberg urged member states not just to tackle public spending but also structural rigidities in the labour markets and to main wage restraint. Wage growth in the EC in 1993 was 2 per cent lower than in 1992 and it was vital to 'lock in' expectations that this trend would continue.</p>

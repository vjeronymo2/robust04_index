			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Nervous equities overshadowed by Fed meeting - Market Report A trading session overshadowed by worries ahead of the meeting today of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee closed with share prices giving ground as Wall Street fell sharply in early trading. The final hour in London coincides with the traditional timing for the Federal Reserve to intervene in US money markets, and some traders in London clearly feared a pre-emptive strike from the Fed yesterday. Equities spent most of the session following the gilt-edged market which had an equally unsettled session. After opening lower, share prices slipped below the Footsie 3,200 mark before both bonds and equities steadied following the announcement of the UK's non-EC trade deficit for last month. The deficit was smaller than anticipated in the market. The stock market failed to join fully in the rally in bonds and was soon again overshadowed by the weakness on Wall Street. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,198.0 for a loss on the day of 20.1. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also eased, shedding 11.1 to 3,854.5. Traders warned that turnover in equities had been unimpressive - Seaq volume fell 17 per cent to 506.3m shares. In addition to the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting today, markets have to face auctions this week of Dollars 28m in near-term US bonds; London must also brace itself for the UK Retail price index, due tomorrow, and expected to show that domestic inflation has remained subdued. However, on Friday, retail business in equities was worth Pounds 1.43bn, fully maintaining the bounding volume levels which have brought such excellent trading results this year from the securities houses and merchant banks. The flow of company reporting statements continued to support views that the stock market will benefit from a recovery in company profits, even while economic recovery appears to be sluggish. Bunzl, the paper group, joined the list of leading British companies to increase its dividend payout significantly. Better news on the European car industry came from Porsche and Lucas Industries, which although it left the dividend unchanged, indicated some steadying in industry sales. Overall, however, share prices moved in thin trading and traders were unwilling to take on new share positions. Yesterday's market performance suggested that the European bourses are still finding difficulty in shaking off the influence of US credit policies, even though local analysts continue to argue that interest rates can be lower in Europe while they rise in the US. There is no certainty that the US Federal Reserve will make any announcement today - in the past, it has left the markets to scrutinise the Fed's intervention money market intervention policies to discern its policy. However, Mr Greenspan did make a statement a month ago when the Fed changed stance and London analysts expect a formal statement today if the Fed decides to take serious action, such as increasing its discount rate. At worst, a half point rise in the rate is thought possible. Some London strategists took the view that, since the Federal Reserve has made clear its intentions to tighten policy, European markets will be unsettled until it makes its move. In the meantime, it was clear yesterday that the London market is unlikely to develop much significant direction.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Akhverdyan, chairman of the </F> National-Democratic Union's Human Rights Club: "`Criminal'  Statistics: In 1993, One in Three Crimes in the Republic  Remained Unsolved"]    [Text] Obviously statistical analysis, and especially in  the sphere of "the crime situation and the percentage of crimes  solved, investigative work, and individual areas of procuracy  oversight" does not reveal to the full extent the crime picture  in the republic. Behind each incident of crime there are  concrete human lives. Nevertheless, statistics allow us to  follow the development of very alarming trends and, as a natural  reaction, take at least the necessary preventive measures to  avert their further acceleration.    Last year Armenian organs of internal affairs registered  13,081 crimes. For the first time over the past five years, we  see a decline in the number of registered crimes (1988--6,324,  1989--8,415, 1990--12,100, 1991--13,109, 1992--16,251). One has  to admit that in the years past, "good" reports were the goal.  Many crimes, especially on everyday level, essentially were  concealed and were not registered. That is, nobody ever had the  real picture. To a certain extent this phenomenon, but on a  relatively lesser scale, is present today as well.    As we can see, in many respects the year 1988 was  significant  for us. The peak of national awareness, manifestation of a high  degree of organization, affected even the crime situation.  Armenia had not had such a low crime rate since 1980. The  subsequent lawlessness does not need any comment. Its causes  have been described many times: Social disintegration has lead  to the total impoverishment of almost all population strata and  brought about a crime boom.    In such analyses, the custom is to quote the crime rate per  100,000 persons. This indicator does not lend itself to  measurement, however, because of the endless stream of  emigration. According to official data, 300,000--and to  unofficial, 800,000--Armenians already have left their homeland.  Naturally, the decline in the total number of crimes over the  year is closely related to, and actually is caused by, this sad  reality. The migrants, some of whom undoubtedly belong to the  well-off population strata, had been an attractive target for  criminals. So to a certain extent emigration created  unemployment of a sort among the petty-crime brotherhood. Not to  mention the fact that, according to some reliable sources,  emigration processes decimated the local criminal world as well.    At the same time it should be noted that the crime  coefficient per 100,000 population in Armenia has always been  lower than the analogous indicators across the former Soviet  Union, although, in our opinion, we should now discard  comparative arithmetics. Each republic has its own internal  political and social situation; it is hard to find a  "counterpart" in a chaos, and does not make sense anyway.    Unlike the year before last, the geography of safe cities  and  regions has expanded. Their number reached 35. Yerevan's  Shengavitskiy Rayon and Dilizhan remain "hot spots" (the crime  rate has reached 136 percent (!?), as well as Spitakskiy,  Sevanskiy, and Stepanavanskiy Rayons. Amazingly, this list  includes border regions: Tavush, Tashir, Krasnoselsk, Goris, and  Megru.    While overall crime declined, there has been a sharp  increase  in the number of grave crimes registered by criminal  investigation departments (especially increased theft of  personal property)--from 4,526 to 5,602. This trend was  registered in republic's 42 cities and regions. So, in reality  the safe status of the cities is very much a matter of  conventional definition. The number of grave crimes fell in nine  rayons, including two in Yerevan--Mashtotskiy (0.4 percent) and  Sovetskiy (20 percent)--but expressed in percents they are not  impressive. While in the past Yerevan accounted for more than  half of the registered crimes, including grave crimes, last year  the seats of criminal activities expanded beyond its boundary.  For instance, the growth of grave crime has been registered in  Talinskiy Rayon (115 percent), Dilizhan (400 percent), and  Vanadzor (78 percent), as well as Tavushskiy (223 percent),  Masisskiy (83 percent), Spitakskiy (128 percent), Stepanavanskiy  (221 percent), Tashirskiy (363 percent), Akhuryanskiy (150  percent), Martuninskiy (48 percent), Vardenisskiy (74 percent),  Gorisskiy (112 percent), Yekhegnadzorskiy (81 percent),  Kalanskiy (60 percent), and Sisianskiy (132 percent) Rayons.    Looking at statistics by the type of crime, it should be  noted that the number of violent crimes decreased somewhat,  including that of premeditated murder (-35), attempted murder  (-13), and assault (-78). In the area of general crimes for  mercenary motives, the number of thefts of state and public  property dropped dramatically (-4,388), while theft of personal  property increased (+1,328), including apartment burglaries  (+638), robberies (+112), and muggings (+239). This does not at  all mean that state property is now better protected. Everything  usable already has been plundered from plants and factories. In  one year the number of such crimes dropped from 6,709 to 2,321.  The ordinary guy, on the other hand, essentially found himself  unprotected. This is extremely dangerous, since this trend is on  the increase. There is also a "pick-up" in the sphere of crimes  committed for economic and mercenary motives.    There also has been a sharp increase in crimes associated  with the manufacture, possession, and use of drugs--from 162 to  368. Against this backdrop, the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] decision to abolish the corresponding unit in its  structure looks even more strange. Now it is unclear who deals  with this problem or how it is dealt with professionally. As to  all sorts of hints and statements that we are "all right" when  it comes to the drug problem, they are groundless. Amazingly,  according to city and rayon procuracy statistical reports, not a  single inspection has been conducted on how the law on combating  drug addiction among minors is carried out.    Quite understandably, the number of traffic accidents is  down--from 887 to 525, including those with fatalities--from 325  to 198. There are also fewer car thefts--from 957 to 376. There  are fewer crimes committed in public transportation, which  actually is not surprising, keeping in mind that practically  everywhere it simply is not operating.    One would think that the drop in the number of violent  crimes  can be considered a positive factor. Very alarming, however, is  the number of unsolved cases of premeditated murder (105) and  attempted murder (12). Of the former, 43 took place in Yerevan;  15, in the disaster zone; 28, in border regions. Of 68 unsolved  cases of assault, 41 also occurred in the capital. Also there  has been an increase in the number of unsolved mugging attacks  against individuals' personal property--from 120 to 228, and in  Yerevan--from 55 to 111. Five of 38 rapes in the republic have  not been solved. As a whole, the number of unsolved crimes in  the republic is 4,565. No matter how optimistic this figure  looks--at least against the backdrop of prior years'  statistics--all it says is that one in three crimes remain  unsolved. In this situation there is no reason to say that law  enforcement organs are fulfilling their direct functions. The  overwhelming majority (3,470) are general crimes for mercenary  motives.    According to MVD data, last year 402 crimes were committed  by  minors or with their participation. In Yerevan this figure  increased from 128 to 142. Of 278 criminal cases referred to  court, 235 are theft of state, public, or personal property.  Keeping in mind that last year in the same category of crime  3,381 incidents remained unsolved, it is simply impossible to  judge the whole picture.    On the whole the crime situation in the republic remains  difficult and most likely will exacerbate, aided by the  worsening of the socioeconomic situation of the majority of the  population. Not to mention serious shortcomings and deficiencies  in the work of law enforcement organs. The lack of a legislative  base also makes itself felt. Law regulating the activities of  the Procuracy and the MVD still have not been adopted.    As to figures, the MVD provides the data that reflects  quantitative indicators of the crime situation, which is not  enough for an in-depth analysis of today's problems of crime  suppression, Statistics must reflect quantitative  characteristics of the crime situation, including information on  persons committing criminal actions, the situation with respect  to repeat, group, and organized crime, the percentage of  unsolved crimes, and a number of other things. One thing is  clear. A decline in the total number of registered crimes at  this point does not allow us to say that the situation has  stabilized, and even less so--that crime suppression has  improved.    We will cover the methods of getting out of the current  dismal situation in our subsequent articles, after discussing  the subject in the National-Democratic Union's human rights club.</p>

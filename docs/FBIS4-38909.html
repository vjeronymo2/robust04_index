			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 02, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister  Mart Laar said in an address in the parliament today that Moscow  reaps no benefits from keeping 2,500 military in Estonia, on the  contrary, this is seriously disadvantageous to Russia.    "It seems that meetings at the political top level are  needed  to make this clear," the premier said during the discussion of a  bill on the relations between Estonia and Russia.    Laar assured that, in order to solve problems between the  two  countries, the Estonian Government has chosen a path that  doesn't rule out mutually advantageous agreements and  compromises but presumes that the Estonian-Russian relations are  based on mutual respect and equality of rights.    Laar said the implementation of such a policy has forced the  government to develop and strengthen the country's state and  security institutions, work towards Estonia's economic  independence from Russia, secure internal stability, and achieve  as quickly as possible Estonia's integration into the Western  community.    "Whereas 18 months ago the card of human rights was an ace  in  Russia's hand and a year ago the situation in eastern Virumaa  and Narva was truly explosive, by now the human rights card has  been beaten on the international arena and the power in eastern  Virumaa is in the hands of entirely different principles and of  local governments that support Estonian statehood," the premier  claimed. "Tension has clearly been reduced in Estonia, this is  what both foreign experts and local Russian organizations think."</p>

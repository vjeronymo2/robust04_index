			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / International Company News: Air Canada blames weak demand for record loss AIR CANADA, the country's biggest airline, yesterday blamed record losses of CDollars 218m (USDollars 183.1m) for 1991 - against losses of CDollars 74m a year earlier - on the long North American recession and weak demand on key Atlantic routes. The loss - which works out at Dollars 2.94 a share compared with Dollars 1.01 - was more than analysts had expected. Looking ahead, however, Mr Claude Taylor, chairman, said: 'Competitive pricing in an economy moving into a gradual recovery will bring more growth in demand in the second half.' The airline forecasts a poor 1992 first half. Air Canada cut its operations and staff last year in response to the post-Gulf war recession. This, however, was not enough to stem rising losses. The number of employees was reduced by 11 per cent to 20,600 at the end of the year. Operating revenues for 1991 were CDollars 3.56bn, down 9 per cent, while operating expenses dipped by 4 per cent. The final operating loss, before special charges for staff reductions, was CDollars 164m against an operating profit of CDollars 50m in 1990. The number of passengers carried fell 16 per cent to 9.9m, and the average load factor came to 68.5 per cent against 71.4 per cent. The airline's debt rose sharply in the year, to CDollars 2.1bn, after it added 12 Airbus A320s and three Boeing 747-400s to its fleet. Recent Canadian tax changes broadened the financing options for the country's airlines, but Air Canada says the gap between Canadian and US financing costs remained significant. Air Canada is to add the three 747-400s to its Atlantic routes in March. It will also modify two 747-200 combination passenger-cargo aircraft to all-passenger. This will increase available seat miles by 10 per cent in 1992. Mr Taylor said the priority was restoring profitability. The airline also aims to restore lost market share and achieve greater penetration on all its routes. This week the airline named Mr Hollis Harris, former head of Delta Air Lines, as president and chief executive. The post had been open for two years following the resignation of Mr Pierre Jeanniot, who had led the privatisation of Air Canada. Mr Taylor, 66, continues as chairman.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: ITT-Ciga hotel deal on brink of collapse The agreed L900bn (Dollars 556m) purchase by ITT of Ciga, the Italian luxury hotel group controlled by the Aga Khan, was last night on the brink of collapse following an unexpected surge in Ciga's share price. The US conglomerate ordered its ITT Sheraton hotel subsidiary to recall immediately all its staff from Ciga hotels in Europe, where they had been managing the transition to new ownership. ITT said the deal could not be done at the new share price levels because Ciga's creditor banks would no longer be willing or able to deliver the hotel group's equity at the price previously agreed. But it also said that Ciga's hotels needed capital investment in excess of L300bn - a disclosure likely to prompt speculation that it was trying to walk away from the deal because it had become too expensive. Two months ago ITT appeared to have stolen the Ciga deal from under the nose of Forte, the UK hotel group that had earlier led the bidding. But the L900bn it agreed to pay surprised the hotel industry because Ciga is loss-making and heavily debt-laden. The ITT agreement provided for Mediobanca, the Italian bank, and 22 creditor banks to deliver 50.1 per cent of Ciga's equity to ITT at a price of L740 a share. The rest of the equity would have been acquired on the open market. In the last few days, however, speculative activity has driven Ciga's share price up to about L1,300. ITT said this meant there was serious doubt about whether the banks could deliver Ciga's equity at the agreed price. ITT said it was still ready to go ahead with the deal under the original terms, but this was unlikely to be possible unless Ciga's share price collapsed.</p>

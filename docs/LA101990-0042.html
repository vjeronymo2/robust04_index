			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 2 PROPOSALS TO UNIFY BEACH CITY SCHOOLS MAY GO BEFORE VOTERS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: TRUSTEES SUGGEST PUTTING COMPETING PLANS ON THE BALLOT. BUT STATE  AND COUNTY OFFICIALS AREN'T SURE THAT IT WOULD BE LEGAL.  </P> <P> The beach city battle over school reorganization continued to heat up this  week, as Hermosa Beach trustees proposed letting voters choose between two  competing plans for reconfiguring the schools in Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach  and Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> The idea, discussed at the Hermosa Beach school board meeting Wednesday, was  the latest twist in the two-year debate over whether the beach city schools  should be reorganized into one umbrella district or two. Although the voters in  the three cities ultimately will decide the so-called unification question, the  school boards are politically deadlocked over what plan to put on the ballot.  </P> <P> State and county education officials said Hermosa Beach's proposed compromise  -- putting both plans on the ballot -- might be workable but needs more  investigation.  </P> <P> "It's not a bad idea. We just aren't sure it's legal," said Marc Forgy,  secretary to the Los Angeles County Committee on School District Organization.  </P> <P> There now are four school districts for the three cities: an elementary  district in each city, and the South Bay Union High School District into which  they feed. Unification has been under serious discussion among the districts  since 1989, when the financially troubled high school district proposed merging  with the elementary schools.  </P> <P> But longstanding rivalries among the three cities, combined with a fierce  attachment to home rule, have blocked consensus.  </P> <P> Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach want to dismantle the high school district  and the Hermosa Beach district and reorganize into two  kindergarten-through-12th-grade school systems; with Hermosa joining the  Manhattan Beach-based system.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach wants to dismantle all four districts and create one unified  district.  </P> <P> And the high school trustees have agreed to go along with whatever the  elementary districts decide.  </P> <P> The process for reconfiguring school districts is complicated and bureaucratic  and, unless all the affected school boards can agree on a proposal, requires a  massive petition drive.  </P> <P> The State Board of Education, for example, must approve any reorganization plan  before it can go to the voters, and to become eligible for such consideration,  a plan must have either unanimous approval from the school boards involved or  be accompanied by petitions bearing the signatures of 25% of the registered  voters in the affected districts.  </P> <P> Moreover, because school management is such a complex issue, voters may have  difficulty grasping its finer points. Advocates of a Redondo Beach  kindergarten-through-12th-grade district, for example, have taken a year to  collect just 6,000 of the 10,000 petition signatures they need.  </P> <P> The reason, said Redondo Beach board President Bart Swanson, is that the  petition passers have had to spend an average of 20 minutes with each person  they solicit, explaining how a school system is organized and managed.  </P> <P> If all four school boards could agree on a proposal, a ballot measure could go  before beach city voters this year. If they have to go the petition route, the  matter could take years to come to a vote, state and county officials said.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach trustees said they proposed the compromise two-option ballot as a  way out of the current stalemate.  </P> <P> "It may not be possible to iron out, but . . . (a two-option ballot) would  solve a lot of problems," said Hermosa Beach Trustee Joe Mark.  </P> <P> But reaction from other trustees is lukewarm.  </P> <P> "I personally don't have any problem with putting both (proposals) on the  ballot," said Redondo Beach Trustee Swanson. "But as I remember it, we talked  about that a long time ago, and we were left with the impression that it wasn't  legal."  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach board President Barbara Dunsmoor said she, too, had problems  with the Hermosa Beach plan.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure it's a very good idea," she said. "The issue is confusing enough.  This would only make it more confusing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> UNIFICATION AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> THE ISSUE:  </P> <P> Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach each have an elementary school  district. When children in the three cities reach ninth grade, they are  funneled into the separate South Bay Union High School District.  </P> <P> The high school district, however, has had financial problems, and the single  K-8 school in Hermosa Beach is overcrowded and strapped for cash. All four  districts agree reorganization is necessary, but they cannot agree on how to do  it.  </P> <P> THE OPTIONS:  </P> <P> Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach favor split unification, in which two K-12  school systems would be created, one in each of those cities, and the high  school district would be dismantled. Redondo Beach would take over Redondo  Union High School, and Manhattan Beach would merge with Hermosa Beach and they  would take over Mira Costa High School, which is in Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach wants total unification, in which all four districts would merge  along the boundaries of the high school district to create one 10,000-student,  unified district.  </P> <P> (South Bay Union High School trustees initially wanted total unification but  have since agreed to support any plan the elementary school boards can agree  on.)  </P> <P> THE ARGUMENTS:  </P> <P> PRO: Split unification would protect local control for at least two of the  districts while saving money through economies of scale. Manhattan Beach and  Hermosa Beach already share a common approach to testing and educational  programs. Hermosa Beach students could take advantage of the broader range of  electives offered in Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> CON: Hermosa Beach would become the only beach city to lose its home rule.  About 500 students from North Redondo Beach, who now attend Mira Costa, would  have to transfer to Redondo Union.  </P> <P> PRO: Total unification would allow efficient operation and the broadest  educational options.  </P> <P> CON: All three cities would lose local control. The new district also would  have to reconcile differences between Redondo Beach's testing and educational  philosophy, and that of Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach.  </P></p>

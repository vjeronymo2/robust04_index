			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent E. Guretskaya, including recording of </F> remarks by Russian Television Director Oleg Popstov and an  unidentified TV viewer; from the "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] [Announcer] We have received a statement of the  central committee of the Union of Communications Workers of  Russia saying that from 10 February the Ministry of  Communications can only guarantee the broadcasting of the news  programs of Ostankino and Russia's Television, and that only in  the morning and in the evening.    [Guretskaya] The first reaction of an ordinary TV viewer, a  man in the street, to the prospect of facing a blank television  screen was this:    [Unidentified speaker] They are just hooligans, I think this  is absolutely outrageous!    [Guretskaya] Here is a reaction to the same by a  professional, the chief of one of the state television companies.    [Poptsov] I think this is a natural action, a normal step to  take, and it should not be called blackmail. This is not  blackmail, this is a forced measure. Please understand: This  is a cry, an appeal for help.    [Guretskaya] Last year the heads of the Communications  Ministry, not without help from the heads of the TV and radio  companies, prevented a general strike of communications workers  eight times. But all things in this world of ours are  interrelated: We owe money to communications workers, they in  turn to people in power engineering while the government owes  money to them all. Everyone has turned out to be a bankrupt.    [Poptsov] Why do we have no budget? Because people don't pay  taxes. There are no funds to make up a budget. Taxes are not  being paid because the tax system is not functioning. The  government which is unable to guarantee the implementation of  its own decisions in fact dooms the very concept of statehood  and legality to failure.    [Guretskaya] Oleg Poptsov has pointed out correctly that  what  the reactionary forces failed to achieve during the night of 3-4  October 1993 -- they failed to make TV screens go blank -- can  now be done without any great shocks. You simply stop paying  money, and the screens go blank of themselves. Thus money --  or, rather, the lack of it -- is the cause of everything. Or  maybe there is another cause?    [Poptsov] I am deeply convinced that there is a powerful  lobby behind the idea of the shortening of broadcasting time.  This force, acting behind the government's back, wants the  state broadcasting reduced in order to get free space for  themselves and wants the state to reduce and finally lose its  interest in TV and radio broadcasting. Then some very different  forces can enter that area and then, I am sorry to say, the  state, the government, the president and the Duma will lose  control of this country called the Russian Federation -- or  simply of Russia.</p>

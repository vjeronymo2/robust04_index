			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: CAMERA ANGLES  </P> <P> Sources tell us that Kevin Costner will make his directorial debut in March  when Island Pics shoots "Dances With Wolves" in Mexico. The 19th-Century  romantic adventure, adapted by Michael Blake from his novel, centers on the  relationship between a white man and an Indian woman in the Southwest.  </P> <P> Reps for Costner and Island wouldn't comment.  </P> <P> A source said that Costner, who's been searching for a project to direct for  about a year, zeroed in on "Wolves" partly because it could be made  economically. He'll have the only major English-speaking role, with the other  principal parts written in Indian and Spanish dialects.  </P> <P> Also signing up for his first directing job is "Moonstruck" writer John Patrick  Shanley. The project is "Joe vs. the Volcano" at Warner Bros., a comic fantasy  with Tom Hanks as a man who sells his soul to the devil. Scheduled to shoot  next summer. Leonard Klady  </P></p>

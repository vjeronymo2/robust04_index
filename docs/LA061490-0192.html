			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABC-TV NEWS GALAXY GLITTERS AT CONVENTION;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: TOP STARS AT THE NETWORK'S ANNUAL AFFILIATES' GATHERING FACE AN  AWKWARD QUESTION: WHY DID MARLA MAPLES RATINGS BEAT THE BERLIN WALL?  </P> <P> At its annual affiliates convention here Wednesday, ABC hauled out its glittery  array of news stars -- Peter Jennings, David Brinkley, Barbara Walters, Ted  Koppel and Sam Donaldson, with Diane Sawyer live by remote from New York.  </P> <P> They talked about freedom around the world, flag burning, poverty and other big  issues.  </P> <P> But then they invited questions from the audience of about 1,200 station  executives in the Century Plaza ballroom. And Steve Kimtian of WKBW-TV in  Buffalo asked a stinger: What did it mean to this panel of "the world's best  journalists" that "PrimeTime Live" got its highest ratings for the program that  featured an interview with Marla Maples, Donald Trump's model friend?  </P> <P> Sawyer, just back from Moscow, where she was interviewing KGB officials for a  future program, seemed to blanch.  </P> <P> "Well, it doesn't surprise me," she said. "I mean, you all know what Marla  Maples is all about. It's about national soap opera, an irresistible slice of  American culture.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you what is more confounding, concerning something on the other  end," she said, deflecting the question. "Namely, why did viewers turn away in  droves from coverage of the Berlin Wall coming down?"  </P> <P> Donaldson, her co-host on 'PrimeTime Live,' noted, "We had the highest share on  'PrimeTime Live' to date, with a 26 share, with Marla Maples. Our lowest share  to date was the night when the wall came down, and we mobilized (a special) and  it was pretty good -- I'm real proud of it."  </P> <P> If there was a lesson to be learned here, Donaldson said, he hoped that ABC  executives wouldn't learn it. He said, metaphorically, that when the wall comes  down again, he wants ABC to do the same kind of coverage.  </P> <P> Jennings said that 'World News Tonight' ratings "held up pretty well" the week  of the Berlin Wall events.  </P> <P> Walters put in, "Diane did Marla. I can be holier than thou, folks, but I did  Donna Rice. (It was) the same interview."  </P> <P> The audience broke up in laughter.  </P> <P> Walters said that in 15 years on ABC, she has tried to mix interviews with  celebrities and heads of state "for my own sanity."  </P> <P> Koppel tried to insert a comment, but Walters countered that on Tuesday night  he had done a Tom Cruise interview on "Nightline" for a segment on summer  movies.  </P> <P> Again, affiliate laughter.  </P> <P> Koppel recovered: "Before we get carried away with too much sackcloth and  ashes, by and large the kind of programming you get from the network news  provides you with the opportunity to program for ratings the rest of the day."  </P> <P> As a capper to the session, former President Ronald Reagan came in to chat with  Walters about his recent meeting with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.  </P> <P> The ABC affiliates, meeting through today, seemed in a cheery mood. Network  programming is generally edging up in the ratings and the fall prime-time  schedule is considered promising.  </P> <P> But worse times were recalled by Thomas Murphy, who recently retired as chief  executive officer of Capital Cities/ABC. When the two companies merged 4 1/2  years ago, ABC was running 4-plus ratings points behind NBC in prime time. The  merger narrowed the gap to 1.7 points last season.  </P> <P> This was Murphy's last affiliates meeting. He was given a tribute that included  pictures from his childhood through his executive tenure, set to emotional  music. The affiliates gave him a standing ovation.  </P></p>

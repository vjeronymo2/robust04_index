			<p>BFN     [Text] Wellington, June 20 (XINHUA) -- China will continue  to uphold the policy of reform and opening-up and accelerate the  establishment of a new market economic system, declared the  visiting Chinese State Councilor Li Tieying here today.    In a speech at a reception given by the New Zealand Treasury  this evening, Li said China will also quicken the pace to make  its new economic system compatible with international practices  and take an active part in the international competition and  economic cooperation.    "This not only serves the fundamental interest of the  Chinese  people but also conforms to the common aspiration and  fundamental interests of the people in the rest of the world,"  he said.    Li, also minister in charge of the State Commission for  Restructuring the Economic Reforms, briefed the New Zealand  friends attending the reception about the achievements China has  made since the start of its economic reform 15 years ago.    He attributed the achievements to the guidance of Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building a socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    As China is an Asian country, developing and strengthening  its economic relations and cooperation with countries and  regions in the Asia-Pacific region constitutes an integral part  of its overall opening-up policy, he stated.    Li expressed China's readiness to actively expand its  cooperation with New Zealand in the political, economic,  scientific, technological and cultural fields under the  principle of equality and mutual benefit.</p>

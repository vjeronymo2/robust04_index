			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- A mass meeting was held  here Monday on the occasion of a "week of support to struggle of  Palestinian people."    Addressing the meeting, Yi So-yong, vice-chairman of the  Korean Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, said that the signing of  an accord of the Palestine self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the  West Bank's Jericho area between Palestine and Israel on May 4  was a fruition of the patient efforts of the Palestinian people  to retake the lost territory and restore their national rights.    He wished it would be a basis of building an independent  state of Palestine and the first step for a fair and  comprehensive solution to the Middle East issue.    Noting that if a durable peace in the Middle East is to be  preserved, Israel should withdraw from all the occupied Arab  land and the aggression and intervention of the imperialists in  this area should be ended, he said: We are convinced that the  day is sure to come when the Palestinian people will live a  happy life in their motherland after finally settling the  Palestinian issue, closely rallied around the PLO.    Palestinian ambassador to Korea Shahir Mohammed spoke next.    He said that the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il set an outstanding example in  international support to the just struggle of the Palestinian  people and they remain true to internationalism.    The U.S. imperialists are hatching up falsehood and slanders  about Korea's development of nuclear weapons, but this is  nothing but a demagogy to cover their disgusting purpose and  scheme against Korea, he said, and pointed out:    The Palestinian people and the Arab people fully support the  10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation advanced  by the great leader for the reunification of Korea, considering  it a most just and comprehensive one.    He supported the DPRK's position to solve the nuclear  problem.    Saying that the Palestinian people will always remain  faithful friends of the Korean people, he stressed that the  revolution of the two countries and friendship between the  peoples fostered by President Yasir 'Arafat and the great leader  President Kim Il-song will continue to develop in conformity  with mutual interests in the future, too.    A letter to the Palestinian president was adopted at the  meeting.</p>

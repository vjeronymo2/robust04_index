			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Now we will talk about the continuing conflict  between Greece and the other European Union [EU] countries.  That is unfortunate, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said  today. He is in Stockholm because of the continuing state visit  here of the Belgian royal couple. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent Lars Gunnar Erlandson] Willy Claes is in  Stockholm in connection with the state visit to Sweden of the  new Belgian royal couple. King Albert and Queen Paola and the  Swedish royal couple drove in horse-drawn carriages across sunny  Stockholm today. The foreign minister had talks with his  Swedish colleague Margaretha af Ugglas. The talks concerned,  among other things, the formal voting at the EU parliament  tomorrow. Willy Claes reassured the possibly nervous members of  the Swedish Government: Everything points towards the fact that  the four countries seeking membership will be accepted, the  Belgian foreign minister said. Margaretha af Ugglas took the  opportunity to persuade Belgium, an EU country, that Sweden with  its considerable contribution of troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina  should also be allowed to take a little more part in  decisionmaking when decisions are made by the superpowers and  the EU.</p>

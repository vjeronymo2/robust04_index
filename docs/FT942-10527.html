			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Holderbank in agreed bid for French cement group Holderbank, the Swiss-based international cement and aggregates group, is making an agreed bid for the cement, ready-mixed concrete and aggregates operations of Ciments et Engrais de Dannes et de l'Est (Cedest), for FFr2.6bn (Dollars 456m). The takeover, which is subject to approval by the French and European Union authorities, would double Holderbank's cement capacity in France. It would also raise its market share in northern France from 25 per cent to 35 per cent. However, it would still leave the group ranked third after Ciments Lafarge and Ciments Francais. The plan is for Holderbank to acquire 84.1 per cent of the share capital of Cedest from Compagnie Generale d'Industrie et de Participations (CGIP), at FFr2,000 per share ex-dividend for a total of FFr3.6bn. Holderbank would simultaneously sell the abrasives and fertilisers business units of Cedest back to CGIP for FFr1bn. Then, once official approval was achieved, it would make an offer on the Paris bourse to Cedest minority shareholders at the same price. Holderbank said the acquisition would 'round off' its holdings in France. Cedest is France's fifth-largest cement producer with a total annual production capacity of 2.7m tonnes. It also owns a cement grinding station on the island of La Reunion with annual capacity of 400,000 tonnes. In 1993, it sold 2.1m tonnes of cement, 1.7m tonnes of ready-mixed concrete and 3.2m tonnes of aggregates. For CGIP, the Cedest deal forms part of a programme of asset sales. The French group has for some months been trying to generate capital to replenish its resources, following a deal last year which lifted its holding in CarnaudMetalBox, the Anglo-French packaging group. CGIP has a string of other investments, including a stake in Cap Sogeti Gemini, the computer services concern. The group earlier this year raised FFr994m from a convertible bond issue. The Cedest disposal has left CGIP with a 'war chest' worth around FFr3bn, according to the company. It said it planned to use its cash to 'further develop' its role as an 'entrepreneur investor' in manufacturing industry and the service sector.</p>

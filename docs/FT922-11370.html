			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Arts: Rosenkavalier at length - Records NOBODY, not even those who love every note of it, will deny that Der Rosenkavalier is rather too long; vastly too long, some would say. Except with a Baron Ochs of irrepressible geniality - like the late Kurt Bohme - the Act 3 farce soon wears thin, and I know one producer who vowed to delete the entire levee scene from Act 1 if ever he had the chance (luckily, he never did). For all its cultivated virtues, Haitink's new recording ignores the problem, thus bringing the listener face to face with it. It is no secret that Strauss got carried away, as with almost every libretto he set later. His just-previous operas Salome and Elektra had left him room to expand within a safe one-act compass, but the newly sophisticated, conversational style of Hofmannsthal's three-act Rosenkavalier text tempted him to heedless felicities - beyond the playing-time that the comedy could bear. Afterwards, both creators admitted that. The usual stage solution is to make small cuts, but in recordings that would seem a cheat. It should be enough to remember that it is primarily a romantic comedy (conceived on the lines of a cleverer Fledermaus), not a lachrymose drama, and that during his own lifetime Strauss deplored the tempi at which other conductors liked to draw it out. Though Haitink takes only a couple of minutes longer over each act than Erich Kleiber did in 1954 (Decca 425 950-2: an evergreen tonic) the effect is dishearteningly staid. In the waltz-hullabaloo at the final rout of Baron Ochs, for example, the orchestral voices register superbly - and yet there is hardly a twinkle in its eye, let alone a frank guffaw: it sounds like a majestic interlude.

Teldec 9031-74001-2 Strauss used to insist that Ochs is, after all, a nobleman, but Kurt Rydl allows him to be nothing else. From his grand bass, judicious and authoritative, you would never guess that this is one of the great, bumptious scamps of operatic comedy. All three principal ladies have radiant moments (they would sound lovely in extracts), and their characters are delicately fixed. None of them, however, is a native speaker, and their repartee plods where it should dance. Dame Kiri, in particular, likes to make 'significant' phrases tell at half-speed. For Sophie, Barbara Hendricks' soprano sounds unwontedly dark, too much like Anne Sofie von Otter's fine, sober Octavian. In lesser parts, Richard Leech (the Italian Tenor), Claire Powell and Graham Clark (the intriguers) stand out. For serious Straussians, the new recording of his 1938 one-acter Friedenstag ('Day of Peace') - the first ever  - is of keener interest. It is an opera maudit, all but forgotten since the initial performances incurred Nazi disfavour because of its untimely, undisguised pacifism. A mediaeval Commandant and his forces, besieged in a fortress, are at the end of their resources; despite his loyal wife's yearning for a pacific future, he resolves to blow up the entire town rather than surrender. At what was to be the fatal moment, church bells ring out from everywhere: miraculously, peace has been declared from afar. The score is stern and single-minded, with touches of Kurt Weill's acerbic style. Only the Wife (Alessandra Marc, best in full cry) is allowed some romantic expansion. For the bleak Commandant, Roger Roloff's baritone is uningratiating but effective, and the many small roles are cast from strength - George Shirley, William Wildermann, Ruben Broitman and Richard Cassilly among them. Roger Bass conducts the large orchestra and excellent choruses with a sure, sympathetic hand. Some briefer notes on other new recordings of music from the period. With the Chicago Symphony, Neeme Jarvi continues his rewarding cycle of Franz Schmidt's symphonies with the 'Schubertian' Third. Fresh, eager playing, with the Scherzo at last performed properly up-tempo and to bracing purpose; only Jarvi's Adagio is an aberration, treated as an urgent, passionate Andante instead of the dark meditation it really is. The Hindemith Concerto is a surprisingly attractive fill-up. Among new virtuosi, the pianist Nikolai Demidenko and the very young Siberian violinist Maxim Vengerov have been making extraordinary impressions. Demidenko has often struck me as an eerily detached, chilly artist, but Medtner's music proves to suit him magnificently. The Second Concerto is the less remarkable here, hefty and rather close to Rakhmaninov (a Medtner classmate at the Moscow Concervatoire); the Third, however, is richly original and stirring, and Demidenko is magisterial with it. The phenomenal young Vengerov will doubtless make hundreds more records, in due course. His playing is immaculate and devoted in the Beethoven and Brahms sonatas on Teldec, but his Russian partner is obtrusive, often distracting - like someone determined to make himself noticed. The concerto record with Mehta is much more fun: gorgeous tone, dazzling feats - you can enjoy amazing guests with Vengerov's fantastic account of the 'Carmen' Fantasy.</p>

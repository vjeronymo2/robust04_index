			<p>Language: <F P=105>Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani, adviser to the </F> Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by an unidentified correspondent in  Tehran on 3 March--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Greetings, dear listeners. I  hope you are well. As you know, last Friday the Zionists  attacked the shrine of his holiness Abraham, peace be upon him,  and martyred a number of fasting Muslim Palestinians who were  saying their prayers. The subject of this program is to  investigate the dimensions of this great catastrophe. His  excellency Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani is the esteemed guest of  this program. During the course of this program, we will  benefit from his views. [passage omitted]    As my last question, at the beginning of our discussion, you  referred to countries such as Lebanon or Syria. What will be  the external effects of the massacre on Arab countries, such as  the countries you mentioned or on Jordan--in view of the fact  that those countries have announced that they will not take part  in the peace talks?    [Larijani] In my view, the first repercussion will come from  inside. 'Arafat has completely lost his credibility for the  talks. On one level, this means that all the peace talks have  been delivered such a blow that, in my view, they cannot be  revived. Of course, it is possible that they may hold two or  three meetings and such like. However, to Israel the  suppression of the intifadah is the precondition for any peace.  Therefore, peace talks suffered a major defeat as a whole, the  intensity of which was not predicted by any of the countries  that took part in the peace talks. The Islamic Republic was the  only country that rejected the talks from the start and  predicted their failure.    I believe that a much stronger resistance has started  against  the peace talks throughout the Islamic world. It is clear that  this resistance will influence the political leaders. Perhaps,  if the political leaders of the Islamic world pay attention,  this is the best opportunity to at least pay careful attention  for once to the basic issue of peace and security instead of to  all the lies that have been spoken about peace. The real basis  of this peace and security will be to change the regime in the  occupied territories. The regime is, in essence, an illegal,  racist, and aggressive regime.    [Correspondent] And against human rights?    [Larijani] Yes, and against human rights. It has the worst  record as a racist country, even when compared to the regimes of  South Africa or the former Zimbabwe. Therefore, let us talk  about the real, basic issue. Let us talk about a regime in  which Muslims, Christian, and Jews all live freely and enjoy  equal civil rights. Such a new regime will be the cure for the  present problems. No peace will be possible without it. I  believe that, under present conditions, the Islamic  Republic--while continuing its strong support on the  international scene for Islamic movements in the occupied  territories--should also present new ideas for the solution of  the problems. Those ideas should also be based on the evolution  of a regime--the changing of the present aggressive regime to a  legal regime that ensures equal rights for all. If that idea is  realized, I believe that it would be one of the best fruits of  the Islamic resistance for the Muslims, for Christians, and even  in the future for the Jews. This will be a very important  outcome.    [Correspondent] Once again, I thank you for your  participation in this program.    [Larijani] Thank you.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Business failures decline The number of business failures fell this year for the first time since 1988, with the biggest declines in London, Wales and the east Midlands, according to figures from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company. The report indicates small companies are finding it harder to climb out of recession than big ones, but finds further signs that the recovery is becoming better established. The total for companies going into liquidation or becoming bankrupt in England and Wales fell 11.5 per cent in the final quarter of this year compared with the corresponding period last year. There was a 19.8 per cent yearly decline in the third quarter. The figures show that the worst places for small businesses appear to be the west Midlands and north-west and north-east England, which all saw slight increases in small-business failures over the year. Total business failures in 1993 came to 48,066, down 7.5 per cent on the 51,947 registered last year. This compares with a 30.4 per cent rise in collapses last year from 39,827 in 1991. This year's figure is roughly twice that for 1990, the start of the recession, and is well above the peak in failures during the 1980s of 21,682, recorded in 1984. Part of the reason for the large number of collapses in recent years is that many of the new companies which mushroomed during the late 1980s boom encountered financial difficulties during the recession. Liquidations of large limited companies fell 14.4 per cent this year to 19,220, from 22,444 last year, while bankruptcies of small businesses fell by only 2.3 per cent, to 28,846. In the fourth quarter of this year, total business collapses came to 11,863, down on the 13,397 recorded in the final three months of last year. This last figure was the highest quarterly number of failures during the period of low economic growth. Failures in the fourth quarter of this year were slightly higher than the particularly low 10,320 collapses in the third quarter, though comfortably down on the 13,235 between April and June. In Scotland, collapses totalled 7,667 this year after 10,820 last year. However the figures are distorted by changes in Scots bankruptcy laws introduced this year. In the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, failures totalled 55,733, down 11.2 per cent last year.</p>

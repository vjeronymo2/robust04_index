			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has expressed  the intent of withdrawing from the Military Armistice  Commission, officials at the United Nations Command [UNC] in  Korea said on Monday.    In addition, North Korea has let it be known that they would  remove Polish members from the Neutral Nations Supervisory  Commission, a UNC official at the Armistice Commission said.  Early last year, North Korea withdrew Czech delegates from the  truce-watching commission. Poland and Czechoslovakia had been  the communist-side-chosen member countries of the four-country  supervisory commission, whose delegates were responsible for  watching the North Korean area.    The planned withdrawal by North Korea is an express  violation  of the Armistice Agreement, over the issue of which the U.N.  Command has been contacting North Korean delegates and UNC  member countries related to the maintenance of the truce  agreement, a UNC official said.</p>

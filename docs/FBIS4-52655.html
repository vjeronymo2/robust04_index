			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Foreign public figures  have denounced the United States for threatening the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea with regard to "the nuclear issue."    Amaral Matos, first executive secretary of the Mozambican  Committee for Friendship with the People of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea, released a statement on May 2  charging that the United States has reinforced aggression  forces, constantly bringing mass destruction weapons into South  Korea.    Stating that a durable peace cannot be achieved in the world  before the United States, a country stained with blood, is  erased from the globe, he said: "The world must unite with  each other and throttle and dismember the United States. [no  closing quotation mark as received]    Shandrajeet Yadav, member of Parliament of India,  co-chairman  of the All India Peace and Solidarity Organization and  vice-chairman of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity  Organization, told KCNA on April 26 that the United States has  escalated the plot to isolate and stifle the DPRK, crying for  "special inspection" and "sanctions" under the unreasonable  pretext of "nuclear suspicion."    Saying that to safeguard peace in Korea is a primary matter  in defending peace in Asia and the rest of the world, he  strongly urged the United States to stop arms buildup in South  Korea and promptly withdraw its troops and weapons of all kinds  from South Korea.    Don Borrie, chairman of the New Zealand-Democratic People's  Republic of Korea Society, in a statement April 22 stressed that  the New Zealand Government must not get involved in the  swindles of the United States and the South Korean authorities  but pursue an independent policy and maintain an anti-nuke stand.</p>

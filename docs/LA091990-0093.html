			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE KEATING INDICTMENT;  </P> <P> ARREST DELIGHTS MANY HOLDERS OF WORTHLESS BONDS;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: VICTIMS WHO LOST THEIR LIFE SAVINGS BY BUYING THE AMERICAN CONTINENTAL  PAPER AT LINCOLN S&amp;L HOPE THAT KEATING WILL GET A LONG PRISON TERM.  </P> <P> When Jack Lower was looking to reinvest his savings in 1988, he went to Lincoln  Savings &amp; Loan in Hemet where he had $34,000 on deposit. A teller there  suggested that he put it in bonds being sold by American Continental Corp.,  Lincoln's parent.  </P> <P> Lower did, but now rues the day. American Continental's securities --  high-yield, high-risk junk bonds -- now are virtually worthless.  </P> <P> But Lower, 75, of San Jacinto took some satisfaction out of the news Tuesday  that American Continental's former chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., and three  other American and Lincoln officials were indicted on 42 counts of securities  fraud and related charges.  </P> <P> "I hope this will mean a long prison term for Mr. Keating, and his accountants  and his lawyers," he said, adding that his investment in the bonds "was  practically everything we had saved, both my wife and I working all our lives."  </P> <P> The sentiment is widely shared by others who lost money by investing in bonds  issued by American Continental, which filed for bankruptcy in April, 1989. The  next day, federal regulators seized control of Irvine-based Lincoln. The  thrift's failure is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> But American Continental's collapse has already hit the pocketbooks of more  than 15,000 investors -- many of them elderly and depositors of Lincoln -- who  bought nearly $200 million in bonds sold through the thrift. Some of the  investors thought that the bonds were insured.  </P> <P> Keating has contended that the bondholders should have known otherwise, noting  that the public prospectus accompanying the bonds stated clearly that the bonds  were not insured and were not the same as certificates of deposit. Also,  Keating has contended, the bondholders are not as innocent and unsophisticated  as they make themselves out to be; they bought the bonds lured by their more  attractive yields, often 10% or more.  </P> <P> Such arguments don't hold much water with investors such as Donald Mikami, a  43-year-old Fountain Valley dentist, who lost $25,000 by investing in American  Continental's junk bonds. The money was being set aside for his and his wife's  retirement.  </P> <P> He called the charges against Keating "a modest beginning."  </P> <P> "We're all elated that finally some serious action has been taken, some  non-handslapping," he said. "We want to see some blood, we want to see some  teeth, or at least a pound of flesh."  </P> <P> Norman Lapin, a Los Angeles accountant whose parents invested $120,000 in  American Continental bonds, said people hold Keating personally responsible for  their lost savings.  </P> <P> "He knew what was going on," Lapin said.  </P> <P> He said the loss hasn't ruined his parents financially, but it has shaken them,  especially his father, a worrier who is 75 years old and the retired owner of a  dry cleaning plant.  </P> <P> "I can see it in my father, he won't spend a penny anymore to do anything,"  Lapin said. "He grew up in the Depression, and it's like somebody slapping you  again. For the first time in his life, he had felt secure."  </P> <P> Another investor, Harold Rosenberg, a Sherman Oaks lawyer who declined to say  how much he lost, said Keating is a product of his times.  </P> <P> "(Keating) put it very bluntly, he told the world that the government gave him  this opportunity. There it was staring him in the face and he did it,"  Rosenberg said. "I'm not built that way. I wouldn't know what to do with the  fancy china or the $2-million salary."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAIN STORY: A1  </P></p>

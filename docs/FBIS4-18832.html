			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] France has ruled out any  further military intervention in Rwanda such as its intervention  between October 1990 to December 1993. [passage omitted].    The French cooperation minister has moreover said that more  than 50 Rwandan ministers and high-ranking civil servants and  their families have been taking refuge in the French Embassy in  Kigali since yesterday evening, where they are now under the  protection of a unit of 30 French soldiers who are still in  Rwanda.</p>

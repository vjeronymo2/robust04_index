			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Cossacks to unite militias in own army COSSACK leaders agreed at the weekend to create a Cossack State Service from March 1, bringing together the claimed 4m Cossacks who have formed militias throughout Russia and in Russian communities in other former Soviet republics. The Cossacks, descended from frontier settlers under the Tsars, are concentrated in south Russia around the River Don. They have become increasingly involved in protecting the Russian population in regional conflicts in the Caucasus and made the announcement at the close of their convention in Russia. Two other hardline groups held conventions in Russia over the weekend. The once-banned National Salvation Front, a largely nationalist grouping, claimed that it had sent 18 volunteers from a recently created Russian National Legion to fight in Serbia. Mr Nikolai Lysenko, leader of the National Republican Party, told the RIA news agency that the Legion had enrolled an army of 300. Mr Mikhail Asatfiev, leader of the Constitutional Democrats, called for a boycott of the referendum on the constitution called for April 11, and demanded elections. The meetings were held as the official Itar Tass news agency claimed an army major had been arrested on Saturday for plotting the assassination of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, as a 'contribution to the cause of socialism'. Major Ivan Kislov, who had deserted from his base in the Far East on December 25, was arrested in the main government complex last Wednesday, where he was hiding in an attic room. Itar Tass quoted Major Kislov as saying he planned to disguise himself as a snow sweeper and assassinate Mr Yeltsin with a knife. In St Petersburg, a conference of hardline communist groups protested against the 'anti-popular' policies of the Russian government and called for the unity of all communist and nationalist forces.</p>

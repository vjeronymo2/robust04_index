			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: GrandMet fall steals limelight DRINKS group Grand Metropolitan (GrandMet) once again stole the stock market limelight yesterday announcing the loss of a major contract and seeing its shares drop 4 per cent, the steepest in the FT-SE 100. The group is losing its distribution contract for Absolut Vodka in the US after 13 years. Drinks analysts said that the contract was worth between Pounds 30-Pounds 40m a year in profits, although the impact would not be felt until the company's 1995 results. The revelation came as a shock to the London market, which has only just recovered from the flurry of news from GrandMet two weeks ago. This included boardroom changes and the sale of its Chef and Brewer chain for Pounds 730m to Scottish and Newcastle. GrandMet shares tumbled on yesterday's news, slipping below 400p at one stage, before recovering to close at 403p, a net fall of 15 on the day. Turnover was a chunky 13m. One analyst said that the succession of announcements from the company was unsettling for sentiment and that the latest development had forced analysts to scale down their forecasts for earnings growth.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe bid The VSEL takeover saga, one of the stockmarket's most widely followed special situations, sprang to life with the submarine maker surging 77 to 1475p following a counter-bid from British Aerospace, which tumbled 19 to 446p on the move. The market buzzed with speculation on a further round of bidding by GEC with best bets among analysts centring on a move upwards to 1500p cash. They also believed Sir Arnold Weinstock and his team would move soon - possibly before the December 7 deadline for a statement on VSEL from the Office of Fair Trading. BAe's new offer, 3.3 shares per VSEL share. puts a value of just under 1472p on the deal. It has backed this with a cash alternative that matches the existing 1400p a share cash offer from GEC. Vosper Thorneycroft got caught up in the bid fever, jumping 12 to 754p. More than 8m shares in BAe changed hands but none of the other protagonists was heavily traded. GEC improved 2 1/2 p to 288p in 3.2m turnover. Turnover in VSEL was just 1.7m. The first part of BAe's two-tier Pounds 535m rights issue to finance the deal is priced at 390p, a comfortable 11 per cent discount to market levels and right in line with the price set for BAe's last cash-call three years ago.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Russia angles for special Nato link Russia is to present an alternative 'Partnership for Peace' plan at a meeting on May 24 in Brussels between General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, and Nato leaders. The move threatens to create a rift between the Nato alliance and Russia. The former has made clear that the partnership, aimed at bringing former Communist states into association with Nato, is open to all on equal terms only, while Russia wants a special status. Gen Grachev said yesterday that 'none of the (Nato) structures have the right to subordinate those of the Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe. None can avoid taking Russia's interests into account - as the case of Bosnia showed. What is being presented (in the partnership) is not quite acceptable to us. We came to the conclusion - why shouldn't we present our own proposal?' A draft of the Russian version of the partnership is to be ready in a week for approval by President Boris Yeltsin before being unveiled in Brussels. Gen Grachev said the Russian version could be called the 'Pragmatic Partnership' - echoing the phrase used by Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, of the US-Russian relationship. However, Mr Ashton Carter, assistant US defence secretary, said in Moscow on Thursday: 'There is no room for a special mechanism. I hope Gen Grachev will not bring with him such conditions.' The defence minister sounded a more threatening note on negotiations on troop withdrawals from Estonia, the latest round of which are now going on. In a clear hint that the 2,500 troops in the country could be augmented, he said: 'The problem is reliable guarantees to provide normal human rights to the Russian-speaking population there. If the talks continue to drag on without results,the 2,500 troops we have there will stay. And if circumstances should change it won't take long for us to provide reliable security for Russian military bases in Estonia.' The withdrawal date for all Russian troops has been set at August 31. Russian troops have already withdrawn from Lithuania and an agreement to withdraw those based in Latvia was signed last month. Gen Grachev's comments revealed both the opportunities and the tensions in the Russian military's relationship with the west - a relationship deepened by two days of talks between senior Russian and US officials in Moscow on Wednesday and Thursday. Following the talks, Mr Carter, who led the US side, said that the two former adversaries had informed each other of strategic and other issues with an unprecedented degree of openness - and that they would now extend this policy of glasnost into hitherto forbidden zones such as the number of warheads and the storage of fissile materials.</p>

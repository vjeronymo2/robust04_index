			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Government unmoved by Adams letter: Security forces remain on full alert in Ulster - Mayhew optimistic on prospects of peace The government was last night studying a letter from Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, calling for direct talks on Northern Ireland - but continued to insist that there could be no dialogue without a permanent end to violence. The letter urging Mr John Major, the prime minister, to end the stalemate by meeting Sinn Fein to clarify the Downing Street declaration was delivered on the first day of the IRA's three-day ceasefire. A Downing Street spokesman reacted cautiously and said the government might respond to Mr Adam's request for talks, which the Sinn Fein leader says would be aimed exclusively at clarification and not negotiation, 'in the next day or two'. Earlier in the day, however, Downing Street had reiterated the government's position: 'We are not negotiating with them and we are not going to clarify the joint declaration. They know what needs to be done; a renunciation of violence.' Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein national chairman, yesterday denied that his party was in contact with the government - in spite of suspicions on the subject expressed by some unionist politicians. He said he was not aware that any part of the republican movement was in contact with London. With an extension to the IRA ceasefire - due to end at midnight tomorrow - highly unlikely in the absence of a positive government response, prospects for a breakthrough remain slim. Security forces in the province remain on full alert, in spite of the temporary suspension of violence, and there are fears that the end of the ceasefire will be met by an upsurge in paramilitary activity by republicans and loyalists. Mr Hartley, who was in London to deliver Mr Adams' letter, urged Mr Major to give an 'imaginative response' to what he described as an 'unprecedented initiative' by the IRA which demonstrated republican readiness to be flexible in the search for peace. He criticised the government's refusal to talk to Sinn Fein, given its readiness to do so from mid 1990 until late last year. 'When we raised points for clarification then, we got them very easily,' he said. 'It does seem odd the British are now saying 'no' at a time when there is a real possibility of political movement and a momentum being created.' Ms Lucilita Bhreatnach, Sinn Fein general secretary, said that Dublin had provided satisfactory clarification of the Downing Street document - but that ambiguities and uncertainties remained which London had to clear up. She declined to be more specific, saying it would be 'unhelpful' at this stage. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday used a visit to Canada to deliver an upbeat message on the prospects for peace. He also reiterated the government's view that political violence had 'no place' in a democracy. In a speech at Montreal-based Bombardier Aerospace - owner of Short Brothers, Ulster's largest manufacturing employer - Sir Patrick said the Downing Street declaration would do much to bring about an end to terrorist violence. The people of Northern Ireland, like those of the Republic, rejected the concept of a three-day 'abstention from political violence'. Focusing principally on inward investment, Sir Patrick said that Ulster had accounted for 14 per cent of all new investment into the UK in 1992-93 in spite of having only 2.8 per cent of the population. Overseas investors recognised the 'essential normality' of conditions in Northern Ireland, he said.</p>

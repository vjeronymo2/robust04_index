			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 29 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Libya  welcomes any effort by any country or grouping, like the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to arrange  negotiations aimed at getting the United Nations Security  Council to lift sanctions against the country.    The secretary for foreign affairs in the Libyan General  People's Congress, Saad Mustafa Mujbar [name and title as  received], said Wednesday his country commended Malaysia for  reserving its stand on imposing wide sanctions against Libya.    The sanctions were imposed in April 1992 following Libya's  refusal to hand over two of its citizens for trial in the United  States in connection with the 1988 bombing of Pan America Flight  103 over Lockerbie in Scotland in which 270 people were killed.    Mujbar, who leaves for home today after a four-day visit,  told a press conference that Libya was ready to co-operate with  the international community to reach the truth, but not to the  extent of violating its laws and constitution.    A proposal by Scotland to have the two suspects tried in  Scotland was rejected by the United States, Britain and France.</p>

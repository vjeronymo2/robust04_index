			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (15): Pharmaceuticals enjoy good health - Chemicals / The rise of the drugs companies has been almost miraculous DIFFERENCES in performance between the dynamic European pharmaceuticals companies and their more sluggish chemical counterparts are all too apparent from the results of this year's FT500. Buoyed by ageing populations and increasingly expensive and sophisticated drugs, the pharmaceuticals groups have proved to be inoculated against the insidious slowdown of the western economies. The rise of the pharmaceuticals companies has been almost miraculous. While other industries have been struck down by the recession, most top European drugs companies have reported sales growth averaging about 13 per cent over the past 12 months. These have been the ultimate counter-cyclical stocks. Any fund manager without pharmaceutical stocks in their portfolio during 1991 is now feeling pretty sick. The capitalisation ratings given by European markets to the drugs companies reflect their charmed status. Many are positioned far higher in the FT500 than chemical giants with sales many times their turnover. Glaxo, for example, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group and the world's number two, has clambered up the table from 10th to third - an impressive achievement for such a large company. Over the past year Glaxo's market capitalisation has doubled to Dollars 35.4bn while sales increased 6.9 per cent to Dollars 4.9bn. Meanwhile, sales at ICI were Dollars 22.2bn - four times greater than Glaxo's - but its capitalisation was only Dollars 16.2bn. Other pharmaceuticals groups benefiting from the markets' approval include Wellcome, the fastest-growing company in the fast-growing British pharmaceutical sector. Wellcome recorded one of the sector's most impressive leaps this year, doubling its market capitalisation and moving from 64th to 27th. This autumn, the company posted a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to August 31. Meanwhile, SmithKline Beecham moved from 23rd to 17th after its pharmaceuticals sales offset disappointing performance in consumer products. Roche, the Swiss group, remained steady in 18th position compared with 17th last year. And Astra, the highly-rated and rapidly-expanding Swedish group, clambered from 48th to 37th. There is no company above Astra in the FT500 with a lower turnover. Although pharmaceuticals companies and their chemicals counterparts share the same scientific base, their industrial and financial performances could hardly have proved more different. Bulk chemical companies have had a dreadful year. Margins have been squeezed as demand fell, prices collapsed and environmental costs soared. Meanwhile, new capacity ordered during the boom times of the late 1908s continued to come on stream, depressing prices further. Some groups managed to escape through the performance of their pharmaceutical divisions. At ICI, for example, pharmaceuticals generated 75 per cent of the company's pre-tax profits last quarter. That sort of achievement, together with the company's rationalisation programme and a little bit of bid froth whipped up by Hanson's 2.8 per cent stake, allowed ICI to move from 19th to 16th place. Similarly, Bayer, the highest rated of the big three German chemical groups, now generates about half of its profits through pharmaceuticals. Mr John Doree, chemicals analyst at Hoare Govett, believes this has helped the company's shares gain 25 per cent over the past 12 months compared with a 10 per cent rise in the Dax index. But Bayer's achievements are in marked contrast with those of BASF and Hoechst whose shares have gained only 8 per cent and 6 per cent respectively during the past year. Not surprisingly, Bayer moved up in the FT500 from 31st to 28th, while Hoechst fell six places to 45th and BASF also dropped six places to 46th. New entries to the FT500 included Institut Merieux of France and Gehe of Germany. Nobel Industries, the Swedish chemicals and defence group slipped out of the ratings as did UCB, the Belgian company and EMS-Chimie of Switzerland. Over the next 12 months, analysts will be looking carefully for any sign of recovery in the world economy. The question is whether an upturn will be sufficient to overcome over-capacity problems in the chemical industry. If it is, then the bulk chemical companies, with their highly cyclical exposure, could prove useful investments. Similarly, the pharmaceuticals stocks could start underperforming the market. Timing will prove crucial.</p>

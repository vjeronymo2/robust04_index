			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTERS FAIL TO DELAY DEPARTURE OF VINCENNES  </P> <P> Three protesters tried to chain themselves to a bridge Tuesday to delay  departure of the guided missile cruiser Vincennes.  </P> <P> Police stopped them, and the drawbridge was raised, allowing the ship to leave  for San Diego.  </P> <P> Last summer the Vincennes mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner over the  Persian Gulf, killing 290 people.  </P> <P> The ship was in Portland as part of an anti-drug program involving  schoolchildren. Paul Kerchum said he and other protesters objected to the  message that "it's OK to murder hundreds of people, as long as you are not on  drugs."  </P></p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / French dockers return to work FRENCH dockers returned to work yesterday after a five-day strike over working practices that crippled main ports and cost the economy an estimated FFr1bn (Pounds 102m), Reuter reports from Paris. The CGT union, which organises most of the country's 8,300 dock workers, called off the stoppage at Marseilles and Bordeaux on Sunday after the government had agreed to discuss its reform programme. Both ports were back to normal yesterday. French dockers still work to conditions laid down in 1947 that include a 140-day working year. The government says the sector is becoming dangerously uncompetitive. Union leaders fear that reform would lead to heavy job losses.</p>

The building of the ship lift project, which requires a  total  investment of more than 200 million yuan, is aimed at  establishing a reliable basis for the design and construction of  another ship lift at the gigantic water control dam at the Three  Gorges on the Chiang Jiang, said engineers responsible for the  construction of the ship lift on Qingjiang river.    According to them, the main technical indexes of the ship  lift under construction, designed and being constructed by the  Wuhan Ship Building Company, observe a general proportion of one  to ten with the ship lift to be built at the Three Gorges water  control dam.    The ship lift now under construction is a major part of the  Geheyan water control project. The ship lift, consisting of two  separate vertical ship lifts, is expected to have a maximum  lifting height of 122 m and a maximum lifting weight of 15,000  tons when completed and put into use in 1997, said the engineers.    Construction of the ship lift at the Geheyan water control  project of Qingjiang river is of great importance for promoting  the economy of Hubei and opening up mountainous southwestern  Hubei in the Qingjiang river watershed.</p>

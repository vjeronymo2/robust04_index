			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said the Arab  economic boycott is becoming void and even the Arab states are  changing their attitude toward it. Arab businessmen are  visiting Israel to investigate the possibility of investing  here. Four Arab states -- Oman, Qatar, Tunisia, and Morocco --  have expressed a willingness to host the economic committees in  the multilateral negotiations. There is a readiness by  multinational companies, which had previously caved in to the  boycott, to invest in Israel. Even in Japan -- the largest state  to support the boycott -- there has been a revolutionary change  and Japanese businessmen and companies plan to invest in Israel.  He said, however, that he still finds it hard to foresee an  Arab League decision to annul the boycott. Our correspondent  Yo'el Nir reports that Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin made the  remarks in answer to a motion in the Knesset.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Japanese real estate groups dip sharply at pre-tax level Mitsubishi Estate, one of Japan's leading real estate groups, posted a 32.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y47.4bn (Dollars 451.42m), on turnover which increased by 26.1 per cent to Y440bn. Post-tax profits rose 3.4 per cent to Y38.3bn. The dividend was maintained at Y8 per share. Brokers Baring Securities said the second half of the year had been much weaker for Mitsubishi than the first six months and that there was little sign of a turnaround. Mitsubishi predicted pre-tax profits for the current year down at Y35bn on sales of Y420bn, below analysts expectations. Mitsui Fudasan, Japan's biggest real estate developer, reported pre-tax profits down 36.2 per cent at Y16.4bn, on turnover down 5.2 per cent at Y795bn. The company said it would maintain the dividend at Y9 per share, even though the business outlook looked severe, with the possibility of higher interest rates and oversupply in the condominiums market. It predicted pre-tax profits would fall to Y12bn during the year to March 31 1995 on sales of Y730bn. Tokyu Land, the property developer, posted pre-tax profits down 16.6 per cent at Y5.5bn, following a collapse of its building leasing operations, according to the company. This was the third year profits had fallen, said Mr Kyuichiro Kinoshita, vice-president. The group also sustained losses on its golf course and leisure activities, together with a sharp decline in foreign exchange profits, he said. Turnover increased 3.5 per cent to Y266bn. The dividend was maintained at Y5 per share. The group warned margins would come under pressure during the present financial year because of competition in the housing market and a deterioration in the building leasing business. The company said it would sell a building in Shibuya, Tokyo for Y10bn to its do-it-yourself subsidiary Tokyu Hands. Pre-tax profits would fall to Y5.3bn on sales of Y280bn during the current year, the group predicted.</p>

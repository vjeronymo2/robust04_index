			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Confidence is casualty of Sharif's fall: Pakistan's businessmen are wary of future of reforms BUSINESS confidence is emerging as one of the principle casualties of the recent downfall of Pakistan's reformist prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif. 'It's like the train has slowed down incredibly because the driver has left,' was how one leading banker recently summed up the mood. Pakistan's interim government, which has promised to hold national elections on July 14, denies that newspaper reports of large-scale withdrawals from foreign exchange bank accounts in the country reflect a nervousness among savers. Signs of fatigue continue to hamper stock prices on the Karachi Stock Exchange, the country's leading stock market. While the market has recovered its level before Mr Sharif's dismissal, businessmen do not see this as a sign of any larger recovery of confidence. The uncertainty centres on the future of economic policies and the outcome of political developments. A programme of economic reforms was at the heart of Mr Sharif's agenda whose 29-month-long government was sacked on April 18 by Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the Pakistan president, for alleged corruption. Mr Farooq Leghari, the new finance minister, has said all economic reforms will remain intact and has promised to press ahead with liberalisation policies. Many businessmen accept that Mr Sharif's reforms will not be reversed, because that would further damage the economy. But there are fears of a slowing down in the pace of future reforms. Businessmen also point to macro-economic problems and political uncertainty as well as statements from the new government that the cases of factories privatised under Mr Sharif will be reviewed to consider allegations of corruption. Mr Arif Habib, president of the KSE, said: 'Whenever a government changes, the investors have apprehensions about future policies.' He said the short-term nature of the government which replaced Mr Sharif did not help to ensure continuity in policies. 'Uncertainty will prevail till after the elections,' he said. Mr Tahiq Khaliq, president of Karachi's chamber of commerce and industry, said: 'New commitments (from businesses) have slowed down because of uncertainty.' He expected few changes to take place until investors saw an elected government come to office. Last week Daewoo, the South Korean conglomerate, said it was holding back on plans to invest up to Dollars 400m (Pounds 259.7m) in an industrial complex in Karachi until after the elections. On the economic front, an on-going recession in the textile sector plus a growing budget deficit has also added to the fears. Textile stocks make up roughly a third of the 643 companies registered on the KSE. Projections of low profitability, especially in the spinning sector, have pushed down share prices, leading stock brokers said. The interim government has announced a relief package for the textile sector, with concessions on some duties, but it is too early to say how much of a boost this will provide. The KSE index rose nearly 10 points yesterday as a result, brokers said. The budgetary deficit for the fiscal year ending in June is expected to exceed Rs100bn (Pounds 2.43bn) compared with a target of Rs65bn. Mr Leghari recently described the deficit as 'problem number one' and appealed to businessmen to help resolve the country's economic problems. His task of re-establishing confidence has become more difficult with signs of conflict between key members of the interim government over the future of the country's four provincial assemblies. It has raised fears that Ms Benazir Bhutto's opposition People's Democratic Alliance may pull its ministers out of the cabinet. Mr Mian Habibullah, president of the Federation of Pakistani Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said he opposed any review of the previous government's privatisation efforts, adding that 'people (businesses) invested in good faith'. Other businessmen said such a review would only increase investors' fears and could make it difficult for any future government to privatise the country's deficit-ridden public sector industries. Many other businessmen are convinced that if the new government does not move quickly to establish fresh confidence through fiscal incentives and further commitments to continuity of policies, signs of fatigue may spread.

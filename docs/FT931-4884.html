			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / ICI clears way for Zeneca issue by settling US patent dispute IMPERIAL Chemical Industries and Barr Laboratories, the New-York-based generics group, have settled a drugs patent dispute in a move that helps clear the way for ICI's wholly-owned subsidiary Zeneca to make its Pounds 1.3bn rights issue in June. ICI and Barr have reached an out-of-court settlement concluding a dispute over the US patents for Nolvadex, Zeneca's best-selling breast cancer drug. Last April, ICI's Nolvadex patents were invalidated by a US southern district court of New York. It decided irregularities in filing for the US patent for Nolvadex had made the patent unenforceable. ICI was appealing. The court's decision put Nolvadex's US annual sales of about Dollars 265m (Pounds 186m) at risk. The patents were supposed to run for another nine years. Recent US patent expiries - including that of ICI's heart drug Tenormin - have been followed by sales falling as much 50 per cent over 12 months, as generic manufacturers undercut the price of the previously patented brand. The two groups have now agreed to dismiss all claims raised in the action. Both have acknowledged there was a substantial possibility that the drug's US patents would have been held valid and enforceable. The drug's US patents are scheduled to expire in 2002. They have expired in other countries. Under the agreement, ICI will pay Dollars 21m to Barr. The US group will enter a non-exclusive distributorship agreement with Zeneca and will start selling the drug from November 1. ICI indicated the price the medicine would be sold to Barr would not allow the US company to undercut Nolvadex's existing price substantially. ICI announced last month that it was to spin off Zeneca, its pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and speciality chemicals subsidiary. The demerger needs to be confirmed in May by an extraordinary general meeting. Barr is also challenging Wellcome, the UK group, over the validity of its patents for AZT, the HIV-treatment. Glaxo, Europe's biggest drugs group, yesterday announced it had been notified by the UK's Medicines Control Agency that its new inhaled steroid asthma treatment Fluticasone had been given a product licence. The decision increases the likelihood of the drug receiving licences from other regulatory bodies.</p>

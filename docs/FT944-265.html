			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Call for gaming machines to pay out all prizes in cash Gaming machines should be able to pay out all their prizes in cash instead of tokens, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said yesterday. He also suggested that betting shops should be allowed to install gaming machines and that maximum cash prize limits should be changed. The proposals, in a consultation paper to be issued by the Home Office early next year, were welcomed by the fruit machine industry. Prizes are currently paid partly in tokens that can only be used to play more games or to buy drinks from a pub where the machine is installed. Mr Howard said: 'Players feel cheated when they win on the machines and only get tokens which cannot be exchanged for cash. 'A new all-cash machine would dispense with tokens, allowing players to keep their winnings rather than being left with tokens for the machine. 'The proposals will provide greater flexibility and choice over what type of machine may be installed in different venues. 'In making these changes it is sensible to allow betting shops to install the new machines.'</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Reece incurs loss in second half As foreshadowed, Reece, which has interests in glass and brick making machinery as well as cycle manufacture, ran up a loss of Pounds 137,000 in the second six months which left profits for the full 1991 year at Pounds 403,000 pre-tax. That compared with profits of Pounds 415,000 for the preceding 15 months and came from turnover of Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 11.7m). The group resumed dividend payments with 0.1p at the interim stage. However, the final is omitted as a consequence of a 'disappointing' second half.</p>

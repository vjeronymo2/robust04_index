			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade Across Eastern Border </F> Increasing Rapidly"]    [Text] Trade between Finland and Russia is continuing its  explosive growth. During the first three months of this year,  nearly 390,000 metric tons of export and import goods crossed  the border. If the trend continues at this rate, the total trade  in goods will exceed 1.5 million metric tons this year. The  corresponding figure in 1993, a record year, was just under  900,000 metric tons.    The main increase has been in exports to Russia. During the  first three months of this year, the flow of export goods  increased a full 217 percent over the corresponding period last  year. At the same time, the flow of import goods rose by 4.9  percent.    Most of the export products originate in other countries and  pass through Finland as goods in transit. During the first three  months of this year, transit trade totaled 214,000 metric tons.  That is an increase of 365 percent over the corresponding period  last year.</p>

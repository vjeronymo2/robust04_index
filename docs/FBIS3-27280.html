A U.S. delegation led by assistant trade representative  Dorothy Dwoskin will arrive in Beijing on February 20 to pay a  four-day visit to China at the invitation of the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).    During their stay in Beijing, Dorothy and her party will  talk  with a Chinese delegation headed by Gu Yongjiang, vice minister  of foreign trade and economic cooperation, on the restoration of  China's signatory party status in GATT.    This will be the first round of talks between the two  countries on the issue after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round  of GATT.    An official with MOFTEC said that China attached great  importance to this round of talks, and will exchange views with  the U.S. delegation on issues of common concern as well as how  to accelerate China's re-entry into GATT.    The official added that the two-day talks will also make  preparation for the 16th meeting of the China working party on  GATT scheduled to be launched in March in Geneva.    The first round of Sino-U.S. talks on China's re-entry into  GATT was held in November, 1986.</p>

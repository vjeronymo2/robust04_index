For the first time since December 12, this  created a basis for joint actions of the two branches of power  in implementing the economic reform.    Glazyev believes that "the work of the government does not  correspond exactly to the political course, outlined in the  presidential address to the Federal Assembly." Substantiating  his point of view, he cited numerous facts of privileges granted  by the government to some enterprises and industries, of  mistakes made in the sphere of economic restructuring and the  implementation of the privatization programme. Instead of  supporting science-intensive industry on a priority basis, it  was nearly ruined: The reduction of output reached the  catastrophic level of 90 per cent. This is true of  microelectronics and precise machine-building.    According to Glazyev, it is necessary to insist on the  adoption of laws, which will simplify the tax system and make it  more rational, establish order in the sphere of tax collecting  and toughen criminal responsibility for the violation of the  currency and customs legislation. In this case the state will  have enough strength for supporting priority industries.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This announcement consists of three parts: Part I_Background, Part II_Application Process and Part III_Reporting Requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part I_Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is the Department of Labor's experience that few out-of-school youth programs supported by the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) have been effective. JTPA programs in general appear to have no positive impact on the earnings, employment, criminal involvement, or welfare dependency of male and female out-of-school youth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current JTPA Title II&hyph;C programs spend an average of $2,800 per youth and last perhaps four or five months. It may well be that this is too small and too short term of an investment to expect to turn around the lives of economically and educationally disadvantaged youth. We also believe that new and different approaches to serving the needs of youth should be tested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) believes that more comprehensive and innovative second-change approaches need to be designed and tested that focus on the needs of youth, particularly, out-of-school youth, on a variety of fronts. This solicitation is a pilot effort by the Department and ETA to move in that direction. In both the single site and multi-site grants, the Department is particularly looking for models that are more comprehensive and intensive than are typically now provided by JTPA Title II&hyph;C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ideally, the development of new approaches to serving youth occurs in several stages_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An idea or model is developed; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The idea is put into practice at one site, and then perhaps at a second site with some modifications; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The model program is then pilot-tested a several sites; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The model program then enters a demonstration stage in which it is formally evaluated using random assignment of program applicants to treatment and non-treatment group at several sites; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If the random-assignment evaluation results come out positive, the model program is replicated widely across the country. This grant announcement covers stages (2) and (3) of this process_the pilot-testing of a new approach at a first or second site or at multiple sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part II_Application Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

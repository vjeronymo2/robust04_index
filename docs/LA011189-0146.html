			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> GIRL'S BODY REJECTS BOY'S HEART  </P> <P> The heart of a 15-year-old boy -- transplanted into the girl he loved three  years ago -- is being rejected by the girl's body, and she will have to undergo  another transplant.  </P> <P> Doctors are looking for a suitable heart for Donna Ashlock, 18, who has been  living on the heart of Felipe Garza since Jan. 4, 1986. Doctors learned last  month that the Garza heart has been permanently damaged by repeated attempts by  Donna's body to reject it. Garza died of a broken blood vessel in his brain  only a few days after he told his mother that he had had a premonition of death  and that he wanted his heart to go to Donna, who had learned a year earlier  that she needed a transplant.  </P></p>

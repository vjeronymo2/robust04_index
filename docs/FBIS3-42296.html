			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>   [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has  announced that the health of its founder, Shaykh Ahmad Yasin,  began to deteriorate four days ago.    Shaykh Yasin has been in Kefar Yona prison in occupied  Palestine since May 1989. The Israeli Military Court sentenced  him to life imprisonment plus 15 years.    The Hamas representative in Jordan, Muhammad Nazzal, told  AL-RA'Y that Hamas received reports from the occupied  territories saying that Shaykh Yasin's health is precarious. He  denounced Arab and international public opinion for ignoring the  cause of Shaykh Yasin and urged human rights organizations and  international establishments to pressure Israel to free Shaykh  Yasin immediately. The shaykh has spent four years in prison in  very bad physical condition.    Nazzal said that delays in the trial of Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz  al-Rantisi [spokesman of former Palestinian deportees in south  Lebanon] have no legal justification, and are aimed at  preventing him, and those who returned from Marj al-Zuhur, from  playing their political role in confronting the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement.    Nazzal disclosed that the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions,  Hamas's military wing, and the Fatah Hawks groups coordinate  military operations confronting Israeli occupation.    He said the martyrdom of Salim Muwafi, a Fatah Hawks  commander in Gaza, a few days ago emphasized that the enemy is  going ahead in its onslaught to liquidate all mujahidin and  strugglers, regardless of their organizational affiliation. He  hailed Fatah Hawks groups who announced they will continue armed  struggle.    Answering a question on delaying the Doctors Union elections  in the Gaza Strip, Nazzal said: The delay is supposed to last  for a few days as a result of the recent martyrdom of one of  Fatah Hawks commanders.    A similar delay was recently announced for elections at the  Islamic University in Gaza following the martyrdom of 'Imad  'Aqil, one of the 'Izz-al-Din Battalions commanders.    Answering a question, Nazzal said Hamas is not against a  phased solution that restores any part of the occupied  Palestinian land, on the condition that the Zionist entity is  not recognized and that no part of the Palestinian land is ceded.    He added: The current negotiations to implement the  Gaza-Jericho agreement do not represent a phased solution as  presented by the PLO in the 1970's.    Concluding his statement to AL-RA'Y, Nazzal said the Davos  talks proved that the Palestinian side is the only party making  concessions, and that delaying the signing of the agreement was  simply a maneuver to market the new concessions made by the PLO  leadership and to convince the Palestinian and Arab public  opinion to accept the agreement as an important political  achievement.    Nazzal expected more Palestinian concessions during the next  PLO-Israeli talks. He said these concessions will tempt Israel  to tighten its position on all issues negotiated during the next  stage.</p>

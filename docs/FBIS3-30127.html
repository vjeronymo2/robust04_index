Now that the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks, which Prime  Minister Hosokawa had boastfully described as a venue resulting  in an "adult relationship" between Japan and the United States,  have created a situation that is casting a dark cloud over  bilateral relations between the two countries. As usual, there  are strong signs that government leaders are trying to shift the  responsibility for the breakdown of the talks onto others. This  phenomenon can be regarded as an expression of their irritation  at their failure to find effective ways to soften the U.S. stand  on Japan, which is increasingly hard-line.    On the evening of 11 February right after the breakdown of  the Japan-U.S. framework talks, a dinner party was held at the  official residence of Japanese Ambassador to Washington Kuriyama  in Washington. The dinner party was attended by Deputy Foreign  Minister Matsuura, who was in charge of administrative matters  in the talks, and Bowman Cutter, special assistant to the  president. At the dinner party, Mr. Matsuura asked Cutter, "How  do you feel now?" In response, Cutter said "it was horrible."    Why did Mr. Cutter said "it was horrible?" An informed  source in the Clinton administration on 17 February told a  Japanese Government official whom he has known well for a long  time: "Mr. Cutter and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative  Barshevsky have reported to the president that the Japan-U.S.  framework talks will hammer out agreements. They have reported  to the president to that effect after a "Japanese close to  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata" had hinted to  them that the Japanese side was willing to make concessions.    On the evening of 7 February, the foreign minister talked  over a dinner with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mondale in the  Foreign Ministry's Iikura Hall. It has been speculated that  during the dinner party, the foreign minister might have hinted  that Japan would make concessions and the speculation has  sparked allegations that the foreign minister is a "culprit"  responsible for the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks.  The foreign minister has continued to take a stand against  numerical targets that have become the hot point of dispute  between Japan and the United States.    The foreign minister was still negative about Japan's  acceptance of the U.S. demand for setting the numerical targets  when Deputy Foreign Minister Matsuura reported by telephone to  him for nearly one hour just before he left on 5 February for  the United States to begin final negotiations with U.S.  officials.    The prime minister met with cabinet ministers in charge of  the Japan-U.S. framework talks in his official residence just  before the foreign minister departed for Washington. During the  meeting, the Foreign Ministry asserted: "The foreign minister  will visit Washington for talks with the U.S. side prior to  Japan-U.S. summit talks, but he will carry no card to play at  the talks. International Trade and Industry Minister Kumagai  should go to Washington for the talks." The prime minister and  the foreign minister came to a final conclusion that the foreign  minister, who is also "deputy prime minister," will visit the  United States. Shortly after the meeting at the prime minister's  official residence, the foreign minister met with senior Foreign  Ministry officials; the meeting was held in a gloomy atmosphere.  At the meeting, the foreign minister said: "At the present  stage, we have no choice but to oppose the U.S. demand for  setting numerical targets to the last" and then decided to leave  for Washington with empty hands.    A government official who is well aware of these events has  said: "It had been speculated that at the Hata-Mondale meeting,  Mr. Hata hinted that Japan would make concessions, but the  speculation has been exhausted. A senior Foreign Ministry  official was present and the Foreign Ministry kept a record of  the meeting. The United States might have misunderstood that if  it pulled the foreign minister out of Japan to Washington, he  would certainly come here with a compromise proposal."    A Foreign Ministry official has pointed out: "The foreign  minister simply met with the American ambassador, but the  meeting has spawned speculation. Ichiro Ozawa met with the  American ambassador on 7 February and the international trade  and industry minister met with him on 8 February."    Who is the "Japanese person close to the foreign minister"?  There is a rumor that he is an influential politician who has  nothing to do with the Foreign Ministry, but the truth still  remains unclear. This type of approach to the United States  smacks of the "dual diplomacy" that was often noted during the  period the Liberal Democratic Party was in power.    The United States has complained that Japan plans to cut the  income tax only for one year, and the foreign minister has been  criticized for his failure to assuage U.S. complaints at talks  with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor. In response, the Foreign  Ministry has refuted the criticism, saying: "The foreign  minister has stressed that, as a realistic issue, it is  impossible to cut the income tax for only one year."    Recently, President Clinton harshly criticized the Japanese  bureaucracy as standing in the way of the prime minister's  reform efforts, while supporting steps taken by the prime  minister for reforms. In this way, the President made clear  "his strategy to separate politics from bureaucracy." The  government and ruling coalition parties are still continuing  their "research for culprits," and this could make the U.S.'s  tough trade stand on Japan "effective."</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Safer cheques THE CHEQUES ACT, a private member's bill sponsored by Conal Gregory MP, became law on Monday. It means that writing 'account payee only' on cheques makes it impossible to divert them to a third party. Cheques crossed in this way are now non-transferable and can only be paid into the account of a named payee. If funds are wrongly paid out, the error lies with the collecting bank. The original signatory and beneficiary of the cheque are both protected. Though the Act is now law, it will take three months before its commencement orders are issued and it begins to function. Several of the high street banks, including Barclays and Lloyds, say they are considering issuing personal customers with cheques marked 'account payee only.' Customers who want to issue transferable cheques - mostly small traders in a few traditional markets - would be able to request old-style cheques. For the rest of us, the account would offer greater security from having payment diverted by a fraudster, though there may be complications in cases when a cheque issuer gets a payee's name slightly wrong. But watch out. The change does not apply to another expression commonly written on cheques, 'not-negotiable'. Not-negotiable is not another way of saying that a cheque cannot be transferred. What it means is that if the cheque is transferred, the new payee has no better claim over the payment than the original payee - for instance if the cheque is stopped.</p>

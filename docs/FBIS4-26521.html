			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanchang, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Jiujiang, an eastern  Chinese city with an excellent harbor on the Chang Jiang river,  has accelerated its infrastructure construction to provide  better conditions for overseas investment.    According to an official from the city, the central  government and Jiangxi Province are spending over three billion  yuan on 20 key construction projects in Jiujiang during the  Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995).    Opened to foreign ships in 1992, Jiujiang harbor has regular  cargo shipping services to various parts of the world. Its  airport links the city with Beijing, Nanjing and Huiyang in  Guangdong Province. New air routes are being planned with  regular flights to Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and  Haikou.    A major bridge across the Chang Jiang river is being built  in  the city. Railway lines from Beijing to Kowloon, from Shanghai  to Chongqing, and from Jiujiang to Hefei, which are all under  construction, will make the city an important transportation  center.    With a favorable investment environment and promising  potential, the city approved 144 foreign investment projects  during last year alone, with an investment of 140 million U.S.  dollars.    To further improve its investment conditions, the city plans  to invest a total of 10 billion yuan by the end of the century  in such sectors as communications, telecommunications and energy.</p>

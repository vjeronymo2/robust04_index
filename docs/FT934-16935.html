			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Tougher parking fines for London Bromley, Lewisham and Hammersmith and Fulham - face stiffer penalties from today under parking laws due to spread throughout the capital over the next 10 months. The boroughs have taken over routine enforcement from the police and will employ their own parking attendants, who will be able to issue 'penalty charge notices'. These carry a fine of Pounds 30 to Pounds 60 depending on the area.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / IMF team in Ivory Coast Mr Alassane Ouattara, Ivory Coast prime minister and presidential hopeful, faces the unenviable task of winning International Monetary Fund support for a tough programme of reform during a period of political turmoil in which his own premiership is in jeopardy, Leslie Crawford writes from Abidjan. A few weeks ago, France said it would no longer pay Abidjan's Dollars 350m-a-year debt service bill to the World Bank, or cover the recurrent budget deficits. Paris also directed other former African colonies to the IMF for continued financial help. An IMF team arrived in Abidjan over the weekend to review the country's dismal economic performance and discuss renewed assistance. A previous IMF programme was abandoned last year because of non-compliance with economic targets. President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's declining health has led to paralysis in economic decision-making, as leaders of the Democratic party jostle for power. Private sector contractors complain that the government is not honouring debts. The government is experiencing increasing difficulties in meeting its monthly Dollars 85m (Pounds 57m) wage bill. Doctors, teachers and electricians have been on strike over delays in the payment of salaries. See Press Review, below</p>

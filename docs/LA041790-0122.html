			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LITHUANIA EMBARGO BEGINS;  </P> <P> NATURAL GAS CUT ORDERED BY SOVIETS  </P> <P> Soviet officials ordered drastic cuts in natural gas supplies to Lithuania  today, putting into force a threatened economic embargo to break the Baltic  republic's drive for independence, Lithuanians said.  </P> <P> Soviet officials also plan to cut off oil and gasoline to the republic  Wednesday, Lithuanian officials said. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had  given Lithuania until Sunday to repeal laws enacted since the republic's  Parliament declared independence March 11.  </P> <P> Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis told British radio that he had not  expected such a "brutal" move from Gorbachev but that it will not weaken the  republic's resolve.  </P> <P> "We can survive in poor conditions," Landsbergis told Independent Radio News in  London. "We survived in war conditions, in terrible postwar conditions, without  any gas, without any oil. . . . We will survive."  </P> <P> A telegram from the Soviet Western Trans Gas company to the Lithuanian gas  company said Moscow had ordered the supply of natural gas to the republic  "sharply curtailed" beginning today.  </P> <P> Teresa Juodenienie, a secretary for Premier Kazimiera Prunskiene, said that the  telegram was sent to Lithuania's gas authority rather than to the government  and that officials did not immediately know whether the cut had already taken  effect and what percentage would be reduced.  </P> <P> The telegram was read in the republic's Parliament as the legislators were  debating a response to Gorbachev's ultimatum. A Lithuanian government spokesman  said the response would probably not be voted on until Wednesday but stressed  that the republic will not rescind its independence declaration.  </P> <P> In Washington, President Bush said he is watching to see if shipments are  actually cut off to Lithuania and considering "appropriate responses." He did  not specify how the United States might respond.  </P> <P> "Clearly these announcements are contrary to the approach that we have urged  and that others have urged upon the Soviet Union," Bush said. "I would simple  repeat that what we need is dialogue, discussion and a peaceful resolution of  this great difficulty there."  </P> <P> Juodenienie said the Lithuanian government received a telephone warning from  the Druzhba, or Friendship, enterprise that supplies oil to Lithuania, saying  that deliveries of oil and gasoline will be curtailed beginning Wednesday.  </P> <P> Lithuanian residents formed long lines at gasoline stations in recent days to  fill up for what they fear might be the last time.  </P> <P> Lithuania Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas, in an interview before the  reduction of gas supplies was announced, said if Moscow "cut the tap," there  would be serious problems in less than a month.  </P> <P> "Natural gas (for heating) will disappear in 20 days, and the situation with  electricity is the same," Ozolas said.  </P> <P> Lithuania has been talking to Scandinavian and other Western countries about  helping out if Moscow cut off energy supplies.  </P> <P> Prunskiene sent Gorbachev a telegram Monday seeking a meeting to negotiate  Moscow's objections to laws enacted by Lithuania.  </P></p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Japanese brokers prepare to move into banking JAPAN'S big four securities houses - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - are likely to establish trust banking subsidiaries during the second half of this year. The move is planned after the enactment of the financial reform law, which will allow brokers and banks to partially enter each other's business. This takes place in April. Japan's brokers, however, are moving ahead slowly with plans to enter the banking arena, as the merits are yet to be assessed. 'We're not quite sure of the short-term returns,' said Nikko Securities. Deregulation of financial barriers between the securities and banking industries has decelerated substantially due to strong opposition from the country's ailing brokerages. The government's original schedule was to allow banks to underwrite securities and eventually play a larger role in stock trading. However, the ministry limited the banks' entry to the bond market. In return for the banks' entry into the bond underwriting business, brokerages' subsidiaries will be allowed to accept investment trusts, operate fund trusts and engage in some banking activities. Musashino Bank, the regional bank, plans a rights issue at Y2,880 a share. The financing, which will increase the number of shares in issue by 14 per cent, is aimed at strengthening the bank's management base amid the increasingly severe market conditions. Musashino shares closed yesterday in Tokyo at Y5,780. Kawasaki Steel plans to issue sponsored American Depositary Receipts for over-the-counter trade today through Morgan Guaranty Trust. Sponsored ADRs are provided by a single sponsoring bank, with costs and fees carried by the issuing company.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Argentine ambitions founder off Tierra del Fuego: An ill-conceived scheme to promote industrial development at the ends of the earth IN 1972 Argentine strategists announced that security and geopolitical priorities made it essential to establish a large permanent settlement on the remote island of Tierra del Fuego, which is divided between Argentina and Chile. They decided to establish a duty-free zone and offered tax incentives to attract industry. Nineteen years and millions of dollars later, the ill-conceived plan is finally being abandoned as Argentina embraces free trade. As a result, Ushuaia and Rio Grande, the population of the island's only towns, are shrinking daily. Ushuaia, a port of about 30,000 people set between the Beagle Channel and the southernmost ranges of the Andes, became home to five screwdriver plants notorious for their poorly crafted and over-priced consumer durables. Now, the end of incentives and the advent of trade liberalisation could spell the end for the factories and the 5,000 jobs they provide. Mr Hugo Iglesias, general manager of Bencer SA, Ushuaia's largest company, said 'if our protection from imports is ended I would say it spells the end for the economic development of Tierra del Fuego. Companies will implode.' Recession has already reduced sales severely and most factories operate at only 20 per cent of capacity. If the industrialisation of Tierra del Fuego made little economic sense, it has at least eased the worries of Argentina's military planners. Strategists in Buenos Aires have always been anxious to settle Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego because they suspect Chile covets the under-populated but resource-rich region. Hardy Chilean immigrants, who do the menial and labouring jobs the Argentines refuse to do, have always been in a majority. At one time about 90 per cent of Argentine Tierra del Fuego's population was Chilean. Now it is estimated at 'only' 60 per cent. In 1978 the two countries, then run by right-wing military governments, almost went to war over control of the Beagle Channel. The immediate 'threat' from Chile faded following Argentina's acceptance in 1984 of Papal arbitration awarding three minuscule islands in the Beagle Channel to Chile. However, Argentine Tierra del Fuego is trying to assert a new strategic importance as the focal point of Argentina's territorial claims in Antarctica and the South Atlantic. Formally, Tierra del Fuego has 'jurisdiction' over a region covering 495,000 square miles, which includes the Falkland Islands, three other British-held island groups in the South Atlantic as well as a section of Antarctica. Maps of the region carry the legend 'Tierra del Fuego - geographical centre of a country we must consolidate.' However, the virtually insolvent government in Buenos Aires has little time for Tierra del Fuego's territorial ambitions. It can no longer afford to sustain the expensive and notoriously corrupt incentives schemes. On April 1, the duty free zone became practically meaningless when the government replaced formerly insurmountable trade barriers to imported electronic goods with a single 22 per cent tariff as part of a general trade liberalisation policy. Overnight, Tierra del Fuego was priced out of the market. A 20-inch television set made on the island retailed in Buenos Aires for Dollars 855 (Pounds 483). A similar set imported from Japan and sold in the Chilean half of Tierra del Fuego, which is also a duty free zone, retails for less than half the price. Naturally, there are few homes in Ushuaia equipped with locally-made goods. Mr Mario Muia, manager of Continental SACIF, which makes televisions, video cassette recorders and audio systems, said Tierra del Fuego 'is not a good deal any more. It's practically impossible to compete with imports.' Mr Muia, who admits to being the proud owner of an imported Sony stereo, warned darkly of 'social disaster' on the island unless the trade policy was reversed. However, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, retorts that the companies have 90 per cent profit margins, and says there is scope for them to compete. Less charitable observers say the companies made even larger profits by manipulating the incentive regulations. There is little else to sustain the island's economy. Buenos Aires, its only market, lies thousands of kilometres away at the other end of a highway which includes long stretches of rutted and potholed dirt roads that are closed for weeks in the winter. Most of the island's food is sent from Buenos Aires, although it is fertile and its waters abound in fish. If the screwdriver plants do close, what will become of Tierra del Fuego? Before, it was home to thousands of sheep, a prison colony and a naval base. Tourism, the region's boosters say, is the obvious alternative. Indeed, on a hill overlooking the Beagle Channel, Ushuaia's first five star hotel and casino is under construction.</p>

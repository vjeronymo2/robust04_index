"Defense Logistics  Agency [DLA] Director, I do not quite understand. After all  your logical explanations, you yourself do not understand  clearly either. Do you?" "Defense Security Commander, when did  you learn about this case [fraudulent shell purchase incident]?    The above is a scene from the high-ranking military  officials' "hearing" that took place in the first meeting room  of the Ministry of National Defense [MND] called suddenly on 22  December 1993. Such "hearings" and "lectures" followed one after  another in the MND after new Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae took  office. It is difficult to imagine Minister Yi's continuous  unpredictable acts.    On 22 December, immediately after his appointment, the first  formal meeting was held with 120 high-ranking military officials  from the MND, the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS], and chief of each  service. There, Minister Yi made the participants sweat by  unceasingly reprimanding the director of the DLA (lieutenant  general), the head of the special prosecution team (lieutenant  general), the chief of the Logistics Bureau (major general), the  second assistant vice minister, and the commander of Defense  Security Command (brigadier general) for the recent controversy  over the gun shell purchase fraud case. In the meeting,  Minister Yi urged the relevant military officials to wake up,  asking how the people could accept the case when he himself  barely understood it.    In addition to the "hearing-style" reprimand, Minister Yi  surprised many relevant officials once again that day by  personally writing on the board to explain, as if he were a  teacher giving a lecture, each time he was supposed to stand up  to defend his dignity. By taking an example of U.S. Generals  Vessey and Meyers, Minister Yi drew a diagram in an attempt to  dispel some people's worries that there would be a large-scale  personnel reshuffle because JCS Chief Yi Yang-ho is one year  Minister Yi's senior, and Kim Tong-chin, chief of Staff of the  ROK Army, is a fellow graduate of the 17th class of the Military  Academy. Like an instructor of an institute talking to  students, Minister Yi repeatedly stressed, "This is the point.  Please underline (or take a second look)," about the subjects  he wanted to emphasize.    Minister Yi's "diagram-style lecture" continued on 28  December when he declared the full-scale re-audit and inspection  of the Yulgok Project [ROK Army weapons purchase program] and  the defense logistics system and facilities. After reading the  prepared announcement, he continued to give his own 15-minute  "enthusiastic lecture" while drawing diagrams on the board. He  stressed the following four points: The Yulgok Project reform  is a true reform; two major directions to improve the Yulgok  Project; the inspection is not aimed at specific figures like a  "witch hunt" inspection; and supplementary measures for audit  and inspection. He used a unique expression of "making the  Yulgok Project truly worthy of Yulgok."    Sudden proposal of silent tribute during inauguration  speech,  "Let us think of the beloved soldiers" [subhead]    Such "Don Quixote-style" acts were seen again at his  inauguration ceremony. At the inauguration ceremony held on the  morning of 22 December in the Army Hall inside the MND, after  reading only the usual greeting part from his prepared  inauguration speech, he said, "Now, I will talk about three  major points I want to emphasize," and gave an impromptu speech  for over 10 minutes.    "First of all, we should prevent a disastrous war, which  would cause common destruction of the North and the South, by  maximizing combat capabilities. Second, we should achieve a  true reform in the national defense field by driving out  inefficiency, incompetency, corruption, and irregularities.  Third, we should have a strict sense of professionalism over  our duty and the Army."    Stating that the next year's [1994] National Defense budget  is a tremendous burden to the people forcing each household to  share 910,000 won, Minister Yi continued to say in a high tone  of voice: "The Army should manage and administer defense  manpower and resource with heart-trembling piety." Minister Yi  repeated with particular emphasis the phrase "with  heart-trembling piety." He also added in a high tone of voice,  "(the soldiers) should not spend their time by merely reading  newspapers and magazines but they should read about the enemy  (North Korea) which threatens us."    Stating "Let us think of our beloved soldiers who are on  guard duty day and night and are engaged in operation while  exposed to severe cold temperatures and cold wind blowing from  the North," Minister Yi paid silent tribute to soldiers,  momentarily suspending his inaugural address.    There are two contradictory reactions among military  personnel concerning Minister Yi's "eccentric behavior." One is  the group of "affirmative assessment" which interprets his  behavior as an expression of strong will to push ahead with  genuine reform drive in order to make the military worthy of the  military, and another is the "critics" group that claims he  deals lightly with high-ranking general officers, who regard  honor and authority as their own lives; by holding press  interviews too frequently; and being conscious of his own  publicity.    However, most of military-related officials share the view  that Minister Yi is doing his utmost to recover the honor of the  military, which has been driven into a corner with the shells  import incident. It was learned that for the first two weeks  after he came to office, Minister Yi stayed late in his office,  between 2200 to 0130, in order to acquaint himself with the  work, except when he had to attend an unavoidable official  dinner meeting or other functions. With the minister's forced  march, working-level officials could not return to their homes  until late at night, even during the year-end days.    Many military officials are concerned with the fact that the  scope of Minister Yi's choice is not wide under the present  situation. Former Minister Kwon Yong-hae was relieved and  Minister Yi took office as a result of the shell import  incident, and the interest of the people, including the supreme  commander of the military, is so great that Minister Yi is being  pressed hard to eliminate the people's suspicion on this  incident. Besides, he is assigned a task to resolve the doubt on  the Yulgok Project [ROK Army weapons purchase program] and on  logistic irregularities.    Phenomena, far distant from Minister Yi's public pledge,  already began to appear. In the first meeting with military  officials on the day of his inauguration, he clearly stated that  there would be no shocking personnel reshuffle within the  military. However, he suddenly dismissed two lieutenant  general-grade officers, including Kim Sang-chun, JCS chief of  operations; and Yi Taek-hyong, JSC chief of strategy, last 30  December. They were all members of Hanahoe [a private circle of  military academy graduates] and were already on the reshuffle  list last October. However, since a step was taken throughout  the entire armed forces to strengthen combat readiness through  March 1994, their replacement is to be withheld until that time.  Thus, there were many speculations about the change in this  policy.    Lieutenant General Yi reported the greatest amount of  personal properties among the military general officers during  the period of official registration of personal properties by  government officials last September. He has been even suspected  of real estate speculation. Lt Gen Kim also belonged to the top  group when the military generals made public their personal  assets. As a result, some believe that the reshuffle was  prompted by the disclosure of their assets. The reshuffle  contradicts some people's speculation that since Minister Yi  himself is a Hanahoe member, those from Hanahoe will be saved in  the future, thus attracting public attention. Some are concerned  with a possibility that the personnel reshuffle to be carried  out sooner or later in connection with the shell import incident  will be a large-scale one.    Minister Yi is also given a difficult task of figuring out  how he should accept in the future "the wind" blowing from  outside forces, including Chongwadae [presidential office], that  expect reform, regardless of his own will for a reform drive, in  a way that the military would not fall to pieces [wahae]. He  also needs to overcome some people's criticism that Minister Yi  has been merely posturing when he has expressed his will for  reform over the past two weeks. In conclusion, Minister Yi's  "clever moves" to overcome such a difficult situation facing the  military is the target of the people's attention.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The organizational committee of a new party has  been established in Belarus -- the Belarusian Humanitarian  Party. Kanstantsin Syalchonak, known to many of our listeners as  an astropsychologist, has been elected chairman of the new  party. Although the party has already held its constituent  congress, its statute and program are still being examined by  the Ministry of Justice. The party founders are convinced that  they will contribute to the quick and effective improvement of  our lives.</p>

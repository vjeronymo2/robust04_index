			<p>BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, April 23 (XINHUA) -- China's reform and  opening drive has helped remote areas, mostly inhabited by  ethnic nationalities, develop their economies.    The northwestern Gansu Province, home to 44 minority  nationalities, is an example.    The people of minority nationalities have been driven by the  current nationwide economic tide to get involved in various  businesses such as commodity transportation, business and  sightseeing.    The local people of the Hui, Tibetan, Dongxiang and Salar  nationalities transport local products, daily necessities and  garments to Sichuan Province and the Tibet Autonomous Region, in  return taking back arts and crafts and medicinal herbs.    Moreover, some local farmers have set up joint ventures in  co- operation with business people from India, Sikkim and Bhutan.    Uygur-nationality people who live in the Qilian mountains  have developed scenic spots to attract tourists.    The province's Kazak Autonomous County of Aksay and  Mongolian  Autonomous County of Subei have established economic  co-operation ties with Kazakhstan and Mongolia, respectively.    A number of markets for leather, wool, timber and tea have  emerged in the province. Some of its products are exported to  Hong Kong, the Commonwealth of Independent States and Southeast  Asian countries.    This economic prosperity has in return promoted unity and  stability in Gansu. Some of the richer local people have funded  the building of schools and roads.</p>

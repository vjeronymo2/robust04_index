"The soldiers gave us a 15-day deadline to fall back; or  otherwise suffer the consequences," said Carlos Ovando, mayor of  the Guatemalan hamlet of Los Dolores in northern Peten  Department. The official told the Guatemalan Congress that  Belizean soldiers threatened to kill the peasants in the area if  they remain in the border region. Ovando asked for the  Guatemalan Government's intervention to exercise greater control  along the border in light of what he labeled a Belizean invasion.    Last year in October, the Guatemalan Defense Ministry  confirmed that Belizean soldiers had raided Guatemalan territory  on several occasions; however, the Belizean Government ruled out  an "erosion" of diplomatic relations. On 16 February, residents  of the De Melchor de Mencos municipality in Peten, approximately  10 km north of here, charged that soldiers from the neighboring  nation had entered Guatemalan territory, destroying maiz and  rice fields.    Guatemala maintains -- since the time Belize was a British  colony -- a demand on this territory that gained its  independence from the United Kingdom in 1971.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House Sir Nigel Broackes ought to be kicking himself for not cutting last year's final dividend. His message is too upbeat to do it now, and the shares obviously need the support of one of the highest yields in the Footsie (9.1 per cent). But the consequences of overpaying shareholders showed up clearly in yesterday's interim statement in the form of a 33 per cent tax charge and a large new slug of unrelieved ACT. It is small comfort that a couple of years' UK losses would provide the necessary shelter to bring the charge back to its accustomed level of 20-25 per cent. At least the 56 per cent drop in half-year profits looks like being the low point in the present cycle. But the question is just how fast the recovery will be. The company, for example, will do well to maintain its construction and engineering margins in the second half, though this side of the group certainly proved its quality in the first. The signs of revival detected in UK housing, moreover, are not necessarily shared by others. The key will be almost certainly be commercial property - a big earner in the past - where the decision to reclassify about Pounds 200m of investment properties as fixed assets can be read in two ways. Either it genuinely reflects the view that yields are going to be stuck at present levels for some time, or it is a neat device to avoid taking September's inevitable write-down through the profit and loss account.</p>

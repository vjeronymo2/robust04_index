			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Serious Revelations"] </F>   [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis' revelations -- that  third parties are trying, in every way, to prevent  implementation of the decision by Cyprus and Greece for a common  strategy and one unified defense space -- are particularly  serious. Because once again, this proves foreign intervention  and conspiracy against Cyprus during a new decisive phase of the  Cyprus issue. The president did not reveal who the third  parties trying to prevent implementation of the new defense  doctrine are. The doctrine actually means the accession of  Cyprus to Greece's unified defense space.    There was no doubt of the fact that foreigners would  conspire  against the new defense doctrine. In any case, the reaction of  the British and Americans on the issue of the National Guard's  arms program and the representations made, at times, toward  France and other countries that sell arms to Cyprus, are known.    However, what is nice is that both the Cypriot and the Greek  Governments reject the interventions by the third parties on the  new defense doctrine and methodically proceed with its  implementation. Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos  Arsenis' visit to Nicosia next week is indicative of the  decisions by the two governments not to take seriously the  intervention of the British and Americans, and not to back down  on the issue of the unified defense space. The Greek defense  minister along with the Cypriot Government and military  leadership will study ways for quicker implementation of what  has been decided in Athens between President Kliridhis and Greek  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.    In the meantime, people are outraged by the foreign  interventions that have to do not only with the political but  also with the military aspect of the Cyprus issue, because the  British and Americans, and whoever else, are not bothered and  concerned with the presence of 35,000 Turkish troops and 70,000  settlers in Cyprus. On the contrary, they are bothered because  it was decided that Cyprus' defenses should be put on a new  basis so that the island will not be under constant threat from  a new Turkish offensive. This "concern" expressed by the  foreigners raises many questions that should teach us a lot.    Because, the foreigners want an undefended and weak Cyprus  that will always be under foreign influence. It is a blessing  that the two governments rejected the foreigners' efforts and,  systematically and quietly, have proceeded with the  implementation of the unified defense goal.</p>

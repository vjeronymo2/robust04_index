			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Every measure was taken to ensure that civilians  were not hurt during the operation carried out by the Turkish  Armed Forces against the Zhalah camp of the terrorist PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization in northern Iraq  yesterday. At the end of the operation, it was determined that  no mistake was made in this region.    A Foreign Ministry announcement says that Iranian  authorities  claim certain Iranian citizens were killed or wounded during the  operation in the border region inside Iran. The statement points  out that the operation was not aimed against Iranian territory,  and that the Iranian authorities had sufficient advance  information about the intentions, reasons, and targets of the  operation.    The statement says: Every measure was taken during the  operation in northern Iraq to ensure that no civilians were  hurt. The technical capability of our planes and the training  level of our pilots are very well known. Furthermore, a study  of the photographs taken after the operation and a study of the  places where the bombs were dropped lead us to determine that  such a mistake was not made. Nevertheless, we proposed that  Turkish and Iranian border authorities meet immediately to study  this issue and that a joint delegation investigate the issue.  We informed the Iranian authorities that military officials  will also be included in the Turkish delegation.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 16. The governmental exemption is mandated by Congress. Congress did not distinguish between various governmental functions, nor did it restrict the exemption's availability for any specific governmental entities. Therefore, we do not accept CCPR's proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Nonprofit Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 17. Section 9(h) also exempts nonprofit entities from the requirement to file regulatory fees. In the NPRM, we tentatively found that Congress intended its exemption for nonprofit entities to cover any entity possessing nonprofit, tax exempt status pursuant to section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 501. Congress' exemption of nonprofit entities from regulatory fees is substantially broader than the limited exemption from the payment of application filing fees that Congress afforded in section 8(d)(1) to nonprofit entities licensed in the Public Safety Radio Services and tax exempt under section 501(c)(3). See 47 U.S.C. 158(d)(1); see also 47 CFR 1.1112(b). The comments generally support our interpretation of the exemption, and we will adopt the exemption as proposed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NPRM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The nonprofit exemption will be available only to those licensees who have established their nonprofit status under section 501. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Amateur Licensees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 18. Pursuant to section 9(h), we proposed to establish an exemption from regulatory fees for amateur radio operators licensed under part 97 of our rules. However, Congress included in the Schedule of Fees an annual regulatory fee covering vanity call signs, and we proposed to establish a fee for amateur vanity call signs. We proposed that this fee would be assessed if our proposed rules to establish vanity call signs become effective. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 9 FCC Rd 105 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. We will adopt the exemption for amateur licensees as set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NPRM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If our proposal to issue vanity calls signs is adopted, we will also assess a regulatory fee in FY 1994 upon persons filing applications, pursuant to the charges listed in Congress' fee schedule. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The American Radio Relay League, Incorporated asserts that it has requested Congress to change the vanity call sign annual regulatory fee to a one time application fee. We, of course, will modify our fee schedule to be consistent with any congressional amendment of the fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Noncommercial Educational Broadcasters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 20. In the NPRM, we concluded that regulatory fees are not applicable to noncommercial educational broadcasters. Congress included commercial television and AM and FM radio broadcast licensees and permittees in its Schedule of Fees. In contrast, Congress omitted the noncommercial educational stations from the category of stations subject to the regulatory fee. In addition, and consistent with existing section 1.1112(d) of the rules governing application fees, we proposed to exempt from the regulatory fee requirement any secondary and auxiliary broadcast services, such as low power television (``LPTV'') stations, television translators and boosters, remote pickup stations and intercity relay stations and other Mass Media, Common Carrier, and Private Radio facility authorizations used with noncommercial radio, television and instructional services qualifying for the exemption. See 47 CFR 1.1112(d). The comments supported the exemption for nonprofit educational broadcast stations and we will adopt the exemption as set forth in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NPRM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. Further, we affirm the tentative conclusion of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NPRM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that noncommercial international short-wave will be subject to the regulatory fees. Congress did not provide an express exemption for these stations and none of the commenters urged us to exempt the international short-wave stations. In addition, unlike noncommercial LPTV and translator stations, the government does not provide financial support to noncommercial international short wave stations through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) or the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Thus, the considerations that led us to conclude that Congress intended to exempt noncommercial educational LPTV and translator stations are not present with respect to international short-wave stations.

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Construction stocks come under scrutiny - London The London market has a day of grace today and can stand by to see whether New York and the other leading continental European stock markets are prepared to extend the gains registered ahead of the weekend. The running order on Friday night, when Wall Street was about 3.3 per cent up on the week, London 2.2 per cent, Paris about 3 per cent up and Germany less so, bore out the view taken by London analysts of the latest economic developments. Relaxation of interest rate worries in the US following a mild upwards revision of second-quarter economic growth estimates, has been quickly reflected in optimism in the London and Paris stock markets, both recently unsettled by renewed rate anxiety. UK market analysts have been able to return their attention to the onward flow of corporate earnings and dividends. S. G. Warburg underpins this increasingly favourable indication of corporate recovery by pointing to the improving margin expectations in manufacturing industry extrapolated from the Central Statistical Office economic data on the first and second quarters of the year. Not that base rate concerns have vanished. NatWest Markets reminds clients of the downside aspects of the favourable economic statistics and believes that a rise in interest rates 'remains on the cards,' perhaps in November. NatWest's view is that domestic inflation is subdued because the monetary framework is in place. Base rates of 6 per cent, says NatWest, may be needed to keep inflation at 3 per cent, or below. With economic recovery again the stock market's favourite topic, it is no surprise that analysts are reviewing the housebuilding and construction stocks. Enthusiasm is restrained, with NatWest Securities expressing faith in the UK new housebuilding sector while commenting 'contracting remains a mug's game'. The uncertainty bedeviling housebuilders is shown by the underperformance of about 23 per cent against the market over 12 months of George Wimpey, of 9 per cent by Berkeley group, of nearly 6 per cent by Bryant Group, all three recommended by NatWest. Credit Lyonnais Laing, in a heavyweight analysis of the private housebuilding sector, finds it less easy to be charitable, believing that negative equity and low inflation will constrain recovery. On the firm's own profits model, it could be 1996 before average price earnings ratios come down to single figures. Lyonnais Laing recommends a neutral weighting in housebuilding stocks. However, it suggests widening institutional portfolios to share NatWest's approval of Berkeley and Bryant Group and sees hopes of recovery in Crest Nicholson, Wainhomes and McCarthy and Stone.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Council tax allows town hall staff cuts MOST COUNCILS in England and Wales have coped well with the introduction of the council tax to replace the poll tax, a report today by the Audit Commission, the local authority watchdog, shows. The commission found in a survey that the change had allowed councils to reduce staff by a planned average of 24 per cent. The commission found that many councils still faced 'significant' backlogs from the community charge which would take time to clear. It found fault with two areas of council-tax implementation: About 21 per cent of authorities face the danger of being left with computer capacity they do not need, having bought equipment for the changeover without an option of returning it. More than 10 per cent of authorities have failed to monitor progress with the council tax.</p>

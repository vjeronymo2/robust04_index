			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Elections in Russia: Media build an even balance from 13 blocs The Russian election campaign, it is already clear, will not be fair. However, unlike the 'elections' of the Soviet days, where fairness had nothing to do with it, they will be unfair in a recognisably democratic way, with money, personalities, image, showbiz, and arm-twisting taking place against a backdrop of state-defined rules. The technical requirements for the registration of parties and candidates for the two houses of the new parliament - the federal assembly - have been completed, and have thrown up 13 blocs and more than 600 candidates covering a range of views from neo-liberal to Communist and neo-imperialist right. In one republic - Chechnya - elections will probably not take place at all and in another - Tatarstan - insufficient candidates have registered for the upper house. The key questions now are the overall political context within which the elections take place, and, crucially, the coverage given to the parties and candidates by the media. President Boris Yeltsin is presently the only source of legitimate power in Russia: government is carried on through decrees he issues and though the government he has chosen. He has not, and may not, declare his support for any party. The main reformist parties are all linked to, or enjoy the support of, groups of enterprises and banks. This is quite overt: businessmen and industrialists appear on party slates and/or sit beside leading candidates at press conferences. Their backing allows the parties to run the campaigns and pay for media coverage: under the election rules, donations from each enterprise are limited to a maximum of 20,000-times the minimum wage to parties and 200-times the minimum wage to an individual candidate. However, the scrutiny of these donations is lax, and will, anyway, not take place until after the event. Further, the linkage of money and campaigning looks improper. Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister but also leader of the main radical bloc, Choice of Russia, held a meeting last week with the heads of Russia's commercial banks - during which he promised them protection from foreign competition, a promise which quickly took the form of a presidential decree. They met in his party headquarters, not his office. Did they promise support for the party? Had they already given it? The site of the meeting pointed to these questions. Most of the curbs on the central press have now been removed: censorship appeared only briefly after the suppression of the parliamentary revolt, and the daily newspaper which is still banned, Sovyetskaya Rossiya, won a court judgement against the ban earlier this week. While the most prestigious daily, Izvestiya, is pro-presidential and supports Mr Gaidar's movement, other papers - such as Pravda - are strongly critical. The liberal daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta is waspish about Mr Yeltsin and about the government. Television is - as everywhere - the dominant medium. The rules of the game, drawn up with some advice from the British Broadcasting Corporation, specified that parties could buy TV time up to November 22, when the campaign proper began: thereafter, each of the 13 competing blocs was allocated equal time on the two main national channels, dolled out in 20-minute segments, with the times of appearance determined by drawing lots. The party political broadcasts are wholly fascinating. At one end, they are fairly slick: Choice of Russia, with a professional, well-staffed central election staff, produced earlier this week a 20-minute show which mixed clips from a concert with a smart Mr Gaidar. Other parties have simply pushed their candidates in front of cameras. The marvellous amateurism is gold dust to anyone attuned to the banalities of western party politicals.</p>

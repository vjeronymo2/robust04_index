			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: NORTHROP ELIMINATES FIVE EXECUTIVE POSTS;  </P> <P> STREAMLINING DESIGNED TO CUT COSTS, CONCENTRATE RESPONSIBILITIES  </P> <P> Northrop eliminated five executive-level positions Monday and retired or  reassigned the men who held the jobs in an effort to streamline its  organization.  </P> <P> Two senior vice presidents, Joseph T. Gallagher and C. Robert Gates, will be  retired within 60 days, the company said. Gallagher is 52 and Gates is 64.  </P> <P> Northrop President Kent Kresa said in a prepared statement that the changes are  aimed at cutting costs, improving communications and concentrating  responsibilities in the corporate office.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based aerospace firm disclosed last month that it was  initiating a reorganization and that it would eliminate 2,500 to 3,000 jobs  across the company, partly because the firm's workload was declining and partly  because it wanted to cut its overhead costs.  </P> <P> In the executive moves announced Monday, the company also appeared to be  preparing for Kresa to take the job of chief executive, which will occur by the  end of the year, when Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones retires as an active  employee.  </P> <P> Jones characterized the restructuring Monday in an interview as "pruning a tree  to support the fruit on it." He also said he was seeking to give Kresa "a clean  ship when he takes over."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Continue as Consultant  </P> <P> Gates has been in charge of Northrop's international business, which once  consisted of F-5 aircraft sales, training services to the Saudi Arabian  military and a variety of other aircraft service work. Virtually all of that  has been eliminated or is being sold off.  </P> <P> Northrop said Gallagher, who had carried to title of senior vice president for  programs, will leave active management but continue as a consultant on advanced  fighter aircraft development. Northrop is one of two prime contractors  competing to win a production contract to build the Air Force's advanced  tactical fighter program.  </P> <P> In addition, three vice presidents under Gallagher are losing their positions  as corporate officers of Northrop. They are Jaime Oaxaca, who is retiring; Lou  Carrier, who will be reassigned to the firm's aircraft division; and Robert  Lovell, who will be put on special assignment in the firm's B-2 division.  </P> <P> Northrop has experienced sweeping changes in its corporate executive ranks over  the past year, including the retirements of three other corporate officers and  the death of a fourth.  </P> <P> Welko Gasich and William G. McGagh were retired amid a federal investigation  last year and John Paterno, who headed the firm's B-2 bomber program, died.  </P> <P> In addition, Joseph Yamron, a corporate vice president who headed the firm's  precision products division, is under federal indictment and has been put on  leave of absence.  </P></p>

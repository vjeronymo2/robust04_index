			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Arts: After communism in Hungary - Theatre In Budapest, two impresarios meet on a cloth-draped stage to negotiate a change of management for the bankrupt theatre in a spoken preface to the Erkel Theatre's new production of Orpheus in the Underworld. In the third act, the misplaced wanderer in hell mixes his drunken panegyric to sexual prowess with snide comments about the limp minister of finance. Thus has the once ear-straining subtlety of anti-government innuendo in Hungary given way to blatant invective, as the conservative coalition proposes a parliamentary bill to impose more 'responsibility' on the outspoken Press. Even more telling are the sheer exuberance, stylishness and sexuality of Viktor Nagy's production, a stark contrast to a drab seriousness of the theatre under the Communists. Attila Csikos's sets evoke the playfulness of an Olympus revelling in its excesses, led by Bela Kartza's winking Jupiter. Hades has never been decked out more fittingly as a fin-de-siecle brothel. The final scene's can-can for the gods may not have been as shocking as in Offenbach's own first production in Paris, but it marked a departure from the recent past in Budapest. Budapest's internationally celebrated Katona Jozsef Theatre, fresh from a visit to Australia, finds new richness in the naturalism of Chekhov's Platonov. A production ten years ago at the nearby Jozsef Attila Theatre plunged into the dark recesses of Chekhov's youthful imagination; this one has a much more off-handed air, breezily placed among the comfortable Russian bourgeoisie enjoying a holiday. Director Tamas Ascher makes the servants clumsily open a deck chair and foolishly wander the room to further mock the old regime. A six-year-old production of Gyorgy Spiro's Chickenhead at the same theatre is a reminder of what used to pass for realism: squalid public housing victimised by juvenile delinquents, a pair of inarticulate toughs themselves victims of welfare indifference and cruelty. With a pair of comic cops to round out the picture, Gabor Zsambeki's production veers from the oppressive-realist to the absurd, capped with a violent climax to round out a perfect reminder of what passed for civil disobedience in the old days. Appropriate as these productions seemed to post-Communist Hungary, they gave as deceptive a view of the new order as the country's optimistic economic figures. What in the old regime was stodgy and simple has become fundamentally unstable despite a patina of exuberance and refreshing frankness. The immediate danger to Budapest theatre is financial: the national government has turned the vast majority of theatres over to the city council, retaining only the National Theatre and Opera. As part of the National Opera, the Erkel shows how much national support can mean. But even here, Orpheus may be one of only three new productions this year, compared to a dozen in years past.</p>

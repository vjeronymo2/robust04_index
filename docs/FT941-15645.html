			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Woman candidate may cause Finnish poll upset A late surge in popularity by Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, the Finnish defence minister, yesterday rattled her opponents in Sunday's presidential election, for the first time raising some doubt that the eventual winner will be Mr Martti Ahtisaari, the Social Democrat and former senior UN diplomat. An opinion poll for the national television station put Mrs Rehn, of the Swedish party, in third place among the 11 candidates in Sunday's first round of voting with 18 per cent, only just behind Mr Paavo Vayrynen, the former foreign minister and candidate of prime minister Esko Aho's Centre party, who had 19.2 per cent support. Mr Ahtisaari still leads the field with 26.6 per cent. But the poll showed that if Mrs Rehn can reach the run-off vote on February 6 between the two leaders that emerge on Sunday, she stands the best chance of any candidate of beating Mr Ahtisaari. The poll showed a 50-50 split between Mr Ahtisaari and Mrs Rehn in a second round contest, compared with a 62-38 Ahtisaari advantage over Mr Vayrynen and a 54-46 Ahtisaari lead over Mr Raimo Ilaskivi, the candidate of the Conservative party. Mrs Rehn appears to have gained a significant and well-timed momentum in the hitherto stale campaign, despite representing the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland which accounts for only 6 per cent of the population. She has apparently attracted strong support among women and among non-socialists who lack faith in either Mr Vayrynen or Mr Ilaskivi and are looking for a strong personality to take on the popular Mr Ahtisaari. She - like Mr Ahtisaari - is an unequivocal supporter of Finland's application to join the European Union, an issue that is set to be decided in a referendum later this year. Despite being a member of an unpopular government, her straightforward style seems to have cut through a widespread public animosity towards the political establishment engendered by deep recession - an asset previously exploited by Mr Ahtisaari. Commentators in Helsinki say Mrs Rehn's cause was also boosted by Finnish outrage over a statement by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian nationalist leader, who said recently a country with a woman as defence minister did not deserve to be independent.</p>

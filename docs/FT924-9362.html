			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Derivatives software houses amalgamate THE reliance of derivatives traders on a small number of large software suppliers is likely to grow, following the latest amalgamation of software houses announced yesterday. Devon Systems International, one of the biggest software suppliers in the derivatives industry, has extended its reach into continental European capital markets through the purchase of the Swedish suppliers Front Capital Systems and Prosoftia. Front has supplied trading and risk management systems to around 50 banks on the continent. Devon's parent, SunGard Data Systems, is paying Dollars 16m for all the common stock of A. J. L. Holding, which owns the two companies. Devon, which claims 650 clients around the world, said that the move would not lead to less choice for derivatives traders. 'We believe it is a bad decision to remove choice from banks,' Mr Patrick Brazel of Devon in London said. Front's software for traders on DTB and Soffex, the German and Swiss derivatives markets, has been in competition with a rival product from Devon. Mr Brazel added that Front's main product, Optas, would provide Devon with a front-office trading and risk management system for equity derivatives, extending its range of services into potentially 'the hottest area in derivatives at the moment.'</p>

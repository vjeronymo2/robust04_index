			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Improved method to weld copper Copper's ability to resist corrosion has made it one of the front-runners in the search to find a suitable material in which to store nuclear waste under ground. The snag is that copper is difficult to weld because of its high thermal conductivity. The Welding Institute, a Cambridge-based research group which is working on a prototype copper canister for the Swedish Nuclear Fuel &amp; Waste Management Company, believes the solution lies with the use of reduced pressure electron beam welding. It uses a 100kW electron beam, which is sufficiently intense to penetrate the 50mm-thick copper canister. The steel-lined canisters produced by this process are expected to last more than 100,000 years. The Welding Institute: UK, tel 0223 891162; fax 0223 892588</p>

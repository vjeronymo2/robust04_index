			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Ruling party in Mongolia sweeps poll MONGOLIA'S ex-communist ruling party crushed its democratic opponents to win 70 out of 76 parliamentary seats in last Sunday's election, according to official results released yesterday, Reuter reports from Ulan Bator. The General Election Commission said the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) polled 56.9 per cent of the total vote, six percentage points down from its showing in Mongolia's first free elections in 1990. The Democratic Coalition won the second highest number of votes with about 17 per cent. It won four seats in the country's new single-chamber parliament. The Social Democratic Party came in third with 10 per cent of the vote, securing one seat. The final seat will go to an MPRP member who ran as an independent. The democratic parties have yet to decide whether they will go through with a threat to boycott the parliament.</p>

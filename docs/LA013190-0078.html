			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ELKS LODGE INDUCTS FIRST BLACK MEMBER  </P> <P> The Van Nuys Elks Lodge inducted its first black member Thursday after a  months-long controversy that brought on a state investigation of the fraternal  organization's racial policies.  </P> <P> Ben Harvey, 41 of Pacoima, the manager of a laminating plant, received the  lodge's membership badge -- a gold lapel pin -- after swearing eternal  brotherhood with fellow Elks.  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office has been investigating whether the lodge  violated state civil rights laws by twice rejecting two other blacks who  applied for membership. Lodge officials said they were turned down because  other members resented the involvement of fellow Elk and state Sen. Alan  Robbins (D-Tarzana), who nominated them.  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. Louis Verdugo said the state investigation is continuing, but  that Harvey's admission will be considered "one piece of evidence that the  organization does not discriminate on the basis of race."  </P></p>

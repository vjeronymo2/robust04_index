			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Ambassador to Belgium Andrzej </F> Krzeczunowicz: "NATO Summit Should Make It Clear That No One  Has a Veto Right Over Us"; first paragraph is DE STANDAARD  introduction]    [Text] Many NATO countries provide a series of arguments to  only make a vague commitment on the eastward expansion of the  alliance on the summit to be held in Evere on Monday [10  January] and Tuesday. These arguments do not convince the  Central European countries that are on the first row for  membership. Today Andrzej Krzeczunowicz, Polish Ambassador to  Belgium, has the floor and tomorrow it will be the turn of the  deputy chief of the Hungarian mission to NATO, Andras Simonyi.    [Doornaert] One of the arguments, among others of the  Belgian  diplomacy, is that the major problem of the Central and East  European countries is one of social instability, not of foreign  security. And that NATO membership will not remedy this.    [Krzeczunowicz] But it is exactly the opposite. Poland is  internally stable, we have a democratic system that works. The  economic shock therapy is yielding results. It is true that it  is hitting hard many people by marginalizing them.  Nevertheless, the macroeconomic results are good. Last year,  we registered a 4.5 percent growth, the European record, with a  rise of 7 percent in our industrial production.    Therefore, we feel at ease. One of our large neighbors  speaks of its "bordering foreign countries," its sphere of  influence. This is distrurbing. To the east, there are  countries where foreign troops are still stationed, minority  problems that might represent a threat. The instability does  not emerge from us but from the neighbors.    The recent events in Moscow do not make us feel very  optimistic. The Parliament was shelled by tanks, and afterwards  a totally irresponsible individual shows up who acquires  one-fourth of the votes.    [Doornaert] That is why NATO is saying that we should avoid  doing anything which could support Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.    [Krzeczunowicz] Look, anyone could use Zhirinovskiy for his  own purposes. One can say as well that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is the  product of the West's timidity. I cannot prove that, but you  cannot prove either that a moderate attitude will moderate  Russia's attitude, too. Appeasement is not a wise policy, as  became obvious previously.    [Doornaert] Do you mean that the best way to avoid security  problems in Central and East Europe is to create a reliable  deterrence policy by means of security commitments?    [Krzeczunowicz] Exactly. The opposite attitude would be to  say: Dear Russian friends, here is your area of influence. And  NATO should say: This is our area of influence, meaning an area  of peace and stability. Indeed, keep in mind that NATO won the  Cold War. It cannot be lost now, that would be stupid.    We feel that it is important that at the summit NATO will  undertake to include the Central European countries meeting the  standing criteria, i.e., stable democracy, pluralism, settling  of border and minority questions.    Poland realizes fully that it cannot become a NATO member  tomorrow, that this requires numerous changes of our defense  mechanism. However, it is important that a clear commitment is  made so that the Partnership for Peace does not become an  objective in itself, but the way to full membership. Otherwise,  it cannot respond to real problems and the security vacuum will  not be filled up.  <H5>  European Union </H5>   [Doornaert] Belgian diplomats suggest that the Visegrad  countries follow a logical order by becoming European Union [EU]  members first, then of the Western European Union [WEU], and  then of NATO.    [Krzeczunowicz] Of course we want to become a member of the  EU and of the WEU, we already are an associate member. Also we  do not define security in a purely military sense. The fact  that the EU sets up protectionist barriers against us is equally  at our disadvantage.    But before becoming a full member we will have to wait at  least 10 years and our security cannot wait that long, that is  the problem.    [Doornaert] It has also been said that the expansion of NATO  toward the Visegrad countries would draw new artificial lines in  Europe, which would be a destabilizing factor.    [Krzeczunowicz] But there have always been barriers,  nowadays  they exist too. There is NATO and the EU and the other  countries. It is impossible to cancel all barriers at once in  such a diversified continent, but one has to place them so that  they have a rational function, namely to serve peace and  stability. Leaving the barriers as they are nowadays is not  rational at all.    [Doornaert] How is it possible to enlarge NATO while  avoiding  giving Russia a feeling of isolation?    [Krzeczunowicz] No one wants to isolate Russia, and  certainly  not Poland. Let us admit that it is particularly difficult to  isolate a country which stretches over 11 time zones. Poland or  the much smaller Lithuania will definitely not isolate giant  Russia.    Secondly, from a historical point of view, Russia has rather  been inclined to isolate itself. It is up to Russia to open up  to the world and the democratic process. We will be the first  ones to welcome that. Poland assumes that there cannot be any  lasting peace and stability in Europe without a Russian  participation. No one wants to cut Russia from Europe and erect  a new [Berlin] wall somewhere. We did not build walls, nor did  the West.    [Doornaert] Does NATO's attitude -- which gives priority to  possible reactions in Moscow to the desire of the Visegrad  countries for membership -- give the impression that your are  being held in a kind of restricted sovereignty?    [Krzeczunowicz] Well, if you recognize that a country has a  veto right on the choice of an alliance that Poland should  conclude, than Poland's sovereignty is restricted. If you do  not recognize that right of veto, then we are a sovereign  country. The decision does not rest with us, NATO must make it  clear that there is no right of veto.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Here in Lusaka this morning the special envoy of  President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos held a meeting  with the mediator of the Angolan peace process. General  Kopelipa, special envoy of Angolan head of state Engineer Jose  Eduardo dos Santos, arrived here in Lusaka, Zambia, yesterday  evening and this morning held a meeting with Alioune Blondin  Beye, mediator in the Angolan peace process. The meeting was  attended by the government delegation leadership, by Dr.  Fernando Faustino Muteka and General Eugenio Carneiro.    Although no details have been given about the meeting, it is  believed that Gen. Kopelipa conveyed to Alioune Blondin Beye a  verbal message from the president of the republic concerning the  talks between the government and the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] under way here in Lusaka.    Meanwhile, an official source told Angola Radio Nacional  that  the document presented by UNITA representatives to the mediator  yesterday, connected with that organization's participation in  the country's government, is void. It is therefore necessary  and urgent that UNITA declares unambiguously whether or not it  fully accepts the latest offer made by the government, which is  not in any way negotiable.    The source also said that the government will, as always,  continue committed to searching solutions that will lead to  peace through negotiations, fighting to preserve unity and  national reconciliation, and trying to resolve the multifaceted  problems which the Angolan people still experience, because of  the war mounted by Jonas Savimbi's UNITA. The source, contacted  by the Angola Radio Nacional here in Lusaka, stressed that the  government is aware of its responsibilities and cannot therefore  be blamed for the lack of free movement of people and goods in  different corners of the national territory. As a matter of  fact, the source added, the entire Angolan people long ago  identified the causes of their suffering and who is behind them.    This morning the negotiators from the government and UNITA  continued to discuss the issue which has been on the negotiating  table for the past eight days. It deals with swearing in some  UNITA members of parliament. On this issue the understanding  between the negotiators from the government and UNITA is proving  to be difficult. Sources close to the talks believe, however,  that the parties could reach an agreement any time, thus making  it possible to discuss other issues connected with national  reconciliation in the working agenda. It is already known  however that UNITA has requested more time to reflect on the  issue, as has always been the case.</p>

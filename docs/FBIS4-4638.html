			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu said here on Monday afternoon that he expects China  will influence North Korea to fulfill its obligations spelled  out in the UN Security Council president's recent statement over  the nuclear question. The minister noted that the council  president's statement was unanimously adopted and China played a  positive role in the process.    While meeting with the press on arrival at Kimpo Airport  from  his tour of the United States and Japan, Han said South Korea,  United States and Japan are carrying on efforts to persuade  North Korea through China.    "If North Korea fails to fulfill the obligations within a  specific period of time, the UN Security Council will take up  the issue again, at which stage it would apparently take strong  steps," he said.    The foreign minister also said that North Korea's acceptance  of additional inspection by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) is one of prerequisites, not the sole condition,  for third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level talks. He thus held  fast to the position that the U.S.-North Korea agreement made on  last Feb. 25 remains valid.    Regarding the issue of the Team Spirit exercise, Minister  Han  declined to say whether the joint exercise would be resumed by  saying South Korea is discussing the question with United States.</p>

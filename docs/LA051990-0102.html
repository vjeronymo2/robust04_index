			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCC CONDEMNS COLUMBUS' 'INVASION' OF NEW WORLD  </P> <P> The National Council of Churches, ending a three-day meeting here Friday, voted  to condemn Christopher Columbus' "invasion" of the New World in 1492.  </P> <P> A celebration is "not an appropriate observation of this anniversary," the  council's governing board, representing 32 denominations with 42 million  members, said. The resolution, approved after more than two hours of debate,  cites "genocide, slavery, 'ecocide' and exploitation of the wealth of the land"  as the bitter fruit inherited by "the descendants of the survivors of the . . .  invasion."  </P> <P> "The church, with few exceptions, accompanied and legitimized this  exploitation," the council added.  </P> <P> The resolution, "A Faithful Response to the 500th Anniversary of the Arrival of  Christopher Columbus," was proposed by the Rev. George Tinker, an Osage Indian  who teaches at the Illif School of Theology in Denver.  </P> <P> "The only thing Columbus really discovered was that he was lost," Tinker said.  "American people have so digested the myth of American history that they have  lost sight of the truth -- the pain of so many people who live on the  continent."  </P> <P> The resolution is intended to influence next year's official yearlong  celebrations marking the 500th anniversary of Columbus' fleet reaching the  Caribbean islands.  </P> <P> An attempt by Episcopal Bishop David Reed of Louisville, Ky., to soften the  resolution failed.  </P> <P> "Many of us find it hard to state that this is not a time for celebration,"  Reed told the 220 board members. "There have been so many things over the past  500 years to thank God for."  </P> <P> Joseph D'Andrea, the vice consul of Italy in Pittsburgh, said he understood the  intent of the resolution but thought the anniversary should celebrate "the  spirit of America" and its accomplishments rather than dwell on the landing's  negative effects.  </P> <P> But the church council noted that "theological justifications for destroying  native religious beliefs while forcing conversion to European forms of  Christianity demanded a submission from the newly converted that facilitated  their total conquest."  </P></p>

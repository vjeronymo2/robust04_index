			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: DESIGN ;  </P> <P> PACK RAT HEAVEN  </P> <P> IN THE MARKET for hundreds of 1960s-era baby dolls with glass eyes and  synthetic, haylike hair? How about chalky slabs of fossil-imbedded Texas  limestone, speckled bowling balls or slabs of pink alabaster? You'll find all  of this and more at Ventura's Art City, one of the West Coast's largest  sculpture-supply businesses -- and certainly its most surreal.  </P> <P> The brainchild of Ventura sculptor Paul Lindhard, Art City is also a working  studio where sculptors from all over come seeking inspiration and a recharging  of their creative batteries.  </P> <P> At first glance, the place looks like the result of a pack rat run amok. But  somehow there's a Zenlike order about the place; the jumbled rocks, the metal  objects, the driftwood and the cacti take on the serenity of a Japanese garden.  </P> <P> A born scavenger, Lindhard collects Mexican onyx and California marble from  desert quarries, and avocado and cypress wood from abandoned orchards. But keep  a lookout for the metal coils, old tires and red-vinyl booths -- all industrial  artifacts from Ventura dumpsters.  </P> <P> "I like creating order out of chaos," Lindhard says. "I think of the whole  place as theater."  </P> <P>  Art City, 197 Dubbers St., Ventura, (805) 653-6380. DENISE HAMILTON  </P></p>

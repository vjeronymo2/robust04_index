			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Voluntary plans by the  Japanese auto industry on purchases of U.S. auto parts and  automobiles will be referred to in the government's  market-opening package to be unveiled next week, a senior trade  ministry official said Thursday [24 March].    In the package, set for release Tuesday, the government will  probably state it "welcomes" private-sector efforts to boost  buying of U.S.-made auto components and automobiles, said the  official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.  He declined to be named.    But the reference does not mean the government will  guarantee  results for plans by each carmaker, the official added.    The package will be formulated as a way to resume failed  "framework" trade talks between Japan and the United States.  The two countries were unable to reach accord on "objective  criteria" as a tool to measure Japan's imports.</p>

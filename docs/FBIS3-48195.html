Working-level negotiations in the Chinese capital have been  extended and are progressing in a "positive direction," one said.    Korea will succeed in having the Seoul-Beijing flight  control  transfer point set at 124 degrees longitude as designated by the  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).    China had been opposed, saying the line was drawn when  Taiwan  represented China at the ICAO.    But the two sides are to skirt the transfer point issue on  the Seoul-Shanghai route and fly along a corridor, as done up to  now, the official said.    Kim is expected to visit Beijing in March and the two  countries likely will formally sign the aviation agreement then,  he said.    The agreement will be initialed at the next aviation talks  in  Beijing.</p>

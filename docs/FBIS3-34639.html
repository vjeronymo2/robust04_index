			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 10 Feb (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political  adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has affirmed  that Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has delivered an  official message to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat  notifying him that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will  discuss the final size of the Jericho area with him personally  when they meet in the near future. Sha'th pointed out that the  final size of the Jericho area will remain frozen until 'Arafat  and Rabin meet. He noted that the Palestinian side signed the  map relating to the Jericho area but expressed reservations  about it.    It is worth noting that Palestinian President 'Arafat balked  for a few moments when he was asked to sign one of the maps  pertinent to Jericho. He did not want to sign it but then  signed it with reservation.    Official Palestinian sources in the negotiating delegation  said that the Palestinian party's basic objection to the  crossings document, which delayed the official signing for more  than three hours, focused on the paragraph relating to the  administration of the crossing points. These sources said that  they tried to get the best conditions under the general  Declaration of Principles agreement, which gives Israel the  right to be in charge of external security but emphasizes  national Palestinian sovereignty.    Palestinian sources pointed out that the administration of  the crossing points gives Israel the right to have a general  director with a Palestinian and an Israeli deputy director.  They stressed that the Palestinian party managed to obtain a  confirmation of total Palestinian authority over the crossing  points, side roads [turuq 'aradiyah], and the settlements [wa  akkadat anna al-janib al-filastini istata'a al-husul 'ala ta'kid  bi al-sultah al-filastiniyah bil kamil sawa' bi al-nisbah lil  ma'abir aw al-turuq al-'aradiyah aw al-mustawtanat]. Noting that  the emphasis on Palestinian authority was important, they said  that the Palestinian side gave Israel the right to be in charge  of external security, including recognition of what the  Declaration of Principles agreement outlined on external  security. These sources said that according to the agreement,  the Palestinian party has the right to coordinate security on  the crossing points, side roads, and the settlements. They said  that the Palestinian party also obtained the zones outlined in  the document under the title "yellow areas," which are the  Palestinian areas excluded from the Israeli settlements. Israel  has a certain authority over these areas but the Palestinian  party has full authority over them.</p>

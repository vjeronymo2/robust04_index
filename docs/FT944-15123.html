			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Curb on money laundering Monaco has signed an accord with France to co-ordinate efforts against money laundering. The agreement will require banks, insurance companies and bureau de change agencies in the principality to hand over details of bank accounts and transactions wherever they have suspicions. It will for the first time open communication between Trackfin, the French agency responsible for tracking laundered money, and Siccfin, its equivalent in Monaco. It follows similar agreements signed between France and other countries including the US, Australia, Belgium and Italy over the past few years. Siccfin was set up last year following the introduction of a banking law in line with international guidelines designed to clamp down on money laundering.</p>

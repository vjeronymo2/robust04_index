			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A press statement released by the State  Secretariat in Jakarta today said that Indonesia and Cambodia  have agreed to expand their bilateral cooperation in the fields  of trade, economy, education, and culture. The statement also  said that an accord on bilateral economic and technical  cooperation has been signed between the two countries during the  current visit to Indonesia by the Cambodian co-prime ministers.  The accord marks a new era in bilateral relations between  Indonesia and Cambodia because the current bilateral cooperation  has focussed only on political matters.    Meanwhile, the Phnom Penh government expressed its  appreciation for Indonesia's vigorous efforts in leading the  Nonaligned Movement (NAM). Cambodia is optimistic that the NAM  will be successful under the chairmanship of Indonesia.    Today, the Cambodian co-prime ministers Norodom Ranariddh  and  Hun Sen visited the state-owned Nusantara Aircraft Industry and  the Afro-Asian Museum in Bandung, West Java. [passage omitted]</p>

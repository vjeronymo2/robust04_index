			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOUBTS KEY PART OF DEFICIT PLAN, FED CHIEF SAYS  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, questioning what is expected to  be a key element of the Bush Administration's deficit-reduction plan, said  Tuesday that he does not believe interest rates will drop sharply this year.  </P> <P> When asked whether it is realistic for the Administration to rely on a forecast  that short-term interest rates will fall at least 2 percentage points from  current levels while the economy maintains its healthy growth rate, Greenspan  told the Joint Economic Committee: "Technically . . . it is feasible. Is it  probable? No, it is not."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Counting on Lower Rates  </P> <P> The Administration is counting on declining interest rates to slice $9 billion  from the deficit next year by reducing interest payments on the national debt.  </P> <P> Despite the dispute on interest rates, Greenspan went out of his way to play  down reports that he and President Bush disagree significantly on economic  policy. Last week, after Greenspan said that the Fed would maintain relatively  high interest rates to help curb inflation, Bush told reporters that he did not  want the Fed to "move so strongly against fear of inflation that we impede  growth."  </P> <P> "There is far less here than meets the eye," Greenspan contended. Whatever  differences exist between the Fed and the Administration, he said, "are quite  minuscule."  </P> <P> But Greenspan's doubts about the economic assumptions underlying the  Administration's budget blueprint are sure to keep the controversy alive.  </P> <P> White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman has indicated that the Bush  Administration plans to rely on the Ronald Reagan Administration's economic  forecast in developing its own budget proposals, primarily because it has no  time to prepare an alternative before Bush's scheduled Feb. 9 economic policy  speech to Congress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Facing Automatic Cuts  </P> <P> Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit law, Congress and the White House are required  to reach agreement on a budget plan that would reduce the deficit to $110  billion for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. Failure would result in  automatic, nearly across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the  deficit-reduction law.  </P> <P> If there are no changes in current spending and tax policies, the Reagan  Administration predicted, the deficit will reach $127 billion next year. It  called for a variety of measures that it said would reduce the deficit to $92  billion.  </P> <P> To produce those deficit estimates, Reagan's budget forecasts that the economy  will grow by 3.2% this year and that 91-day Treasury bills will pay an average  of 6.3% interest during 1989, sharply lower than the current level of 8.3%. The  Administration also counted on a drop in long-term interest rates to an average  of 8.3% from the current rate of about 9%.  </P> <P> However, most analysts do not believe interest rates can fall significantly  unless the economy's growth slows from its current pace of about 3%.  </P> <P> Of course, lower growth depresses tax revenues, and the deficit would probably  rise more as a consequence of that than it would fall as a result of declining  interest rates.  </P> <P> "The prospect of slower economic growth to curtail inflation could provoke a  confrontation between the Federal Reserve and the Bush Administration later  this year," David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in  Chicago, contended. "If economic forecasts are revised to incorporate  projections of only 2.5% growth with T-bill yields of 8% to 9%, federal deficit  estimates could easily rise into the $160-billion to $180-billion range."  </P> <P> Because the federal government pays interest on more than $2.6 trillion in  existing debt, interest rates that exceed projected levels would add  significantly to federal interest costs, estimated at about $165 billion this  year.  </P> <P> Even with its projection of falling interest rates, the Administration  forecasts that interest payments will rise to $170.1 billion next year because  of increases in the amount of outstanding debt.  </P> <P> If interest rates average just 2 percentage points higher than expected in  1989, interest payments would jump an additional $9 billion.  </P> <P> If a rise in interest rates were accompanied by an increased inflation rate,  that would help with the deficit by generating additional government revenues.  But Greenspan sought to throw cold water on that possibility as well, repeating  last week's testimony that the Fed remains determined to reduce inflation from  current levels.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Greenspan said, the Fed and the Administration remain in close  contact on economic policy matters. Greenspan repeated his backing for Bush's  plan to rely primarily on spending cuts to reduce the deficit and offered  support for Bush's controversial proposal to reduce the capital gains tax rate  on investment profits.  </P> <P> Greenspan said he had met with Bush in December and that he speaks with  Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady "on a continuous basis. . . . I have no  concern about the issue of communication with President Bush."  </P></p>

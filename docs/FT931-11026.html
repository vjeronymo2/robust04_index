			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: CME to extend trading on Globex THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange is to add an afternoon trading session for its interest rate and foreign exchange products to the Globex electronic trading system. US futures and options begin trading on Globex at 1800 local time and are offered through the night. From March 4, the CME plans to open Globex trading shortly after its trading pits close each afternoon, extending futures and options trading during Chicago business hours. The move may be an admission by CME officials that Globex is more useful in boosting domestic trading volume than as the universal worldwide trading vehicle for which which it was first conceived. Globex's slow start may lie in the fact that Japan is not yet part of the system.</p>

Some of the marchers had been  on the road for the 200 miles and 10 days since leaving Gallup, a town of  20,000 people that borders the Navajo Indian reservation. McKinley County leads  the nation in both drunken driving accidents and alcohol-related deaths.  Authorities said 18 people died in McKinley County in January due to  alcohol-related causes, such as exposure, drunken driving and drunken beatings.  </P></p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Polish steel deal finalised THE Italian quality steel maker, Lucchini, has said it will be 'cautious' about expanding sales into European Community countries from its new joint venture with the Huta Warszawa steel mill in Warsaw. Mr Luigi Lucchini, head of the company, who was in Warsaw yesterday to cap two years of negotiations, said the new company Huta L W had the Polish domestic market to concentrate on, while exports were needed to service the project's foreign currency debts. Under the joint venture, the first foreign investment in Poland's steel industry, Lucchini has obtained 51 per cent of the mill's equity and is committed to a Dollars 200m modernisation plan over 18 months. The joint venture is capitalised at Ecu53.4m (Pounds 43.2m). The balance of the shares is held by the mill's Polish creditor banks led by Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which is soon to be privatised and now holds 21.8 per cent through a debt for equity swap. Lucchini's modernisation plan foresees annual output of 600,000 tonnes of quality steel.</p>

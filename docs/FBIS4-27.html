			<p>With      fall parliamentary elections looming and former Prime  Minister Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS)  continuing to top the opinion polls, two splinter parties  in the governing coalition have announced plans to merge into a  single party forming a united front against Meciar.  Former  Foreign Minister Milan Knazko said that during a 23 April  founding "congress," the newly created "Slovak Democratic Union"  (DUS) will unite his Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD SR), whose  eight deputies in the 150-seat parliament split from the HZDS  last year, with the Alternative of Political Realism (APR), a  group of ten deputies who were expelled from the HZDS in February  (CTK, 7 April).  Distinguishing the new party's platform from  Meciar's emphasis on the state's role in the economy, Knazko  added that the DUS will "push for a liberal policy" and "for  changes to support the private sector" (SME, 29 March).  Prime  Minister and APR leader Jozef Moravcik also suggested the  possibility of coalescing with other parties in the governing  coalition, saying that the DUS "already has an agreement" to form  a "joint preelection front" with "all the other centrist parties"  (Warsaw, Rzeczpospolita, 8 April).  Similarly, former Prime  Minister Jan Carnogursky called for "loose cooperation" during  the election campaign between the DUS and his Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH) (CTK, 7 April).      Perhaps limiting the electoral success of this "centrist," anti-  Meciar coalition, Peter Weiss, the leader of the strongest party  in the governing coalition, the former communist Party of the  Democratic Left (SDL), has suggested that his party will not join  or agree to electoral cooperation with it.  During an interview  published in the 30 March Denni Telegraf, Weiss said that there  is a "realistic chance" of the SDL and a number of labor and  farmer parties not currently in parliament forming a "social  democratic grouping."  Separating the political spectrum into  three groups, Weiss said that this group would offer an  "alternative" to Meciar and to a coalition centered around the  KDH, adding that he did "not think the majority of voters" would  favor the KDH group.

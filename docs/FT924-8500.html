			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Delors to rescue of 'unlovely' treaty IT WOULD be a mistake to renegotiate the Maastricht treaty, even though the document had blemishes and would not win a 'beauty contest', Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, , said yesterday. 'If it (Maastricht) were undermined, we would need two, three or four years to get a result that would probably have less dynamism and attraction,' he said.

The EC, national governments and national parliaments had all been guilty of keeping the public in the dark about European developments, and more had to be done to make the EC's workings transparent.

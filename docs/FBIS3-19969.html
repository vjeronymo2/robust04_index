			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A German television team (Spiegel-TV) was arrested  by the Turkish Army in the southeast of Turkey, an area mainly  inhabited by Kurds, and released after eight hours.  Correspondents Michael Enger, Corinna Gutstatt, and Hans-Peter  Weymar said in a telefax sent from Diyarbakir on Thursday [24  March] that they were blindfolded and taken from near Lice to  Hazro. Film material and personal notes were forcefully taken  from them. Their hands were tied behind their backs during  several interrogations. They were taken to Diyarbakir and  released that evening.    The television crew, which wanted to do a program on the  Nevruz spring festival last Monday and the municipal elections  in Turkey next Sunday, had already been attacked once while they  were filming last Sunday. In their telefax, they also say the  Turkish Army is continuing its operations against the Kurdish  civilian population with undiminished violence. Villages are  systematically destroyed and burned, and people are mistreated,  killed, and driven out. With the election approaching, violence  against international observers is becoming increasingly  widespread, the correspondents say. A Finnish observer  delegation was also detained for a day.</p>

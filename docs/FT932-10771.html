			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Ruling curbs cuts in pension scheme benefits LONDON Regional Transport could be forced to pay up to Pounds 93m into its pension scheme following a High Court ruling on Tuesday unless it can reach an agreement with members on improving benefits. In a key ruling, Mr Justice Knox said that LRT could not alter the terms of its pension scheme without taking account of benefits implied, but not specifically promised. According to pensions experts the ruling places clear limits for the first time on an employer's right to cut pension costs by restructuring pension schemes. The judge has directed all parties to the case - the trustees, the pensioners, the active members and LRT - to reach a negotiated settlement. Lawyers for the parties believe such a settlement may not require LRT to add funds to the scheme directly, but it could be forced to set a minimum contributions rate for itself, cut employees contributions and enhance benefits out of existing surplus for present and deferred pensioners. Mr Justice Knox ruled that where pension schemes are merged to create a new scheme, not only must actual benefits to members not be substantially worsened, but unwritten promises of benefits must be recognised. It is the first time the courts have so unequivocally protected the expectations of pension benefits. There are some legal quirks in the case which are unique to the LRT pension scheme, but many pensions experts believe the case will set a precedent. 'It has widespread implications for members of ordinary occupational pension schemes,' said Mr John Cunliffe, partner at McKenna and Co, who represented the 45,000 present and deferred pensioners. In 1989 two LRT schemes were merged into a new scheme via a statutory act of parliament. The RMT rail union questioned, among other things, whether the merger had been legally carried out, and whether it was right that LRT could change the rules to eliminate the requirement that its own annual contribution be 2 1/3 times that of the employees. In the new scheme LRT contributions are determined by how much is needed to pay the specified level of benefits. The change in the LRT contribution rate meant that it could take a valuable partial contributions holiday, reducing the Pounds 460m surplus by Pounds 93m. Mr Justice Knox did not address the question of whether an employer is entitled to use surplus. But he said that the existence of that surplus had given rise to members' expectations that benefits would be enhanced, as indeed they had in the years before the merger. 'No doubt the larger the surplus the livelier the expectation but in the majority of cases it remains an expectation rather than a right. That is not to say that it is either without value or that the law will not protect it in appropriate circumstances,' Mr Justice Knox said. Mr Edward Cooper, partner at solicitors Russell, Jones and Walker, which represented the RMT union members, said that some ambiguities about the case could affect its applicability to ordinary occupational schemes. Unlike most mergers which are effected by trustees, this merger occurred through a statutory act of parliament. The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called on the government to abandon its effort to force occupational pension schemes to increase benefits in line with infla-tion. Speaking at the annual conference of the National Association of Pension Funds in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, yesterday, Mr Robbie Gilbert said the new law would add considerably to company pension costs.</p>

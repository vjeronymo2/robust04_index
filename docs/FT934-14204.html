			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / International Bonds: EC issue underlines its commitment to the Ecu THE EUROPEAN Community tapped the Eurobond markets in inimitable style last week, as it made the most of the favourable sentiment sparked by the removal of the last legal obstacle to the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union. The proceeds of its two offerings, one in Ecu and the other in D-Marks, will fund a large part of the second Ecu2bn tranche of the EC's Ecu8bn balance of payments loan to Italy. The EC will launch a third issue in the coming weeks to complete this tranche. The market had been waiting for several weeks for the EC's issues to emerge, but the EC held fire until last Wednesday, the day after the German federal constitutional court made its ruling in favour of the treaty. The EC chose to make the first offering of bonds in Ecu to underline the importance of the German court's decision. The treaty, which covers the second phase of European economic and monetary union, can now become European law from November 1. In addition, the Ecu1bn offering of seven-year Eurobonds underlined the EC's commitment to the future of the Ecu bond market. This sector had been one of the main casualties of the long period of uncertainty about the future of the treaty. Institutional investors deserted the Ecu bond market after Denmark rejected the treaty in a referendum in June 1992. The EC has been keen to attract them back since their presence is needed to allow the Ecu market to develop fully. As a result, the EC decided to give up a few basis points when the bonds were priced in order to re-open the market to institutions. Nevertheless, the EC still achieved aggressive pricing for its bonds which, at the launch, yielded 12 basis points less than the French government's 9 1/2 per cent Ecu-denominated OAT due 2000. By the end of the week, the yield spread had tightened to 14 basis points below the OAT and the bonds had risen to 99.25 bid from a fixed re-offer price of 98.97, which traders said indicated the strong demand for liquid Ecu bonds. The EC intends to continue to show its leadership in the Ecu bond market by issuing its Eurobond offerings in Ecu wherever possible. However, since it is effectively raising the funds on behalf of a third party, in this case Italy, it is reluctant to dictate the terms. The immediate performance of the EC's DM1bn offering of five-year Eurobonds has also been strong. At the launch on Thursday the bonds had a fixed re-offer price of 100.025 to yield eight basis points over the series 107 of German government medium-term notes. On Friday, the bonds were trading at 100.15 bid and the yield spread had tightened to six basis points. The EC's ability to command aggressive pricing in the Eurobond market works in the favour of the ultimate borrower of the funds, because the EC does not make a profit on its lending, apart from covering the costs of issuing the bonds. As a result, Italy paid a competitive all-in cost of 6.2 per cent for its funds. However, since the EC can only borrow in the Eurobond market to raise money for specific purposes - it must not plug any shortfall in its budget, as this has to come from savings or contributions from member states - it is relatively unusual for its Eurobond transactions to be this large. This was another reason why last week's issues sold so quickly, since investors would probably have to wait at least six months before the EC launched another series of large Eurobond offerings to finance the third tranche for Italy. However, it is possible that the EC might have to raise larger amounts in the Eurobond market in the future in order to fund the EC's commitment to creating new jobs within the Community. In addition, it has not yet been decided if the EC's Ecu500m aid package to the West Bank and Gaza Strip will be in the form of a grant or a loan. For now, at least, the EC's narrowly-defined borrowing remit and its inability to warehouse money mean that it is unlikely to be as active in the Eurobond market as the European Investment Bank, the EC's long-term financing institution. The EIB's annual borrowing programme of almost Dollars 19bn makes it one of the biggest issuers in the Eurobond market. These constraints also bar the EC from taking advantage of the benefits offered by the global bond offering, a concept pioneered by the World Bank to enable borrowers to achieve a single world price and global distribution for their bonds. The World Bank, which has already issued global bond offerings in dollars and yen, is expected to launch its first D-Mark global bond offering, of DM3bn, early this week. The solution devised by the World Bank to bridge the legal differences between the US and Germany has opened up this type of financing to the EC, since the D-Mark would be the most likely currency for any global offering in the future. EC officials believe that the trend to a global market is irreversible and that it is only be a matter of time before the EC jumps on the global bond bandwagon.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JENNY CRAIG DENIES CLOSING BRITISH CLINICS  </P> <P> Jenny Craig Inc., the Del Mar-based operator and franchiser of weight-loss  centers, Wednesday disputed a British newspaper report that 33 of its centers  in the United Kingdom had closed down because of financial problems of the  British franchisee running them.  </P> <P> In its Tuesday Editions, the Today newspaper reported that 33 Jenny Craig  clinics, all situated in the greater London area, "went bust" this week because  of "massive debts."  </P> <P> Weight-loss clients -- the newspaper described them as "shocked slimmers" --  were informed of the closings in telephone calls Sept. 3. Many had already paid  the $335 annual fee that the centers charge, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> Jenny Craig Inc. spokesman Phillip Myers denied Wednesday that the centers had  closed, but said closures are "being contemplated." He acknowledged that the  company's British franchisee, Jenny Craig Weight Loss Centres (U.K.) Ltd., and  its managing director, Jeremy Beloff, were having financial problems. The U.K.  centers have been open about three years.  </P> <P> "It's undecided whether (the centers) are going to stay open or close. The  franchisee is reviewing his operations," Myers said. "There have been some  market challenges in the U.K. . . . This is an unusual situation for Jenny."  </P> <P> Myers declined to discuss what the company's options are if the United Kingdom  operation was too fail.  </P> <P> The Jenny Craig Weight Loss Centres chain has grown rapidly since its founding  in 1982 by wife and husband, Jenny and Sid Craig. System-wide revenues will  reach $500 million in 1990, or double last year's sales, Myers said.  </P> <P> The centers, which offer weekly weight-watching classes and sell low-calorie  packaged diet foods, now total 570 in the U.S., Australia and the United  Kingdom. The number of U.S outlets has grown to 433 from just 14 in 1985.  </P> <P> The company, which owns 70% of its centers, has been rapidly gaining on  industry leaders Nutri/System and Diet Centers, each of which have more than  1,000 storefronts. Company officials have said they expect 1,000 Jenny Craig  Weight Loss Centres to be open in the United States alone by the end of 1993.  </P></p>

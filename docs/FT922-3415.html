			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Naylor companies are wound up THREE companies of which Mr Peter Naylor was a director were compulsorily wound up by the High Court yesterday. Mr Naylor is serving an 18-month sentence for his part in the Barlow Clowes fraud. The orders to wind up Tudor Barn Farm, Southern Properties (Send) and Tudor Barn Stables were made on unopposed petitions by the liquidators of Barlow Clowes International and the receivers of certain Clowes investment portfolios who claimed to be loan creditors of the three companies for Pounds 50,000, Pounds 733,857 and Pounds 26,000 respectively.</p>

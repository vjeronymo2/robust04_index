			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 17 SAPA -- Executive powers were being  transferred to South Africa's nine provinces with immediate  effect, Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya  said on Friday [17 June].    The administration of almost 800 regional laws was involved.  The transfer included almost all laws dealing with housing and  health. The provinces would also receive almost all the laws  administered by the now-defunct TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana,  Venda, Ciskei] states and self-governing territories.    "The transfer of such major executive powers to provincial  governments represents a significant step towards bringing  government to the people," Dr Skweyiya told a press conference  in Pretoria.    All the powers vested in the administrations of the four  former provinces, the TBVC states and the self-governing  territories were temporarily transferred to the central  government two weeks ago.    The constitution lays down that the provinces will execute  certain exclusive powers in the areas of urban development,  local government, nature conservation and roads, among others.  It is these powers that are being transferred. In addition,  there are other powers which are exercised jointly by the  provinces and central government, such as policing powers.  These second-phase powers would be transferred to provincial  governments as soon as possible, Dr Skweyiya indicated.    He said education laws were in the process of being revised  and that the education powers of the former provinces were not  yet being transferred to the provinces. However, the education  powers of the former TBVC states and self-governing territories  were being transferred.    "The remainder of the executive powers to be executed by the  new provincial governments will be transferred to them as soon  as possible. Substantial amendments to these laws, however, are  required before any transfer can be affected. Significant  progress has been made in this regard. "The transfer of these  executive powers to the new provinces will have to be  accompanied by a restructuring of the relevant government  administrations. This is being attended to."    He said the deployment of powers between national and  provincial governments constituted one of the fundamental  aspects of the new constitution.    Dr Skweyiya has been consulting provincial premiers and  public service corps around the country for the past month.</p>

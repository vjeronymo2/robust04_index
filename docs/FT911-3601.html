			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Earnings stagnate at Matra MATRA, the French missiles and electronics group, yesterday reported that profits stagnated last year on a gentle increase in orders and sales. Net earnings were FFr606m (Dollars 101.89m), barely changed from the FFr605m recorded in 1989, on turnover up 10 per cent at FFr24.3bn from FFr22.1bn. The group received FFr26.3bn of orders last year, against FFr24bn in 1989. Space and defence, the largest division, which makes missiles, defence electronics and satellites, saw its turnover rise from FFr8.4bn to FFr10.3bn. This includes the first FFr4.5bn contribution from Matra Marconi Space, the 51 per cent owned space equipment company. The transport and car division, which produces the recently re-launched Espace for Renault and makes urban railways and automotive electronics, reported sales of FFr8.1bn, representing 34 per cent of group turnover.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICKING UP THE PIECES;  </P> <P> UN-CANCELLATION SENDS 'LOVE'S' PRODUCERS SCRAMBLING  </P> <P> "Anything but Love" got a happy surprise when ABC, after canceling the comedy  May 21, decided a month later not to cancel and ordered nine new episodes as a  backup series for the 1990-91 season.  </P> <P> The only catch: Some staffers had already signed contracts to work on other  shows. They were anything but pleased that ABC's delayed renewal canceled their  chance to return to the series about workers at a Chicago magazine.  </P> <P> "We waited as long as we could. We were told it was dead, so we took other  jobs," said Bruce Rasmussen, former co-producer of "Anything but Love." "This  is not to say we're not happy where we are, but our first choice would have  been to stay on the show we were on last year."  </P> <P> Although ABC made its decision in time to keep stars Jamie Lee Curtis and  Richard Lewis on board -- as well as executive producers Peter Noah and Robert  Myman and co-executive producer Janis Hirsch -- Rasmussen and executive story  consultants Michael Saltzman and Bill Diamond had already departed to join the  staff of NBC's "Wings," and co-producer Alan Kirschenbaum had become  co-executive producer of ABC's "Baby Talk."  </P> <P> In addition, Noah said that because "Anything but Love" was not renewed when  other series were, it lost its chance to compete for the services of many  established comedy writers, who are routinely snapped up by other shows as soon  as the networks announce their fall schedules.  </P> <P> "It's a little aggravating," Noah said when the renewal finally came. "Not only  did we have a terrific staff, but 'Anything but Love' is a show that a lot of  writers like. This is frustrating, I'll have to admit that. But when the dust  settles, we're going to have terrific writers. To a certain extent, you are  really at the mercy of the whims of the network, but we are really grateful to  be given another chance."  </P> <P> Since that conversation, the show has hired one new writer, Bill Bryan, who  will join Bill Barol, a writer who signed on with "Anything but Love" at  mid-season last year. Noah said that the production company may make a deal to  add a creative consultant, but he considers the show fully staffed now.  </P> <P> From his post at "Baby Talk," Kirschenbaum said that, while he is "a little  sad" about not being part of "Anything but Love," he is "ecstatic that the show  is picked up" and does not expect the loss of a few writers to change the show  substantially.  </P> <P> "Shows do go on," he said. "Peter (Noah) is enormously talented; the only three  irreplaceable people on the show are Peter, Richard Lewis and Jamie Lee. People  change shows in this business; it's very rare that somebody stays on a show for  a long time."  </P> <P> Harris Katleman, president and chief executive officer of Twentieth Television,  which produces the series in association with Adam Productions (a partnership  of Myman and John Ritter), said that he and Myman went to ABC to plead the  show's case as soon as it was canceled.  </P> <P> The studio also sent memos to everyone "from (ABC chairman and chief executive  Thomas) Murphy on down to the person who opens the door," Katleman said. The  plea included copies of an indignant column by New York Newsday columnist  Marvin Kitman, blasting ABC for canceling the "unique, innovative comedy."  </P> <P> "My attitude was: I thought they (ABC) had made a major error and I just kept  hammering at them," Katleman said. "I told them, 'You're going to need this  show desperately,' and they concurred."  </P> <P> Ted Harbert, ABC's executive vice president for prime time, denied that ABC  needed the show "desperately." He added that ABC's initial decision to cancel  was anything but a mistake.  </P> <P> "With the information we had on May 21, it was a reasonable decision," he said.  "We had to give them a decision by then; they got their decision. We were torn  about it; it came down to the very last second. It came down to, OK, 51  (percent) against. If we had another day, it might just as easily have gone 51  for."  </P> <P> Though declining to offer specifics, Harbert said that ABC executives changed  their minds because, after setting the fall lineup, they found that they didn't  have enough backup shows immediately available to go into production.  </P> <P> "What we learned about the availability dates of some of our backup shows  created a sort of window of opportunity for 'Anything but Love' to pop back in  there," he said. While acknowledging that Kitman's "second coming of Christ"  review -- as well as Myman and Katleman -- carried some pull, "If we hadn't  been able to come up with that window of opportunity, all the good salesmanship  in the world wouldn't have had much effect."  </P> <P> The network has asked the producers to be ready to go back on the air in  October, but "if nothing (on the fall schedule) fails, 'Anything but Love' will  not get on the air until next March," Harbert said.  </P> <P> The 11th-hour rescue represents another chapter in "Anything but Love's" quirky  history. When it went on the air in March, 1989, it already had undergone an  overhaul from the oiginal pilot. Hannah (Curtis) landed a job at Chicago Weekly  Magazine, where she was helped by star reporter Marty Gold (Lewis). For the  rest of the season, Hannah struggled as a researcher, shared a woodsy cabin  with her father and developed her friendship with Marty.  </P> <P> When the show returned last fall, Hannah had a better job at the magazine, a  tough new boss (played by Ann Magnuson) and her own apartment. The friendship  with Marty continued. (Summer reruns of last season's episodes air Wednesdays  at 9:30 p.m.)  </P> <P> Now more changes are in store. Bruce Weitz ("Hill Street Blues") will join the  staff of the magazine next season, and John Ritter will play a photographer  with designs on Hannah in the first few episodes. More importantly, the  Hannah-Marty relationship will finally take a romantic turn.  </P> <P> According to Harbert, test audiences have not warmed to their platonic  relationship.  </P> <P> "It seems that the idea of these male-and-female friendships makes people  uncomfortable," he said. "They don't really get it -- either you're lovers, or  you're not. That's not true in life, but in a television show, the audience  wants to know."  </P></p>

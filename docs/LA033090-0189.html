			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CARVEY FOLLOWS COHORTS' MOVIE PATH BUT ISN'T SPLITTING SNL YET  </P> <P> Dana Carvey, who makes his film debut in "Opportunity Knocks," is being  interviewed as a movie star, not as a member of the comic ensemble of "Saturday  Night Live." But old habits are hard to break. You ask him if he plans to leave  the venerable late-night show in pursuit of Hollywood, and suddenly George Bush  is answering.  </P> <P> "Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent."  </P> <P> And how does he feel audiences will react to his character in "Opportunity  Knocks"? The voice that answers belongs to Garth, Carvey's "nerdy surfer dude  and loyal sidekick" in the new SNL segment, "Wayne's World."  </P> <P> "Excellent! He shoots! He scores!" says Carvey/Garth.  </P> <P> Between unprompted mini-skits, the impish-looking Carvey will tell you that he  is, in fact, marveling at his success.  </P> <P> The telephone at his Encino home never seems to stop ringing, with requests for  his zany presence on such shows as "Today," where he made an appearance  Tuesday, and "The Tonight Show," where he showed up Thursday. But, it wasn't  always this way for the "Saturday Night Live" star.  </P> <P> "I was just dismissed a lot,' Carvey said. "I looked so innocent and boyish  that no one thought of casting me as a comedian."  </P> <P> In the years since then, no wrinkles or gray hairs appear to have set in, but  Carvey is no longer being offered the innocent, boy-next-door roles. After  playing a colorless character in the short-lived TV series, "One of the Boys,"  with Mickey Rooney, a mime waiter in the rock movie spoof, "This is Spinal  Tap," and being edited out of the Sean Penn movie "Racing Against the Moon,"  Carvey is ready for some recognition.  </P> <P> Known best for his quirky SNL characters -- the priggish Church Lady and the  arrogant Teutonic bodybuilder Hans, Carvey has embarked on the same crossover  journey undertaken by a host of SNL comedians before him.  </P> <P> "It's entry-level movie stardom," Carvey says.  </P> <P> His starring vehicle is a fairly ambitious role. In "Opportunity Knocks," which  opens today, Carvey plays likable con man Eddie Farrell, a two-bit hood from  the south side of Chicago. Farrell pulls off the ultimate "con" by convincing a  wealthy Chicago family that he really is a Harvard-educated whiz kid and wooing  the family's daughter.  </P> <P> Unlike SNL predecessors Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, who have ventured into  dramatic roles, Carvey wants to concentrate on what he does best: comedy.  </P> <P> Carvey said he plans to stay on SNL for as long as it'll have him, or at least  for another season, when his five-year contract runs out.  </P> <P> "You look back on people that have done three, four, five seasons there, and  they have a legacy that they can be proud of," Carvey says.  </P> <P> "I feel like I would just love to be connected to that whole legacy. And  hopefully next year will be my best year."  </P></p>

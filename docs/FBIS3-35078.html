Jansen] </F>   [Text] Damascus--Now that the tragic death in a car crash  of Major Basil al-Asad, the eldest son and heir apparent of  President Hafiz al-Asad, has been mourned and a consensus on who  will ultimately succeed the president seems to have developed,  Syria can get back to its main preoccupation, the peace process  with Israel.    On the streets of Damascus, one can still see black mourning  flags and long black streamers hanging down the facades of  buildings while tens of thousands of pictures of Basil are on  almost every wall. Although Basil was not a real candidate to  succeed his father because at 32 he was eight years too young  for the post, his death revealed that for at least five and  perhaps 10 years, he was being groomed for leadership through  service in the army and as his father's personal assistant,  during which time he performed delicate negotiations in Lebanon.    Three weeks after his death, a consensus on what the  succession will be has emerged. It is expected that there will  be no one leader after President al-Asad but a collective  leadership of, perhaps, three persons (because a triumvirate is  more stable than a duumvirate) while the primus inter pares,  eventually, will most probably be 'Abd al-Halim Khaddam,  presently the first vice president and for many years the  forceful foreign minister and Syrian viceroy for Lebanon. But  since Mr. Khaddam is a Sunni Muslim, he would require the  backing of the real holders of power, a group of generals  belonging to the 'Alawite minority, who, though only 11 per cent  of the population, have been the overlords in Syria for over two  decades.    The succession question out of the way, for the time being  Syrian attention switched back to the other major preoccupation,  peace with Israel. This, too, has been clarified and by none  other than the main Israeli negotiator with Syria, Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres, who on Feb. 11, said that "there was no  chance of an Israeli-Syrian agreement"--which is true--in the  present format of their talks-- which is untrue. There is  nothing wrong with the bilateral format except for the fact that  in the talks an irresistible force, Syrian determination, has  come up against an immovable object, Israel's intransignce:  Syria has not budged an inch from its well-established position  that Israel must vacate the whole of the occupied Golan  Heights--no return, no peace--and Israel will not budge an inch  in refusing to return the Golan only at best the smaller portion  of it.    The Syrians have almost reached the point of accepting that  the Israelis are never going to concede on the Golan. The  Syrians will accept this position because they will have no  choice. But Israel will not get the peace which it says it  wants: "The Arabs cannot make war without Egypt and cannot make  peace without Syria." For how long more would Syria be prepared  to go on with the present fruitless exercise? -- Perhaps another  half year.    A recent display of Israel's stubborn arrogance has further  convinced the Syrians that that is what is going to happen.  They noted the way in which the Israelis slapped their great  and good friend U.S. President Bill Clinton in the face when  they rubbished his claim that Syrian clarifications at the  Geneva summit of what Syria meant by full peace and  normalisation were "new" and "very important," which is exactly  so. And having been slapped, Mr. Clinton, like a good  Christian, turned the other cheek, when a few days ago, his  secretary of state announced officially that the U.S. was not  going to pressure Israel on withdrawing from the Golan.    But because the Israelis, like that other difficult and  dangerous people, the Serbs, only make concessions when under  pressure, where is the pressure on Israel going to come from  when the U.S. has opted out? Perhaps from the Palestinian  people in the occupied territories who, individually, are  killing individual Israelis on an almost daily basis. That  would explain why Damascus is the headquarters of no less than  10 "rejectionist" Palestinian groups which oppose the peace  process and particularly the Oslo accord. It would also explain  why Damascus refuses to curb the pro-Iranian Hizballah, which  maintains pressure on Israeli forces occupying parts of southern  Lebanon. The message from Damascus is clear: If there is no  peace, there will be an Arab war of attrition against Israelis  in occupied Arab territories.</p>

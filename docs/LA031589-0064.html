			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Government officials announced all National Weather Service stations will  remain open through the mid-1990s, putting to rest rumors that 40 or more  weather stations may soon close due to budget constraints. Commerce Secretary  Robert A. Mosbacher said all stations will remain in service while a  "comprehensive program to modernize the National Weather Service is completed."  There will be no layoffs at the stations, officials said. The weather service  currently has a national network of 52 weather forecast offices and 211 smaller  weather stations.  </P></p>

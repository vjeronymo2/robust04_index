			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Accounts partner quits over probe A partner with a London-based firm of accountants has left the business following a probe into apparent financial irregularities, Jim Kelly writes. Mr John Goldring, a partner with Casson Beckman, is well known in the music industry, where many of his clients work. It is understood that the apparent irregularities involve about Pounds 2m. The executive chairman of Casson Beckman, Mr Geoff Barnes, said: 'We are all extremely shocked at the circumstances which have led to the departure of John Goldring. I have taken personal charge of this matter and will head the dedicated special team which will continue to work hard and do everything it can to resolve this matter as soon as possible.' In a statement issued last night the firm said the departure had 'resulted from on-going investigations carried out by the executive board and their advisers into certain apparent financial irregularities concerning funds over which John Goldring had control by virtue of personal appointments he held in relation to certain clients'. It added: 'As soon as Casson Beckman became aware of these matters a special team was set up to investigate the full extent of these apparent irregularities and the few affected clients have been contacted personally. 'The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has been informed.' Mr Goldring's lawyers, Jay Benning Levine &amp; Peltz, said that no statement would be made on the matter.</p>

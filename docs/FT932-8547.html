			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Crackdown on crime bosses startles Brazil A RIO judge has taken the first step towards ending crime networks throughout Brazil. The surprise move could herald the end of Brazil's traditional soft approach towards organised crime. The regular monthly court appearance for the bicheiros  - men who run Rio's massive illegal gambling network  - is usually a formality. They pay off local police and politicians, and the case investigating them for Mafia-style activities has been running for seven years with no progress. But last Friday 12 of the city's 14 biggest crime bosses were handcuffed and led away agape after Judge Denise Frossard ordered their arrest for 'threatening public order' after one of their bodyguards (an off-duty military policeman) was caught trying to enter the courtroom armed with a Colt 45 and a Magnum revolver. Inspired by recent events in Italy, Ms Frossard's decision could put her own life at risk. An editorial in the Jornal do Brasil newspaper enthusiastically described it as 'perhaps the most impressive moment in Brazilian judicial history'. Ms Alba Zaluar, a leading authority on crime in Rio, says: 'This may finally break the vicious circle of a justice system where only the poor go to jail.' Brazilians were riveted to their television screens watching the 12 men being led away and transferred under police escort to the Ary Franco prison to share a cell with eight others. There was much mirth as prison guards refused to allow the entry of an exercise bike brought by one of their aides. Ms Frossard's ruling has been supported by her colleagues and Rio's chief justice says he will resist all pressures to drop her from the case. The move follows the opening of investigations into 15 of the city's top-ranking policeman for alleged corruption. But the bicheiros have powerful friends. The gambling racket turns over millions of dollars a week and, although illegal, it is conducted openly on almost every street corner of Rio. The bicheiros finance many of the city's football clubs and run Carnival, sponsoring all the main samba schools. Only two months ago they were seen by 50m television viewers being embraced by the mayor of Rio during the Carnival parade. A sentence is expected on Friday. Even if convicted, the bicheiros are expected to carry on running their lottery from jail and analysts fear they may use their estimated 30,000 strong ranks to unleash a campaign of violence in Rio.</p>

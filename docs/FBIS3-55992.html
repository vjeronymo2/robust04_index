Indeed, three security agencies are ready to guard American  President Bill Clinton during his visit to Russia: the Chief  Security Department of the Russian Federation, the Russian  Presidential Security Team, and the United States presidential  Guard. The number of people who are going to be directly  involved in the protection of Clinton, who arrives late  Wednesday evening, will exceed several hundred, according to  First Deputy Director of the Russian Security Department Yuriy  Krapivin.    If one counted up the number of auxiliary people somehow  involved in the massive security effort, the numbers would run  into the thousands. According to Krapivin, the Russian Interior  Ministry will secure the U.S. President's travel routes and the  sites which are included in the programme of his visit. The  interior troops will also protect the "Radisson Slawjanskaja"  hotel where President Clinton is scheduled to stay.    The Russian Federal Counter-Espionage Service is responsible  for up-to-the-minute information, including reports about  possible extremist conspiracies and criminal activity in Moscow.  Even the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service took part in  preliminary steps to guarantee Clinton's complete security.    Krapivin said that an advance group from Clinton's personal  guard, which arrived with their armored cars and weapons a week  ago, worked out a plan of cooperation with their Russian  colleagues. The group thoroughly scouted out the president's  hotel and the sites of his visits.</p>

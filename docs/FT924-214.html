			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Italian high-speed rail plan approved A plan to build a high-speed rail network in Italy was given the green light by the government yesterday after several days' delay, Reuter reports from Rome. Italy's budget, treasury and transport ministers' approval clears the way for an Italian-led consortium to build some 1,300 km (780 miles) of track in the next seven years. The Italian railroad consortium TAV Spa is the flagship of FS Spa, the new name of the Italian state railway system, converted into a joint-stock company last week.</p>

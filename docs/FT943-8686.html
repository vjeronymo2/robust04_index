			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Consultants net savings Sir, I must agree with the title if not with the content of 'Surprising claim about market testing in efficiency study' (Letters: August 9). The fact remains that value for money has been achieved with the use of external consultants. The taxpayer has seen a net saving on a range of projects through the use of outside consultants. Furthermore, many agencies compete and succeed in attracting private sector work through increased efficiency as a result of the implementation of consultants' recommendations. There will be consultants who do not achieve the quality or results required and they will not be used again - an option not available with permanent departments. An undertaking of the stature of the Market Testing Initiative should be judged objectively and as a whole, and not, as seems to be the fashion these days, be subject to sound bites taken out of context. Should a sound-bite be required, however, the following, drawn from the Efficiency Unit scrutiny report, may be useful: 'Our scrutiny has left us in no doubt that consultants have, and will continue to have, significant 'added value' to contribute to departments and agencies.' Jonathan Blanchard Smith, publisher, Wickham House, Executive Agencies Quarterly, London E1 4TR</p>

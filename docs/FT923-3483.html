			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Belgian court rules in favour of Accor A BELGIAN court yesterday ruled that Accor, the French hotels group, did not have to reopen its FFr2.2bn (Dollars 458.3m) bid for Wagons-Lits, the Franco-Belgian tourism company, writes Andrew Hill. The judgment should draw some of the sting from last month's landmark court ruling forcing Accor to pay three groups of minority shareholders an extra FFr950m for their shares. Accor is appealing against Cannot distribute vertically the August judgment, which established that the French company - and Societe Generale de Belgique  -gained control of Wagons-Lits in June 1990, when they bought a 26 per cent stake at BFr12,500 a share. The bid was launched last October at BFr8,650. The Brussels commercial court yesterday rejected institutional shareholders' attempt to reopen the bid, apparently dashing hopes that other investors might Cannot distribute vertically receive the increased price. Brokers had estimated the French company might have to pay an additional FFr1.6bn if the August ruling was extended to all shareholders. Some analysts believe investors who can prove they held shares in June 1990 might still receive the extra cash. Accor had promised to extend the payout to shareholders 'in a similar situation' if it finally loses the court battle.</p>

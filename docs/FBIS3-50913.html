Foreign Affairs Minister Ralph Maraj said Donaldson will be  based in Port of Spain, as economic constraints have forced  government to increase the number of non-resident ambassadors  where diplomatic postings in faraway countries were concerned.    "I'm optimistic that being able to be in closer contact with  the cabinet and the government, a non-resident ambassador will  be better positioned to deepen relations ... And will prove more  productive than what existed before," he said. The minister also  said that a delegation of Korean businessmen was expected in  Trinidad for a trade fair in April.</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Oyston puts Trans World stake up for sale Mr Owen Oyston, the flamboyant businessman who owns Blackpool Football Club, has put up for sale his 24 per cent stake in Trans World Communications, the independent radio group. A further 4 per cent, owned by associates of Mr Oyston, are also on the market. The move is likely to trigger a battle for control of the company involving Emap, the publishing group which owns almost 30 per cent of the shares, and the Guardian newspaper group, which has 20 per cent. Under the current rules on cross-media ownership the Guardian could not increase its shareholding. But it might seek a 'safe' home for Mr Oyston's stake in the expectation that the rules will soon be relaxed. Were Emap to buy the stake and so take control, it is thought it would have to sell one of Trans World's stations to stay within the limits on market share. Trans World owns Piccadilly in Manchester, Red Rose in Lancashire, Red Dragon in South Wales and Aire in West Yorkshire. Emap already owns the Liverpool station Radio City. Since letting it be known that the stake was up for sale Mr Oyston said that 'some quite seriously interested parties' had contacted him. He needs the money to fund the Pounds 50m first phase of his long-planned redevelopment of Blackpool's stadium where planning permission 'now looks almost certain'. Trans World's shares, which closed up 11p at 159p on Friday, have risen by 60 per cent in the last three weeks. Mr Oyston is looking to sell the stake at a premium to Friday's market price which valued the holding at almost Pounds 15m.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Coats regains control of Indian side COATS VIYELLA, the textiles and clothing company, is taking advantage of India's relaxation of foreign investment rules by taking control of its Indian associate, Madura Coats. Coats has increased its stake in the company, which is to be renamed Coats Viyella India, from 39.9 per cent to 51 per cent. The total investment of Rs604m (Pounds 12.25m) is payable in three tranches spread between now and next year. The Indian operations were wholly owned until 1972 when the company was forced by changes in legislation to reduce its holding below 50 per cent. Following a relaxation of the rules on foreign shareholdings, Coats applied last year for government approval to again increase its stake. It will lift its holding through a preferential share offer at Rs65 a share, a steep discount to the recent market price of Rs275. The offer, which was approved by shareholders last month, will be followed by a rights issue next year at Rs30.</p>

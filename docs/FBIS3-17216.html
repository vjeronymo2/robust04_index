			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we now report on the latest  incidents on the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] front line and  on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    The latest reports from the NKR confirm that Azerbaijan is  not interested in the effort to resolve the confrontation  through peaceful talks. Several observers are convinced that  Azerbaijan's leaders have used the relatively peaceful situation  to prepare for new and large-scale attacks. The NKR Defense  Headquarters has revealed that Azerbaijan's military command is  massing large units and armored vehicles in areas near the front  line to reinforce its positions. Not satisfied with that,  Azerbaijan's military forces have continued to systematically  fire on NKR positions with various kinds of arms and to launch  attacks to establish whether the Armenians have strengthened  their defense lines. But they have been confronted with  counterattacks and forced to retreat after suffering many  casualties and losing military equipment.    Azerbaijan's military forces in Fizulinskiy Rayon attacked  the NKR defense positions in the east of the rayon center at  0745 yesterday. A wave of rocket and artillery fire preceded  the attack. The advancing units were supported by 10 tanks and  three infantry combat vehicles. There were casualties on both  sides.    The NKR defense forces obstructed the onslaught but also  counterattacked in the afternoon. The defense forces succeeded  in occupying four heights near Alkhanly in Fizulinskiy Rayon at  about 1630. The fighting is continuing in that area.  Azerbaijan has used its Air Force units again.    The NKR Defense Army Information Service has reported that  the Armenian freedom fighters recaptured two important heights  in the Omar Pass last night. The heights were occupied by the  enemy forces several days ago. The Armenian fighters have  placed the Omar Pass under their control.    No change has occurred elsewhere on the NKR's front line.  The confrontation is mainly in the form of positional fighting.  The Artsakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] people are trying to silence  Azerbaijan's positions, which are firing on them with various  types of arms.    The Armenian Defense Ministry Information Service has  revealed that the relatively peaceful situation on the border  between Armenia and Azerbaijan has been disrupted. One of  Azerbaijan's T-72 tanks has fired on the defense positions in  Tavushskiy Rayon. The Armenian border guards launched  retaliatory operations. No other incident occurred anywhere  else in the border area last night or this morning. But the  situation is tense.</p>

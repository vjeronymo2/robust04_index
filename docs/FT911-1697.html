			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Colombia suspected of soft-pedalling war on drugs: The public appreciates the respite as the nature of the struggle has changed RUSHED around in an armour-plated white Mercedes accompanied by six armed outriders and a back-up jeep full of body-guards, Miss Universe recently visited Bogota. The high-spot for the 19-year-old beauty queen from Norway was a meeting with President Cesar Gaviria. The encounter in the presidential palace was splashed across the front pages - it was the first time in three years it was safe for a Miss Universe to come to Colombia. People walk the streets of Bogota without fear of car bombs planted by the drug barons. The military presence is less obvious. But to any outsider, this 'tranquillity' remains relative - Colombians have been progressively anaesthetised against all save the most appalling atrocity. There are still, on average, a staggering 22,500 violent deaths a year. The country's complex, interlocking and often deeply private wars continue in varying degrees of intensity - the government battles against leftist guerrillas, the guerrillas against the government, the state against the drug traffickers, the traffickers against the guerrillas, traffickers against traffickers. Meanwhile self-defence and paramilitary groups strive to 'clean up' society. In Bogota alone, the police collect around 150 unidentified bodies a month, carrying them off twice a week in an ageing Chevrolet truck for burial in a common grave. However, a sense of normality lingers, despite this grim panorama, for two reasons. Firstly, Colombia's well diversified and cautiously managed economy continues to grow at 3 per cent without the region's twin traumas of a heavy debt overhang or high inflation. Unemployment is falling and incomes have kept abreast of inflation, which over the past decade has oscillated between 16 and 32 per cent annually. Second, the nature of the confrontation between the state and the drugs mafia has changed. Since President Gaviria took office last August the all-out war declared by his predecessor, Mr Virgilio Barco, has become a low-intensity conflict with both sides putting out peace-feelers. The public undoubtedly appreciates the respite. But the president's detractors claim he is moving dangerously close to a policy of appeasement. Colombians and foreigners directly involved in fighting the multi-billion-dollar narcotics business say the progress in dismantling the influence and infrastructure of the drugs cartels achieved under Mr Barco is being undermined. Cocaine production, US narcotics agents say, is still over 500 tons a year - similar to or above the levels before Mr Barco declared his all-out war on the traffickers in August 1989. The president is aware of these criticisms; but associates say they come from those who see Colombia's drugs problem primarily in policing terms. They insist Mr Gaviria's policy is consistent with his electoral pledge to break the spiral of violence by reforming Colombia's justice system and creating a distinction between drug-trafficking and drugs-inspired terrorism  -the former being an economic and social problem, the latter a police and judicial one. But at the same time the government believes it is impossible to sustain a high-intensity war against the drug cartels at great economic cost and social strain when the drug-consuming countries are making so little headway in curbing demand. Mr Gaviria is thus walking a tight-rope between preserving the state's authority and placating a mafia which society lacks the will to combat. For instance, the powerful Medelln cartel, which controls most cocaine production and sales, has the blood of thousands on its hands. Even so, three decrees were passed between September and December, each more lenient than the last, encouraging the traffickers to turn themselves in. Three brothers from the Ochoa family, one of the principal Medelln cartel groups, have taken advantage of the decrees and are now in custody. They are widely expected to receive light sentences in what one lawyer called 'five-star prisons from which they can continue their business'. The traffickers' principal demand has been the abrogation of the treaty of extradition with the US. They have violently opposed the idea of extradition for more than six years because they know the Colombian justice system can be intimidated or bought. The US Drug Enforcement Agency has pleaded with the constituent assembly not to overturn the extradition provisions. However, nationalist sentiment has made extradition unpopular anyway, and it would be surprising if the treaty were not revoked. This would inevitably be seen by Washington as a down-grading of Colombia's anti-drug effort and could well produce a severe strain in relations.</p>

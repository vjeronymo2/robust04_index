			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCULLEY BEGINS RESHAPING APPLE RIGHT TO THE CORE;  </P> <P> COMPUTERS: ANALYSTS SAY THE LATEST EXECUTIVE SHUFFLE IS A LONG-OVERDUE ATTEMPT  TO DEAL WITH THE COMPANY'S WOES. THE CHAIRMAN'S OWN REPUTATION IS AT STAKE.  </P> <P> Apple Computer, once a symbol of brash, aggressive entrepreneurial success, has  become a victim of swollen bureaucracy and sluggish technology. And Chairman  John Sculley -- his own reputation on the line -- says he has finally had  enough.  </P> <P> Bothered by unfocused marketing efforts, new-product delays and plunging  profits, Sculley has announced layoffs, an executive suite shake-up and a firm  intention to become directly involved in overseeing the company's lagging  product development process.  </P> <P> The latest shoe dropped this week, just days after Sculley criticized Apple's  new-product development. Jean-Louis Gassee, who headed those efforts for the  last five years, apparently was unwilling to become Sculley's scapegoat and  decided to leave Apple. He is expected to depart by the end of the month.  </P> <P> Sculley's decision to assert himself in product development and marketing -- a  critical move that several analysts recommended many months ago -- comes at a  crucial time for the 14-year-old personal computer pioneer.  </P> <P> Throughout the industry, computer sales are sagging and earnings are lackluster  at best. Virtually every large computer maker -- including International  Business Machines, Compaq, Digital Equipment, Unisys and Wang Laboratories --  reported problems of varying degrees last year, and analysts don't expect to  see much improvement until at least next year.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, things aren't much better.  Leading edge technology and popular new products, long the pride of this  Silicon Valley upstart, aren't getting out the door fast enough to suit Sculley  or a growing chorus of critics. Existing product lines are clearly showing  signs of advanced age. And sales are slowing while profits are declining. For  the first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, profits fell 11% from the prior-year  period while sales grew at a mere 6%, far below the industry average and  Apple's own 26% growth rate just six months earlier.  </P> <P> Further -- and perhaps even more ominous -- competitors, led by IBM and Compaq,  are increasingly catching up with the once trail-blazing technology offered by  Apple's Macintosh model, a PC system widely considered to be the easiest and  most enjoyable to use.  </P> <P> "I want them to knock my socks off with something new, but they haven't done  it," complained Richard Shaffer, editor of a personal computer newsletter.  "They seem to have some difficulty making the right product choices, packaging  the technology correctly and getting their message to the customers."  </P> <P> Added Andrew Neff, a high-technology analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New  York: "Apple spent four times what Compaq did on research and development last  year, but only got out about one-third the number of new products. There's no  excuse for it."  </P> <P> Even Sculley has acknowledged that somewhere on its latest spurt to becoming a  $5-billion-a-year company, Apple has lost focus and stalled under the weight of  its 14,000-plus employee payroll and a slowing worldwide appetite for  computers.  </P> <P> Though Sculley's diagnosis of Apple's current ills was months in the making,  his prescription and its execution came quickly.  </P> <P> Over the last several weeks, Sculley forced out the unpopular president of U.S.  operations, Allen Z. Loren, and replaced him with Michael H. Spindler, the  architect of the company's successful European sales strategy. He announced  pending layoffs of an unspecified number of Apple employees, and started  looking over Gassee's shoulder, apparently prompting Gassee's departure.  </P> <P> "I want to compress the decision-making time and I want better-focused  marketing," Sculley said in an interview preceding last week's annual meeting.  </P> <P> "It's not a question of our engineers. . . . We have many things under  development in our labs. The issue is how do we move more things from the  research and development phase to the product phase. That's where I want to  turn up the heat."  </P> <P> Insiders recall that the last time Sculley made his presence so visible within  the company was in 1985, another down year in the computer industry and the  worst ever for Apple. Although the company had introduced the Macintosh the  year before, it was still floundering for a marketing strategy to spur its  disappointing sales.  </P> <P> Sculley, then Apple's president, moved quickly that time. Within a six-month  period, he ousted Apple chairman and co-founder Steven P. Jobs, laid off about  20% of the company's work force and focused the company's agenda on making the  under-recognized Macintosh more accepted among businesses.  </P> <P> The payoff came quickly. In January, 1986, Apple introduced the Macintosh Plus,  a mainstay in the current product line-up and the best-selling Mac model to  this day. Other models and accessories quickly followed and over succeeding  years, the company grew from $1 billion in sales to more than $5 billion last  year.  </P> <P> The turnaround earned Sculley, a former Pepsico president and marketing whiz,  high marks. It also propelled him into the top ranks of U.S. high-tech  executives and became the basis of "Odyssey," his autobiography that is  considered required reading among Apple employees.  </P> <P> The current situation, although hardly as bleak as it was five years ago, has  taken some of the burnish off Sculley's reputation as a stellar manager, and  left several analysts perplexed about why he failed to recognize the problems  in Apple's product line sooner.  </P> <P> "There's no question but that the product line has been mismanaged," said  Stewart Alsop, a PC newsletter publisher in the Silicon Valley. Alsop argued  that the company has wrongly focused its attentions exclusively at the high end  of the Macintosh product line, while abandoning the middle range and ignoring  the low end completely.  </P> <P> "They forgot that they couldn't just be a high-end purveyor for the power  user," Alsop said. "They need to provide the total solution to be successful."  </P> <P> Although analysts say they had been telling Sculley and his now-departed  lieutenants this for months, the chairman has apparently now gotten the word.  </P> <P> Sculley said last week that one of the first moves in his "break out" strategy  for renewed growth is speeding the introduction of a low-cost Macintosh, a  machine with a price tag in the $1,000 range.  </P> <P> Insiders say that with Sculley's full clout firmly behind it, the system --  which would fill a gaping void in the Macintosh product line and attract  first-time Mac customers -- could hit the market as early as next fall.  </P> <P> Sculley's reentry into Apple's product and marketing process is widely welcomed  both within and outside the company.  </P> <P> "These are tough times for Apple. . . . They have got to start speeding their  new product development," said Paul Norris, a market research analyst with the  Gartner Group and former Apple employee. "Sculley has identified the right  problem."  </P> <P> Even top-level insiders admit that product development over the last few years  has slowed and suffered. The problem, explained Larry Tessler, Apple's vice  president for research and development, is that the engineers and marketers  have often taken too long to lock up the specifications of a given product.  </P> <P> The low-cost Mac is said to be a victim of just such a process. According to  Tim Bajarin, a Silicon Valley market analyst and sometime Apple consultant,  Sculley approved the basic product concept at least a year ago. But development  languished as the engineers, product designers and marketing teams quibbled  over features, intended users and pricing strategies.  </P> <P> Analysts say a Macintosh laptop model, finally introduced late last year to  unenthusiastic reviews after two years in the labs, was another such victim.  </P> <P> "There have been innumerable reviews, rethinking and refocusing of products  while they were still in the lab," Tessler said, identifying no particular  product. "So by the time you get around to actually doing the product, the  competition had beaten us to it."  </P> <P> Although getting a low-end Mac and other products out the door is an immediate  priority, there are other -- and perhaps more critical -- challenges facing  Apple.  </P> <P> Primary among them is what to do about the entire Macintosh product line, a  question that Tessler and Gassee's successor will no doubt wrestle with. The  basic technology of the line, which accounted for more than $4 billion worth of  Apple's sales last fiscal year, was developed in the early 1980s, and has begun  to show signs of its age.  </P> <P> Although Sculley and Tessler say replacement technologies are well under  development in the research laboratories, they are reluctant to break away  entirely from a product with more than 3 million users and a huge library of  software.  </P> <P> For the time being, the issue has been put off while Apple has introduced  incremental innovations that have steadily expanded uses for the Macintosh. But  analysts say the potential pool of such advances is shrinking and express  genuine concern that the key competitive edge that the Macintosh has enjoyed  over its PC competitors -- namely its easy-to-use features -- is fast  disappearing.  </P> <P> "There's more happening here than management shuffling," said Bruce Lupatkin,  an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco. "The strategy hasn't  been working and it's getting harder to differentiate Apple from the pack."  </P> <P> </P> <P> GASSEE EXPECTED TO QUIT  </P> <P> The head of Apple Computer's new-product development unit, Jean-Louis Gassee,  is expected to resign shortly.

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Drug cartel leader shot dead AN ELITE police unit has shot dead Mr Brance Munoz Mosquera, military leader of the feared Medelln drug cartel, during a raid on a house in the Colombian city, Reuter reports from Bogota. Police said Mr Munoz Mosquera, 33, was wanted on numerous charges of terrorism and murder, and was considered the right-hand man of Mr Pablo Escobar, the cartel chief. The government had offered the equivalent of Dollars 143,000 for information leading to his arrest. Unlike Mr Escobar and his lieutenants, Mr Munoz Mosquera never took advantage of a government offer of lenient treatment in return for surrender. He has been on the run since a spectacular escape from the Medelln jail of Bella Vista in 1988. Police said the killing of Mr Munoz Mosquera made it most unlikely that Mr Escobar, who escaped from jail in July only 13 months after he had turned himself in, would surrender for a second time. Seven of the nine lieutenants who fled with Mr Escobar from the La Catedral jail near Medelln have surrendered in the past two months. Press reports have predicted that Mr Escobar also would turn himself in again soon. Meanwhile, seven soldiers have been found guilty of helping Mr Escobar escape from prison and will be sentenced next week. Three former army officers also are accused of aiding the escape. Col Hernando Navas was fired as national prisons director. Col Homero Rodrguez, former director of the prison, and Col Jorge Rodrguez, former assistant director, both resigned after the escape. The three face civilian trials.</p>

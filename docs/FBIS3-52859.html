			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has commented on  the Betzelem report about Arabs cooperating with the authorities  in the territories. It says this is the first time that  Betzelem has focused on the activities of Arab terrorist  organizations vis-a-vis the internal Arab population. During  the intifadah, the IDF says, most of the 964 Palestinians  murdered by other Palestinians did not cooperate in any way with  the IDF. The Army stressed its obligation to do everything  required to support those individuals who have aided the Israeli  authorities over the years.</p>

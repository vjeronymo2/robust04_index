			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government: Biographies"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 10 -- Following are the biographies  of Premier Silvio Berlusconi and the members of his new cabinet:  <H5>  Silvio Berlusconi -- Premier </H5>   Entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi was born in Milan on  September  29, 1936 and obtained a law degree from Milan University.    He began his business career at the age of 23 as general  manager of a building contracting firm and in 1961 founded the  Cantieri Riuniti Milanesi construction company. Two years later  he founded Edilnord, which in five years planned and built a  4,000 unit housing center in Brugherio, on the outskirts of  Milan. His second major project was Milano 2, for 10,000  inhabitants, designed and begun in 1972. It was followed by  Milano 3 (for 12,000 inhabitants) in 1976.    Also in 1976, Berlusconi joined the shareholders of the  Milan  daily, IL GIORNALE and later became its publisher. He is also  100 percent owner of TV SORRISI E CANZONI, Italy's best selling  magazine.    In 1978 Berlusconi ventured further into the communications  field by opening the Canale 5 private television channel in  Milan, extending his network nationwide and purchasing two other  major channels in 1980, Rete 4 and Italia 1.    Meanwhile he erected Il Girasole in 1979, the largest market  center for wholesale traders in Europe.    In 1988 he bought a 25 percent stake in Amef, the company  which controlled the Mondadori publishing group, and in 1990 he  became chairman of Mondadori.    He also owns 25 percent of La Cinq, the first commercial  television network in France and is president of the European  Consortium for Commercial Television (ACT) in Brussels. His bid  to enter the French television world in 1984 proved difficult  and finally collapsed in 1989, but he had more success in Spain  where he bought up a 25 percent stake in Antenna 3 in 1989.    Berlusconi is also a committee member of Confindustria  [General Confederation of Italian Industry] and since 1986 is  president and owner of the first division AC Milan soccer team,  which this year won its third consecutive National League title.    Berlusconi in the 1980's found himself dragged into the  scandal over the outlawed Propaganda Due (P-2) Masonic lodge, of  which he was a member. He denied ever having played an active  role in the lodge, but found himself charged with perjury in  connection with the inquiries.    The late 1980's also saw him doing battle with the RAI state  broadcasting company which sued him for unfair competition and  unauthorised use of nationwide live broadcasting. The issue was  settled with a new broadcasting law which many saw as  tailor-made for the Milan magnate.    According to his detractors, Berlusconi's close personal  friendship with disgraced Socialist Party chief Bettino Craxi,  who was premier when the new broadcasting law was being drawn  up, smoothed Berlusconi's path in mass media.    His awards include the 1977 Knight of the Order of Labor  Merit of the Italian Republic and has been a member of the board  of the Teatro Manzoni theatrical company in Milan.    Berlusconi has handed over management functions of his  Fininvest empire but still retains 100 percent ownership. The  group is Italy's third largest private enterprise.    Fedele Confalonieri is the new chairman of Fininvest, which  operates in the television, advertising, publishing,  supermarket, insurance and building sectors, generating net  earnings of 10.5 trillion lire (6.2 billion dollars) in 1992.    Fininvest announced earlier this month it planned to reduce  its stake in Mondadori to less than 50 percent.    Berlusconi has created his party, Forza Italia (Go Italy),  less than three months before the March 27 elections.  <H5>  Alfredo Biondi -- Justice </H5>   A qualified solicitor and law graduate, Alfredo Biondi, 66,  was born in Pisa and is currently based in Genoa. He first  entered Parliament as a candidate for the Liberal Party (PLI) in  1968, and remained as such until just before the March 27-28  1994 elections when he ran successfully for the small  conservative Center Union (UDC), grouping most of the  ex-Liberals.    In 1981 Biondi became part of the parliamentary inquiry  commission on terrorism in Italy and was thus involved in the  investigation of Aldo Moro's murder by the Red Brigades in 1978.  He also served as minister for European affairs in 1982 and has  held posts on numerous committees such as constitutional  affairs, justice, and more recently on laws reforming  parliamentary immunity. He was deputy speaker of the Senate in  the last legislature.    Within the Liberal Party Biondi maintained a high profile  becoming national vice-secretary and later national secretary of  the party.t  <H5>  Raffaele Costa -- Health </H5>   Raffaele Costa, 47, is a lawyer, journalist and editor of IL  DUEMILA (2000) magazine. He was health minister in the Amato  government and transport minister under Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.    He entered parliament in 1976 and has remained in the Lower  House ever since. Besides his ministerial posts, Costa has  served as undersecretary several times, at the Justice, Foreign  Affairs, Interior, and Public Works Ministries. Costa is famous  for his battles against extravagance and waste in the public  sector.  <H5>  Lamberto Dini -- Treasury </H5>   Lamberto Dini was born in Florence in 1931, obtained a  degree  in economics from Florence University and attended post-graduate  school at the University of Minnesota and at Michigan  University. He obtained a Stringher scholarship from the Bank  of Italy and a Fulbright scholarship from the United States  government, as well as a research fellowship from the Ford  Foundation.    In May 1959 he entered the International Monetary Fund as an  economist and worked his way through the ranks until becoming  central co-director for African affairs.    Dini became director general of the Bank of Italy in 1979  and  is also a board member of the Italian Exchange Office, chairman  of the deputies of the Group of Ten and a member of three OECD  Economic Policy committees.    He is on the European Union's Monetary Committee and has  represented Italy as a substitute for the central bank chief at  meetings of the Bank for International Settlements, the  International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank  and the Center for Monetary and Banking Studies in Geneva.    Dini's wife, Donatella Zingone, founded the Zeta industrial  group in Costa Rica and is considered one of the richest people  in the Central American country.  <H5>  Francesco D'Onofrio -- Education </H5>   Francesco D'Onofrio, 54, belongs to the right-wing Christian  Democratic Centre, which broke away from the Christian  Democratic Party when it became the Popular Party.    D'Onofrio teaches law at Rome University. He joined the  Christian democrats in 1977 and worked as a consultant for the  Higher Council of Public Administration from 1977 to 1981. He  worked in the state-run departments of local administrations and  of institutional policies between 1982 and 1989 and was a top  party official in Rome from 1986 to 1988.    He was elected to the Senate in June 1983 and has been a  member of several commissions, including Constitutional Affairs,  Broadcasting and Institutional Reforms.    With three other former Christian Democrats, D'Onofrio set  up  the Christian Democratic Centre, but stood with Forza Italia for  the proportional sector of the Lower House vote.  <H5>  Giuliano Ferrara -- Relations With the Parliament </H5>   Best known for his one-man political comment show which has  run since 1989 on the Fininvest-owned channel Canale 5, Ferrara  is a prominent public figure with a long involvement in media  and politics.    Since 1989 he has been a member of the European Parliament  where he was elected as an independent on the Socialist ticket  but recently announced his intention to withdraw his candidacy  for the June elections. He also served on European Parliament  commissions on youth, culture, media, education and citizens'  rights.    The son of a Communist Party member, Ferrara, 42, was active  with the Communists until 1980 when he turned his attention to  journalism and to the Socialists, becoming a close acquaintance  of then-Socialist leader and Premier Bettino Craxi.    He worked as political commentator for the late-night RAI-2  news in the mid '80s and, after his lucrative move to the  Berlusconi network, as anchorman for various, sometimes stormy  current affairs programs on Fininvest's Canale 5 and Italia 1.    He writes a regular column for Italy's biggest-selling daily  CORRIERE DELLA SERA.    He was born in Rome, where he still lives with his wife  Anselma Dell'Olio.  <H5>  Publio Fiori -- Transport </H5>   Publio Fiori, 56, a Rome lawyer, has a long history with the  Christian Democratic Party but in the March vote was elected on  a National Alliance ticket.    He taught at university and worked as a state lawyer,  becoming a public works officer before being appointed president  of the party's advisory council and member of the regional  management board. He become a town councillor in 1971, moving  on to the Lazio regional council in 1975. In the mid-'80s he  was knee-capped by the Red Brigades.    He was elected to the national parliament in 1979 with the  Christian Democrats and has held posts in several parliamentary  commissions, the last being Finance and Tax Registry.    In November of last year, on the eve of the local elections,  he made his first overtures to National Alliance and later  joined the party, in time to get elected in March.  <H5>  Domenico Fisichella -- Cultural Heritage </H5>   Domenico Fisichella, 59, a senator elected with National  Alliance, was born in Messina, Sicily, and is a lecturer in  political science at Rome University, and at the private Luiss  University, also in the capital.    He is an editorial columnist for the Rome conservative  daily,  IL TEMPO, where he has repeatedly asserted that "in democracies  there is a constant temptation toward a perversion of plurality,  toward an excess of plurality." Fisichella is an outspoken  monarchist.  <H5>  Vito Gnutti -- Industry </H5>   Businessman Vito Gnutti, 55, was born near the northern city  of Brescia and in the 1970s owned a steel factory with plants in  Brescia and Milan. The company failed and in 1986 Gnutti bought  Silexport, specializing in rifle barrels.    Gnutti, a long-standing member of the Lombard region's  industrialists' association, describes his past political ideas  as varied and said he "also" voted for non-disgraced former  Socialist Party chief Bettino Craxi, "when I thought it was  right to do so." He is a member of the Confindustria national  board.    Lured into politics by Northern League Secretary Umberto  Bossi, Gnutti was first elected to the Lower House in April  1992. He received 52 percent of the vote in his Val Trompia  constituency in last March's elections.  <H5>  Gianni Letta -- Cabinet Undersecretary </H5>   Gianni Letta, who announced earlier on Tuesday [10 May] that  he gave up his post as Fininvest deputy president two days ago,  worked as a publishing and broadcasting executive for  Berlusconi's group from May 1987, when he became vice chairman  of Fininvest Comunicazioni and board member of the group's  supermarket and department store chain, Standa.    Before joining Fininvest, Letta's career was at the  conservative Rome daily, IL TEMPO, where he rose from simple  reporter in his early 20s to board member, then a top editor.    Letta's career at IL TEMPO ended abruptly when he confessed  to having received 300 billion lire (187 million dollars) in  bribes from the state-owned IRI [Institute for Industrial  Reconstruction] colossus. Letta has always claimed the money,  handed to him by Italstat chairman Ettore Bernabei, was part of  a "promotional campaign" and a totally legitimate affair.    Letta was also anchorman for the current affairs television  show, "Italia Domanda" ("Italy Asks") broadcast by one of the  three Fininvest networks.    Born at Avezzano in the Abruzzi 59 years ago, he comes from  a  family of lawyers.  <H5>  Roberto Maroni -- Interior </H5>   Roberto Maroni, 39, is the Northern League whip in the Lower  House. He is viewed as the right hand man of party chief  Umberto Bossi, and is the federalist movement's chief  negotiator. He was born in the northern town of Varese, where  he has a lawyer's practice. He is married, with two small  children.    Maroni began his political activity with Bossi in 1979 and  was one of the founding members of the Northern League. He is  provincial secretary for the Northern League in Varese and a  member of the Lombard League's national council.    In 1990 Maroni was elected to his home town's city council  and was first elected to parliament in the Lower House in April  1992. He was a member of the constitutional affairs, interior  and cabinet office parliamentary committees.    Maroni led negotiations that created the League's two-way  electoral alliance with Forza Italia in the north of Italy, and  has stood in for Bossi more than once in talks with coalition  partners.  <H5>  Antonio Martino -- Foreign Affairs </H5>   Antonio Martino, 51, an economist who studied at Chicago  University under free-trade guru Milton Friedman, heads the  political science faculty at Rome's private Luiss University.    The son of Gaetano Martino, the Liberal Party vice secretary  who in the 1950s was education and foreign minister and among  the signatories of the Treaty of Rome, Antonio Martino began his  political career with the Liberals, standing for election to  that party's secretariat in 1988.    In December 1993 he moved closer to electoral reform  champion  Mario Segni, signing an appeal for a strong alternative party to  the Democratic Party of the Left and for Segni to become  premier. Later he became involved in the Forza Italia  experiment, acting as one of Berlusconi's top economic advisers  during the March election campaign.    He is the author of Berlusconi's 30 percent flat tax rate  proposal, to be compensated by a new system of taxable income  declared.    Since being tipped as foreign minister, Martino has taken  steps to reverse his reputation as an anti-European Thatcherite,  calling for a "monetary constitution" to forge economic and  monetary union in the EU [European Union].    Unveiling his policy-thinking in a recent interview, Martino  said that Italy would "never again be a European Cinderella."    "Slovenliness and unmet deadlines have made us lose face in  Europe," he said, striking three keynotes in the defence of  human rights, a war on national selfishness (meaning firm  antiprotectionism in foreign trade policy), and "transparency"  with the United States. He said these were all elements that  broke with the "muddle along" approach he attributed to past  governments.    As foreign minister, Martino intends to pay his first visits  to the United States and Israel where, he said recently, "they  have a very negative image of our coalition."  <H5>  Clemente Mastella -- Labor </H5>   Clemente Mastella, 47, was born in Benevento, near Naples,  and joined the Christian Democratic Party early in his youth.  He graduated from university with a degree in philosophy and  worked as a journalist for RAI in Naples, later becoming head of  information and publishing for the Christian Democratic Party.    He was first elected to the Lower House in 1976 and has been  there ever since, joining a variety of commissions and becoming  undersecretary for Defense under Premier Giulio Andreotti in  1991. He has gained considerable power because of his continued  role in the party's mass media and information department.    He was re-elected to parliament with the Christian Democrats  in April 1992 but later joined the right-wing Christian  Democratic Center and was re-elected in March on a slate run by  the new party.  <H5>  Giancarlo Pagliarini -- Budget </H5>   Giancarlo Pagliarini, 52, is a certified public accountant  from Milan who worked at Arthur Andersen from 1967 to 1983, when  he formed his own accounting agency.    Pagliarini was not active in politics before he met Umberto  Bossi in 1990 and joined the Northern League. He was elected to  the Senate with the party in April 1992. He is a member of the  economic planning and budget commissions.    Among his main contributions to the League's policies is the  proposal to privatize totally the pension system and to use  workers' monthly pension withholdings to pay for the pensions of  retirees, and to calculate a worker's pension according to the  total contributions paid during his/her working life. He also  wants to give everyone education "vouchers" and let the  individual choose whether to attend public or private school.    He taught at Parma University and is on the board of several  accounting and financial service associations, including the  Miami-based International Independent Accountants Association.    He was one of the founding members of the Alliance for  Institutional Reforms (APRI) in 1983 and has published numerous  works on taxes, accounting, financial reports and budgeting.  <H5>  Cesare Previti -- Defense </H5>   Cesare Previti is a well-known and wealthy lawyer and Silvio  Berlusconi's personal legal adviser. Born in Reggio Calabria,  Previti is a former member of the neofascist Italian Social  Movement and was elected to the Senate with Forza Italia in the  March elections.    Previti was the analyst who stirred a hornet's nest only a  few weeks ago when he suggested that the judges' self-governing  body, the Supreme Council of Magistrates (CSM), should "adapt to  the new political reality emerging from the elections."  According to Previti, the one-third of CSM members who are not  judges and who in the past have been appointed by parliament  (using a "proportional" system according to party size) from now  on should be appointed only by the three right-wing parties  forming the new government coalition.    Over 1,000 magistrates have signed a petition against  Previti's proposal, charging that it would undermine the  political independence of the judiciary and place it in the  hands of the executive.    Previti is Forza Italia's Senate whip.  <H5>  Adriana Poli Bortone -- Agriculture </H5>   Adriana Poli Bortone, 50, is from the southern town of Lecce  and has been on the city council there since 1967. She joined  the neofascist Italian Social Movement early on and has been a  member of the party's national secretariat and executive  commission.    She was first elected to the Lower House in 1983 and was  party whip in the Pension Commission. She also is a member of  the Education and Fine Arts commission and is on the party's  commission for women's issues.    Since 1972 she has been assistant professor of Latin  literature at Lecce University.    In April 1992 Poli Bortone was re-elected with the MSI,  which  became the National Alliance ahead of the March 28 general  election, receiving more votes than any other party colleague in  the Puglia region.  <H5>  Francesco Speroni -- Institutional Reform </H5>   Francesco Speroni, 47, is a former Alitalia flight  technician  with a political science degree from the University of Pavia.  He worked as a transport personnel consultant at the Health  Ministry and was president of the Association of Flight  Technicians before joining the Northern League in 1986.    He was elected to the European Parliament in 1989 and in  1990  was elected city councillor of Busto Arsizio, his home town near  Varese. The following year he was elected a member of the  Lombardy regional council.    Speroni, in October 1991, was elected president of the  Northern League-Lombard League and in April 1992 was elected to  the Senate in his home constituency under a joint  Northern-Lombard League ticket.    He is the Northern League's party whip in the Upper House  and  is a member of the Constitutional Affairs, Interior and Prime  Minister's Office commissions.  <H5>  Giuseppe Tatarella -- Post and Telecommunications, Deputy </H5> Premier    Giuseppe Tatarella, 60, is a lawyer and journalist first  elected to parliament in 1979 with the neofascist Italian Social  Movement. A native of the southern Puglia region and one of the  most powerful right-wing politicians there, he is considered one  of National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini's closest aides and  will "represent" the south in the premier's office.    He was a member of the Justice, Public Works, Finance and  Treasury, Culture, Science and Education commissions and was  also a member of the joint commission on Information, Security  Services and State Secrecy.    He is Lower House whip for the MSI, now the National  Alliance, and a member of the national secretariat. He was also  among the founders of the association, Young Italy, and has held  several local administration posts in his southern hometown of  Bari.    Roberto Maroni of the Northern League last week said of  Tatarella that, "speaking with him, I feel as if I were talking  to an old-time Christian Democrat."  <H5>  Giulio Tremonti -- Finance </H5>   Giulio Tremonti, 45, is professor of tax law at the  university of Pavia and is a free-lance tax consultant. He is  also working in the Commission for Currency Reform and in two  technical committees at the Finance Ministry.    He is a member of the so-called Liberal Democratic  Foundation, which split from the Pact for Italy after the March  elections to join Berlusconi's alliance.    Tremonti, however, began his political career as a Socialist  and first ran unsuccessfully in the 1987 elections. He was also  a consultant for then Socialist Finance Minister Rino Formica,  has offices in Milan and Rome and writes commentaries for the  Milan daily, CORRIERE DELLA SERA.    He reportedly had a falling out with Formica, thus  "fortunately" ruining his chances of being appointed head of  IRI's SNAM [National Gas Pipeline Company] industrial unit  (whose chairman was later put under investigation for  corruption).    At the end of last year Tremonti hit the spotlight with the  timely publication of a book on fiscal federalism, an issue  close to the heart of the Northern League, and quickly picked up  by all other parties during the election campaign. One of his  main theses is that revenues should shift from indirect to  direct taxes.  <H5>  Giuliano Urbani -- Public Sector Industry and Regions </H5>   Giuliano Urbani, 56, of Forza Italia, is general manager of  the Institute for International Policy Studies (ISPI) and  chairman of the scientific committee of the Einaudi Foundation.  He teaches political science and is director of the research  and studies center of comparative politics at Milan's Bocconi  University.    Urbani, known to combine a diplomatic manner with firmness  and determination, is the main architect of Forza Italia's  institutional platform. According to this advocate of good  government, Berlusconi's movement should be firmly anchored in  the center of the nation's political spectrum and interpret a  capacity for renewal in a liberal key.  <H5>  Giorgio Bernini -- Foreign Trade </H5>   Giorgio Bernini, a lawyer and professor, was born in Bologna  on 9 November 1928. After teaching in Ferrara and Padua,  Bernini is now a professor of commercial law at the University  of Bologna, from which he received his degree in 1950.  Considered one of the main experts on arbitration, he is  president of the International Council for Arbitration. He was  an EC consultant for the Italian Government on questions of  international commercial law and, in particular, on problems of  tariffs, customs barriers, and technology transfer. He has  written texts and articles for specialist journals as well as  daily newspapers. He entered politics in recent months. His  meeting with Forza Italia took place in January. As a candidate  on the proportional lists for the Umbra constituency, he was  elected with 90,852 votes.  <H5>  Roberto Radice -- Public Works </H5>   Roberto Radice, a member of the Confapi [National  Confederation of Small Manufacturers] executive committee and an  entrepreneur who has only recently entered politics, was, in  fact, elected to the Senate for Forza Italia in his first  legislative session on the lists of the pole for freedom in the  electoral constituency of Lombardo di Desio.

After fulfilling various diplomatic duties abroad, in 1976  he  was appointed deputy diplomatic advisor to Prime Minister Rumor  and, subsequently, head of the press and information service of  the Foreign Ministry. Beginning in 1979, he was a diplomatic  advisor to Prime Ministers Francesco Cossiga (August  1979-October 1980), Forlani (October 1980-July 1981), and  Spadolini (July 1981-November 1982).    In 1980, Berlinguer was the prime minister's personal  representative at the G-7 summit in Venice (June 1980). From  spring 1983 until June 1985 he held the post of director general  for emigration and social affairs at the Foreign Ministry. In  April 1985 he was appointed director general of economic  affairs, a post he did not actually fill since in June Cossiga  called him to the Quirinale [president's palace] to be secretary  general of the presidency of the republic. In December 1992,  then Foreign Minister Emilio Colombo appointed him chairman of  the committee in charge of negotiating with Slovenia, Croatia,  and the other states of the former Yugoslavia for reviewing the  Osimo Treaty."  <H5>  Altero Matteoli -- Environment </H5>   New Environment Minister Altero Matteoli (53 years) was born  in Cecina, in the province of Livorno.

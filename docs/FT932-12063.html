			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Beijing to rival Tokyo steel making CHINA is likely to outstrip Japan in steel production by the end of the decade and has the 'real potential' to become a major market for western steel producers and iron ore miners, according to a study by a Sydney-based consultancy, writes Andrew Baxter. The report by AME Mineral Economics says Chinese steel production has increased steadily since the early 1980s, reaching 78m tonnes of crude steel last year. But production is expected to grow rapidly over the current decade, to reach between 100m and 120m tonnes per year by 2000. Planned capacity expansions at existing steel mills already total some 16.8m tonnes and possible greenfield developments might add a further 40m tonnes, says the report. If these ambitious targets are met, China will be rivalling the steel capacities of Japan and the US by the end of the decade. The report notes that China's importance to world steel trade was emphasised in 1992 by heavy Chinese buying in the second half of the year. In spite of last year's 10 per cent increase in Chinese crude steel production, even stronger domestic demand caused internal free market prices to jump by up to 80 per cent, diverting production away from the export sector. With China's imminent entry into the Gatt, says the study, import duties should fall, stimulating imports into the country. Iron and Steel: Relying on China.

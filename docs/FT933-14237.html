			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Lobbying not worth a button: UK government plans to prune its contacts with trade associations The British Button Manufacturers Association was formed in 1915 when the country's clothing manufacturers were still a force to be reckoned with. Today, the association shares its headquarters with the Buckinghamshire home of its secretary, Mrs Patricia Smith. Its membership has fallen to 14 companies, from about 160 at the end of the second world war, but it still expects to have occasional meetings with senior government officials on issues that affect European and world button markets. Hundreds of other UK trade associations, large and small, have similar aspirations. However, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, wants to restrict their access, concentrating ministerial and civil servants' time on a smaller number of 'better resourced, more powerful' lead associations in each industrial sector. His aim, announced in a recent speech to the Confederation of British Industry, is to improve the quality of industrial lobbying in Whitehall and Brussels. The principal role of trade organisations is to lobby government on legislation and likely policy changes that could affect the way in which their member companies operate. Mr Heseltine believes that fewer, larger groups would be more effective than a myriad of smaller, more narrowly focused bodies. The prospect of losing already limited access to government dismays Mrs Smith, who is contracted by the button makers to work one morning a week - in practice, it is more - assisting with pay negotiations, dealing with correspondence, organising meetings and keeping abreast of possible legislative changes. She says: 'Recently we became concerned about European Community attempts to restrict the use of nickel, which affects button making. After much badgering we got a meeting with Department of Trade officials, but only at a very low level. We were very disappointed.' The department has raised the issue in Brussels, but the proposed EC legislation remains unchanged. By concentrating on the big picture there is a danger that issues affecting small component suppliers could be ignored, says Mrs Smith. This could have a detrimental effect on larger manufacturers which rely on small suppliers. Ministers and government officials say they do not have enough time to see all the organisations demanding their attention. They add it can be confusing to receive conflicting messages from trade associations in the same sector. There are about 2,000 registered trade associations in Britain, compared with 1,200 in Germany and 1,000 in France, according to Mr Chris Henderson, a director of CBD Research, which since 1965 has published a series of British and European guides to business, trade and professional organisations. The formation and survival of so many associations is explained partly by history: the scale and diversity of Britain's industrial base spawned large numbers of trade groupings, whose members have traditionally valued their independence and who have enjoyed the club-like atmosphere of small, focused organisations. While industry has declined, the number of associations has remained high. In the past 25 years, since CBD Research has kept records, the number has been remarkably constant, says Mr Henderson. Associations in declining industries that have merged or disappeared have been replaced by new industry bodies formed in growth areas such as electronics, he says. But recession in the past few years has eroded individual membership numbers and trade association income - most fees are based on a member company's turnover, payroll or capital employed. Some smaller trade associations, faced with the loss of lobbying access as well as dwindling income, are seeking loose federations where they can share resources, while others have merged with larger, more powerful organisations in the same sector. Mergers between smaller associations have increased as the industries they represent have shrunk or rationalised. An example of the trend is the formation of the British Engineers' Cutting Tools Association, which represents the combined forces of the Sheffield-based Milling, Cutter and Tool Bit Association, the Twist Drill and Reamer Association and the Screw Thread Tool Association. The new body will remain a member of the 50-year-old Federation of British Engineers' Tool Manufacturers which helps co-ordinate the industry's lobbying activities. The Chemical Industries Association, singled out by Mr Heseltine as 'an excellent example' of a 'well-resourced lead association', acts as an umbrella organisation providing substantial lobbying assistance to other chemical trade associations trying to influence Whitehall and Brussels. It has an annual fee income of about Pounds 4m - only slightly less than the combined turnover of all 14 members of the British Button Manufacturers Association. Mr John Cox, the association's director-general, says: 'It is not enough just to respond to upcoming legislation. You have to be in permanent contact with policymakers so you can influence proposals before they are made. You have to know which members of parliament, in Westminster and Strasbourg, have influence and when you can contact them. We have to employ permanent staff to cope with this work, which smaller associations would not be able to afford.' Even large employers and trade bodies are forming links: the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers' Federation are examining ways to 'collaborate more closely to improve the delivery of industry's message to government'. But co-operation between groups in Britain tends to be less centralised than in Germany, for example, where specialist interest groups are more co-ordinated within central industrial organisations. These provide a well-organised system of industrial lobbying, says Mr Henderson, as well as providing services for a range of separate product groups - in a similar fashion to the Chemical Industries Association. The success of more centralised groups does not mean that small associations have no place in representing manufacturers' interests. 'The British system tends to be more informal,' says Mr Henderson. 'Separate product groups in the same industry may share the same headquarters and even the same secretary, but still value their independence. This does not necessarily make them less effective. 'Associations have a lot of functions. They may help organise specific industry training, maintain links with educational bodies, assist with pay negotiations, arrange conferences and generally promote and market their industry. It would be a pity if these individual services were lost as a result of member companies moving to more broadly based organisations.' But Mr Henderson shares Mrs Smith's concern that small but important issues might slip between the cracks, damaging the interests of small industries which supply larger manufacturing interests. It is not the first time that government has tried to rationalise its relations with industry lobbyists. The 1972 report of the Commission of Inquiry into Industrial and Commercial Representation under Lord Devlin similarly criticised duplication and confusion in trade associations competing in the same industries. The report said: 'Everybody agrees that there are too many bodies. A businessman can find himself paying out substantial sums to quite a number of different bodies without being at all clear what he gets in exchange . . . He can find himself attending quite a number of different meetings at which the same subjects are being discussed.' In the critical area of representation to government, it concluded: 'You can have competition of services but not competition of voices.' The commission's report was quietly forgotten and nothing changed. The Department of Trade and Industry, more than 25 years later, might be more persistent. The associations themselves appear to be moving in the right direction. It will be up to the DTI to ensure that those small but important issues do not slip through the cracks.</p>

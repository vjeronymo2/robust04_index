			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: CHANGING BY STAYING THE SAME  </P> <P> Great cities change slowly, over decades, and so it is difficult to name the  year when San Francisco finally lost its war with Los Angeles. Perhaps it was  1958, when the O'Malleys saw the future and moved the Dodgers south instead of  north. Perhaps 1971, when the Fillmore closed its doors. Or 1986, when the Bank  of America fell from grace, revealing San Francisco to be a fading center of  high finance.  </P> <P> One can argue about these things, but there is no doubt that one of the great  urban rivalries of this century has now ended. San Francisco is slowly being  drawn into orbit as a satellite of Los Angeles. This may be regarded with a  sense of vindication or with some sadness, but the truth of it can be seen  everywhere.  </P> <P> Just go to The Top of the Mark, a place that once symbolized so much about San  Francisco. This grand old room occupies the highest floor of the Mark Hopkins  hotel, which in turn sits at the very pinnacle of Nob Hill.  </P> <P> Once the city's banking and railroad barons came here to survey their kingdom  and dance away the night. They don't come here anymore, of course. The Top of  the Mark is now a quick stop for the tourist buses.  </P> <P> From the windows, as big as movie screens, you can look over the city that only  a century ago was the unchallenged center of the Pacific slope. Look north and  you can see the city's port, a place now empty of ships, the old docks filled  instead with lobster restaurants and bric-a-brac stores. The ships themselves  have long since gone to Oakland and Long Beach. You will nowhere see the name  of Crocker Bank, one of the city's first great banks, because Crocker no longer  exists. The Southern Pacific Railroad, the original junkyard dog of  corporations, is operated out of Chicago now. Del Monte Foods is controlled  from Florida. The once imperial Bank of America has become a tenant in the  granite-faced skyscraper it formerly owned.  </P> <P> No one is claiming that San Francisco is about to become another Cleveland. The  streets of the city still are filled with people of money munching bran muffins  as they push their way through the crowd. South of Market Street new hotels are  abuilding. No, the decline of San Francisco is another sort. It has to do with  the loss of mass, of urban throw weight.  </P> <P> Richard Walker, a geographer at UC Berkeley, studies the rise and fall of  cities. One day recently he ticked off the reasons why San Francisco should  never have lost its rivalry with Los Angeles.  </P> <P> San Francisco had a great, natural port, it had water supplies, had railroads  and banks filled with money from the gold rush. Los Angeles had none of this.  And yet Los Angeles now completely dominates the western United States, and San  Francisco has been reduced to a regional center. No one really understands how  this happened.  </P> <P> In fact, there are probably lots of reasons for San Francisco's fall, but I  have a favorite theory. It has to do with urban narcissism and how that can  lead a city into dissipation. There is nothing wrong with municipal  handsomeness, of course, and some cities -- Paris, for example, or even Seattle  -- have managed to accept their beauty without becoming obsessed by it. Cities,  like people, need a reason to get up in the morning and these cities never  forgot that truth. San Francisco did.  </P> <P> Have you ever listened to San Franciscans congratulating each other simply for  living in the city? Or the stories they tell about New Yorkers or  Washingtonians who threw it all over and came here to live on salaries half  their previous size? Living in San Francisco is like going out with the  prettiest girl in high school, the one who has convinced herself she doesn't  have to be smart or know computers or shoot pool. All she has to do is remain  forever pretty.  </P> <P> But prettiness is all about staying the same, about dreading change, which is  what San Francisco did while other cities were grabbing the future. San  Francisco didn't bother with containerized shipping, and the port moved to  Oakland. Trade with Japan was ignored and the Japanese car companies all put  their American headquarters in Los Angeles. The city didn't woo the aging J.  Paul Getty when it had a chance and the old man built the richest museum in the  world in Malibu. I have my own favorite milestone in all this. It is 1977, the  year tourism became the largest business in the city. This was the point when  San Francisco turned prettiness into a profession. It was the point of no  return. From 1977 on, the city's old roles ceased to matter and it began the  sordid game of wooing outsiders to pay its keep. This city, once the ruler of  all it surveyed, had joined the ranks of Honolulu and Las Vegas.  </P></p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Shanghai rights issue setback SHANGHAI has suffered another blow to its plans to develop a large and respected capital market as the first rights issue to be launched on China's fledgling stock markets looks set to collapse in disarray. Shanghai Vacuum, which in February became the first company to offer shares to foreigners since 1949, was attempting to raise Yn600m (Dollars 105m) through a deeply-discounted share offer; but the subsequent crash in the Shanghai stock market has made subscription an impossibility. The rights issue had been controversial from the start. The new shares were to be issued at the same price to both local and foreign investors because their A and B shares rank pari passu. At the time of the announcement, the offer price of Yn800 represented a 30 per cent discount to the A share price and a 120 per cent premium to the B share price. Foreign shareholders were therefore excluded from the issue, although the cash call remained an attractive source of low cost financing. However, Shanghai's A shares have plunged, from a combination of the wholly unrealistic share prices previously achieved and concerns over the impact of several large scale flotations. The Shanghai Vacuum share price reached a peak of Yn2,510, at the time the rights issue proposals were first discussed, in May. It closed yesterday at Yn500, a discount to the rights offer which will close on Friday. Theoretically, the local portion of the issue was underwritten by Shanghai Shenyin Securities and the issue could still proceed, with that brokerage taking its full commitment. However, brokers expect the entire rights issue to be cancelled. This fiasco adds pressure for the authorities to streamline the trading and settlement procedures at the exchange, and to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework. At present, many foreign fund managers are barred from purchasing Shanghai shares.</p>

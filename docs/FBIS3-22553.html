[stockholding company]," have been at the  hospital for infectious diseases from the middle of December  until 19 January. The diagnosis is trichinosis. Sixty patients  have been released, but two remain at the hospital. Yesterday,  the deputy minister of health care, Dr. Lyubomir Kumanov; a  national consultant on infectious and tropical diseases,  Professor Petur Petrov; and representatives of NIZPB [Scientific  and Eductional Institute of Communicable and Parasitic  Diseases], the hospital for infectious diseases, and the KhEI  [Hygiene-Epidemiological Inspectorate] in Pernik, met to  consider the origin of the trichinosis infection in "Stomana."    The specialists have established that the cause of infection  is the consumption of infected pork by the patients, and not  through radiation as rumored. As yet, the exact source of the  meat is not known.</p>

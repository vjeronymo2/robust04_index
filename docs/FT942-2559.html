			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weak bonds, derivatives closures hit bourses After a morning recovery, a serious weakening in bond market sentiment hit bourses hard again in the afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff. In some cases, the bourses' problems were exacerbated by added volatility on the closure of futures and options contracts. FRANKFURT seemed to be negotiating its way through the DTB options minefield, the Dax index closing just 4.19 lower on the session at 2,050.72 and down 3.9 per cent on the week. But the closure process extended into the afternoon, when equities were hit by bond market weakness and a report of management changes at Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank denied the report that a board member, Mr Rolf Breuer, was to be relieved of his responsibility as head of securities trading. But, said Mr Nigel Longley at Commerzbank, the market was already edgy following the arrest of the managing director of Procedo, the factoring company, and the revelation of derivatives trading on a massive scale at Balsam, Procedo's biggest customer. Turnover soared on the DTB closures, from DM6.7bn to DM25.6bn. In the post bourse, Deutsche Bank fell to DM722.50 and the Ibis-indicated Dax to 2,031.80. A further drop on Monday would threaten the closing low of 2,020.33 for 1994. PARIS drifted at the end of a week which saw the CAC-40 index slide more than 4 per cent, in spite of further good news that economic recovery was on course. The index eased 6.86 to 1,935.95. The highlights of the session were Schneider and LVMH, both up against the trend after forecasting higher profits in 1994. Schneider rose FFr8.10 to FFr365 and LVMH FFr5 to FFr840. Rhone-Poulenc slipped FFr3 to FFr127, but dealers said that it was largely unaffected by news that it was to recall a batch of its antibiotic drug as a precaution after one of the bottles was tampered with. Eurotunnel suffered further as fears arose that it would fail to get its rights issue away, the shares finishing down FFr1.15 at FFr25.65. ZURICH, once again, saw a firm trend early in the day dispelled in the last hour. The SMI index fell 39.0 to 2,627.6 for a 4.9 per cent decline on the week. Banks, the hardest hit sector, remained under pressure. UBS bearers lost SFr25 to SFr1,115, for a fall over the week of 9.1 per cent. CS Holding bearers lost SFr17 to SFr533, off 10.1 per cent. Among the large blue chips, Nestle gave up SFr12 to SFr1,133 and Roche dropped SFr80 to SFr6,520. MILAN remained concerned about the outlook for interest rates and the constitutional court ruling on pensions that could cost the government up to L30,000bn. The Comit index finished 1.79 lower at 698.90, down 7.6 per cent on the week, amid rumours that the sharp fall in prices earlier in the week was the result of selling by domestic brokerages to cover the cost of losses in the bond markets. Fiat bucked the trend with a L56 rise to L6,256. Mondadori lost L720 to L15,660 but remained solidly over the L15,000 price set for the public offering and placement of 66m shares, which ended yesterday. MADRID was half a percentage point higher at midday but it closed with the general index down 3.52 at a new 1994 low of 307.79, down 5.4 per cent on the week. Utilities fared badly. Dealers said that there was a huge seller in Sevillana, down Pta32 at Pta638; and Iberdrola, which fell Pta29 to Pta936 was hit like Pryca, the retailer, by its high weighting in the Ibex, real time index. Futures and options dealers were selling baskets of Ibex stocks in the cash market as contracts expired. AMSTERDAM, too, had to endure the volatility of options expiry and the AEX index closed the day down 3.12 at a new 1994 low of 392.62, for a week's fall of 3.4 per cent. KPN, the partially privatised telecommunications and postal group, closed its first week of trading off 40 cents at Fl 49.30, 45 cents below its issue price. ISTANBUL continued to improve with a 4.7 per cent gain on the day and up 16 per cent on the week. The composite index rose 911.78 to 20,233.45, in spite of mid-session profit-taking. Turnover was TL1,26bn.

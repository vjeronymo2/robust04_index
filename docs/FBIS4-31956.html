			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item; By Stevan Cordas] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 16 (TANJUG) -- Massive arrival of  troops from Islamic countries to Bosnia-Herzegovina, where they  are joining the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  threatens to turn the U.N. "blue helmets" into "green" ones.  Around 1,500 Turkish, 3,000 Pakistani and 1,200 Bangladeshi  troops are expected to arrive in Bosnia next summer. When all  the planned troops have arrived, UNPROFOR will have soldiers  from as many as six Islamic states -- Turkey, Pakistan,  Malaysia, Egypt, Jordan and Bangladesh.    The current situation indicates that this may not be the  final figure becuase some other Islamic countries have showed  great interest in sending their own peacekeepers to Bosnia.  Those who know the situation in Bosnia claim that massive  arrival of troops from Islamic countries had been initiated by  Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic. He needs peacekeepers  from Islamic countries for two reasons. The first one is that  they would give him an additional military power under the  current conditions of the arms embargo. The other one is  connected with the attempt to Islamize Bosnia.    Izetbegovic's intentions are clear. Well-informed sources  believe he will try to use Islamic peacekeepers for  strengthening the influence of Islamic fundamentalism in the  Bosnian Moslem enclaves. Some analysts in the West claim that  most of the Moslem population in Bosnia is not inclined to  Islamic fundamentalism. Izetbegovic must therefore be backed by  a real power in his effort to `persuade' his own people that it  is necessary to accept Islamic fundamentalism.    So-called holy warriors from Islamic countries, who have  been  fighting alongside Bosnian Moslems since the beginning of the  civil war, have not had much success so far in helping  Izetbegovic implement that ideology. On the contrary, their  behaviour has turned many Bosnian Moslems against them.  Izetbegovic therefore needs `fresh forces' with the image of  peacekeepers and he has found such troops in Turkey, Pakistan,  Bangladesh, etc.    There is an impression that the world's most powerful  factors  involved in the the settling of the Bosnian conflict are  indiferently watching the arrival of troops from Islamic  countries to Bosnia. Such a stand can be understood only as yet  another in a series of expressions of support to the Bosnian  Moslem side since the beginning of the war. U.N.  Secretary-General Butros Butros-Ghali has found himself in an  awkward position because Western countries are not ready to send  fresh troops to Bosnia. On the contrary, the most powerful  countries are indicating the possibility of withdrawing their  peacekeepers.    On the other hand, Islamic countries have no problems in  financing their peacekeepers serving as part of UNPROFOR. Under  the circumstances, Butros-Ghali has no other option but to  accept what is offered. Consequences of such an attitude,  however, do not seem to be considered.</p>

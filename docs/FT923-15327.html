			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Reject Shop 15% lower at Pounds 652,000 Reject Shop, the furniture and houseware retailer, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 652,000 for the year to March 16 against Pounds 763,000 last time. Turnover was static at Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 20.4m) in spite of the recession and a fire bomb which damaged the company's Tottenham Court Road store in London last November. Earnings emerged at 4.47p (4.88p) and a same-again final dividend of 2.1p makes an unchanged 3.15p total.</p>

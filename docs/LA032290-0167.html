			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOTEL OCCUPANCY RATE DIPS TO ITS LOWEST POINT IN MORE THAN A DECADE;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: SLUMP IS ONE OF SEVERAL LACKLUSTER INDICATORS FOR SAN DIEGO TOURISM  RECORDED IN JANUARY.  </P> <P> The average occupancy rate of San Diego County hotels dipped to 53.7% in  January, the lowest level in more than a decade, as the local hospitality  market continues to feel the effects of a five-year boom in local hotel  construction.  </P> <P> The softening of the local hotel market was just one of the several lackluster  tourism indicators for January released Wednesday by the San Diego Convention  &amp; Visitors Bureau (ConVis). Total visitors to the area declined 1.1% from  the January 1989 total, visitors to the San Diego Zoo declined by 12.3% from  the previous January and traffic at the Cabrillo National Monument was down  nearly 20%.  </P> <P> Border crossings at San Ysidro and Otay Mesa were up only 0.2%, a reflection of  growing disenchantment by tourists with the long lines on both the U.S. and  Mexico sides of the border, ConVis vice president Al Reese said Wednesday. Air  passenger arrivals were up by 3.4% from January 1989, and visitor spending  increased by 3.5% from the previous year.  </P> <P> January's countywide hotel occupancy rate, down from the 57.2% average for  January 1989, was the lowest since ConVis began monitoring hotel occupancy in  1979, Reese said. "It's not a very cheery picture," he said.  </P> <P> The softening of the hotel market is a direct result of the addition of 11,000  hotel rooms, a 37% increase, to the countywide hotel room inventory since the  end of 1985, a boom that has lifted the county's room total to more than  40,000, ConVis research manager Lynn Mohrfeld said Wednesday.  </P> <P> One benefit of the local glut in hotel rooms is that the resulting competition  among hotel operators for guests has kept average daily room rates in the  $75-per-night range over the last two years, Mohrfeld said.  </P> <P> Downtown San Diego in particular has witnessed a spate of hotel building, and  downtown rooms tripled, from 2,500 in 1983 to 7,500 in 1989, Reese said. The  new construction has been spurred by the anticipated opening of the San Diego  Convention Center, which became fully operational in January.  </P> <P> But Ron Berger, General Manager of Marriott Suites-Symphony Towers, which  opened its doors in January, was pessimistic that the convention center can by  itself create enough added demand to cure the glut. That's because the  twin-tower, 1,365-room San Diego Marriott hotel next to the center can  accommodate about 75% of all convention visitors.  </P> <P> "There's not that much overflow for other hotels," Berger said, whose  all-suites hotel opened in January. "There are way too many hotel rooms for the  amount of business coming into the area."  </P> <P> Another discouraging statistic for local hoteliers was that hotel room nights  sold in all of January actually declined by 0.1% from the previous year,  despite the opening of the convention center, a sign that hotel room demand was  flat.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for both the zoo and for Sea World, which saw attendence drop 11.6%  in January from the same month the previous year, said six days of rain in  January was the primary reason that attendance fell.  </P> <P> HOTEL ROOMS  </P> <P> Total number of hotel rooms available in San Diego County at year's end.  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:2.55IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> YEAR  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> TOTAL ROOMS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1985  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 29,600  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 33,600  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 34,504  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 37,782  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 40,605  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 41,919 (Est.)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: The San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.  </P></p>

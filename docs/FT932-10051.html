			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Observer: Checkmates No wonder the Labour party wants to reform the House of Lords. Last week, John Smith, the party leader, had to sack Lord Desai from his job as opposition economic spokesman for speaking out of turn on the merits of extending VAT. Now Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, has had to squash another embarrassing initiative. Observer hears that his independently minded mates in the upper house had wanted to do a deal with the Tory rebels who oppose the government's leasehold reforms. In the hope of defeating ministers today during the final stages of the bill, Labour peers were intending not to vote, which would have given the Tory rebels a free run at the government. The Commons shadow environment minister had to point out to them that Labour itself is not in favour of restricting the rights of tenants as the landlords' lobby propose. Ministers are now hoping that the opposition's efforts at whipping its troops are rather more effective than their own.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNFAIR PROPERTY TAX BASE  </P> <P> John J. Curtis' column on Proposition 13 ("Equalize Property Taxes, and  California Can Put Humpty Together Again," Op-Ed Page, March 22) really struck  a chord. By taxing properties with the same market value at greatly disparate  levels, Proposition 13 rewards those able to buy before property values  skyrocketed and punishes latecomers. The young first-time buyer pays not only  his share of taxes, but that of the properties that have not changed hands.  </P> <P> Furthermore, Proposition 13 has provided a strong disincentive to sell, since  only those unlucky to be young and buying for the first time are willing to pay  the current reassessed tax levels. Such a disincentive artificially shrinks the  housing supply, thus driving prices even higher.  </P> <P> This scheme has allowed current property owners to pull the ladder up on my  generation. A young family today sees the staggering cost of owning a home  coupled with Proposition 13's "reassessed" property tax as a truly  insurmountable hurdle.  </P> <P> Up to this point, the young have been quiet. Many are still in school or live  at home; our interests in these matters have yet to be vested. But with each  passing day it becomes clearer and clearer that our profligate elders have  enjoyed 40 post-war years of good living and passed the bill to us.  </P> <P> Soon, we're not going to take it anymore.  </P> <P> JACK DAVIES  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

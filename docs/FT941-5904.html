			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Favourite tipped for barrage deal A joint venture between Balfour Beatty, part of BICC engineering group, and Costain is favourite to win the main construction contract for the Pounds 152m Cardiff barrage, one of Europe's biggest building projects. The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation is due to meet today to discuss the decision which is expected to be announced shortly. The value of the contract to the joint venture - 60 per cent Balfour Beatty and 40 per cent Costain - is thought to be worth more than Pounds 100m. The barrage is designed to rejuvenate the derelict docklands area of south Cardiff and control the tidal waters of the Taff and Ely estuaries, creating a 500-acre lake. Supporters claim it will attract investment of about Pounds 2.5bn and create over 20,000 jobs. The project has been opposed on environmental grounds because it would flood a 165-hectare freshwater wetland bird habitat. The scheme was approved by parliament in the autumn after five years' scrutiny, after ministers cut short the last stage of debate on legislation with a 'guillotine' timetable. The project has attracted bids from UK and continental European construction companies. These include tenders from Balfour Beatty and Costain; Laing; Tarmac; Bouygues of France; and joint ventures of Kier and Christiani; Nielson and Hochtief of Germany; Trafalgar House and Ballast Nedam; and Taylor Woodrow and Sir Robert McAlpine. Preparatory work on the site has started and the main construction is expected to begin shortly. The corporation hopes that the work will be completed within four years. The awarding of the contract will have to be approved by the Welsh Office. The corporation says the barrage should act as a catalyst for the regeneration of 2,700 acres of derelict docklands. It is expected to pave the way for other large construction projects in the area. The corporation says the barrage could encourage up to Pounds 1.2bn of private-sector investment, 4.7m sq ft of business space and 23,000 jobs. Without the barrage, it says, these figures would be halved.</p>

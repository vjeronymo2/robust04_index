			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Top quality wines to savour - Jancis Robinson goes upmarket for her seasonal wine-buying spree For the last four years, with a conscientious nod to the recession, this pre-Christmas wine buying column has concentrated on inexpensive chainstore wines. This year things are looking up. If FT readers cannot afford to splash out a little on a special bottle or two for the holiday season, who can? And when it comes to wines selling above Pounds 6 or so a bottle, the best independent wine merchants have much more to offer than most supermarkets and high street chains. The most reliable guide to finding the best independent wine merchants all over the UK is the (almost) annual Which? Wine Guide. The 1995 edition is just out, published at Pounds 13.99 by the Consumers Association under the editorship of Harry Eyres, one of our more fastidious wine writers. He chooses as independent wine merchant of the year Lea &amp; Sandeman, of London SW10 and W8 - a slightly Sloaney firm of which I am also a great admirer. A good measure of an independent wine merchant is how it buys. Deduct 10 points for those who simply ring around the wholesale importers; add 15 for those who, like Charles Lea, take the trouble to scout around the byways of the world's wine regions in search of exclusive little trouvailles. Actually Lea &amp; Sandeman's prowls are pretty much confined to France and Italy. They have some clever choices from the New World but limit themselves to two very un-Australian Australian Chardonnays. Their strength is in the wine world's classics (of which they have a constantly changing stock), characterful bargains from southern France, Valdespino's connoisseur sherries, and evidence of the Italian wine revolution that is shamefully rare in Britain. Wine merchant of the year, so far as this year's WINE Magazine International Challenge was concerned was, yet again, Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk, surely Britain's most confidently innovative wine merchant. This much larger outfit, run with flair by Simon Loftus, can afford many more passions than L &amp; S - indeed the annual game with its instructive and attractive list is to spot this year's weakness or two rather than a particular strength. The May list is supplemented throughout the year with a series of pamphlet enthusiasms which have recently included Australia, Austria, Alsace and, evidence that their approach is non-alphabetical, the Southern Rhone. Lea &amp; Sandeman's shop prices per bottle tend to be about 10 per cent higher than Adnams', but then premises in London tend to be rather more expensive than in Suffolk market towns, even charming old Southwold. Mail order prices from the two merchants (those quoted below) are much the same, with delivery free for those spending more than 150 with L &amp; S, and for those buying at least 24 (assorted) bottles from Adnams. Adnams is a member of The Bunch group of wine merchants (together with John Armit of London W11, Corney &amp; Barrow of London EC1, Lay &amp; Wheeler, Laytons of London NW1, Tanners, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire and Yapp Bros, of Mere, Wiltshire) which is doing its best to instill confidence in the independent wine trade. Below are some representative examples (whites before reds in ascending price order) of the exciting wines currently listed by these wine merchants  -each demonstrating the sort of individuality that is all too rare on the shelves of the chains and supermarkets. Oddbins is the exception to this rule, continuing to offer wine drinkers evidence that it is on the cutting edge of the wine world. Some of its best buys this winter are therefore also included below. But for really personal service, you could do very much worse than track down your nearest independent wine merchant, who is probably motivated chiefly by his or her product and a giant helping of enthusiasm. LEA &amp; SANDEMAN, 301 Fulham Road, London SW10 (071- 376 4767) &amp; 211 Kensington Church Street, London W8 (071- 221 1982). Domaine de Joy Cuvee Speciale 1992, Pounds 5.87. Oak-aged tangy dry white made mainly from Manseng grapes (of Jurancon fame). Long, lively and so much easier to drink without food than Chardonnay. Monbazillac 1990 Domaine de l'Ancienne Cure, Pounds 8.95. Most wine merchants worth their salt have gone scouting for a Monbazillac from this first class sweet white vintage. This one might need a little more acid for long term development but is just the luscious thing for drinking this winter. Chablis Premier Cru Beauroy 1992 Tribut-Dauvissat, Pounds 13.33. Fine, sleek, classic Chablis with terroir in spades. Its assertive acidity should revive jaded palates. Cuvee Pierre Audonnet 1993 Domaine Piquemal, Pounds 4.58. A frank, glossy Merlot-based vin de pays from Roussillon that would make a delightful house red. Les Dolomies Coteaux du Languedoc 1993, Pounds 5.58. Seductively scented Syrah from the Garrigue. Full, rich and flattering. Cabernet Sauvignon Olimpo 1992, Pounds 5.98. The bottle alone looks worth double the price. Aromatic cold turkey red. Domaine du Deffends Clos de la Truffiere 1990 Coteaux Varois, Pounds 7.34. A great find. Handsome Provencal blend of concentrated Cabernet and Syrah that should please and impress a wide range of palates. A particularly stylish magnum (Pounds 16.95 each) would make a delicious present. Ch Le Grand Bourdieu 1990 Graves, Pounds 7.34. Appetising, crisp, classic Graves with lots of fruit and chew. Vino Nobile di Montepulciano Riserva 1990 Dei, Pounds 9.40. Lots of punch and vigour; a good Boxing Day restorative. Savigny les Beaune Les Lavieres 1989 Domaine Chandon de Briailles, Pounds 11.95. House wine of Moet &amp;, this soft red burgundy would make a perfect accompaniment for turkey et al with gorgeous Pinot Noir fruit and nice, appetising zip. Cote-Rotie 1991 Domaine Clusel-Roch, Pounds 15.86. Top quality northern Rhone red made by talented team whose sophisticated winemaking delivers a plummy, rich wine that can already delight but will be better still at the turn of the century. Camartina 1990 Querciabella, Pounds 17.62. Sumptuous blend of Cabernet and Sangiovese. Scented, well balanced and already approachable (although better cellared for three or four years). ADNAMS, The Crown, Southwold, Suffolk (0502-724222). Pinot Blanc Rosenbourg 1992 P Blanck, Pounds 6.15. Really rather serious for this useful, keenly-priced appellation. A good house aperitif for connoisseurs while the rest of the household might appreciate the more obvious charms of the Pfaffenheim 1993 Pinot Blanc at Pounds 4.95. Dr Loosen Riesling 1992, Pounds 6.20. First-class aperitif. Dryish, refreshing yet scented. Thresher with all their buying power charge Pounds 5.99, without delivery. Scheurebe Kabinett Trocken 1993 Lingenfelder, Pounds 9.75. The modern face of German wine - a dry white with lashings of flavour and concentration. Albarino Morgadio 1992, Pounds 10.75. Galicia's finest - a fine dry white palate sharpener from Atlantic-cooled Spain. Le Marigny Vouvray Moelleux 1990, Pounds 14.75. Great honeyed mouthfuls for the end of the meal without any heady or excess of alcohol or sickly lack of acidity. Puligny-Montrachet Clavoillon 1992 Domaine Leflaive, Pounds 25.50. A treat. A relatively early maturing white burgundy from Puligny's best address. Lirac, Les Queyrades 1990 Andre Mejan, Pounds 5.95. Full, powerful, licorice-scented mouthful of southern warmth. M Shiraz/Pinot Noir 1992 Victoria, Pounds 6.20. A blend of Rhone and Burgundy red grape varieties overtly traditional in Australia, a more clandestine marrage of convenience in old-fashioned burgundy, is surprisingly successful. Slightly jammy but fruit in all the right places and ready to drink now. Domaine du Grand Cres 1991 Corbieres, Pounds 6.45. Wild southern French wine made by an ex-Domaine de la Romanee-Conti perfectionist from a high, isolated, beautiful vineyard. Sablet 1993 Ch de Trignon, Pounds 6.75. Lively Cotes du Rhone. Villages red that should continue to improve over the next two years but could be order from Adnams' current Rhone offer in time for Christmas drinking. Vacqueyras 1990 Cuvee Les Templiers, Pounds 6.95. Amazingly deep colour and very, very deep flavours. Lots of Syrah grapes in this blend which still has considerable life in it. Probably the best bargain of these three Rhones from Adnams. Dry Country Grenache 1992 Rockford, Pounds 7.20. Non-irrigated yet juicy Barossa version of Chateauneuf-du-Pape. Lady Langoa 1990 St Julien, Pounds 9.75. Second wine of second growth bordeaux Ch Leoville-Barton, consistently reliable and under-priced. Joseph Cabernet/Merlot 1992 Moda Amarone, Grilli, Pounds 12.55. South Australia meets north east Italy in this impressively balanced red concentrated by drying the grapes before fermentation. Vibrant, lively, beautifully constructed. ODDBINS Nearly 200 shops around the country which try to offer the full range via well-educated staff. There are also Fine Wine Shops in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Oxford and Cambridge which sell smaller parcels of fine wines, notably the gorgeous Moss Wood Chardonnay at Pounds 10.99. Reuilly 1993 Aujard Mabillot, Pounds 5.99. Very convincingly fruity Sauvignon from this close relative to Sancerre. (Buy the Menetou Salon Cuvee Vanessa for Pounds 1 more if appropriate, or the Chilean Santa Isabel Sauvignon 1994 for a rather fruitier style.) Various north American Chardonnays Pounds 5.99 - Pounds 12.99 Some real substance here, even in the Rex Hill and Sterling versions at the bottom end of this price bracket. At the top Newton and Landmark Damaris can also offer gloss and some prospect of further development. St Veran 1993, Domaine des Deux Roches, Pounds 6.49. Not a Macon trying to taste like a Cote d'or wine but an utterly satisfying rendition of this useful appellation, ultra-ripe for enjoying this winter. Late Harvest Botrytis Semillons 1992, Pounds 7.49 and Pounds 6.99 a half, from McWilliams and Yalumba. Great rich sweet wines. Just the thing to make a meal memorable. Pity that now that the EU will allow these 'stickies' in, Australian growers have lost patience with producing them. Buy in quantity, especially the rather more concentrated Yalumba version. Various 1993 Alsace whites, Domaine Weinbach, Pounds 6.99 - Pounds 15.99. These Faller wines are a dream - very rich and powerful, even the Sylvaner. Both the Gewurztraminer Reserve and the Riesling Ste Catherine are sublime (Pounds 10.99 and Pounds 15.99 respectively). The less expensive Sylvaner and Pinot Blanc would make great aperitifs. Chablis Premier Cru Montee de Tonnerre 1992 Louis Michel, Pounds 11.99. Lively, pure, very slightly lean. Just the ticket for mornings, or evenings, after - and a very good price. Condrieu 1993 Cuilleron, Pounds 19.99. Not cheap but a taste thrill for most who encounter this extremely well made old-vine version of fashionable Viognier in its home town. Ch-Grillet lookalike bottle. Peter Lehmann Vine Vale Shiraz 1992, Pounds 3.99. Very silly price for a wine with this much bang. Great value for enthusiasts of Barossa's chocolate-thick reds. Havenscourt Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon, Pounds 4.99 each. California is awash with well-made wine available in bulk (no-one wants to sully their carefully cultivated winery name with cheap estate-bottled stuff). Typical of Oddbins to create its own label to take advantage of this phenomenon. Best value by far are these two reds, the Pinot Noir having a bit of age and richness to it, the Cabernet being a mouthful of very frank, lively fruit. Peter Lehmann Clancy's 1992, Pounds 6.49. A Barossa Valley blended red with an element of sophistication. Chateau Reynella Basket Press Cabernet/Merlot and Shiraz 1992 Pounds 6.49 each. Terrible labels but great value for extremely traditionally made wines from McClaren Vale. A brace of exciting, old-fashioned, thoroughly full-bodied reds. Sterling St Dunstans Reserve 1991, Pounds 6.99. Bargain price for a mineral-scented Cabernet blend from one of the Napa Valley's pioneer wineries (not coincidentally owned, like Oddbins, by Seagram). St-Joseph Vieilles Vignes 1992 Cuilleron, Pounds 10.99. Scented, full, very sleek and modern. Ready to beguile already. Not a rough edge in sight. Bourgogne Hautes Cotes de Beaunes 1992, Jayer-Gilles Pounds 11.99. Scented Pinot Noir fruit with good, serious concentration. Just the thing for turkey.</p>

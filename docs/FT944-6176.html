			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Concession to smaller funds on distribution - Offshore Two changes to the offshore funds legislation are planned so that the legislation will no longer apply to entities that are not 'collective investment schemes' as defined in the Financial Services Act, and funds with low gross income will not need to incur the administrative cost of distributing it to satisfy the 'distribution test'. The first of the two measures will apply as from today and the second for account periods of funds ending on or after today. Under the first of the chancellor's changes, entities that are not collective investment schemes within the definition in the Financial Services Act 1986 would be removed entirely from the scope of the offshore funds legislation. This is intended to apply to certain types of commercial structures used by international groups, which are not created as vehicles for rolling-up income but may technically be offshore funds as the legislation now stands. (Other offshore funds which are collective investment schemes will not be affected by this change.) Under the second proposal, funds seeking Inland Revenue certification as 'distributor' funds will be treated as having met the distribution test where the gross income in a year is very low - and where the cost of distributing that income to investors would be disproportionate. At present this relaxation is only available where annual income is nil. It is proposed that the de minimis limit will be set at 1 per cent of the average value of the fund's assets.</p>

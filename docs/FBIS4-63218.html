			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- The first session of the joint  intergovernmental Russian-South Korean economic, scientific and  technical commission session, planned to open in Seoul on  Thursday, has been put off, but can be held sometime later in  Moscow, high-ranking sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry  told ITAR-TASS.    According to the sources, head of the Russian delegation,  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economics Aleksandr  Shokhin "due to purely internal circumstances" cannot undertake  the trip to Seoul on the aforesaid dates. An appropriate  explanation has been conveyed to the South Korean Foreign  Ministry. At the same time, a suggestion has been made to hold  the session in Moscow before the forthcoming June 1 to 4 visit  to Moscow by South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, especially as  a number of important problems of economic cooperation between  the two states are expected to be discussed at the session on  the eve of the high level visit.    "We are now waiting for a response to this proposal," the  high-ranking Russian diplomat, who wished to remain  unidentified, said. He emphasised that the Russian side is  deeply interested in holding the commission's session and  attaches great significance to it.    In turn, sources in the Russian Government told ITAR-TASS  that Aleksandr Shokhin could not fly to Seoul, as he has been  charged with "very important tasks" by Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin. The possibility of replacing Aleksandr Shokhin by  another Vice-Prime Minister Viktor Yarov at the session was also  considered. But later it was decided that since Aleksandr  Shokhin has a better understanding of the range of problems, it  will be "illogical to replace him by another person at the last  moment."    The informed government sources noted that Aleksandr Shokhin  is "fully involved" in making preparations for the visit to  Moscow by Kim Yong-sam. For the time being, planned for the  next week visit to Beijing by Shokhin remains in force which is  to take place directly before the beginning of Viktor  Chernomyrdin's official visit to Beijing from May 26 to 29.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS TONIGHT  </P> <P> Opponent -- Dallas Mavericks.  </P> <P> Site -- at Forum.  </P> <P> Time -- 7:30.  </P> <P> TV -- Prime Ticket.  </P> <P> Radio -- KLAC (570).  </P> <P> Records -- Lakers 4-1; Mavericks 1-3.  </P> <P> Record vs. Mavericks -- 1-0.  </P> <P> Laker update -- James Worthy played 44 of the 48 minutes with a sprained right  ankle in Friday night's six-point victory over the Charlotte Hornets, so it is  understandable that the Laker forward was held out of practice Saturday. Coach  Pat Riley, however, said Worthy is expected to play tonight. Better medical  news is that Byron Scott was able to play 38 and 36 minutes in back-to-back  games and not report any discomfort in his left hamstring. The Lakers are  shooting 44.1% and averaging 104.6 points per game, 10.1 fewer than last  season. However, the Lakers hold a 249-223 rebounding advantage through five  games.  </P> <P> Maverick update -- Dallas figures to give the Lakers problems because of the  disparity in height. The Mavericks start 7-foot-1 James Donaldson at center,  7-foot Roy Tarpley at power forward and bring 6-9 Sam Perkins and 6-11 Herb  Williams off the bench. But height did not win out in the season opener, when  the Lakers defeated (and outrebounded) the Mavericks, 102-94, at Dallas.  Through four games -- three losses and a victory over the Clippers -- guard  Rolando Blackman has been the leading scorer with a 19.3 average, followed by  Adrian Dantley's 18.8 average. Tarpley is averaging 16.8 rebounds and 16.8  points.  </P></p>

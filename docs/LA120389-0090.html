			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOBILIZING AMERICA FOR THE COMING AGE OF PEACE;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: IF WE ARE TO BREAK OUR MILITARY SPENDING HABIT, WE MUST HELP DEFENSE  WORKERS TO MAKE THE TRANSITION.  </P> <P> The times, as Bob Dylan once sang, they are a-changin'. Walls are tumbling down  in Germany. Fences are coming down in Czechoslovakia. The people of the Soviet  Bloc are demanding democracy. Elections are happening in Namibia, and mass  rallies are taking place in South Africa. The leaders of the United States and  the Soviet Union are meeting in a new spirit.  </P> <P> What does this new spirit mean for the United States?  </P> <P> First, it means that we can reduce war tensions and bring down the federal  budget deficit, much of which was caused by runaway military spending. The  $286-billion military budget signed by President Bush last week is a relic from  another era. America's leaders must face the reality that we can no longer  afford extravagant spending on weapons we don't need for wars that will never  be fought against enemies that don't exist.  </P> <P> It also means that we can finally begin to reinvest in America by moving from  preparation for war to preparation for peace and justice. We must prepare now  for economic conversion, the transformation of military-related industry into  productive civilian enterprise. The prophet Isaiah told us to beat our swords  into plowshares and our spears into pruning hooks. The weapons of war must be  made into instruments of peace.  </P> <P> As the Cold War thaws and the Warsaw Pact rapidly dissolves, as NATO forces in  Europe -- including 305,000 U.S. men and women in uniform there -- look  increasingly unnecessary and obsolete, it is incumbent on us to plan an orderly  transition for our military-based economy. We must convert our moral vison and  social priorities.  </P> <P> From 1981 through 1988, as military spending nearly doubled, spending on  education, employment training, housing and community development, urban mass  transit, public health and community block grants was cut by close to $60  billion.  </P> <P> It is now time to reverse this drain of budget resources from the human  economy. Bridges are falling down; teachers need raises; the environment needs  attention; masses of homeless wander the streets; victims of AIDS seek  treatment and help, and the drug crisis threatens to overrun our communities.  </P> <P> For the $100-billion cost of the Trident II submarine and F-18 jet fighter  programs, we could clean up the 10,000 worst toxic waste dumps in America.  </P> <P> For the cost of six months of outlays for nuclear warheads, roughly $4 billion,  we could fund twice over the child-care bill recently put on hold by Congress.  Such a shift in funds would bring real hope to working mothers and enable many  people to get off welfare.  </P> <P> For the cost of the Stealth bomber program, $68 billion, we could fund a  national health insurance program. With 40 million Americans lacking basic  health coverage, don't we need a national health plan more than a national  Stealth plan?  </P> <P> The major obstacle to the civilian conversion plan we need is our habit of  reliance on military spending. All told, according to the National Commission  for Economic Conversion and Disarmament, more than 20 million Americans are  dependent on the military economy for survival.  </P> <P> These Americans should not be threatened by the outbreak of peace, freedom and  justice. On the contrary, we must harness the genius of our scientists, the  creativity of our engineers, the courage of our soldiers and the service  instinct of our armed forces to plan for peaceful reconstruction of our nation.  </P> <P> Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) has introduced a bill, the Defense Economic Adjustment  Act, that would make the federal government responsible for supporting economic  conversion planning in the defense sector and helping those communities  "substantially and seriously affected" by defense cuts to make the transition.  </P> <P> The legislation, moreover, would establish "alternative use" committees at  every defense facility employing at least 100 people. These committees of  management and labor would develop detailed plans for converting the facility  to productive civilian use and re-employing the work force within two years of  losing a defense contract or military base. Also, the bill would make displaced  workers eligible for retraining and displacement benefits for up to two years.  </P> <P> The Weiss bill is moving in precisely the right direction. The transition to a  labor-intensive peace economy will not be easy after so many years of relying  on capital-intensive military spending. But the needs of our people are great,  and weapons production does nothing to address them. We must become as serious  about mobilizing the American people for the coming age of peace and justice as  we were about mobilizing ourselves for war and violence.  </P></p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Banks set for court fight over councils' swap deals EIGHTY banks facing losses of Pounds 550m over interest rate swap agreements with 130 UK local authorities are set to pursue their claims in court after a government decision yesterday not to intervene. The government resisted pressure from banks, the City, and the Bank of England to overturn a House of Lords ruling earlier this year that the swap agreements entered into by the councils were illegal. The swaps involved councils exchanging their interest obligations, normally from fixed to floating rate, in the expectation that rates would fall. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, said in a written Commons answer yesterday that the government would not 'seek to alter existing legal obligations'. The banks could recover around Pounds 125m through restitution actions to retrieve sums paid to the councils. Separately, they can reclaim corporation tax of 35 per cent on the losses. Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, referring to the decision yesterday, said that 'all courses were very unattractive on the grounds of both principle and practice'. The government had considered retrospective validation of the contracts and mandatory restitution. The decision not to legislate was seen as 'the least unattractive of the solutions open to us'. So far, 12 banks have issued 69 writs against 32 local authorities, according to Ms Irene Dorner, head of the banks' steering committee dealing with the swaps issue. But many have yet to be served, as banks had been hoping that the existing situation would not be allowed to stand. Ms Dorner said the number of cases actually likely to go to court would be 'very unpredictable, but potentially very large'. However, she added that out-of-court settlement 'must be a more sensible approach'. Mr Cliff Nicholson, deputy controller of the Audit Commission, which brought the original test case against Hammersmith and Fulham council, agreed it was time for the banks and councils to 'do deals. There has been enough litigation'. So far, two cases have been settled out of court: Ogwr Borough Council in South Wales paid Citicorp Investment Bank more than Pounds 1m, and Hammersmith and Fulham settled with one of the banks involved. The Bank of England, which had backed the banks' case for action, was disappointed but appreciated that the government faced a difficult decision. Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the British Bankers Association, described the decision as 'very regrettable'. He added that the decision would cause 'great long-term damage to London's standing in the international financial markets.' Banks still impaled on the town hall railings Page 8</p>

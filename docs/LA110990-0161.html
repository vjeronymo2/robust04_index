			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INGRAM SEES AUSTRALIAN INTEREST AS FOOTING IN PACIFIC RIM MARKET  </P> <P> Hoping to gain a strong foothold in the fast-growing Pacific Rim computer  market, Ingram Micro D said Thursday that it has tentatively agreed to buy a  33% interest in a large Australian computer distributor.  </P> <P> Ingram Micro D, the nation's largest independent distributor of personal  computer products, said it will pay $2.4 million for a one-third interest in  Imagineering Technology Ltd. of Sidney, Australia. Under terms of the deal, the  Santa Ana company also would provide $9.4 million in capital to the Australian  firm, said Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy, Ingram Micro D's chairman and chief  executive.  </P> <P> Lacy said the deal would fulfill a key company goal to establish itself as a  major overseas supplier of computer products and gain a strong presence in the  Far East.  </P> <P> "Our strategy is to have three worldwide markets in North America, Europe and  the Pacific Rim," Lacy said. "We also like having a partner that knows Asia. If  you consider Imagineering as part of our group, then we'll be larger in  international sales than any other distributor."  </P> <P> Ingram Micro D posted sales of $367 million for the third quarter ended Sept.  30, and it expects to report annual sales $1.45 billion. The privately held  company does not report earnings.  </P> <P> Ingram Micro D's partner in the deal is First Pacific Co. Ltd, a diversified  Hong Kong company with real estate, banking and telecommunications interests.  First Pacific, which currently owns 42% of Imagineering, would invest $17.9  million in capital and increase its stake to 67% if the deal goes through.  </P> <P> Together, Ingram Micro D and First Pacific will offer 47 cents a share to  shareholders who hold the 58% of Imagineering stock not owned by First Pacific.  That represents a hefty premium over Imagineering's current trading price of 21  cents a share,  </P> <P> The deal is subject to several conditions, including Australian government  approvals, the renegotiation of Imagineering's current loans, and a due  diligence review by Ingram Micro D, Lacy said. The deal is expected to close  between Feb. 15 and March 1 next year.  </P> <P> Under the agreement with First Pacific, Ingram Micro D has the option of  increasing its stake in Imagineering to up to 49% between 1993 and 1995.  </P> <P> The Australian firm distributes computer products in the Pacific Rim, including  Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines  and Indonesia. It expects to report sales of $202 million this year.  </P></p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Eleco benefits from restructure Eleco Holdings, the Hertfordshire-based building products and specialist contracting group, returned to the black at the interim stage as its restructuring programme began to bear fruit. On turnover of Pounds 27m (Pounds 23.6m), including a contribution of Pounds 45,000 (Pounds 828,000) from discontinued activities, profits before tax for the half year to December 31 emerged at Pounds 139,000 (losses of Pounds 2.21m). Mr Field Walton, chairman, stressed that although some group businesses had made good progress, particularly in the specialist products division, others continued to encounter difficulties. An improved showing from distribution and construction activities, currently operating in 'highly competitive' markets, would only be achieved following continuation of rationalisation programmes, Mr Walton said. Borrowings stood at Pounds 8.9m at the period end, down from Pounds 11.9m at June 30. Proceeds from disposals following the continuing withdrawal from property development would be used to further reduce debt. Earnings per share were 0.4p, against losses last time of 7.5p. There is again no interim dividend, but a decision on a final will be made 'in light of the full-year results and the continuing trading outlook'. The last distribution was a final of 1p in 1992.</p>

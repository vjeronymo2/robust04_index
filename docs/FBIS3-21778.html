			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kenneth Ahlborn: "Drug Seizure Reflects Trends; </F> Definite Downward Trend in Hashish"]    [Text] There is a definite downward trend in marijuana, but  an equally pronounced upswing in heroin and in drugs that  stimulate the central nervous system.    "Our statistics on drug seizures over the last five or six  years reflect attitudes and trends. Hashish is no longer the  right stuff; people want to be pepped up in order to perform  their jobs, go to a disco, or do bodybuilding," said Thord  Ohrstrom, chief of the division for criminal investigations at  Sweden's national police headquarters.    Sociologists and criminologists often feel that police and  customs drug seizures, expressed in terms of kilos and the  number of hits, do not adequately indicate the extent of abuse.  Rather, they measure the effectiveness of the smugglers with  respect to the authorities in a given year.  <H5>  According to Statistics </H5>   "It is, if nothing else, the only statistic with a basis in  reality that is available to us. If the rate of seizures for a  particular drug is obviously increasing from year to year  despite the fact no additional measures have been taken from our  side, as is the case for amphetamines and heroin in the last  five years, it means that there is a lot of that drug on the  market. Clearly it would not be found if there were no customers  for it," said Orhstrom.    The percentage of drugs that is actually seized by customs  and the police is another point of contention between the police  and researchers. Ohrstrom believes that he can make a qualified  guess by comparing the statistics from the UNO [Report on the  Demographics of Drug Abuse] in the 1980's with statistics on  drug seizures.  <H5>  Careful Investigation </H5>   "The UNO investigation was a thorough and careful  investigation of the number of drug abusers in Sweden and the  amount of drugs they consumed. Our statistics on seizures add up  to approximately 8 percent of the yearly total calculated by  UNO. It varies a little from drug to drug, of course. It is  easier to intercept marijuana than cocaine."    The 8 percent estimated for 1993 suggests a very sizable  mountain of drugs in Sweden--5 tons of marijuana, 200 kilos of  heroin, a ton or more of amphetamines, 100 kilos of cocaine, and  lesser amounts of LSD, opium, and morphine. Sold on the streets  by the gram, this would have a total value of 1.5 billion kronor.  <H5>  Black Market Infrastructure </H5>   The total annual European consumption, piled up in one  place,  is almost impossible to imagine. To smuggle this amount back and  forth across Europe, while many billions of dollars change hands  in 100,000 individual transactions, presupposes a very  smooth-functioning infrastructure.    "It is very striking how stable drug prices are. A 0.2 gram  capsule of heroin, which has long been the standard packaging,  costs exactly the same now--500 kronor--as it did in 1975. Other  drugs have not increased in price or have increased very little  in several decades. It is as though the market did not permit  prices to rise."  <H5>  Strong Competition </H5>   Presumably this has something to do with the strong  competition in Sweden.    "If someone attempts to raise the price, the customer goes  to  the next seller. A Mr. X, who can control these transactions,  cannot be found and has never been found, not even in the heroin  trade. The Swedish drug trade consists of many small chains and  none of them predominate," said Ohrstrom.    The four drugs: cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines  have for many years been the major ones in Sweden.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Doboj, April 14 (TANJUG)--Bosnian Moslem forces on  Thursday twice shelled the Serb-controlled town of Doboj in  north-eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. About twenty shells hit the  town in this former Yugoslav republic but there have been no  reports about possible casualties.    In the meantime, Moslem-controlled radio of the autonomous  province of western Bosnia reported that eight soldiers of the  Fifth Corps loyal to the Sarajevo authorities had been killed  and 15 wounded during heavy inter-Moslem clashes in the Cazinska  Krajina region in western Bosnia on Thursday morning.    The source also said that three soldiers of the autonomous  province had been killed.    Fierce attacks, supported by artillery fire, launched  against  positions of units loyal to Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic  continued in the area of Velika Kladusa and Cazin on Thursday  afternoon, Moslem Radio-Sarajevo reported. Two people were  killed and 25 wounded in the attacks according to the same  source.    Autonomous province of western Bosnia forces are destroying  everything in their way with multi-barrelled missile launchers  Osa and Zolja, Radio Sarajevo said. The autonomous province was  proclaimed last year by Moslems--followers of Fikret Abdic, who  oppose Izetbegovic's war-mongering policy.    The command in Sarajevo admitted that about 500 troops had  been killed and more than 2,000 wounded during the eight months  of inter- Moslem clashes. The provincial army announces a  counter-offensive to liberate Cazin, which is held by  Izetbegovic's loyalist.</p>

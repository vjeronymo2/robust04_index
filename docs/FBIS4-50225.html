The province has introduced high-quality species of oriental  cherries, apples and pears from Japan to six counties.    Shanxi is also popularizing Israeli advanced  cotton-cultivation technology on 2,000 hectares of farmland in  Yongji county near the yellow river.    France's fine-bred goats are now being raised in the  province.    The province has invested 116 million yuan including 12  million U.S. dollars in loans from the UN Food Program to  undertake a water conservancy program in the area of the Luliang  mountains. The project will benefit 31 townships and 248,000  people.    The International Agricultural Development Fund has invested  about 63.46 million yuan in a comprehensive agricultural  development program in five counties.

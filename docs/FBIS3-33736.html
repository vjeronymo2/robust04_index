The PLO chairman  told a British diplomat the gap between the sides is wide and  outside intervention is required to bridge it.    The Egyptian foreign minister will meet 'Arafat after the  latter arrives in Davos this afternoon, and later he will hold  another meeting with Peres. Mr. Peres expects a tough meeting  with 'Arafat, perhaps the toughest so far at this stage of the  talks.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1300 GMT on 29 January  reports that "Musa told Israel radio that he intends to mediate  between Israel and the Palestinians prior to the Peres-'Arafat  meeting tonight. The 'Arafat-Peres meeting is due to begin at  2100, at first alone and then later with the heads of the two  delegations.]</p>

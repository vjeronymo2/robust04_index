			<p>in   1994   <F P=102> 94WS0287A Paris 01 INFORMATIQUE in French 18 Mar 94 p 5--FOR  OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94WS0287A </F> <F P=104>  Paris 01 INFORMATIQUE </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by VR and DG: "Bull Posts 5 Billion Francs in </F> Losses"]    [Text] How is Bull supposed to attract new shareholders  when it has posted losses totaling 20 billion French francs [Fr]  since 1989? This is the basic problem with which the computer  builder has been wrestling ever since the privatization decree  was signed. What the company needs to demonstrate more than  anything else is stability, but just recently it has closed out  the 1993 accounting year with net losses of Fr5.07 billion  (including Fr1.65 billion in provisions for restructuring) on  turnover that had dropped 6.4 percent to Fr28.25 billion.  Although the minister for industry has discussed the French  company with NEC, the Japanese manufacturer's response has been  cautious. One of its spokespersons said on Wednesday that Bull  had not presented any specific offer. NEC also prefers to  refrain from comment on the interest that was expressed (in LA  TRIBUNE) by Peter Bonfield, CEO of ICL (whose principal  shareholder is Fujitsu), in Bull's systems integration and  facilities management divisions.    In addition to other steps taken by management to put the  company back into the black, Bull is banking heavily on Pegasus,  which Armand Malka, director of Bull's Unix division, describes  as "a major project." This new Unix multiprocessor, based on the  PowerPC 601 and scheduled to go on the market in early June,  should quickly boost the builder's profit margins. Made possible  by an accord reached in early 1992 with IBM but designed almost  entirely by Bull, Pegasus represents the company's biggest  R&amp;D  project. Absorbing close to Fr600 million per year (or 25  percent of the total R&amp;D budget), it also provides jobs to  250  people involved in the project--on the hardware side, at the  research centers in Pregnana, Italy; and on the software side,  for design of the future AIX 4.1 operating system, at the  Echirolles center near Grenoble. Bull hopes to develop a chain  of OEM [original equipment manufacturer] resellers, principally  American firms, to sell these computers built in Angers. "With  Pegasus, we are finally going to be able to met 80 percent of  the needs," explains Armand Malka. Bull is still counting on the  next-generation PowerPC 604 and 620 to satisfy needs in the  high-end market.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Rita Naseniece: "Haritonovs and the Oil </F> Business"]    [Excerpts] On 8 June the policemen from the 6th Division  of the Police Department arrested three employees of the joint  stock company TESS Petroleum (I do not mention their names on  the investigator's request). The grounds for the arrest were  documents found by the police after the arrest of Haritonovs,  during a search that caused such discontent on the part of his  lawyer.    The documents were discovered at various companies -- TESS  AB, TESS Petroleum, Brih, ABB, and Amstrig. The investigation  group is in possession of documents that prove that the company  TESS Petroleum (which is a hundred percent Swedish TESS  Petroleum's subsidiary in Latvia) has participated in illegal  deals connected with the purchase and delivery of oil and oil  products to Latvia. The essence of the deal was: the oil  products were bought in Russia at cost, then sent supposedly to  Kaliningrad, but in reality sold in Latvia, without paying  customs duties. The geographic area of the illegal operations  of the "oil syndicate" was rather large -- it included Estonia,  Sweden, Finland, Russia (including the Kaliningrad region), and,  of course, Latvia.    As the Police Department inspectors reported, the police now  has documents proving the participation of 19 Russian  oil-processing enterprises in the chain of deals. Among them,  there are such gigantic oil-industry plants as Grozniy,  Volgograd, and Jaroslavl oil refineries. The bosses of these  plants, taking advantage of their position, sold the oil to TESS  Petroleum at cost, instead of at world prices as should have  been done when selling oil to Latvia. According to the documents  in possession by the police, the amount TESS Petroleum has paid  for the oil products supplied from Russia amounts to $28,603,176  (in Russian currency, the sum is 22,882,541 Russian rubles).  [passage omitted]    The deliveries were addressed to a recipient in Russia --  usually a company in the Kalinigrad Oblast, which as a rule  refused to accept them. This way, the deliveries found their way  to Latvia.    In the documents, discovered in the search, about 10 such  Kaliningrad companies are mentioned, that have never received  any of the deliveries allegedly sent to their address. In  addition, this provided the opportunity to operate without a  license for the purchase, securing additional profit.    At present, I do not have precise information as to what is  the total consumption of any of the oil products, for example  petrol, in Latvia, and what is the amount of their declared  import. One of the experts on economic crimes from the Ministry  of Internal Affairs is of the opinion that less than one  hundredth of the imported petrol is being declared at the  border. In the case of TESS Petroleum, petrol was purchased for  10 cents (approximately 5.5 santims). As is known, in Riga  petrol is being sold for 17 - 19 santims.    The profit came from unpaid customs duties. As was explained  by our customs officers, for every liter of petrol one has to  pay 4 santims in excise tax, and from the total amount an  additional 18 percent state tax is to be paid.    The customs papers were sealed with forged stamps, and the  signatures were also forged. As a result, Latvia has lost  millions that have omitted the Treasury.    Now a little background about the "family tree". TESS  Petroleum is a company established two years ago. Its initial  capital has come entirely from TESS AB -- a Swedish company  (please do not mistake it for the Latvian TESS AB). The  president of the TESS Petroleum is Patricia Korotejeva, the  widow of Rustem Kadirovs' brother. Mr. Kadirovs, a former  inhabitant of Riga, currently a Swedish citizen, is the founder  and co-owner -- along with Magnus Visland -- of the Swedish TESS  AB. The task of TESS Petroleum in this oil business was to  control the movement of freight-cars loaded with oil on their  way from Russia to Latvia. The currency payments were conducted  through an Estonian bank. TESS AB is also the founder of  another Latvian company -- TES AB. On the list of its founders  is -- together with the Swedish company with its 80 shares of  capital -- also Ivans Haritonovs (40 shares), Grigoriy Bobovich,  and Boris Yelisejev (40 shares each). In the company "Brih,"  the names of the founders are to be seen in a different  combination, but they are the same -- they include Bobovich,  Haritonovs, and the Swedish citizen Visland as well. Grigoriy  Bobovich, a rather little known and quiet person, is at the same  time the president of TESS AB. [passage omitted]</p>

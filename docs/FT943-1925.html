			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Austerity budget for Hungary Hungary's new socialist-dominated coalition government yesterday presented an austerity mini-budget whose cuts in spending and tax increases will disappoint an electorate which voted in the hope of easing the pain of economic transformation. Mr Laszlo Bekesi, finance minister, warned that despite an upturn in industrial production and in exports, the country's trade and budget deficits were worsening and its net national debt was increasing rapidly. The mini-budget, the government's first important piece of legislation since taking office in July, aims to keep this year's budget deficit to Ft331.9bn (Pounds 2bn) - 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product - by increasing revenues by Ft5.5bn and cutting expenditure by Ft4.5bn. The Finance Ministry said that without the corrective measures the deficit could soar to more than Ft385bn. Further cuts in public expenditure and reform of the bloated welfare system are essential if Hungary is to secure the three-year International Monetary Fund loan package which Mr Bekesi hopes to discuss with a fund mission to Budapest next month.</p>

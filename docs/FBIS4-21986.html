			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been learned that members of the al-Jihad  Organization's military wing have constructed secret underground  tunnels in al-Sharqiyah Governorate in which they built a number  of cells.    According to information, the organization planned to kidnap  some figures and lock them up in these cells as hostages to put  pressure on officials to meet their criminal demands.  AL-JUMHURIYAH has learned that the tunnels were discovered  during a search for terrorists. Security men found a big water  tank. When they removed it, they were surprised to find an  entrance that leads to the underground tunnels.</p>

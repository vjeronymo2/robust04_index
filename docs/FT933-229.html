			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Recession hits tax revenues THE RECESSION helped push tax revenues down to the lowest levels for five years in 1992-93, the Inland Revenue said yesterday. Receipts from compliance and the number of successful prosecutions also fell, while bad debts, tax written off and costs as a proportion of tax collected rose. Net receipts fell to Pounds 76.1bn in the 12 months to March this year against Pounds 79.7bn last year, the Revenue's annual report showed. That included net receipts from income tax of Pounds 56.5bn and from corporation tax of Pounds 16bn. The Revenue said the decline had been caused by falling income and profits as a result of the recession and tax changes introduced in the last Budget. Sir Anthony Battishill, Revenue chairman, said in his foreword to the report: 'Staff in tax offices achieved the best recorded overall results for their annual cycle of work and performed extremely well against targets which measure their service to the tax-paying public.' Total income from compliance work - including investigations against tax evasion and avoidance - also fell, to Pounds 4.6bn from Pounds 4.9bn. The proportion of collectable assessed tax which was collected fell from 87 per cent to 86.7 per cent as a result of poorer debt collection rates. The Revenue's expenses fell slightly to Pounds 1.6bn, but the reduction was not sufficient to offset the decline in tax revenues. As a result, costs as a proportion of total tax yield rose to the highest level in the past decade, at 2.09 per cent compared with 2.06 per cent last year. The amount of tax written off as irrecoverable almost doubled to Pounds 1.7bn last year, from Pounds 884m in 1991. This included Pounds 1.1bn in unpaid income tax and Pounds 542m in corporation tax. The number of people convicted in criminal proceedings brought by the Revenue fell to 217, the lowest level in more than five years, while those acquitted rose to 14. Most of the Revenue's offices achieved their performance targets. The results of an opinion poll in the report show that taxpayers' top priorities are getting their tax right first time, clear explanations and good general information. Two thirds said they were satisfied overall with the service they received. Seventeen tax inquiry centres experimented with extended opening hours during the year as part of the Revenue's attempts to restructure. Nearly 1,500 of the Revenue's tax forms were reviewed during the year against a target of 1,000 in an attempt to make them clearer. Report of the Commissioners of the Inland Revenue. Cmnd 2328. HMSO. Pounds 13.90.</p>

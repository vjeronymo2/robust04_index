			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Gaona, Georgina Tristan, and Lucia </F> Domville]    [Text] In the government's program for the six-year period  between 1994 and 2000, foreign trade will be one of the pillars  of the Mexican economy. Thus, private sector organizations have  presented a package of measures, the most important of which  are:     -  Total deregulation of trade and the creation of a  one-step procedure for national exports.    -  Refinement of the  country's economic opening with the strict implementation of  mechanisms to curb unfair trade practices, because the  government has only used dumping [previous word in English] to  combat the entry of products from other nations.    -  The government  must grant to national exporters the same support (covert  subsidies) other governments extend to their businessmen, as is  particularly true of the United States and Canada.    -  The next  administration must finally break off its connections with  mafias and end corruption in the country's customs offices. It  is the only way to ensure the honest entry and departure of  merchandise and to eliminate contraband to Mexico.       The private sector believes over the next six years  international trade policy should attempt to encourage  development banks to make loans at competitive international  rates, eliminate bureaucracy and excessive guarantees, and allow  loans to indirect exporters.    Representatives of Mexican Employers Confederation, National  Association of the Processing Industry, Confederation of  National Chambers of Commerce, National Association of Mexican  Importers and Exporters, and Conacex [expansion unknown] have  proposed certain foreign trade policies such as flexibility in  commercial openness, which has been exercised in our  negotiations with South American countries (Chile and the Group  of Three), in order to evaluate trade agreements with other  countries.    These organizations have proposed broad-based negotiations  by  goods and services groups. They have called for honesty in the  negotiations process, whereby the community will be informed  beforehand of the scope of negotiations, and for the  institutionalization of the work plan jointly prepared by the  government and the private sector for the North American Free  Trade Agreement.    The business organizations are advocating gradual  negotiations because it is fundamentally important to establish  deadlines for the opening of the various sectors. Openings that  are too broad or too rapid might undermine the sector's ability  to adjust to change, and they may negatively affect its  productive structure.    It is necessary to have a propensity toward exports, to  which  the organizations have recommended the creation of a culture of  exportation. Presently, there is considerable assembly plant  and export activity by foreign companies. Certain Mexican  consortiums have been successfully exporting; it is possible to  capitalize on this through a plan to integrate firms of various  sizes that conduct indirect exports. Added to the problem of  exports are the promotion policies and mechanisms that have been  used thus far, which require the import sector's increased  involvement in organizations that promote exports.    One aspect of regional development is the need to develop  the  private productive nature of organizations and regions  concurrently with regional export activities. Unfair trade  practices such as dumping [previous word in English] and  contraband have harmed the productive infrastructure, making it  necessary to divulge, implement, and place within the reach of  medium- and small-sized businesses the legal mechanisms with  which to avoid them. Furthermore, considering these mechanisms  can be refined, the process should be accelerated.    Customs must face the challenge of assimilating and carrying  out all changes; it is a key operational factor to be able to  rely on a customs system that is trained and efficient.    The business groups addressed the need for a single  organization responsible for promoting agricultural foreign  trade; this organization would have three duties: To examine  competitive national products.    To identify foreign markets, and    To establish an information system.    The business organizations say the development of the border  area requires administrative deregulation and incentives to  increase the competitiveness of border trade. Also required are  consistent foreign trade policies that will allow nationals as  well as foreigners to conduct long-term investments or  coinvestments that will foster employment, the demand for raw  materials and exports.</p>

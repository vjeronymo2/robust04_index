			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Management: Forcing a change of direction / Challenging the belief that private-sector managerial practices will reform the police and the National Health Service The pace of structural and managerial change in the UK police force is about to quicken. But the trepidation felt by many officers is not confined to the likely introduction of performance-related pay and the short, fixed-term contracts which will come in if forces are amalgamated. Some chief constables doubt whether ideas being considered by Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, for bringing private-sector style personnel and financial management practices into the police force have been proven. When the inquiry into police responsibilities and rewards under Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, reports in May it will almost certainly endorse and encourage moves, under way in some forces, to thin out senior levels of command and develop a flatter management structure. The introduction of performance-related pay is also being considered. Clarke is separately conducting an examination of structure that could reduce the present 43 forces in England and Wales to 20-25. Lay members will join the Inspectorate of Constabulary for the first time in its 137-year history, to bring financial and personnel management experience to the task of scrutinising police performance. He is likely to follow this by putting appointees with business experience on police authorities. Although chief constables' day-to-day operational powers exceed those of many public-sector managers, the service remains a local government responsibility. Police authorities draw two-thirds of their members from local councillors and one-third from magistrates. Appointing people with business experience would mirror the structure of trust hospital boards established by Clarke when he was health secretary. Some chief constables - and some National Health Service managers - wonder if all private-sector appointees have quite as much to teach public-sector managers as ministers may assume. 'Police forces employ thousands of people, have multi-million pound budgets and provide a complex range of services 24-hours a day,' says Peter Ryan, chief constable of Norfolk. 'I frequently show private sector business people around my headquarters and many of them comment that they don't have anything like our management expertise in their own companies.' Norfolk and its neighbour Suffolk are typical of forces Clarke may have in mind as potential candidates for amalgamation - possibly with Cambridgeshire as well - into an East Anglian force. Serious crime and other specialised police activities are already co-ordinated across forces. Consortium tendering arrangements give smaller forces benefits of scale when purchasing equipment. And chief constables value their links with local authorities. Is there, to set against all this, a convincing business case for creating combined forces such as West Midlands, Greater Manchester, West Mercia and Devon &amp; Cornwall? 'The best that can be said for the case in favour of larger forces is that it has not been proved,' says Anthony Coe, chief constable of Suffolk, who has studied the effects of size on police forces. 'There may be scope for some amalgamations, just as some existing forces may be too big. I do not believe there is a single ideal size. It depends on the structure, demography and sociology of particular communities.' Coe acknowledges that amalgamations would generate savings at chief officer level, although he suspects these would be marginal compared with a tendency towards greater bureaucracy in bigger organisations. 'But there is no automatic correlation between force size and performance.' Measuring performance between police forces is difficult because communities differ as do demands on their local police. But using 1991-92 data from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, Coe concludes the average cost per officer in the six largest non-metropolitan forces was 2.4 per cent - or nearly Pounds 750 per head - higher than in the six smallest. If crime figures are used as an indicator of police performance, Coe's analysis shows crime has risen faster in areas policed by big forces, while detection rates in those areas have fallen. 'There are many possible explanations,' he cautions. 'All I am saying is that the case in favour of bigger forces is presumably based on the belief that they are more cost-effective and efficient. Those putting forward the argument should be aware that there is no clear evidence to support it.' Coe believes financial demands on smaller forces such as his own encourage efficiency. 'Because we are small we have to be cost-conscious and get to grips with the minute detail of budgets.' Suffolk, in common with about half Britain's provincial forces, has flattened its management structure, reducing the number of officers in senior posts and devolving responsibility to local level. This saved Pounds 750,000 a year - the equivalent of an extra 45 officers on the beat. Such processes are likely to go further after the Sheehy report, which could lead to the abolition of some ranks - chief superintendent and chief inspector are favourites to go, but others, like assistant chief constable, could be at risk. One of the distinctive features of police work is the high degree of day-to-day decision-making responsibility it places on the individual constable. This reality is likely to be increasingly recognised in the way the service is managed.</p>

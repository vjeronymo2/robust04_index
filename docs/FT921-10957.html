			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Bribery of oil group agent admitted THE MANAGING director of a Wrexham engineering company yesterday admitted bribing an agent of Exxon Chemicals, a division of the US oil group. Mr Colin Stuart, 56, of Chester, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court in London to a charge that he corruptly gave Pounds 7,000 in July 1990 as an inducement to Mr Robert Wanstall, a construction manager at Exxon. The court heard that Mr Stuart had a series of meetings with Mr Wanstall at London's Inn on the Park Hotel. These were in connection with a dispute over payment for petrochemical work carried out at the Fawley oil refinery in Hampshire by Dutton Engineering, Mr Stuart's company. Exxon had made repeated demands for a detailed breakdown of how Dutton arrived at its final demand of Pounds 110,000. The Pounds 7,000 payment was made as an inducement to Mr Wanstall to resolve the dispute quickly and favourably towards Dutton. The case was adjourned for sentencing today.</p>

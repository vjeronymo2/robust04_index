			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE BREAKS INTO THE VICTORY COLUMN  </P> <P> UC Irvine proved one thing in its 85-79 victory over Bucknell in the first  round of the Disneyland/Freedom Bowl tournament Friday night in the Bren  Center:  </P> <P> The Anteaters showed they could turn in a solid all-around game, after all.  </P> <P> Irvine will face Tennessee Chattanooga, an 86-81 winner over Navy in the first  game, for the championship at 8 tonight. Bucknell plays Navy in the consolation  game at 6 p.m.  </P> <P> The victory came not a moment too soon for Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan, who  watched his team get pressed into a loss in the opener at the University of San  Francisco last Saturday, then shoot itself in the foot in a loss to Stanford  Monday. Irvine shot 38% against Stanford.  </P> <P> Mulligan had figured on winning each of those games.  </P> <P> Friday, the Anteaters suffered through a lapse or two on their way to their  first victory of the season.  </P> <P> But nothing seemed to throw them too far off track.  </P> <P> They fell behind by 15 points in the first half, but rallied to take the lead,  40-38, by halftime.  </P> <P> Center Ricky Butler fouled out with 6 minutes 24 seconds left, but that didn't  hurt Irvine too much.  </P> <P> Irvine shot well, especially down the stretch as it pulled away.  </P> <P> Irvine took the lead for good, 77-76, on a jumper in the lane by Justin  Anderson, who had 19 points.  </P> <P> Anderson, one of the Anteaters' best outside shooters, was one for 12 from the  field coming into the game.  </P> <P> "He can shoot," Mulligan said. "I want to stick with him, but I was starting to  get nervous."  </P> <P> Anderson's poor shooting was one reason Irvine came into the game shooting just  43%.  </P> <P> "We haven't shot that well all year," Mulligan said.  </P> <P> Butler, a burly, 6-foot-7, 255-pound junior, was a force inside at times,  lumbering around defenders for short jumpers.  </P> <P> He had 18 points and a team-high nine rebounds.  </P> <P> Jeff Herdman also had 19 for Irvine.  </P> <P> Herdman and Anderson made key free throws in the final minute to seal the  victory.  </P> <P> Herdman also came up with what turned out to be the biggest basket of the game.  </P> <P> After missing a jumper on an out-of-bounds play, Herdman wrestled the rebound  away from Bucknell's Mike Joseph and scored on a short bank shot.  </P> <P> That gave Irvine a relatively safe 81-76 lead.  </P> <P> Joseph had 22 points to lead Bucknell. Forwards Greg Leggett and Mike Bright  added 19 and 14, respectively.  </P> <P> "They were a really good offensive team," Mulligan said. "There are no easy  teams in this tournament."  </P> <P> Bucknell opened up a 30-15 lead midway through the first half and it appeared  the Bison would put the game out of reach early.  </P> <P> Irvine seemed listless at times in the first half, throwing the ball away  repeatedly and missing easy shots.  </P> <P> But Mulligan turned to two freshmen, neither of whom figured prominently in the  Anteaters' plans when the season began, for a spark. Ben Rishwain, a walk-on  guard, got Irvine moving with a layup that cut Bucknell's lead to 30-19.  </P> <P> Jeff Von Lutzow, a forward Mulligan had hoped to redshirt, added a steal and a  driving dunk, cutting the Bison lead to 35-30.  </P> <P> Irvine took the lead, 40-38, on a pair of free throws by Herdman with four  seconds left.  </P> <P> It was the Anteaters' first lead since it was 10-9 with 16:10 left. But as it  turned out, it wasn't their last.  </P> <P> Anteater Notes  </P> <P> Irvine shot better than 50% for the first time this season. The Anteaters were  30 of 57, including six of 12 from three-point range for 52%. Even their free  throw shooting, which was 57% against Stanford, improved. They made 19 of 30  for 63%. . . . Rob Doktorczyk was the only Irvine starter who didn't score in  double figures. He had just three points. In addition to Justin Anderson (19),  Ricky Butler (18) and Jeff Herdman (19), guard Rod Palmer had 15 points. He  also had seven assists and five rebounds. . . . Sophomore Nick Marusich, who  played at Servite High School, is a 6-7 center for Navy. He had two points in  12 minutes in Navy's loss to Tennessee Chattanooga. . . . The Moccasins were  led by center Terry Brent, who had 29 points and 11 rebounds. Eddie Reddick had  22 for Navy.  </P></p>

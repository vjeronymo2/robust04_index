			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala] </F>   [Text] During a ceremony in which Police Director General  Octavio Vargas Silva submitted the final report on the  modernization of his organization, President Cesar Gaviria took  the opportunity to say he never intended to offend the State  Council. He then said he considers the debate generated by the  presence of U.S. troops in Juanchaco Ladrilleros and Bahia  Malaga to be over and done with.    [Begin Gaviria recording] Yes, undoubtedly, in the wake of  the State Council's statement yesterday, what could be called a  controversy has now ended. I did not intend to offend the State  Council, and I do not believe I did offend the council. What I  did was defend a legal position -- an interpretation of the  Constitution -- and to respect Colombia's international treaties  and their development, which I consider essential. I consider  this essential not for the president or his position, but for  the professionalization of the Armed Forces and for  international cooperation in efforts to counter drug  trafficking. [end recording]    During the same ceremony, former Police Director General  Miguel Antonio Gomez Padilla for the first time appeared in  public wearing civilian clothes.</p>

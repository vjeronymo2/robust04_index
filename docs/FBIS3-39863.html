The Black Sea Economic Cooperation group is responsible for  setting up the project.    Kumbaracibasi told reporters upon his return at Ankara's  Esenboga Airport that the protocol of the project known as the  West-East Corridor was signed on Friday [18 February], and that  Bulgarian, Albanian, and Macedonian ministers participated to  the meetings held in Sofia.    Italy is participating as observer.    The 1,000 kilometer-long highway, with its 500 km section  between Istanbul and Sofia ready to use, will rescue Macedonia  from its isolated position in the middle of the Balkans.    The corridor, which does not pass through Serbia or Greece,  will be the main route connecting Albania to the Black and  Aegean Seas.    The Bulgarian portion of the road will be financed by  Turkey,  and Sofia will have direct access to the Adriatic Sea and thence  to western Europe.    Kumbaracibasi said the project was proposed by Turkey which  is its greater supporter, adding it will be an advantage for  countries with weak economies such as Albania and Macedonia.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Cook steps up pressure to release Archer report Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, will today step up pressure on the government to publish the Department of Trade and Industry report into allegations of insider dealing involving Lord Archer, the former Conservative party deputy chairman. Mr Cook is expected to write to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, asking him to confirm that there would be no 'legal barrier' to publication of the report if Lord Archer agreed to it being published. Mr Cook said last night that since Lord Archer had stated publicly that the report 'exonerated' him, the best-selling novelist should have no difficulty in giving such permission. The DTI has never said whether Lord Archer was exonerated. It has only said only that no further action would be taken against him, following advice from 'independent counsel'. The DTI has consistently maintained that it is a 'criminal offence' to publish reports into alleged insider trading under section 177 of the Financial Services Act. Lawyers confirm however that publication is possible if the main protagonists in the affair give their permission. The report's main subjects - Lord Archer who bought 50,000 shares in Anglia Television just before the MAI takeover, Lady Archer, a non-executive director of Anglia Television, and Mr Broosk Saib, an acquaintance of Lord Archer - have maintained that they behaved properly. The shares were bought on Mr Saib's behalf, although the cheque for the dealing profit was sent to Lord Archer's London address. However, Mr Cook yesterday said that all three had new questions to answer following disclosure that Lady Archer was present at an Anglia board meeting on January 12, when directors were given details for the first time of the takeover price proposed by MAI. That meeting was the day before Lord Archer placed the first of two orders to buy the shares. By the evening of January 12, agreement for a takeover was in sight. However, the Anglia board did not give its formal approval until January 16. Lord Archer placed an Anglia share purchase order, on January 13, with Mr Simon Wharmby, a broker who had joined stockbrokers Charles Stanley the previous October. Lord Archer had never before placed orders through Charles Stanley, though he had dealt through Mr Wharmby. The profit from the deal of just more than Pounds 77,000 was sent out by Charles Stanley in an 'account payee only' cheque on February 4, four days before the DTI launched its inquiry into the deals. The cheque was deposited in Mr Saib's UK bank account.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN YSIDRO PROJECT DISCOVERS CURE FOR ILLS OF GANGS, DRUGS  </P> <P> When Villa Nueva was opened in an area plagued by gang- and drug-related  crimes, it was known as a hotbed for illegal activities to the point that even  the police patrolling the area were reluctant to enter the 390-unit, low-income  housing project.  </P> <P> But, after almost 20 years of existence, the San Ysidro development has  eliminated gangs from its grounds, and, through a successful teen club, unusual  community unity and increased security, its 1,800 tenants now live in relative  peace.  </P> <P> Although increased security and community cohesiveness have played important  roles at the project run by an Augustinian order, the teen club established 13  years ago in the Guadalupe Center has been singled out as the key in the fight  against gangs and drugs.  </P> <P> "People usually do things to cure the problem after it has happened," said  Felipe Muro, director of the teen club. "The main reason we don't have (gangs)  is that we have our own peer group. I guess it would be like a family, like one  big family."  </P> <P> Muro, who grew up in Villa Nueva before he was hired as director of the club  five years ago, said the teen-age members of the club now are probably the  first generation at the complex in which the majority is thinking about college  and not jail. Through the 75-member club and other programs in the community,  most of the older teen-agers are now either working or in college.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outlets for Energy  </P> <P> He attributes the lack of gang interest not only to the support system created  by the club but also to the outlet it provides for aggressive energy through  different activities, such as football and baseball.  </P> <P> "We have our own group," said Rene Harris, 11. "We play a lot of sports, and we  get to have fun, that is why we don't believe in gangs and drugs."  </P> <P> In school, members of area gangs know who is from Villa Nueva and leave them  alone, and, although there is some contact, the fellowship provided by the club  takes away the allure a gang might have, said 16-year-old Jose Saldana.  </P> <P> According to detective Felix Aguirre of the San Diego Police Department's  street gang unit, Villa Nueva has "cleaned up quite a bit" and has become one  of the better places to live in San Ysidro.  </P> <P> He, too, praises what the club has accomplished.  </P> <P> "Kids join gangs because they have nothing more to do," Aguirre said. "They go  out to find companionship and fellowship and eventually join gangs."  </P> <P> When Villa Nueva first opened its doors, the Augustinian priests who had taken  over the task of managing the project did not have the time or manpower to  screen all the tenants, and some "troublemakers" were admitted, said Father  John Blethen, Villa Nueva's social director.  </P> <P> "We've been in business for 20 years, and we ended up with some bad apples at  first, but we've gotten rid of most of them," he said.  </P> <P> More than 95% of the tenants in Villa Nueva receive federal rental assistance  through a program for families with limited income.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gang Members the Exception  </P> <P> Blethen and Muro acknowledge that some teen-agers are still members of gangs,  but they say those cases are the exception.  </P> <P> As important as the club has been in ridding the complex of gangs, they and  others agree that the teen club could not have succeeded without community  unity.  </P> <P> "Everybody pulls together when things need to be done," Muro said.  </P> <P> That unity was created in part through a food cooperative, a religious  education program, a preteen club, and an adult school. Also, since 1979, the  project provides space in the La Paz Center for a YWCA outreach program.  </P> <P> There is also a distribution center for the San Diego Food Bank, and every  second Friday of the month the Villa Nueva bus carries enough staples from the  food bank to distribute to 460 families, under the direction of Antonia  Gallegos, a longtime Villa Nueva resident.  </P> <P> "Tenant unity is one of the greatest assets (here)," said Armando Hurtado,  resident manager of Villa Nueva. "You have a steady population, and they are  very community-oriented people. What we do is for the benefit of the  community."  </P> <P> The Augustinians have tried to create a Christian sense of community among the  tenants, said Blethen, even though only about 60 units actively participate in  Villa Nueva events.  </P> <P> "I would say it is a case of the minority having a good, strong influence over  the majority," he said. "I think that people who live here appreciate that they  have a good environment and want to keep it that way."  </P> <P> Some residents say that, years ago, whenever something bad happened in San  Ysidro, people would blame Villa Nueva residents. Now the turnaround is so  complete that there is a two-year waiting list to get an apartment, and the  Augustinians are not taking any more applications until the list shortens.  </P> <P> "Villa Nueva doesn't provide just housing, it provides life, a dream, a  future," Blethen said. "It provides a lot of extra things."  </P></p>

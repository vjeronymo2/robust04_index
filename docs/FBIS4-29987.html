			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Executive Council members of the  Indonesian Journalists Association [PWI] said they fully  understand the government's reasons for revoking the publication  permits of two magazines, namely, TEMPO, EDITOR and a tabloid  paper DETIK.    In a statement released in Jakarta today, the PWI Central  Executive Council noted the several warnings issued earlier by  the government to these three publications. The statement was  signed by Tony Hadi and Tribuana Said, PWI's secretary general  and chairman respectively.    The PWI Central Executive Council is confident that this  incident will not cause the active participation of the press in  national development to slacken and it will not dampen the  spirit of openness between government officials and the people.</p>

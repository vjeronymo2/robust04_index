			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Arts: Ray Charles IT IS hard to imagine a more emotionally intoxicating mix than soul and suffrin' music spiked with sentimental gospel. If it is sung by a handsome blind man, apparently for you alone, and whose body language suggests he is deriving almost indecent pleasure from it, the effect is evangelical. Ray Charles provokes this devotional state in audiences as a matter of routine, of course - alone at the piano or surrounded by strings and celestial choirs. But fronting a hefty brass and rhythm section and with the divine Raelettes by his side is easily the most seductive setting for the man who can make people from Sussex feel homesick for Georgia. Charles takes a lot of stick, from people who should know better, about his overt commerciality - the fact that he will advertise anything from charge cards to soft drinks and is strict about his terms of contract. Presumably they would prefer him to stick to the basket-weaving skills he learnt in order to earn his pin-money when a penniless child in Florida. Charles is the consummate professional who gives his fans exactly what they crave, effortlessly. He sings the ones they will come again for ('Georgia', 'I can't stop loving you') and, from a huge repertoire, delights with surprise covers ('Some enchanted evening' and Ruth Brown's 'Evr'y time it rains'). Surely someone who gives so much pleasure should be allowed some spin-offs. The 61 year old voice is legendary, and in great shape, ranging from gruff, rough velvet eructations through soothing C &amp; W tinged soul to pure blues shouting. The charisma of the man still harks back to monochrome footage of the joyfully demented puppet in sunglasses, black patent shoes and grey DJ, bent-double in pleasure and clutching at himself in excitement at the audience's own rapture. (Part of Charles' magnetism is surely induced by an anxiety that he might actually fall off his stool or somehow become parted from his instrument.) The monogrammed stands of the Ray Charles Orchestra, whose horn section is staffed by implausibly big men, and the Raelettes, a rhapsody in black silk and hairspray, complete the vision of soul and showbiz in perfect harmony. The glitzy style of the show might appear even more superficial 30 years on, but as an escape into sentimentality and 'sadness like a ball game on a rainy day', it is precious trash.

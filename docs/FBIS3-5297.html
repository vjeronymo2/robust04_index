			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa vowed Monday [7 March] that he will continue to lead  efforts to make the Japanese economy more open to the rest of  the world.    "Economic and administrative reforms now under way are  indispensable in establishing an economic society open to the  world. For that purpose, I and the cabinet as a whole will  continue to make efforts to solve Japan-U.S trade friction,  promote economic deregulation, and slash the trade surplus,"  Hosokawa said at a plenary session of the House of  Representatives.    "Japan has been asked to play a more positive role as the  Uruguay Round of trade talks has concluded and the world is  shifting to new trade rules," he said at the start of a  three-day question-and- answer session at the Diet.    Hosokawa was responding to Yohei Kono, president of the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who said that  Hosokawa's seven-month-old coalition government has completed  its mission.    Kono criticized Hosokawa for delaying compilation of the  fiscal 1994 budget to this year, scuttling a "national welfare  tax" scheme, failing to reach an accord in framework trade talks  with the United States and giving up a recent plan to reshape  the cabinet.    "As a reason for reshuffling the cabinet, you said you'll  establish an economic reform cabinet as political reform is  nearly complete...(but) the failure of the cabinet shake-up  means discarding the bid to promote economic reform," Kono said.    "Japanese society and the Japanese economy are facing  historical turning points in every respect...The Hosokawa  cabinet has finished its mission," Kono said.    Hosokawa rebutted Kono's remark, saying "the historical  change of society and the economy need a new political power and  the reason for the birth of the coalition government lies there.  The Japanese people expect the coalition government to carry  out its mission to implement a comprehensive economic reform."    Hosokawa launched the seven-party coalition government last  August after dislodging the LDP from a 38-year-long grip on  power.    Asked how to improve strained economic relations with the  U.S., Hosokawa reaffirmed Japan's commitment to further opening  its markets to U.S. firms even though the summit talks with  President Bill Clinton early last month failed and led to the  reinstatement of the "Super 301" trade provision that gives the  U.S. Government broad powers to impose sanctions.    The government "is doing its utmost to draw up voluntary  measures within March to further open the country's markets,"  Hosokawa said.    He also reiterated Japan's opposition to setting numerical  targets to measure the penetration of imports into the Japanese  market, saying "it will be against deregulation to force firms  to set numerical targets."    The premier also said the sagging economy will be back on  recovery during fiscal 1994.    On the North Korean nuclear issue, Hosokawa echoed Kono, who  said Japan should deal with the matter in cooperation with the  U.S. while taking into account the views of South Korea and  China.    Hosokawa also expressed his intention to continue efforts to  resume the stalled negotiations with Pyongyang aimed at  establishing diplomatic ties. The negotiations hit deadlock in  November 1992, when North Korea walked out over a dispute on the  alleged abduction of a Japanese woman by Pyongyang.    On political realignment, Hosokawa reiterated his initial  stand that political parties would be absorbed into a moderate  multiparty system after several elections, thus denying recent  speculation that he is tilting heavily in favor of a two-party  system advocated by the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] and Komeito.</p>

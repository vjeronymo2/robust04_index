			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Little-known winners share the LWT corporate jackpot: Rachel Johnson on the 54 people who will become rich by virtue of the golden-handcuff scheme THE 16 top executives at London Weekend Television who will become paper millionaires next week as a reward for investing in a Pounds 3m golden-handcuffs scheme before the 1991 franchise auction will not be the only people feeling prosperous at the company. Leaving aside the 16 - who include such well-known names as Sir Christopher Bland, chairman; Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive; and Mr Melvyn Bragg, arts controller and presenter of the South Bank Show - there are plenty of lesser-known winners of LWT's corporate jackpot, making a total of 54. All those who benefitted from the scheme were in management at some level, but why were they so richly rewarded? Those who left LWT before Sir Christopher Bland dreamt up the golden handcuffs scheme, or were not senior enough to participate in it, struggle to give even-handed replies. Mr Anwer Bati, a freelance producer who worked at LWT in the early 1980s, gulped at the thought of a former colleague, Mr Robin Paxton, being worth Pounds 2m. 'They were in the right jobs at the right time, so lucky them,' he said. He added: 'It's not that they were in dire danger of being headhunted, but the station needed to convince the IBA (Independent Broadcasting Authority) that the people behind its star programmes would not be headhunted by rivals. Take Barry Cox (director of corporate affairs). He's a very nice guy, was an ordinary programme maker. Now he's worth Pounds 1.5m.' The scope of the scheme has penetrated some surprising corners. Mr Paul Gibson is a classic example - an unknown manager on the technical side of LWT's operations, he is one of nine investors who have ended up with shareholdings worth Pounds 915,000 each. Mr Gibson is LWT's group systems controller, in charge of all corporate information technology, airtime bookings and production bookings. His past experience includes time as a senior systems analyst at Lyons and Tesco, the food retailers. He would not comment on his participation in the share scheme nor why he was chosen for it. According to Korn Ferry, the media headhunters, Mr Gibson's job at LWT would involve extensive responsibilities and probably command a salary of about Pounds 70,000. 'But he wouldn't be all that hard to replace,' Korn Ferry said yesterday. LWT says the 54 managers are justly reaping the reward of their loyalty in 1989. At a time when it was not clear whether Carlton Communications, chaired by Mr Michael Green, would compete for the London weekend franchise, they took a risk by putting their own money, sometimes borrowed, into LWT. Mr Peter Coppock, head of press relations at LWT, was keen to put this side of tale of the 'telly millionaires'. He was offered 18,028 shares at 83p, and made 'no small investment' of Pounds 15,000. But he did not know until the franchise was renewed that he had made money rather than lost it. 'For a long time the share price was 65p and it was brown-trouser time,' he recalled. 'It's easy enough now the share price is 470p to say it was a cushy investment but it didn't feel like that at the time.' Mr Coppock's investment is now worth Pounds 342,991 - 22 times its original value. He said that a shareholding this size is the norm - and that only the 16 top managers became millionaires overnight.</p>

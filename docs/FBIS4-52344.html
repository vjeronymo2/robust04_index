			<p>BFN     [Text] Mitsubishi Electric Corporation [MEC] has organized  a research team charged with a research program for a new air  defense system. The United States has been calling on Japan to  participate in the research program of the theater missile  defense [TMD] to cope with ballistic missiles developed by North  Korea. At the present stage, Japan has yet to decide on whether  to participate in the research program, but building an air  defense system is expected to be a task in the plan for defense  buildup to be implemented after 1996. MEC plans to undertake a  wide range of research on radar, antimissile missile, and  command communications network.    The research team is comprised of about 20 engineers mainly  from MEC's Kamakura Plant (in Kamakura City, Kanakawa  Prefecture), and they are in charge of missile, communications,  and fire control system in their respective divisions.    The TMD, which the United States plans to develop, is a  system which will make phased interceptions of enemy missiles  with various missiles deployed on the ground and at sea after  satellites detect their launching. However, Japan adheres to the  principle of using space for peaceful purposes, and Japanese  experts are divided over the use of satellites to detect their  launching. MEC will examine two options -- the new air defense  system that uses satellites and the one which does not use  satellites.    MEC is now working on the development of "a new medium-range  SAM," the next-generation surface-to-air missile for the Ground  Self-Defense Force. It has manufactured missiles along with  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toshiba Corporation. MEC, which  has developed a high-performance aircraft radar, will certainly  participate in the TMD development program as a key Japanese  partner once Japan decides to participate in it. MEC says, "At  the present stage, we are studying various theoretical  problems." It plans to vigorously propose to the Defense Agency  the building of the new air defense system.    The United States is said to have estimated the cost of  developing the TMD at approximately $30 billion (approximately 3  trillion yen). It has asked Japan to participate in the  development program through: 1) the purchase of U.S.-built air  defense system; 2) financial cooperation; or 3) joint  development.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil dispels growth concern with rise to Pounds 67m RENTOKIL, the environmental and property services company that recently bought Securiguard for Pounds 75.7m after a hostile takeover battle, yesterday went a long way towards dispelling concern that growth in its existing businesses was running out of steam. The group reported a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 67.1m for the six months to end-June on sales up 20 per cent at Pounds 252.4m, and a near-30 per cent increase in earnings per share to 4.39p. The interim dividend is increased by 31 per cent to 0.84p. 'We are pleased that the UK, North America and Asia have performed well against a background of difficulties in continental Europe,' said Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive. Rentokil's bid for Securiguard, which has cleaning and personnel businesses as well as the manned property guarding business, alarmed some analysts who believed the group was diversifying into low margin businesses and that the limits of organic growth were being reached in the existing businesses. Mr Thompson said the types of businesses the group had acquired were low margin for some people but not for Rentokil who could charge people who wanted a quality product. The group pushed up margins in the UK, where an 8 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 93.3m produced profits up nearly 20 per cent at Pounds 26.6m. Healthcare, pest control and hygiene showed steady growth and tropical plants had grown very quickly. Property care, hit by the slowdown in the rate at which people have been moving house, had also showed some benefit from the improvements in the improving economy. Continental European sales rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 77.2m with profits up 32 per cent to Pounds 18.8m. France, Switzerland and Sweden had grown strongly while there had been some slowdown in Belgium and Germany. Profits in North America rose 50 per cent to Pounds 5.2m on sales up a third at Pounds 29.2m, while Asia Pacific and Africa increased turnover by 30 per cent to Pounds 52.7m and profits by 44 per cent to Pounds 14.2m Net cash at the end of the period was Pounds 73.3m.

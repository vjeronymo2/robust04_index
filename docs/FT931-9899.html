			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Banks suggest register to stop excessive lending OVERSEAS banks based in London have suggested to UK banks that a joint register of corporate loans should be compiled to stop lending to companies that have excessive debts. The Foreign Banks and Securities Houses Association has sent a detailed proposal to the Bank of England and the British Bankers Association. It hints that overseas banks would reduce their commitment to operating in the City of London if a register was not created. Many of them made big losses on loans to the late Robert Maxwell's group of companies and to other concerns such as Brent Walker, the property and leisure group. They believe this may not have happened if it had been easier to ascertain the companies' overall indebtedness. The banks had originally wanted the Bank of England to maintain the register. The task is done in most continental European countries by their central banks. The Bank of England is reluctant to take it on. It believes a register would at best provide only limited information on most companies' indebtedness because the UK economy is so open. The scheme proposed would involve voluntary bank participation and the register would be run by a specially created company, owned by banks and other financial institutions. Confidentiality would be guaranteed regarding sensitive information. The start-up costs are estimated to be about Pounds 10m and the running costs, including 11 to 15 staff, in the range of Pounds 1m to Pounds 4m a year. The scheme would cover only the 1,500 biggest British companies and their UK subsidiaries. Participating banks would report their loans to these companies each month. The banks' proposal stresses that British companies benefit greatly from the presence in London of about 470 foreign banks. But the confidence of these banks has been eroded and needs to be restored if they are to continue to lend to British companies. To be effective the register would need to gather information not only from banks but also from other providers of loans, such as leasing and factoring companies, insurance companies and finance houses. The foreign banks accept that getting agreement from all these institutions would be very difficult. The British Bankers' Association is due to circulate the proposal to its members.

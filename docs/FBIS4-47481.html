Lebedev at  Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow]    [Abstract] A novel emission mode of a free-electron x-ray  laser with counterpropagating electron beam and optical pump  laser (``optical wiggler'') beam, namely its quantum emission  mode where emission of an x-ray quantum changes the electronic  state appreciably, is analyzed by comparing it with its  classical mode of operation. Interaction of relativistic  electrons with both electromagnetic pump and signal fields, for  simplicity assuming a collinear geometry. Such a laser with an  optical pump differs from one with a conventional magnetostatic  one in that its emission and absorption lines are completely  separated so that the ratio = h/_D_|e of the distance h_o_  (h- Planck constant, _o_- frequency) between them to their  effective width _D__e_ is _ee_ &gt; &gt;  1, while with a  magnetic pump  this ratio is _ee_ &lt;&lt; 1. Analysis of three-wave  interaction  confirms the validity of treating the laser as one with a  completely inverted two-level active medium and describing its  electron dynamics with the Klein-Gordon equation. By virtue of  the conservation laws, the problem of transitions in a continuum  reduces to the problem of resonance excitation of discrete  levels in an anharmonic oscillator. This leads to a  self-consistent closed nonlinear system of four partial  differential equations completely describing the emission  dynamics of such a laser: two equations the evolution of slowly  varying amplitudes a[.sub]0[/](z,t) and a[.sub]-1[/](z,t),  one equation the propagation of emission pulses, and one  equation the evolution of the high-frequency signal. This system  is analogous to the system of Maxwell-Bloch equations describing  the interaction of a two-level atomic medium with a resonance  field. The performance characteristics of this laser are  calculated for the case of quasi-steady amplification with the  durations of not only the high-frequency pump and signal pulses  but also of the electron cluster much longer than the  characteristic dimension of the interaction space divided by the  speed of light. The laser is shown to be more efficient in the  quantum mode than in the classical mode of operation, transition  from the latter to the former being achievable by widening the  energy range within the electron beam.

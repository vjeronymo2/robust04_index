			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Italy keeps tougher watchdog on a leash - The belated and controversial move to stricter financial supervison BY pushing privatisation harder than all its predecessors combined, Italy's new government has raised the profile of Consob, the country's companies and stock market watchdog, beyond all previous expectations. Much of the privatisation programme, which received broad parliamentary approval last month, involves the stock market. The government is keen to promote popular capitalism by encouraging Italians to buy shares. Even when disposals look set to take place via auctions or tenders, rather than flotations, Consob has been forced to take a stand when the companies on the block are quoted. Based in Rome, the agency, chaired by Mr Enzo Berlanda, had its first taste of battle late last year after suspending the shares of a number of public-sector companies following conflicting reports about their fates. More discreetly, it has investigated sharp price movements which have in some cases taken place ahead of market-sensitive information on privatisation. Consob showed signs of having sharper teeth even before the arrival of the government's ambitious privatisation drive. The change stemmed from new legislation, which has belatedly brought Italian bourse rules closer in line with tougher regulations in many other western markets and personal factors at Consob. Laws reforming share trading through the creation of the societa di intermediazione mobiliare (Sim), Italy's new breed of securities dealing and fund management hybrids, have been the main impetus behind the change. Consob is responsible, with the Bank of Italy, for policing a much tougher stock market rulebook than was previously applied. Strict disclosure requirements for the Sims have created greater transparency, while the more exacting capital adequacy standards now operating have eliminated some marginal players from the business. New laws banning insider trading and setting out rules for takeover bids have further boosted Consob's role. It now looks more closely for erratic or inexplicable price movements, which could result from the illegal use of privileged information. Last year's introduction of a highly complex takeover code, based on individual trigger levels for when companies should be subject to a full bid from potential raiders, further raised Consob's role and responsibilities. Consob has also been boosted by the removal of barriers to the free movement of capital within the European Community, which has increased the role of regulators across the EC. Harmonisation of national regulations on financial services means new Italian regulations have had to be shaped with Brussels in mind. Personalities have helped. The agency's more interventionist approach has been influenced by an increase in its resources and the arrival of more forceful and, some say, better informed staff. None more so than Mr Berlanda, who took over the chairmanship in March from his predecessor Mr Bruno Pazzi. A former politician and senator for 13 years for the northern city of Bergamo, Mr Berlanda was deputy chairman, then chairman, of the senate's finance committee. It was there a number of the reforms, now laws being policed by Consob, were drawn up. Mr Berlanda gained additional experience of the complex links between financial markets through the committee's work on various banking scandals, including the affairs of Mr Michele Sindona, the Mafia-linked financier, and the unauthorised loans to Iraq by the Atlanta branch of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. For critics of Italian equities, the reforms have come not a day too soon. Only slowly is the Milan bourse shaking off its reputation for unreliability, poor transparency and even the occasional bankruptcy of a financial intermediary. However, Italy's belated move to tougher rules and stronger supervision has brought considerable controversy. Nowhere is this more so than with the Sims law, which has triggered a chorus of complaints from foreign financial institutions, which claim it discriminates in favour of Italian competitors. The objections, echoed in various European capitals, as well as Washington, have brought Italy into conflict with the European Commission. In a clash building up through 1992, the Commission's competition directorate, then headed by Sir Leon Brittan, argued the Sims law contravened the Treaty of Rome on free competition. The Commission has issued a formal procedure against the Italians, who have so far failed to amend the Sims law as required. It remains to be seen whether the new Commissioner taking over from Sir Leon will push the dispute up to the European Court of Justice, or whether the Italian government will be prepared to show greater flexibility. Insider trading rules and the new takeover code have also brought their critics, although in both cases from within Italy, rather than abroad. Some brokers argue the insider rules are too broad to be effective, yet are also too legalistic, in preventing Consob from acting independently. Even writing newspaper articles based on 'privileged' information could put the author and source at risk. Yet Consob lacks the legal powers to investigate suspected insider traders in its own right. Once it is has adequate evidence, Consob must pass on its findings to local magistrates. However, the snail's pace of Italian justice and the fact that most prosecutors are probably unfamiliar with the intricacies of financial markets makes the chances of convictions extremely slim, critics say. Mr Berlanda admits the new takeover code is flawed. 'We've seen that those countries which have the most complex takeover laws are in the biggest difficulties, while those with the simplest rules tend to function best,' he says. 'By setting individual trigger levels for what constitute controlling stakes in Italian quoted companies, Consob has created a set of rules which are so complex as to be almost incomprehensible,' agrees one analyst. Meanwhile, plans to boost Consob further by improving its financial resources are at an early stage. Hopes for more staff, particularly for its Milan-based markets division, could be thwarted by government spending cuts. However, new laws to boost popular share ownership, due to be approved by the cabinet this week, could also contain measures to secure independent funding for Consob. Failing such action, many fear it still lacks the muscle adequately to police its new powers.</p>

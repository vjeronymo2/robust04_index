			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Bears continue to hold sway - Capital and Credit After nine months of bloodletting, the last quarter of this year could be a bit kinder to international bond fund managers. However, amid continued worldwide economic growth and expectations of further monetary tightening in Europe next year, many say any recovery is likely to be little more than a temporary reprieve in a continuing bear market environment. 'I think there's good scope for a fourth-quarter rally, but I don't think the bear market is over yet,' says Mr Edward Dove, director of fixed income at Julius Baer Investments. 'The current level of economic growth is not a flash in the pan - it's here to stay, and that could be consistent with the price of capital being pushed higher,' he says. 'On a technical basis, markets do seem oversold - but even if there is a rebound, helped by subdued economic data, I doubt it's enough to generate a sizeable rally, given what looms in 1995,' agrees Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed income at Lombard Odier, adding: 'We are still positioned defensively and see upward pressure on yields as economies continue to strengthen.' Some are more upbeat. 'We are expecting some sort of recovery, though it's hard to pinpoint the timing,' says Mr Mark Gull, bond fund manager at Gartmore. 'We feel bond yields are rather high and when confidence - that rather elusive quality - returns to the market, it will recover.' The market's troubles began on February 4, when the US Fed raised interest rates for the first time in the current cycle, highlighting fears of inflation fuelled by economic growth. Further pressure came from the failure of US-Japanese trade talks, which undermined the dollar. Both of these factors triggered heavy selling by highly leveraged bond market players, causing prices to spiral lower. In this environment, many investors took refuge on the sidelines, keeping their exposure to a minimum. But while investor demand for bonds was shrinking, supply was swelling though the heavy issuance of debt by governments around the world. All this pushed bond yields to dizzy heights, where, it was hoped, they would eventually entice investors back into the market. Indeed, that now seems to be happening, with dealers reporting cautious nibbling by investors who have been building up large cash positions in recent months. 'People have been far too bearish, and we think there is an increasing risk in being out of these markets,' says Mr Dove. 'Bonds offer very, very good value at these levels.' That's especially because - at least in Europe - fears of growth-fuelled inflation now appear to have been overdone, with some recent data in Germany and the UK pointing to steady growth accompanied by subdued inflation pressures. 'The inflationary implications of the economic recovery have been grossly exaggerated by the market,' says Mr Robert Kyprianou, chief investment officer at Kidder Peabody Asset Management. While growth will remain intact and short-term rates are likely to rise, tightening will not be as drastic as bond market players have been assuming, he argues. 'The current risk premiums are too high; as time passes and confidence returns, prices will recover slowly but surely,' he predicts. Some feel it will take specific developments, like clear signs of US economic slowdown or a resumption of buying by Japanese investors, to jump-start bonds. Others say it is simply a matter of time, with cash and confidence returning to the market as the inflation spectre becomes less daunting. When it comes to picking their favourite market, fund managers are nearly unanimous in their enthusiasm for UK gilts. Gilts - this year's worst performing bond market - last week rallied sharply, partly on switching out of German bunds ahead of the October 16 elections, but mainly due to a reassessment of the fundamental picture. This caused the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt to drop some 15 basis points to 8.71 per cent on Friday, with the yield gap over Germany shrinking to 118 basis points from 148 the previous week. 'We are overweight gilts in our global bond funds and happy to stay that way,' says Mr Gull at Gartmore. 'We don't see many inflationary pressures; the UK is politically stable; the pre-emptive base rate hike underlines the UK's commitment to controlling inflation; the PSBR is on a clearly defined downward path and the improving trade balance is supportive of sterling,' he lists. Depending on the outcome of the German elections, Germany's is another bond market that may offer good value. If Chancellor Helmut Kohl returns to power and his government's planned fiscal tightening measures are introduced early next year, bund yields could benefit substantially; indeed, some are calling for yields of 6.75 per cent by mid-1995, from current levels around 7.72 per cent.</p>

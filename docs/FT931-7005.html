			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Shell lifts profits 8% to Pounds 3bn in spite of lower oil prices THE ROYAL Dutch/Shell group, the multinational oil company, saw profits rise 8 per cent last year in spite of lower oil prices and the first annual loss in its chemicals business for a decade. A rise in oil production accompanied by cost-cutting and a boost from exchange rate gains pushed Shell's profit up to Pounds 3.12bn from Pounds 2.89bn on a replacement cost basis which strips out gains and losses from holding stocks. Sir Peter Holmes, chairman of Shell Transport, the company's UK arm, said 1992 had been a difficult year. 'There was little respite on prices and no respite for chemicals, but the core business did well. Now we've got to move on and do better on the chemicals side.' The company made a provision of Pounds 131m to cover its share of the Y125bn (Pounds 744m) of potential losses on currency speculation at its Japanese associate, Showa Shell Sekiyu, and said it would make an additional provision of Pounds 65m in the first quarter. Sir Peter said: 'I'm staggered by the scale of the losses and staggered it could happen at all.' Top managers at Showa Shell resigned yesterday as they accepted the blame for the unauthorised currency dealings. However, the group as a whole benefited from favourable exchange rate movements in 1992 to the tune of about Pounds 400m and the company's results included a special credit of Pounds 425m from changes in pension provisions in the US. Sir Peter said the outlook for chemicals was better this year and the company planned substantial investments in all of its businesses over the next five years. Capital expenditure is planned to reach Pounds 7bn this year up from Pounds 6bn last year which showed a 9 per cent decline from the year before. He said the chemicals division is planning to cut about 10 per cent of its jobs, but that investment will be made to increase the division's geographical spread. 'These figures are quite good, but a lot of the gain comes from currency movements and that is reflected in the company's extreme caution on the dividend,' said Mr Nick Antill, analyst at Hoare Govett, the UK stockbrokers. Shell increased its payout for the year by 4.8 per cent to 21.9p a share. Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 24; Top two at Showa quit, Page 29</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Apple launches new operating system Apple, the California-based computer company, is set to release a new operating system for its Macintosh personal computers later this summer. The new system, known as Macintosh System 7.5, includes more than 50 new features and technologies to make the computer more productive and easier to use. These include an interactive guide to assist users, some features to streamline and speed up basic tasks and a simplified way to exchange information between Macintosh and MS-Dos or Windows systems. The system includes PowerTalk, which allows users to send electronic mail, share files and forward documents. It also includes the QuickDraw GX technology for high-quality printing and graphics. Macintosh system 7.5 will run on computers with at least a 68020 processor. On a 68020, 68030 or 68040-based Macintosh computer, the system requires at least four megabytes of Ram to run the core elements and at least eight megabytes of Ram to use PowerTalk and QuickDraw GX. The new release will be compatible with most Macintosh applications software currently available. Apple Computer UK Ltd: UK, 081 730 2480.</p>

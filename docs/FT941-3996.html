			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Mexican political threat Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the Mexican government's peace envoy in the southern state of Chiapas, has indicated he might run for national office if the government did not approve democratic reforms under discussion for the country and failed to comply with the recent peace accord for the rebels in Chiapas. He thereby resisted rising pressure from his colleagues in the governing party to rule himself out of the presidential race. The party's 65-year hold on power could be jeopardised if Mr Camacho, a former mayor of Mexico City and an ex-foreign minister, were to realise his veiled threat to run as an opposition candidate in the presidential election in August. 'If there are no advances in democracy and if, instead of accord, there is polarisation and if anyone wants to trample on my political rights as a citizen, then after I have fulfilled my mission in Chiapas, I will take the necessary political decision to bring democracy and unity to Mexico,' Mr Camacho told reporters.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Oil, fuel price rises All oils and fuels were subject to price increases under the Budget. Both leaded and unleaded petrol will rise by 2.5p a litre and 3.2p per litre on diesel to eliminate the small duty differential with unleaded petrol. The increase in the duty for diesel road fuel will bring the duty rate in line with that charged on unleaded petrol.</p>

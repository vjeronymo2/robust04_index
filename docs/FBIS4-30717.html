			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear Listeners: Ko Soe Win Nyo of the Democratic  Voice of Burma's Manerplaw branch has dispatched a report on the  assassination of Colonel Tun Yee, vice chairman and commander in  chief of the Pa-o National Organization [PNO], which had  previously reached a cease-fire agreement with the SLORC [State  Law and Order Restoration Council].    It has been learned that Colonel Tun Yee, vice chairman and  commander in chief of the PNO, which reached a cease-fire  agreement with the SLORC in December 1993, was assassinated by  one of his followers.    The PNO is led by U Aung Kham Ti, and since the cease-fire  SLORC has been gradually controlling and manipulating the group,  said several members. SLORC has been seriously working to  transform the PNO into a defense unit and to keep it under SLORC  control. Col. Tun Yee, vice chairman and commander in chief,  did not accept this idea. SLORC has ridded the obstacle, Col.  Tun Yee, from its path and camouflaged the incident by saying he  was killed because of an internal disagreement. It has been  learned that he was assassinated at the Aung Su Pan Camp, one of  the PNO's camps with 15 villages along Hopong-Loikaw Road.    Concerning this matter, SLORC said Col. Tun Yee was killed  because of a business conflict among PNO members. Whatever  SLORC says, PNO members certainly believe that their leader was  killed by the ruling junta and there is a growing  dissatisfaction against the SLORC within PNO units.</p>

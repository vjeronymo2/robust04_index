With many clips of Dogan's statements, Mr. Kenan proved his  claim that the DPS works against the interests of the Turkish  minority in Bulgaria. His strongest argument was that the  current DPS charter differs significantly from the documents  presented to the Turkish and world public when the movement  registered.    Adem Kenan visited National Assembly Chairman Necmettin  Cindoruk for 18 days, and, he says, succeeded in convincing him  not only of Dogan's double game, but also of the fact that the  DPS serves only the interests of the former "revivers," and  their present day servants -- Dogan's circle.    In an open letter, attached to excerpts of his book "Last  Strike," and personal talks with leaders of parliamentarian and  extraparliamentarian parties, Kenan revealed the grave  socioeconomic situation of the Turks in Bulgaria and the  continuing ethnocultural obliteration. In statements carried by  ORTA DOU, noted politicians supported the mission of Mr. Kenan  and his party in saving the Turkish ethnic minority in Bulgaria.    Mr. Kenan expressed his regret that he could not meet Tansu  Ciller, however, he was assured that, by 15 May, he will receive  an official invitation from the Turkish prime minister.    Mr. Kenan reached an agreement with major business clubs on  the allocation of 50 stipends for Bulgarian students interested  in studying at Turkish higher education establishments. The  sole condition is that they should not be children of  participants in the revival process. He added that 55 of the 75  students sent to Turkey by Dogan are children of such parents.    The DPS does not have two charters and Mr. Kenan is  manipulating the mass media, Mrs. Sherife Mustafa told STANDART  NEWS. According to her, the movement's charter was amended and  supplemented at the last national conference. The charter  merely specifies the functions of the separate structures and  their leaders.</p>

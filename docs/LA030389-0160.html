			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SILVERCREST AGREES TO SELL UNIT MANUFACTURING MOBILE HOMES  </P> <P> Silvercrest Industries Inc. of Santa Ana said Thursday it has agreed to sell  its mobile home manufacturing subsidiary, a move that would reduce the  company's interests to the ownership and operation of mobile home parks.  </P> <P> First Capital Acquisitions Inc. in Los Angeles has agreed to pay $1 million for  the operation and assume $14 million of debt, according to Silvercrest.  </P> <P> Silvercrest placed the manufacturing subsidiary on the block last year. The  unit accounts for more than three-quarters of Silvercrest's sales and profits.  </P> <P> Without the subsidiary, Silvercrest will "not have any significant ongoing  business operations," the company said, although it will continue to own and  operate some mobile home parks.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Silvercrest sold its interest in a big mobile home  subdivision in the San Fernando Valley after being accused of fraud in a  lawsuit by its partner, giant Los Angeles home builder Kaufman &amp; Broad Inc.  </P> <P> Publicly held Silvercrest lost $2.1 million on sales of $55.3 million last year  and has had a recent series of financial setbacks.  </P></p>

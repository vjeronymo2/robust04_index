			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Books: Of virgins, money, death and danger MR WROE'S VIRGINS by Jane Rogers Faber Pounds 13.99, 273 pages FAMILY MONEY by Nina Bawden Gollancz Pounds 13.99, 250 pages THE DESIRED EFFECT by Andrew Gimson Chapmans Pounds 13.99, 202 pages IN 1830 Prophet Wroe, founder of the Christian Israelites, ugly but electrifying, with a voice of honey and thunder, asked his congregation for seven virgins to work in his house. Fathers and other relatives handed them over gladly. Domestic drudgery was a come-down for some, a blessed release for others. Nine months later the Prophet was charged with indecency and tried: the virginal household collapsed. Wroe existed, preaching the imminent end of the world, and the mansion he built near Wakefield was lived in by his descendants until 1956, a tribute to the gullibility of his followers. But nothing is known of his virgins and Jane Rogers has used them to tell their story in interior monologues. These vary. Martha, who has been treated as an animal all her life, at first uses a kind of grunt language, which gradually develops into speech; Hannah is educated and ambitious and will go far; Joanna, soft, ignorant and good, is the most cruelly exploited because the most innocent; and Leah, bitchiest and most experienced (she brings her baby disguised as a foundling into the household), turns on the Prophet when he rejects her advances. The details of housework, cooking, washing, dress and finally a cholera epidemic are wholly convincing and put across with great liveliness; so are the covert sexuality of the household, the girls' rivalries and what would now be called the hunchback Wroe's charismatic presence. Mainly the virgins' lives are hard and humdrum but despite this the writing sings. Jane Rogers has enormous imaginative power and a denseness of vision that includes humour and realism. It seems suitable that she has won both the Samuel Beckett and the Somerset Maugham awards, for both writers, artistically inimical though they may seem, would surely have applauded the way she interweaves the mysterious and the mundane. Family Money is about something seldom discussed or even faced: the link between love and money. Today, anyone with a house bought 30 years ago has riches undreamed of in the past, except by the self-made or the already rich. And whose is this wealth? The house's owner or the heir's? Fanny's husband bought their north London house in the 1950s for Pounds 1,500 and it is now worth half a million. Is it right for her to give chunks - large chunks - of it away, or to halve its value by installing sitting tenants, when she has children and grand-children? That is the theme: now for the plot. One evening Fanny sees a man murdered in the street. She is knocked out, and never remembers what happened. Is she becoming senile, or just odd and frightened? And what has this to do with her plan for the house? Is the young man on the nearby houseboat the murderer, and if he recognises her as the witness is he likely to murder her too? Or - perhaps more likely in both cases  - not? Nina Bawden is here at her best: highly intelligent, good on relationships, affective and social, and with a briskness that saves every situation from what you might expect of it. The murder victim is a poisonous creature, his possible killer beautiful and, perhaps, touching and innocent; the young who seem to be after Fanny's money are loving and kind to her, concerned for their own children, not themselves. The people may be familiar but everything about them is unexpected. Above all the eye that watches them, though sympathetic, is never taken in by any of them; the weather of relationships keeps changing; and money, death and danger take the whole thing beyond the limitations of its official genre, social comedy. The people in The Desired Effect, a first novel of remarkable poise, are in an even smaller social group: one of Sloanes and yuppies, not the same thing but overlapping. Yuppies, being based on money, are less conspicuous in these hard times than they used to be; Sloanes, being perennials not annuals, are more permanently planted in English fiction. Belinda's interest lies in her amazing beauty; but because she is a romantic, seeking true love, at 34 she is still unmarried. When she falls heavily for Tom, it disrupts all well-laid plans: at 24, he is impossible, a sponger and certainly unmanageable. Her flat declines into squalor, neglected friends forget her, the bank writes sharp letters. A Tory parliamentary candidate, a Guards officer out of his depth in today's world, an ugly, sexy girl ('the right age to be a bimbo but not pretty enough'), assorted parents, chums who are on the same network and constituency helpers who are not, work through a well-paced plot. And what might have been over-familiar set pieces - the dinner party of young couples, the Tory selection meeting - are freshly observed and sharply judged. Just the right balance is held between the raised eyebrow and the tender touch: wit and feeling coexist.</p>

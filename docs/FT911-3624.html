			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Brent Walker finalising its 1990 accounts BRENT WALKER, the heavily-borrowed leisure group, is this week finalising its accounts for 1990, a period which saw the group's stop-gap refinancing of its Pounds 1.4bn of debt. The preliminary results are expected in the first half of May with the full accounts published later in the month. Brent Walker is still working with its bankers on a restructuring of its liabilities on a long-term basis, better to match its assets and trading prospects. It is likely that the accounts will be qualified as have those of other companies involved in financial restructurings. Generally, auditors have said that the accounts are prepared on the assumption that the restructuring is successful. Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, the group's property valuer, is understood to have completed a revaluation of the property assets, which will have taken account of the fall in the property market since the last valuation at the end of 1988. Directors may argue with the group's audit committee over how much of the revaluation they incorporate in the accounts. Bankers, however, will look at the actual valuation when assessing the group's ability to carry debt, and will also look at the sale value of whole businesses rather than the value put on individual properties. The group's bankers are also due to see a draft report on the company by Touche Ross, the accountants. However, this report is expected to be revised as the company has reworked its cashflow forecasts. It will eventually form the basis of the restructuring. The task facing Brent Walker and its banks is to raise cash and to prune the business to produce a company capable of servicing its debt. To this end it has been discussing the sale of various assets with interested buyers for some months. Allied-Lyons, the brewing, wines and spirits, and food group, confirmed yesterday that it was in talks with Brent Walker over its brewing and pub interests. It added that an internal memo which had been leaked to the press 'represented an analysis of commercial considerations to be addressed and does not represent any form of definitive agreement'. Allied said that it would be two or three weeks before the two sides could establish whether there might be a deal. Brewing analysts pointed out that following the government's proposals for a shake up in the industry, the sector was in a state of flux. One said 'everyone is talking to everyone else about everything'. One suggestion was that Allied could agree to supply Brent Walker's 1,122 pubs, putting extra volume through its own six breweries, which could be very profitable. This might lead to the closure of Brent Walker's brewery. Brent Walker's brewing and pub interests largely relate to its acquisition of J W Cameron and Tollemache &amp; Cobbold for Pounds 324m in December 1988 from the Barclay brothers. This purchase included two breweries and 855 pubs. The Tollemache brewery in Ipswich was closed in 1989 and production centralised at Cameron's Lion Brewery in Hartlepool. Brent Walker already buys in a sizeable proportion of its beer requirements.</p>

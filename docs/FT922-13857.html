			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Gadaffi renews offer on handover LIBYA yesterday renewed its offer to hand over to a neutral country two of its nationals suspected of the 1988 bombing of an American airliner, but there was no indication it was prepared to yield the men to the US or Britain. Western officials were describing the latest Libyan proposal, which appears similar to one last month, as a 'non-starter.' Britain and the US are insisting they try the men under British or US criminal jurisdictions. The latest Libyan offer was forwarded to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, a day after a special seven-member committee of Arab foreign ministers met in Cairo to seek fresh avenues for compromise before UN sanctions, including an arms and air embargo, come into effect on April 15. The UN is also pressing Libya to allow France access to four men, including Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's brother-in-law, wanted for questioning in connection with the 1989 downing of a French UTA aircraft over Niger in which all 171 passengers and crew died. Arab League officials held out little hope of a breakthrough in efforts to prevent implementation of UN sanctions resolution 748, passed after Libya's persistent refusal to comply with an earlier demand that it hand over the two men for trial in connection with the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, the UN undersecretary-general for political affairs, left Tripoli yesterday for Geneva where he was due to report to Mr Boutros Ghali. Mr Petrovsky, sent to Libya to explain the UN stand, appears to have made little progress in his discussions with the Libyan authorities. Arab officials said they would continue their efforts to defuse the Libyan crisis, but admit that prospects of a breakthrough are slim. The seven member Arab League committee, grouping Egypt, Syria, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania is due to meet again on Sunday, three days before the sanctions are due to go into effect.</p>

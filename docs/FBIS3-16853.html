			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksandr Kopnov and Vladimir </F> Solntsev]    [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- The foreign ministers of  Russia and Japan have agreed to raise the level of cooperation  between the two countries in the field of economic interaction,  Andrey Kozyrev said after the end of official negotiations with  his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata, who is also Japan's  vice-premier.    Andrey Kozyrev said he and his Japanese opposite number had  had "a detailed, circumstantial and constructive conversation  covering a wide range of bilateral problems and some  international issues".    On the initiative of the Japanese side, the question about  the peace treaty between the two countries, including the  territorial issue, was touched upon. "We are not eschewing this  problem," the Russian minister said. According to him, these  questions will be discussed in detail during bilateral  negotiations on the basis of the Tokyo declaration signed during  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October.    The Japanese minister was handed over a message from Boris  Yeltsin to Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, in which  the Russian president expresses the desire to see the head of  the Japanese government arrive for a visit to Moscow as soon as  possible.    Tsutumu Hata said the Russian president's message was "very  amiable". He said the prompt signing of a peace treaty and the  solution to the territorial dispute would be in the interests of  better bilateral relations. He noted that popular support was  needed for the solution in both countries.    Tsutomu Hata confirmed Tokyo's readiness to assist Russian  reforms in all ways. He said Japan intended to cooperate with  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in  establishing a 50 million dollar fund to support Russia's small-  and medium- sized businesses.    Asked about Japan's stance on turning the Group of Seven  into  a group of eight by adopting Russia as a full-fledged member,  Andrey Kozyrev said Japan's reaction was "quite encouraging".</p>

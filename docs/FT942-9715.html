			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Asia urged to fight money laundering Industrialised nations are urging Asian governments that supervise fast-growing financial sectors to join the fight against money laundering, according to members of a task force established by the Group of Seven countries. Mr John Gieve, president of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and under-secretary at the UK Treasury, announced yesterday that Malaysia had agreed to host a conference on money-laundering for the region's financial and legal officials in November, following a seminar in Singapore last year. 'If money laundering is to be combatted effectively, action needs to be taken at the widest possible international level, particularly in countries which are becoming increasingly important as financial centres,' he said in Bangkok. 'A major part of our work is therefore now concerned with the adoption of anti-money laundering measures by non-member countries,' he said. Money laundering and drugs are the subjects of heated debate in Thailand at present. This week the US announced that Mr Thanong Siripreechapong, a Thai opposition member of parliament, had been charged with smuggling tonnes of marijuana into the US. The Thai government says it is considering introducing anti-laundering legislation to help curb the drugs trade. Several Thai politicians are suspected of involvement in drug smuggling, and the Golden Triangle where Thailand, Burma and Laos meet is notorious for opium-growing and heroin production. The 26-member FATF already includes representatives from regional financial centres Japan, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong. FATF officials are hoping to persuade other countries, including Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and eventually China to introduce anti-laundering laws; typically such laws make money-laundering a criminal offence, allow suspicious flows of money to be traced through the banking system, and provide for the confiscation of assets. Mr Gieve and his colleagues said that even if commercial banks feared the expense of implementing such legislation and had concerns about banking privacy, experience in countries such as Switzerland showed that anti-laundering rules were workable and enhanced the reputation of the financial centres applying them.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Technology: On the neural network British companies are waking up to the possibilities of neural computing, which enables patterns to be recognised and masses of confusing data to be analysed, according to a study prepared for the Department of Trade and Industry. Neural computers, with programs allowing them to 'learn' from examples and comparisons, differ from conventional ones in their ability to analyse and predict rather than carry out complex calculations. Originating in US university research into the brain, they are increasingly used in industry and finance. The DTI study, carried out by Hi-Tech Marketing, found companies had responded encouragingly to its efforts to promote the benefits of neural computing. Many of the 150 companies polled planned to adopt neural techniques, 55 per cent within a year and a further 20 per cent in two years. In March last year, the DTI launched a Pounds 6m programme to support seven user clubs and an awareness programme run by Touche Ross, the accountancy group. Projects now under way at the clubs include an intelligent imaging system for automatic track inspection for London Underground, a thermal model of a nuclear waste melter at British Nuclear Fuels, a data extraction system with the Sun Alliance insurance company and a vehicle sensor unit for monitoring traffic congestion. Ray Browne, manager of the DTI's neural computing awareness programme, says many applications can be carried out on personal computers. Neural computers  -also known as neural networks, non-linear programming, adaptive solutions or adaptive programming - are not meant to replace existing systems but to enhance them, he adds. 'It's a mistake to say this is a panacea, but it certainly does open up lots of new avenues.'</p>

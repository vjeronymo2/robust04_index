			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Forte Forte must be glad it did not sell its Gardner Merchant catering business to Compass. The terms of the Alpha airport group flotation put a price tag on the total business, including the contract catering buy-out and the 25 per cent stake Forte has retained, of over Pounds 700m. That is some Pounds 200m more than Compass would have paid. Moreover, after the Alpha deal, Forte's balance sheet will look more comfortable. Gearing will fall to little more than 40 per cent and interest cover will rise above two times. But that still begs the question of whether Forte was right to sell. A degree of ambivalence is indicated by its continuing stakes. The technical reason is that Forte's presence helps ensure existing contracts with customers will be retained. Forte, though, also aims to share in profits growth. Alpha's prospects are limited by its duty-free involvement and the rigorous demands of its airline customers, while contract catering has less room for cyclical recovery than hotels. Yet both are cash-generative businesses with scope for expansion. It will be interesting to see if Gardner Merchant's eventual flotation reveals a performance better than that which Forte has managed in hotels.</p>

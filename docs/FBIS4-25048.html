			<p>BFN     [Text] Accompanied by Wang Xianmin, member of the standing  committee of the provincial party committee and secretary  general, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party  committee, visited the Harbin city party committee and the city  government today and exchanged views with comrades of relevant  departments on how to build Harbin into an international  economic and trade city as quickly as possible. Tian Fengshan,  acting governor, and Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the  provincial party committee, were also present at the meeting.    Yue Qifeng said: Harbin is our country's [words indistinct]  city with a brilliant history. In the present reform and  opening up, it is still very highly renown. Harbin has  conditions for building itself into an international economic  and trade city. However, it should also relatively make  readjustments. First of all, it should emancipate the thinking  and change the irrational industrial structure; second, it  should be determined to readjust the production set-up and exert  strenuous efforts to develop tertiary industry.    Yue Qifeng stressed: Changing the city functions needs the  enthusiasm from various sectors. In addition to boosting the  enthusiasm of large and medium-sized enterprises, it is also  necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm of small  enterprises and let them enter the market. In this aspect, we  should expand the functions of all districts and enable them to  realistically become first-level organizations in an effort to  promote the economic development of districts and neighborhoods.    He said: The greater the hinterland a city has the more  advantages it will have for its future development. So, Harbin  must have good plans for developing what it intends to develop  and so do its neighboring areas.    Yue Qifeng pointed out: The future development lies in  trained personnel and trained personnel lies in education.  Harbin is a scientific, technological, educational, and  cultural center, which should give play to the advantages of  trained personnel and decontrol scientific research units and  trained personnel. It must not be afraid of letting the  knowledgeable people become prosperous ahead of others. It is  necessary to formulate policies and actively develop  nongovernmental scientific research organs in an effort to form  new economic growing points.    Yue Qifeng stressed at the end of this speech: Harbin has  quite a number of large and medium-sized enterprises. The local  government should support and serve large and medium-sized  enterprises, and use their advantages to bring along the  development of regional economy.</p>

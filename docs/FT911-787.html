			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (15): A steady and prudent approach - Profile of Hamish MacLeod, the next Financial Secretary THE MAN who, it is assumed, will be last expatriate financial secretary in Hong Kong's British colonial administration, takes up his post early in August. He is Mr Hamish MacLeod, a rather quiet and self-effacing 51-year-old career civil servant, who comes to the job from a background in trade negotiations and civil service administration. The post of financial secretary combines, in British terms, the role of Chancellor of the Exchequer and permanent secretary to the Treasury. In the past it has been filled by extrovert and powerful men such as Sir Philip Haddon-Cave who ten years ago stood second only to the governor. The present encumbent is Sir Piers Jacobs who is to retire in the summer and has not measured up to that tradition. Mr MacLeod says it is not the financial secretary's job 'to seek to be exciting - that is not actually a virtue.' He prefers 'steady and prudent' as an image, and he chooses to interpret the power-change more in structural than personality terms. 'The post was more powerful when decisions were more ad hoc - the process then was often decision-taking by delay. Now the method of allocating resources is more structured and power is shared with other secretaries. There is constructive tension with everyone putting their arguments into the ring, out of which sensible conclusions emerge.' He expects his job to be dominated by issues such as Hong Kong's economic growth rate, control of public spending, and balancing power with emerging political interests in the Legislative Council. He seems sceptical about whether the official five-year annual GDP growth target of 5.5 per cent can be sustained, though that will depend primarily on the future of the airport project, relations with China, and US decisions on China's most favoured nation status. He is adamant that abandoning or changing the HK dollars exchange rate link with the US dollar 'is not on my list of issues for review because you don't fiddle with a system that works well.' The area he says he has to learn most about is Hong Kong's financial markets. Mr MacLeod started his working career as a management trainee in the British steel industry with Stewarts and Lloyds. and then went to St Andrews for a social sciences degree. From there, at the age of 26, he joined the Hong Kong government as an administrative officer and moved through housing estate management, government expenditure control, and civil service and district administration till he became director of trade in 1983. This was his most enjoyable job - 'you were involved in both strategy and tactics and it gave you the specific challenge of getting agreement with the European Community or the US - and you also got a wider perspective outside Hong Kong'. Since 1987 he has been the Secretary for Trade and Industry and the Secretary for the Treasury. He has been seen as a candidate for the Finance Secretary's job, though critics say that either a more substantial figure should have been hired from outside, or the job should have been gone for the first time to a local ethnic Chinese candidate. As it is, Mr MacLeod will probably go around 1995, before his due retirement age of 57, to make way for a local Chinese who must occupy the post - along with about 30 other top civil service jobs - by the time China takes the colony back in 1997.</p>

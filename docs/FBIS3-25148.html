			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We now know the final decision of Youth and Sports  Minister Boubacar Karamoko Coulibaly in the wake of his talks  with the head of state yesterday. While respecting the decision  of his party, the Party for Democracy and Progress, to withdraw  from the government, he says that, as a patriot, he is duty  bound to pursue the work that he has started with the support of  the Malian youth and sports community, in particular, and the  Malian people, in general. As a result, Boubacar Karamoko  Coulibaly says that, out of respect for the Malian people and as  a citizen, he has decided to remain in the government in order  to make his modest contribution to the construction of a  democratic and prosperous Malian state.</p>

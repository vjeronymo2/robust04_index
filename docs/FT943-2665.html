			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (8): 'For the brave and knowledgeable' - Derivatives / Futures and options offer high rewards, balanced by high risk Financial derivatives, such as futures, options or warrants, can offer higher potential rewards than underlying cash securities, say bonds or stocks. However, unless investors really know that they are doing, they may often be better off leaving derivatives trading to the professionals. 'You can do it, but you have got to be disciplined, market-aware, have a natural interest and understand the risks, have time and a gut feel for the market,' warns Mr Hugh Morshead, director of marketing at brokers GNI. 'This is something for the brave and the knowledgeable,' he says, adding that investors must also have the financial resources to match their trading activities. The intrepid hands-on investor can trade derivatives directly through a futures broker. In the UK, most derivatives are traded on the London International Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe), which lists futures and options contracts on interest-rate products, equities and stock indices. Beginners might want to start with options contracts. 'I'd prefer to see anyone who gets involved in derivatives starting off by buying options,' says Mr Trevor Robinson, head of derivatives at Fidelity International. 'When buying options, you know exactly what you can lose.' A buyer of an option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell particular shares at a fixed price at any time up to a specific expiry date. On Liffe, 'calls' (the right to buy shares) and 'puts' (the right to sell them) are available in 70 different companies and on the FT-SE 100 index. The buying of options involves a limited risk, as the maximum loss is the price paid (premium) for the option, which is known from the outset. Compared with buying a share, which can rise and fall, this is a low-risk strategy. Writing options, on the other hand, entails higher risks and should not be undertaken without a thorough understanding of the product. 'Investors should make sure they have cover of some sort. Writing, for instance, an ICI option without owning the stock would be very foolhardy,' cautions Mr Robinson. Liffe is promoting the use of options by retail investors. 'Equity options are highly suitable for individual investors,' says Ms Karin Forseke, Liffe's director of equity products. They may be used in a number of different ways, she says: as a form of insurance against a fall in the price of a share an investor already owns (a hedge); as a way of generating income from an existing shareholding (writing options against it); or quite simply for straightforward speculation. While private-client use of options on the US Chicago Board Options Exchange amounts to some 70 per cent of total volume, private investors in the UK remain shy of the product. 'It's largely due to a lack of education,' both of investors and the investment intermediaries, Ms Forseke says. 'We get a large number of requests for information from retail investors who tell us: my broker doesn't want me to do this.' 'The industry hasn't succeeded as well as it should have in educating the intermediaries,' agrees Mr Robinson. 'However, they should be given some credit for being sensibly prudent by not letting clients do what they may not understand.' Liffe officials hope that equity options' popularity among among retail investors will be boosted by the recent introduction of rolling settlement on the London Stock Exchange. Under the old system of account trading, investors could buy and sell shares for a quick profit, without having to put up any money or take physical possession of them. Now, each deal has to be settled 10 business days later. Thus, options offer a fairly low-cost way for investors to take advantage of short-term price movements without having to fund the whole position. 'Some private equity business will probably move to the options market' as a result of rolling settlement, says Ms Forseke. For more adventurous investors, futures can offer higher rewards - but also higher risks, since the contracts have unlimited downside as well as upside. Investors should be clear about whether they are dealing in futures contracts to hedge existing cash positions - a conservative strategy aimed at safeguarding the value of the portfolio - or whether they are driven by speculative ambition. 'People who get involved in these markets directly have to understand they're trading, not investing,' warns GNI's Mr Morshead. 'Small-time traders aren't necessarily very good at trading leveraged markets. They often lack the trading discipline required to know what to do when things go badly.' 'If you want to speculate in the futures market, you need to have to have a screen nearby and watch it all day, as these markets can move very quickly,' says Mr Robinson, of Fidelity. If all this sounds too daunting, private investors can place their money in investment funds specialising in derivatives. There is a vast array of offshore funds which invest in derivatives, including commodity, currency, interest-rate, and energy markets. UK investors can buy off-shore funds, although they are not always easy to come by since they are subject to severe marketing restrictions in the UK. Onshore, the closest thing to derivatives funds are Futures and Options Funds (Fofs) and Geared Futures and Options Funds (Gfofs). They effectively replicate the performance of stock indices, such as the FT-SE 100 Index, Japan's Nikkei or the Hang Seng, which is why they are generally called tracker funds. There are some bond and currency tracker funds, but the majority are linked to equity markets. 'More and more wealthy private investors buy index trackers - it allows them to know where they are, rather than handing their money over to a fund manager and taking the risk that they may underperform the index,' says Mr Peter Cotgrove, managing director of John Govett Unit Management, which runs 18 tracker funds. In recent years, index funds have become increasingly widely used in portfolio construction, for tactical asset allocation, hedging and efficient portfolio management, he explains. Many tracker funds provide investors with the opportunity to benefit from rising, as well as falling, markets by offering bull and bear funds. Both the management fees and the costs of switching in and out of these funds are extremely low compared with some conventional unit trusts.</p>

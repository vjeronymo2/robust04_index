			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: Poulenc - Concert On Friday, encouraged by Credit Lyonnais Securities sponsorship, the Royal Philharmonic and the London Choral Society devoted a whole concert to Francis Poulenc. That must have seemed risky, given his status as an endearingly idiosyncratic, backward-looking, narrow-range composer. In the event, it was a red-blooded tonic success. The programme was admirably planned, no doubt by the conductor Jane Glover: no 'light relief' items, but four considerable pieces which tracked Poulenc from his early Diaghilev days to his last years. The ultimate impression was much deeper than many would have expected. Even the beguiling suite from the ballet Les Biches at the start served a vital function, fixing the composer's winsome terms-of-reference the better to let us hear how soberly, sweetly and cogently he developed them later. One hadn't expected Miss Glover to be so sympathetic and searching an exponent of Poulenc, but she turned up trumps. In the Organ Concerto - with Simon Preston, whose registration was brilliantly judicious but his fingers oddly slack in passages that should have a hard tempo giusto sheen - she was far more than an accompanist. She had looked thoughtfully into what Poulenc's orchestra of strings and timpani actually does, and articulated it in pungent detail. The result had a rare poignancy and breadth. After Handel, is there any other organ concerto with such monumental expressive power? The 1959 Gloria was no less persuasive: Lynne Dawson wonderfully melting in the soprano-solos, the chorus by turns warm, elevated and robustly playful. The programme-book (at Pounds 1.50) should have included the text, but it didn't. The particular revelation of the concert was Poulenc's choral cantata Secheresses, commissioned by an eccentric English Maecenas, Edward James, to his own decadent French texts - sun-dried desolation, barrenness, the hurtful indifference of young men. It was not material that the composer would naturally have chosen, but he strove manfully to give it musical life. The cantata had a ruinously under-prepared premiere in 1938, and it remains the most under-performed of the key Poulenc works. Key Poulenc is nevertheless just what it is, and Miss Glover's account of it  -with the London Choral Society in scrupulous dramatic form - opened up dark vistas. With not only the extraordinary orchestral inventions of its four movements, but its abrupt switches between near-atonal scene-painting and stark, heartfelt admissions, it sounds like the matrix for his most sober, most tenderly disillusioned postwar music; it supplies a crucial link. Miss Glover made that crystal clear, as only a clear-eyed devotee could do.</p>

Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, told a meeting of the CBI London region: 'Rises in personal taxation rates would set back consumer confidence at the very time when it is at its most fragile.' He said that any increase in corporate taxes 'would jeopardise the capital investment which is so vital if the UK is to see a sustained period of growth during the nineties'.</p>

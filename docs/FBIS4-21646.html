			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 3--India and Canada today discussed  means of taking forward the disarmament agenda in the framework  of the United Nations, which essentially rests on the conclusion  of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), cutting off  production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and  explosive devices, and establishing a satisfactory verification  regime in this context.    Canada's Disarmament Envoy, Ms. Peggy Mason, who is slated  to  chair the U.N. Secretary General's Expert Group on Verification,  arrived here via Kathmandu to discuss the leading questions of  disarmament with India at the official level.    She is understood to have sought India's active cooperation  in the UN Conference on Disarmament. India's initiative in this  sphere is widely recognised, and dates back to 1982. The Action  Plan enunciated by the late Rajiv Gandhi in 1988 had also called  for an international verification regime under U.N. auspices.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Money, mark two: The EC's new five-year budgetary plan The EC's strained national treasuries can be relied upon to search for evidence of padding, trimmings, or agendas to which they do not subscribe, when on Wednesday the European Commission unveils its five-year plan to expand and redistribute the Community budget. Brussels is not presenting a mere budget, but putting forward the financial framework within which it thinks the process of European political and economic integration, agreed by EC leaders at the Maastricht summit in December, will work. It will be a carefully assembled package. It will have to be, to achieve not easily compatible aims and get the 12 member states to agree priorities for the next five years by the Lisbon summit in June. The Commission's broad political aims are: to extract more money from the member states at a time of recession and national budget tightening; to ensure that in so doing it does not re-open the budget disputes which paralysed the EC in the early 1980s; and to try to match these resources to the ambitions of the EC's new treaty on political union and economic and monetary union. The treaty was formally signed last Friday in Maastricht, but will take most of this year to ratify. Demands for more money by the poorer, southern member states were conceded at Maastricht. But the richer states, led by Germany, are certain to want to limit the extent to which they have to finance their less-developed partners. Hard budgetary bargaining could spill into the national debates on ratification in each member state. It took a year and two fraught summits, in 1987 and 1988, to agree the EC's first medium-term financial plan, called the 'Delors package' after Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. Mr Delors is said to regard the 1988 budget deal as his most important achievement in seven years in Brussels. It started a momentum which allowed the EC to advance further in four years than in nearly four decades - towards the single market, and to the Maastricht treaty. A lot is at stake, therefore, in how well Brussels manages the 'Delors II' package. As one senior Commission official put it: 'Whenever we argue about money, everything comes to a halt.' If the review were to degenerate into a table-thumping wrangle it could block, if not derail, the union train. That is one reason why Brussels will be suggesting only a modest budgetary increase. Officials said yesterday it would seek to raise the revenue ceiling to 1.37 per cent of Community gross national product, from the limit of 1.2 per cent allowed now. To put this in perspective, the Commission in 1987-88 had originally sought a 1.4 per cent of GNP ceiling. This time, a senior budgetary official says, Mr Delors will not go after more, in order to negotiate less: 'Tactically, he believes it is more credible to ask for what you want and need.' The 1.2 per cent limit proved flexible because of higher than expected growth and tight budgetary discipline. This year's budget of nearly Ecu66bn (Dollars 85bn) is well under the ceiling at 1.14 per cent. But there can be no certainty about the Commission's growth assumptions for 1993-97, while it is already clear that spending on agriculture and regional development, the EC's two big budgets, will absorb at least three-fifths of increased revenue. This leaves little over to finance the greater commitments the EC is assuming abroad, particularly as the Common Foreign and Security Policy agreed at Maastricht takes shape. Though this will be run between the governments of the 12 as a form of multilateral co-operation, it is the EC, through the Commission, which will have to provide much of the external aid to underpin it. Nor will there be much money for the industrial restructuring policy through which Mr Delors wants to strengthen European manufacturing - and in which Commission free marketeers already suspect a French-inspired plan to back 'Euro-champions' against Japan and the US. On the assumption of an average of 2.5 per cent annual growth in Community GNP during the five years, the total budget would reach just over Ecu88bn in 1997, at 1992 prices - a modest rise when set against the EC's increasing responsibilities. The revenue side of the EC budget is an accretion of instruments jumbled together over the years, in a way which regularly creates resentment among member states which feel they are not getting a fair deal. The UK has been getting a rebate since 1985 - worth Ecu3.3bn last year - thanks to former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher's advocacy. Spain has successfully insisted that the south and periphery of the EC (Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland) need greater fiscal transfers to have any hope of joining the currency union which will be created by 1999 at the latest. To reduce opportunities for squabbling, long-mooted plans for a new source of revenue linked to member states' relative prosperity have been shelved in favour of making greater use of the so-called 'fourth resource'. This is the payment linked to each country's size of GNP. But up to now it has been used only as a balancing item, making up the difference after customs duties, agriculture levies and the EC's share of value-added tax receipts come in. VAT revenue provides more than half the budget, penalising countries with high consumption and low savings. Beyond this rebalancing of revenue, 'Delors II' envisages doubling regional aid to the poorest four countries. This effort would raise the Structural Funds - for laggard and industrially stricken regions - from Ecu17.7bn this year to Ecu29bn (at 1992 prices) in 1997. The four poorest countries will get their doubling through the new 'cohesion fund' agreed in Maastricht. This would be worth about Ecu2.5bn by 1997 and enable them to meet EC environmental standards and build cross-border transport links. The biggest spender will remain the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The CAP still absorbs 54 per cent of spending, and because it rewards Europe's richest farmers most, is the main reason why the Dutch and Danes do unjustifiably well out of the budget. This should change if the Commission wins acceptance of its plan to reform the CAP. Under the reform, farm spending would rise from about Ecu35.3bn this year to Ecu38.6bn in 1997, but it would be more evenly spread across the EC. Additional allocations will be needed in 1995-96 to get over a short-term spending hump, when CAP costs would reach nearly Ecu40bn. The external aid budget will be made a separate rubric, and get a bigger proportional increase, from Ecu3.3bn now to around Ecu6bn in 1997 at 1992 prices - along with a new reserve of about Ecu1bn. This novelty aims to enable the EC to react rapidly to calls for humanitarian and food aid. Unforeseen aid demands have caused five budget revisions since 1989, leading to long disputes between the Council of Ministers (of the 12) and the European Parliament, and politically embarrassing hold-ups in delivering the aid. The reserve would also underwrite EC loan guarantees, which now stand at more than Ecu10bn. This, a senior official says, should enable the EC to lend more, while guarding against default, and target the aid budget on technical assistance - 'to transfer know-how, not build roads; loans are for that'. Eastern Europe, the Maghreb countries and the Middle East will be the priority recipients. Most commissioners now appear to agree that Mr Delors' wish to finance restructuring, retraining and research in the car, electronics, defence and textiles industries is more than a wheeze for troubled French companies such as Thomson and Renault to get round restrictions on state aid. The two core ideas are to bring some research and development spending closer to the market, enabling a response to innovation in industry, and to use part of 'Social Fund' spending on long-term and youth unemployment to intervene to prevent job losses through retraining programmes. What is likely, officials say, is that companies will tap something like Ecu4bn at today's prices - against current R&amp;D spending of Ecu2.6bn and Ecu1.7bn in Social Fund money not tied to regions. Though in theory any company will be able to apply, France has the industrial support system best geared to scoop up these funds. The southern countries, which already do badly out of the R&amp;D budget because of their low research base, are likely to resist any further drift northwards of funding. Even this modest amount could cause ructions in what will be a very delicately poised exercise.  ---------------------------------------------------------------             EC MEMBER PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS  --------------------------------------------------------------- 1990 (Ecu bn)*                                                  RELATIVE                      PAYMENTS       RECEIPTS     GDP** Belgium                 1.76          0.99       103.0 Denmark                 0.77          1.20       107.2 Germany                10.36          4.81       113.4 Greece                  0.56          3.03        53.0 Spain                   3.67          5.38        76.3 France                  8.09          6.28       108.6 Ireland                 0.37          2.26        67.3 Italy                   6.10          5.68       105.2 Luxembourg              0.07          0.01       128.7 Netherlands             2.62          2.93       103.1 Portugal                0.50          1.10        55.4 UK                      6.53          3.15       103.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

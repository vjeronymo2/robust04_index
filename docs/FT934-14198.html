			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (1): Era of explosive growth - The impetus behind expansion is the international shift towards services, increased globalisation, new technology, declining costs and prices, and deregulation GROWTH, competition and privatisation are today's watchwords in the international telecommunications industry. A few facts give the big picture: Last year the market for international telecoms traffic grew by around 13 per cent despite widespread recession, according to TeleGeography's 1993 survey of the industry.* That was about ten times the growth in global GDP over the year. Around 20 privatisations of national public telecommunications operators (PTOs) are likely to take place in the next three to four years. Taken together, the market capitalisation of the newly privatised companies is likely to be around Dollars 150bn, according to estimates by Mr Richard Ryder, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers in London. Worldwide, some 46 telecommunications companies now have separate listings. By the end of the decade that number could have doubled. In Europe alone, according to Mr Ryder's estimates, telecommunications companies could be a larger equity sector than banks by the end of the decade. This poses unprecedented challenges and opportunities for the sector. Serious international competition between rival alliances of telecommunications companies is becoming a reality for the first time. In the last six months both American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US giant, and British Telecommunications have formed international alliances with global pretensions. Both are bidding to become prime outsourcer to the world's multinational companies. A host of smaller alliances have sprung up, with most PTOs debating which international clubs to join. The eruption of mobile communications into the consumer market seems imminent. For the first time, network operators are marketing packages with wide appeal beyond the business sector. Most analysts project a trebling of the number of cellular subscribers by the end of the decade. If this year's growth figures are sustained, and cheap mobile phones hit the high street by the mid-1990s, that could be a conservative estimate. Growth in international telecoms traffic is slower than in the late 1980s, when it stood at between 15 and 20 per cent a year. But it still far exceeds growth in the international economy, and is set to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. However, it is the nature as much as the size of the recent growth which signifies. Mr Gregory Staple, editor of TeleGeography, notes that in the US, Japan, and the UK, the volume of international traffic added by new carriers last year was, for the first time, greater than the volume of traffic added by the main established carriers. In the US, MCI added more traffic than AT&amp;T; Mercury outperformed BT in the UK; IDC and ITK together added more traffic than KDD in Japan. 'This suggests that head-to-head competition for international market share will be the reality for most carriers in the years ahead,' he says. 'It also implies that the half dozen new international carriers which will cut their teeth in the early 1990s - in Sweden, Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Israel and Chile - may have a harder time than the first generation.' Competition and privatisation are proceeding hand-in-hand. This June, the European Community agreed a timetable for competition between operators for national voice traffic. All the EC's larger countries have agreed to allow new operators to compete with their PTOs by January 1998 - save for Spain, which has an extra five years grace. The thorny question of allowing operators to build new infrastructure of their own has been deferred. But it would be extraordinary if that were not also permitted in due course. BY 1998, it is a fair bet that most of western Europe's leading PTOs will be wholly or partially in the private sector. The remaining government stake in British Telecommunications was sold off this summer. Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands are all proceeding with sales - the last two within the next year. The Spanish and Italian PTOs are already listed, and the disposal of more state shares is imminent. France's Balladur government has begun privatising in earnest, and telecoms is unlikely to be far down the track. Several of Europe's smaller states are thinking of privatising their PTOs, albeit after an interval of corporate status. Analysts discount fears of market saturation. Mr Robert Morris, international telecoms analyst at Goldman Sachs, notes in his latest global survey that in recent years the telecoms sector has consistently outperformed world market averages. 'In every country we examined, the pace of unit growth - whether it be access line growth, calling volumes or network utilisation - outstripped the pace of real domestic GDP growth', he says. The main reasons for the growth are the international shift towards services; increased globalisation; new technology; declining costs and prices; and deregulation. One point is of particular note. As Mr Morris puts it: 'The industry is characterised by large up-front investments with very low marginal costs, such that the unit cost of production is next to zero, contributing to attractive operating leverage and asset turnover rates.' To give an idea of what this means in practice, consider the US-UK translatlantic telecoms route. This summer a consortium of US and European operators ordered a new undersea fibre-optic system from AT&amp;T and STC Submarine Systems, the UK-based supplier. Called Tat-12, it has around five times the circuit capacity of the last system built by STC, and around 12 times the capacity of the first fibre-optic undersea system (called Tat-8), which dates back only seven years. In real terms, the price of successive undersea systems has remained constant, reducing the cost per circuit from around Dollars 45 (Tat-8) to Dollars 5 (Tat-12). In the developed world, the problem is not one of generating sufficient telecoms capacity, but of finding practical and affordable uses for the huge quantity already available - or soon to be so. Privatisation and liberalisation will introduce a host of new operators, small and large, dedicated to the task. Mr Morris views them as an internal dynamic likely to force the industry into still faster growth - 'liberalisation should fuel continued privatisation efforts throughout the world and contribute to the continued growth of this industry.' However, the developed world is only one part of the picture. Most countries have minimal infrastructure and few telephones. Of 133 countries recently studied by the International Telecommunications Union, 70 have fewer than five exchange lines per 100 people. Sweden tops the league with a 'teledensity' of 68 (ie 68 exchange lines per 100 people); Chad takes the bottom slot with a teledensity of 0.07. Most countries are far closer to Chad than to Sweden - including most of Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe. Unspurprisingly, teledensity correlates closely with national wealth. Virtually all countries with annual per capita GDP of more than Dollars 7,000 have a teledensity higher than 30. Most of the world has per capita GDP of less than Dollars 2,000, and a teledensity of less than five. The contrast is as stark within as between regions. In Asia-Pacific, Hong Kong has a teledensity of 49 and Singapore 40, whereas the Philippines languishes at 1.5 and Thailand at 2.7. Even within the European Community, Portgual (at 32) and France (at 52) are poles apart. For most countries, then, line growth is the overriding priority. In many developing and emerging market states, the appetite for more and better basic networks will lead to a telecoms explosion in the next decade every bit as dramatic as that being forged by liberalisation, privatisation and mobile communications in the developed world. Indeed, all three will also be in evidence in developing countries, as governments look for new sources of investment and investors come to see wireless local networks as viable alternatives - not just supplements, as now - to wireline networks. Asia-Pacific is the region set to experience fastest line growth. Mr Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong, expects the total number of lines in the region to have doubled by the end of the decade. That means 100m new access lines, 60m of which will be in China. Should its government provide a climate favourable to sustained investment by overseas companies, the opportunities in China are mind-boggling. The Bejing government's target is to quadruple China's network from 20m to 80m lines. That means more new lines than the existing networks of Britain and Germany put together. To make significant progress fast, Mr Harrington is convinced that China will be forced to allow direct foreign investment by overseas operators within the next year - 'it will probably take the form of joint ventures in which Chinese partners retain majority stakes,' he says. 'But if they want to expand fast, they have got to allow in foreign equity, and a reasonable degree of management control by the overseas investors.' Back to the developed world, the growth of mobile communications will dominate industry headlines over the coming year. At a recent FT conference, Mr Seth Myrby, chief executive of Telia Mobitel, predicted that nine of ten Swedes would have a mobile phone by the end of the decade. Sweden already has the highest level of cellular penetration in the world (nine in 100 inhabitants), but that nonetheless constitutes one of the boldest of the year's claims by a senior industry executive. Bold, but not fantastic - if you include portable phones linked to wireline connections. One by one, cellular operators in Europe and the US are announcing packages for the residential market. The incentive for them to do so comes partly from increased competition: rival cellular operators to PTOs are now licensed in most west European countries, and many beyond. It is also the conseqeunce of the building of new digital cellular networks with far greater capacity and reliability than their analogue predecessors. Although handset prices remain prohibitive for all but the highest-income private consumers, prices are falling fast, and imaginative marketing gimmicks are making the mobile phone a plausible competitor to the fixed-line phone for the first time. So far, the plaudits go to Mercury One-2-One, the UK network jointly owned by Cable and Wireless and US West, which launched its network last month with a special residential tariff offering free local calls in the London area in the evenings and at week-ends. Rival operators have slashed their London prices, and mobile phones are now in the shops of all the main electronics retailers. In the US, the Federal Communications Commission last month laid down ground rules for personal communications services (PCS) networks, unveiling what could eventually be a multi-billion dollar business. PCS, similar to cellular, uses digital technology and greater density of cell sites to improve reception and multiply capacity: see report, page 8. The FCC has decided to allow up to seven licences in each PCS market, with two for larger carriers and five for smaller ones. A significant expansion of US cellular competition is in the offing. For the leading operators, a delicate balance has to be struck between securing one's position in the home market and staking out claims abroad. The recent activities of AT&amp;T and BT, the most aggressive international operators, are a telling commentary. In June, BT hailed its Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, the US carrier, as the telecoms deal of the century. The deal involved BT taking a 20 per cent stake in MCI, the second largest US long-distance carrier, and the formation of a Dollars 1bn joint venture company with MCI to stake out claims in the international market. This summer AT&amp;T set up an international outsourcing venture of its own, called Worldsource. But not to be outdone in the investment league, in August it spent more than Dollars 12bn buying McCaw, one of the largest US cellular companies, to reinforce its position at home. Talk to the executives of both companies, and the word 'multimedia' is more likely to come up than 'telephone.' Services spanning the telecoms/computing/entertainment divides are already on offer; the prospect of new multimedia offerings causes more excitement than any other subject in today's telecoms industry. Later articles in the survey explain why and how. * TeleGeography 1993, TeleGeography Inc., Suite 1000, 1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Washington DC 20036, USA. Dollars 575/Pounds 375.</p>

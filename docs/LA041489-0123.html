			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: THE ARTS  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley recommended an additional $1.9 million for grants to cultural  organizations in his fiscal 1989-1990 city budget proposal Thursday. The  recommendation jibes with interim spending plans for the proposed $20 million  Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts, the city's new cultural funding program, to  become fully operational in July, 1990. If the City Council approves Bradley's  proposal, which contains $450,000 for a new citywide arts festival project and  an additional $155,000 for the city's mural program, $3 million in grants will  be awarded in July. Bradley's action shows "a great effort to upgrade city  support for the arts immediately," said Cultural Affairs Department General  Manager Al Nodal. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

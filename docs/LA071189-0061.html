			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> At least one person in Connecticut died as tornadoes slammed into four  northeastern states. Scores were injured, dozens of homes and businesses were  damaged, thousands were left without power and at least 200 were believed  homeless. The victim, a 13-year-old girl, was killed by a falling tree in Black  Rock State Park in Watertown in west central Connecticut. The twisters struck  two Upstate New York towns and a Long Island village, hit three central  Massachusetts communities and roared into northwestern and coastal Connecticut.  Unusual in the Northeast, tornadoes were also reported in northern New Jersey.  The New York twisters cut a narrow path through the Putnam County towns of  Carmel and Brewster 30 to 40 miles north of New York City. A separate tornado  hit Long Island.  </P></p>

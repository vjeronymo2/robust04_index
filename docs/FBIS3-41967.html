			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia pledges to supply to India at least four more  cryogenic boosters for a SLV-3 rocket, twice more than  stipulated by the 1991 contract.    As the General Director of Russia's Space Agency Yuriy  Koptev  has told INTERFAX, an agreement on additional supplies has been  reached at negotiations in Bangalore between Indian Space  Research Organization (ISRO) officials and Russian experts  earlier this month.    In Koptev's words, India will get two more boosters as  compensation for Russia's forced repeal of the additional  agreements as incompatible with the Missile Technology Control  Regime (MTCR), accords that provide for the delivery of  cryogenic technology and equipment to Delhi and for Indian  specialists' training.    Thereby, Koptev said, "Russia has kept virtually intact the  volume of financing" envisaged by the contract and its addenda  and estimated at $220 Mn. The first booster is to be supplied  in 1995.    In Koptev's opinion, putting relations with ISRO on a  footing  in line MTCR, which Russia intends to join, has not had any  adverse effect on bilateral cooperation, which is borne out by  the two countries short-term plan to sign an intergovernmental  agreement in the field.</p>

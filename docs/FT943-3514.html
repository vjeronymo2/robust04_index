			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / 'Two solitudes' separate further: Quebec Elections - Bernard Simon on growing polarisation in post-election Quebec Canadians voted this week, for the second time in less than a year, to make their country a more difficult place to govern. By sweeping the separatist Parti Quebecois into office in a provincial election, Quebeckers have reinforced polarisation between English and French-speaking Canadians, long described as Canada's 'two solitudes', which began in last October's general election. Recession-weary voters broke with political tradition across the country last year by virtually annihilating two of Canada's three national parties, the Progressive Conservatives, which had held office for nine years, and the left-leaning New Democrats. The third party, the Liberals, easily won the election. But the opposition benches in the federal Parliament are now filled with MPs from two regional groupings: the Bloc Quebecois, which favours Quebec independence, and the Reform Party, with its base in English-speaking western Canada. Reform has little sympathy with bilingualism or Quebec's 'unique' status as an outpost of French language and culture. Federalists took solace yesterday from the relatively narrow margin of the PQ's victory in Quebec. Although it won 77 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly, the PQ's share of the popular vote was only fractionally ahead of the outgoing provincial Liberals. The separatists also won fewer seats on Monday than when they first took office in 1976. Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, expressed a view likely to be heard from many federalist quarters in the months ahead. 'Throughout the election, the Parti Quebecois and its leader again and again stated that this election was about a change of provincial government. Nothing else,' Mr Chretien said. 'I am convinced that in the coming months Quebeckers will once again demonstrate their profound attachment to being a full part of Canada.' The unexpectedly close result will undoubtedly complicate the PQ's drive towards independence. The party's leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, has promised to hold a referendum on sovereignty some time in 1995. Even before the election however, there were signs of division in the PQ's ranks about the referendum strategy. Mr Parizeau sounded a conciliatory note in his victory speech on Monday night. But he also vowed to press ahead with the PQ's raison d'etre. 'In 1995, we will go before Quebeckers and ask them the question that will make a people into a country,' Mr Parizeau said. 'We have begun a new chapter in our history.' The PQ's drive to achieve that goal is likely to test Mr Chretien's political skills to the limit. The new government in Quebec will have several weapons to put federalists on the defensive and win support for a 'Yes' vote in the referendum, if and when it takes place. Mr Parizeau plans to push a 'solemn declaration' through the National Assembly within the next few weeks expressing Quebec's desire to start negotiations with Ottawa on sovereignty. A committee will be set up to draft a new constitution. The PQ is likely to press for recognition internationally that Quebec is more than just one of Canada's 10 provinces. At home, Mr Parizeau will lose no opportunity to point out the costs to Quebec of overlapping federal and provincial jurisdictions, and of the slow, often ineffectual, decision-making among the provinces. He noted in the election campaign that the US, Canada and Mexico took only a few years to draw up a North American free trade agreement, while Canada's 10 provinces have been unable to dismantle their non-tariff trade barriers in 127 years of confederation. The PQ can count on support from the 54-strong Bloc Quebecois contingent in the Ottawa House of Commons. Mr Lucien Bouchard, a former Canadian ambassador in Paris and now the BQ's leader, noted on Monday night that 'we will now have two teams to demonstrate the cost of federalism.' Political observers expect the Liberal government in Ottawa will do its best to avoid a confrontation with the separatists for the next months. Instead, it is expected to go ahead with initiatives - such as social security and healthcare reform - which could demonstrate to Quebeckers that being part of Canada has benefits as well as costs. The problem is that the government cannot put Quebec at the top of its agenda without running the risk of alienating the west. The Reform Party, reflecting the views of many English-speaking westerners, takes the view that it would be better for Quebec to leave than to give it special treatment. Mr Chretien is expected to maintain a relatively low profile in the run-up to the referendum. His strongly federalist views and country-bumpkin image have damaged his credibility in his native Quebec. Liberals are also acutely aware that Mr Chretien needs to be seen as the entire country's prime minister. Even before the Quebec election, the federalist forces had begun casting around for a suitable person to lead them in the referendum. The provincial Liberals' unexpectedly strong showing on Monday has boosted the reputation of their leader, Mr Daniel Johnson, who took over as premier only nine months ago. It would be surprising if Mr Pierre Trudeau, the outspokenly federalist former prime minister, now in semi-retirement in Montreal, did not intervene at some stage. The man to watch however, is Mr Jean Charest, the youthful Quebecker who is one of only two remaining Conservative MPs in the House of Commons. Mr Charest, briefly deputy prime minister last year under the ill-fated government of Ms Kim Campbell, is widely respected and some Liberals would probably be willing to allow him to hold centre-stage. The risk is he could revive the party.</p>

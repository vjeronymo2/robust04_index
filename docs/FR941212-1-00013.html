This is being proposed because the waterway is often frozen during the winter and there have been few requests for bridge openings. This will relieve the bridge owner of the burden of posting personnel at the bridge during the winter months. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before February 10, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be mailed to Commander (obr), First Coast Guard District, Captain John Foster Williams Federal Building, 408 Atlantic Ave., Boston, Massachusetts 02110&hyph;3350.

The Merrimack River is frozen during most of the winter and there have been few requests for bridge openings during this period. The existing regulations require the bridge to open on signal from May 1 to October 31, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. The proposed regulations will extend the period during which the bridge will open on signal: from May 1 to November 15, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. The proposed regulation also will require at least a one hour advance notice for openings at all other times. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Proposed Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD) has requested a change to the existing operating regulations in 33 CFR &sect;117.605 which allow the Newburyport US1 Bridge to open on signal from May 1 through October 31 from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and from November 1 to April 30 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. At all other times the draw shall open if at least a one hour advance notice is given. The proposed regulations will permit the draw to open on signal from May 1 to November 15, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. At all other times the draw will open on signal if at least one hour advance notice is given by calling the number posted at the bridge. This change to the regulations is being proposed due to frequent waterway freezing during the winter months coupled with infrequent requests for openings. The proposed change to the regulation will relieve the bridge owner of the burden of posting personnel at the bridge during the winter months. The drawtenders will be on call to open the draw when the advance notice is given to the highway department by calling the number that will be posted at the bridge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation, under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT, is unnecessary. This conclusion is based on the fact that the regulation will not prevent mariners from transiting the US1 Bridge. It will require only that mariners plan their transits around the new operating hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Quite a time for teenagers This has been quite a time for the economic teenagers - those who rush to dramatic but volatile conclusions on the basis of ephemeral indicators. At the end of last week there were cries of 'credit crunch' on the basis of a one-month drop in seasonally adjusted bank lending this March to Pounds 0.7bn (or 0.1 per cent) compared to an average of Pounds 5bn in each of the preceding six months. A reduction of base rates, we were assured, was now urgent. Then on Monday there was the opposite alarm. The volume of retail sales in March rose by 3.7 per cent above that of February. Now we were told that base rate reductions must be put on hold in view of the vigorous rebound in consumer spending. Both conclusions were of course absurd. Next Tuesday we will have the Bank of England's analysis of bank lending on a three, six and 12-month basis. It has already told us that, on any of these bases, narrow money (M0) is well within, but not below, the government's target range. Broad money, which the government does not target, has been growing by between 6.8 and 9.9 per cent per annum - if anything, reassuring compared with the double-digit rates experienced for so long. The idea of a retail sales boom is even more absurd than the opposite one of a credit crunch. The main reason for the March upsurge was, of course, the desire to beat the April VAT increase. A secondary factor was the early Easter. On a slightly longer view, sales volume fell smartly in the final three quarters of 1990 and recovered very slightly in the first quarter of 1991 to end up half a per cent lower than a year ago. In other words, sales are just about dragging themselves off the bottom. The trade figures are not now as fashionable as credit and retail sales. This is partly because the recession has reduced imports, while the discovery by the Central Statistical Office of hitherto unrealised invisible earnings has diminished the current deficit by some Pounds 6bn per annum. Nevertheless, teenagers found the estimated March current deficit of Pounds 432m 'disappointing' and 'double your money'. Why? Because it was twice as high than February's erratically low deficit and because the so-called market consensus was for a deficit of Pounds 300m. This latter guess was simply the average of the previous five months; and the actual shortfall from it was very well within the normal range of variation. The entire deterioration is due to a swing from an erratically high surplus in volatile items, such as aircraft and precious stones in February, to an erratically low one in March. If we look at quarterly export volumes, and exclude oil and erratics, they have been roughly level pegging since the second quarter of 1990, with small fluctuations in both directions. Imports, on the other hand, have been very gradually declining with economic activity. Arguments about the importance or otherwise of the balance of payments will well up again with economic recovery and will not be stilled until there is a single European currency and no intra-European payments figures. Roll on the day.  ------------------------------------------------              EFFECT OF REVISIONS  ------------------------------------------------ Current balance Pounds bn (At annual rate)                        Old         New 1989                 -19.8       -19.9 1990                 -16.0       -12.8 1990 1st half        -19.2       -19.0 1990 2nd half        -12.9        -6.6 1991 1st quarter         -        -5.8 Source:  CSO  ------------------------------------------------</p>

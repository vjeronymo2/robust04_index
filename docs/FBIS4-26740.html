			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "First Arbitration Law Drafted"] </F>   [Text] China's first commercial arbitration law based on a  United Nations model is being drafted.    A senior Chinese arbitrator said the Model Law, which was  adopted by the UN Commission on International Trade Law  (Uncitral) in 1985, would help bring the Chinese law closer to  international practices.    The draft version of the law is being discussed by China's  highest legislative body, the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress.    But some sensitive issues are yet to be resolved before the  law is approved.    First, there is the question whether ad hoc arbitration will  be allowed in China, where disputes have up until now been  settled by institutional arbitration.    Ad hoc arbitration costs less money and time for feuding  parties than institutional solutions.    Second is whether China should adopt a uniform arbitration  law for both international and domestic commercial disputes.    Despite these issues, there seems to be a general consensus  that arbitration should be independent from administrative  organizations to ensure fairer judgments.    At the moment, the country's arbitration regulations are  part  of the Law of Civil Procedure. But the first national  arbitration law will be separate from the civil procedure law.    Tang Houzhi, vice-chairman of the China International  Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (Cietac), said China  can learn from advanced international experiences.    Cietac and the International Council for Commercial  Arbitration (Icca) organized the International Commercial  Arbitration Conference in Beijing last week.    It was the first time an Icca meeting was held in a  developing country.    But developing countries are playing a more important role  in  international commercial arbitration, said Tang.    Last year China topped the world's 80 arbitration centres in  terms of numbers of cases handled.    Arbitration awards made by Cietac must be enforced by  countries that adhere to the 1958 New York Convention.    China joined the Convention in 1958 but did not implement it  until 1987.    Xu Dayou, another Cietac vice-chairman, revealed that the  biggest dispute handled by his organization so far involved $30  million.    Cietac, China's sole international commercial arbitration  body, has dealt with disputes arising from a growing number of  sectors, including real estate, leasing and joint venture  contracts.    Unlike most Western centres, Cietac combines arbitration  with  conciliation.    The disadvantage of arbitration is that an award can leave a  lasting bitterness between the disputing parties. But  successful combination of arbitration and conciliation can  satisfy both sides.    Tang said China's model can be spread throughout the  Asia-Pacific region.</p>

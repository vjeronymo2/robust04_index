			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL GOES NORTH, SOUTH -- NOT WEST;  </P> <P> EXPANSION: FRANCHISES ARE AWARDED TO TAMPA, OTTAWA. TWO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  BIDS ARE DENIED.  </P> <P> The Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators won approval Thursday to join the  NHL in 1992-93, even though arenas for the teams are only in the planning  stages.  </P> <P> As part of a plan to expand from 21 teams to 28 during the '90s, the league's  board of governors decided to venture into Florida.  </P> <P> Former NHL star Phil Esposito helped Tampa beat bids by groups from nearby St.  Petersburg and Miami.  </P> <P> "To be a part-owner of this thing is the ultimate," Esposito said. "I've done  everything in this game now."  </P> <P> The governors also decided to return an NHL team to Canada's capital for the  first time since 1934.  </P> <P> Among those applications rejected were two from Southern California -- one led  by Laker owner Jerry Buss, to play either in Anaheim or San Diego; and the  other by Harry Cooper, owner of the San Diego Sports Arena -- seeking teams  later in the decade.  </P> <P> Losers in the bidding were told that more teams will be added later.  </P> <P> A San Jose franchise will begin play next year.  </P> <P> The Ottawa bid includes assurance that the owners would overcome objections to  the proposed site of a 22,000-seat arena. Ottawa plans to play its first season  at a 10,000-seat downtown civic center.  </P> <P> Esposito's group struck a deal earlier this week with four Japanese companies  who will help finance Tampa's 18,500-seat arena.  </P> <P> "To those Japanese investors, I thank you," Esposito said. "You're going to  love hockey. I know you like sumo wrestling; we've got it all in hockey."  </P></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Scottish TV explores joint ventures for advert sales SCOTTISH Television is talking to Granada Television and Meridian Broadcasting, the new south of England ITV company, about possible joint ventures in television airtime sales. TVMM, the Scottish company's joint venture with HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the West, also sells advertising for its northern neighbour Grampian Television and for Westcountry. Granada is also talking to Meridian, which decided to sell its own airtime when it began broadcasting in January rather than join an existing sales house. A Granada link with TVMM or Meridian would take both up to a 25 per cent share of ITV advertising - the maximum allowed under existing legislation. It would also create a powerful sales force which could command television advertising sales of about Pounds 400m a year. The talks are taking place against growing tension and turmoil in the commercial television industry. Last month London Weekend Television paid Pounds 14m for a 14 per cent stake in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television. The deal was accompanied by a five-year advertising sales contract under which LWT will receive a fixed annual fee plus commission for selling the Yorkshire group's advertising. Granada was interested in the Yorkshire stake and was upset to be pipped to the deal. Mr Tim Wootton, managing director of TSMS, the largest sales house - which sells advertising for Central Independent Television, Anglia and Ulster - pointed out last night that in 1989 there were 14 separate sales points for ITV advertising. There are now seven. Mr Wootton believes that by 1995 the total could have fallen to three. At the end of this year the Independent Television Commission is expected to review the 25 per cent rule. There will be lobbying to get the rule changed so that the 25 per cent limit is in effect increased by applying it to all television advertising including breakfast, Channel 4 and satellite television.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL SHACKLED MENTALLY ILL MAN FOR 6 DAYS;  </P> <P> HEALTH CARE: PSYCHIATRIST WOULDN'T ADMIT PATIENT, SO HE WAS RESTRAINED IN  PALOMAR MEDICAL CENTER'S EMERGENCY ROOM UNTIL HEALTH ADVOCATE INTERVENED.  </P> <P> A 39-year-old mentally ill man was shackled on an emergency room gurney for  most of six days last month at Palomar Medical Center, because the attending  psychiatrist wouldn't authorize his admission to a psychiatric bed at the  hospital, the county's patient advocate for the mentally ill said Friday.  </P> <P> It was only after the patient advocate appealed to county mental health and  state licensing officials on Oct. 16 and 17 that the man was placed in an  appropriate medical environment.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe this, and I was very fearful for him," said patient  advocate Richard Danford. "I've worked in mental health for 13 years and this  guy just looked terrible. He was in real bad shape, and I wanted something to  be done about it."  </P> <P> Yet, if it hadn't been for a state law requiring a legal hearing for any mental  patient held involuntarily beyond 72 hours, Danford might not have learned  about the man's plight at all, he said.  </P> <P> He reported the situation to the state attorney general's office as suspected  abuse of a dependent adult, and state health care licensing officials were also  called in.  </P> <P> The San Diego inspector, Eleanor Bray, found Palomar to be in violation of  state codes requiring that involuntary mental patients be kept in the least  restrictive, and most therapeutically beneficial, environment.  </P> <P> The man's hands and feet were kept bound in leather restraints without the  psychiatrist's written authorization, Bray found. "There is no documentation in  the emergency room record that alternative methods were considered," her  inspection report said.  </P> <P> He was walked to the bathroom only five times over six days, his medical record  indicated. The "may have contributed to the subsequent development of a  pseudoileus," Bray reported.  </P> <P> A pseudoileus is a form of severe constipation. Psychiatric medication can also  cause the condition.  </P> <P> The man, who had been previously hospitalized at Palomar for paranoid  schizophrenia, was brought to the hospital by police about 3 a.m. Oct. 11  because he allegedly had threatened his father with a knife.  </P> <P> A psychiatrist on Palomar's staff declined to authorize the man's admission to  the hospital, however, because he "was too potentially dangerous and they had a  sensitive milieu" in the psychiatric unit, Danford said he was told later at a  hearing.  </P> <P> Danford said he learned elsewhere that another "justification for not admitting  him to Palomar was that this guy abused the system." He had been hospitalized  at Palomar for schizophrenia at least twice before.  </P> <P> The doctor's refusal to admit the man stuck the emergency room with him. He had  already been legally determined to be dangerous to himself or others, a step  that authorizes involuntary detention for up to 72 hours, so he could not be  released under state law.  </P> <P> "Here they had assessed this guy, put him on hold and then one of their own  doctors refuses to admit him," Danford said.  </P> <P> After the 72-hour hold expired, the hospital again certified the man for  another 14-day involuntary detention, but he still was left in the emergency  room.  </P> <P> The Palomar psychiatrist wanted the man taken to the county's adult mental  health hospital on Rosecrans Street, Danford said. However, the man was  eligible for Medi-Cal coverage. This put him at the bottom of the list for  getting into the overburdened county hospital, since its 62 beds are reserved  for people who have no coverage at all.  </P> <P> After Danford entered the case on Oct. 16, he asked county hospital officials  to admit him for humanitarian reasons. They did so after first returning the  man to Palomar for medical treatment for the suspected pseudoileus.  </P> <P> "He's (at the county hospital) now," Danford said. "He's walking around and  he's not in restraints and he's doing OK."  </P> <P> Palomar officials would not comment on the case, except to say that they had no  evidence the patient was ever in a life-threatening situation. Communications  director Alain Jourdier denied that Palomar has the facilities to treat  dangerous patients.  </P> <P> But the state inspection report notes that "a seclusion room was available on  the facility's psychiatric unit."  </P> <P> At the time of the incident, Palomar had specific certification from the county  as a facility authorized to take involuntary mentally ill people brought there  by police, said county mental health spokesman Patrick Stalnaker.  </P> <P> Since last month's incident, Palomar has asked to have the designation removed,  Stalnaker said.  </P> <P> Danford said the incident at Palomar puzzled him, since the hospital's  psychiatric unit is known as one of the better facilities in the whole county."  </P> <P> It was the doctor's adamant refusal to admit the man to a psychiatric facility  that had plenty of room for him that was the problem, he said.  </P> <P> "The emergency room staff and the mental health staff expressed to me a good  deal of frustration about the quality of care this man got," Danford said.  </P> <P> The state inspection report noted that an inspection at Palomar last March had  also found that its emergency room had no policies to ensure that mentally ill  patients would not be held there beyond 24 hours.  </P></p>

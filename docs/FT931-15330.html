			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Malaysian investment slowdown MALAYSIA is facing a slowdown in investment as new opportunities open in China and elsewhere in the Asia region. According to the government, proposed foreign and domestic capital investments in the manufacturing sector last year fell by nearly 30 per cent to MDollars 22.4bn (Pounds 5.65bn). Total foreign investment approvals in 1992 increased by 2 per cent, with the US, Australia and France making sizeable increases in capital outlay, but these investments related to a small number of petrochemical projects. Other foreign investment showed a steep decline. Investments by Taiwan, at one stage Malaysia's biggest foreign investor, fell from MDollars 3.6bn in 1991 to MDollars 1.5bn in 1992. Meanwhile Taiwan's investments in China have been surging. Vietnam is also believed to be attracting investment funds away from Malaysia and other countries in South-East Asia. Japan's investments in Malaysia declined last year by 30 per cent to MDollars 2.6bn. Mrs Rafidah Aziz, the minister of trade and industry, said Malaysia continued to attract sizeable foreign investments but she admitted that the government was concerned over the decline in domestic investment which, in terms of projects approved, had fallen by 33 per cent last year to MDollars 9.6bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The military situation in Cabinda is controlled by  the Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] despite operations by the Front  for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave [FLEC] and the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in  that province. Colonel Paiva, spokesman for the Cabinda Military  Front Command, says that FLEC concentrates its actions in  settlements to blame the FAA in the event of civilian victims.    By 2100 [2000 GMT] on 23 April, elements of the so-called  Renewed FLEC tried to destroy the microwave communication system  belonging to Angola Telecom enterprise. Using 60-mm mortars and  AKM and PKM automatic weapons, the so-called Renewed FLEC men  infiltrated the (Trezo) area in the outlaying area of the city  of Cabinda, attacking FAA positions. They then intended to  destroy the communication system, isolating Cabinda from the  rest of the country. The prompt response of the FAA detachment  thwarted FLEC's intentions and in their flight they left the  organization's pamphlets. The Cabinda Military Front Command  spokesman says FAA are ready to respond to and thwart this kind  of operations.    [Begin Paiva recording] As well as the attack the Renewed  FLEC carried out against the antennas on 25 April, which was  thwarted, the FLEC recently carried another attack in the (Tando  Zinze) area. On this occasion they ambushed an isolated vehicle  belonging to FAA. Our forces reacted promptly, causing  unspecified losses to the enemy. There is no other event worth  mentioning.

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / US indicators point to recovery US ECONOMIC indicators continue to point to a steady recovery, although government officials remain concerned that businesses are showing little inclination to hire workers to meet with expanding demand. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that factory orders rose by 1.4 per cent in February, erasing a drop in January. The rise to a record seasonally adjusted Dollars 258.6bn stemmed largely from a 10.8 per cent jump in orders in the transport sector. At the same time, the department's index of leading economic indicators - a composite formed by combining statistics such as unemployment, orders, prices and share prices - rose by 0.5 per cent in February. Economists said the figures were consistent with economic growth of 3-3.5 per cent for the full year and suggested the current recovery was likely to be sustained at least past the middle of the year. Some analysts expect a stronger rate of growth in the second half of the year, as lower interest rates encourage housebuilding. Manufacturers' shipments rose by 1.6 per cent to Dollars 257.2bn in February, again offsetting a decline in January, and although inventories rose for the first time in six months, the backlog of unfilled orders increased by 0.3 per cent to Dollars 476.2bn. The index of leading indicators, which was flat in January after a 1.7 per cent increase in December, climbed in February principally because of the increase in unfilled orders, coupled with higher orders for plant and equipment and lower unemployment claims. Signals about the economy have been mixed, however, with only six of the 11 statistics that make up the composite index pointing to growth, and four pointing to contraction in February. One of these four negative indicators in February was consumer confidence, and the Conference Board reported earlier this week that its index of consumer confidence continued to slide in March. Economists believe confidence is unlikely to rise until job creation gets under way, stilling anxieties about the employment market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare April 7 SAPA -- About 10,000 South Africans,  fearing electoral violence, have taken refuge in Zimbabwe. The  mini exodus of mostly white South Africans began at the weekend  and resort hotels are still full. "We will return only when the  peace situation has improved," said Ms Marie Potgieter of Louis  Trichardt, in the northern Transvaal. Ms Potgieter, who had set  up a tent in Harare's Coronation Park camp site said: "Life is  more important than the franchise."    At the weekend, usually vacant campsites north of Beit  Bridge  sprung up into small towns, with scores of large caravans and  multi- coloured tents. "We're bursting at the seams and it's  mostly South Africans who want to get away from the tension,"  said Ms Noreena Ellwell, manager of Goodwood Hotels, which owns  hotels on the main road to the northern border and at Kariba.    Zimbabwean homes are also filling up as South African  relatives and friends arrive. "I've got five families with me.  At three meals a day, they're eating me out of house and home,  and I've got them until well after the election," a white Harare  butchery manageress said.    The South African trade mission to Zimbabwe has made  arrangements for residents to vote in Harare and Bulawayo.    A curio dealer in Masvingo said a group of South Africans  had  parked their vehicles in a circle at the Mutirikwi National  Park. "There are a circle of tents inside the ring of vehicles  and a large fire in the middle. It's so strange, they've gone  into laager, using fancy caravans instead of covered wagons.  And to think 14 years ago it was the Rhodesians going in the  other direction when (President Robert) Mugabe came to power."</p>

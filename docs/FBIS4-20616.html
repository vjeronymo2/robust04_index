			<p>CSO     [Text]    The U.S battery manufacturer Horizon Battery Technologies  Inc. has established a representative office in Japan and begun  activities for electric vehicle (EV) battery business with  Japanese car makers. Horizon's lead battery consists of a glass  filament coating woven in a mesh. In such points as durability,  recharging time, and running time, it is superior to ordinary  lead batteries. The company, in opening its representative  office, is searching for business opportunities in Japan, where  EV development is moving ahead. For now, Horizon will sell the  batteries for EV use but is planning for the future to develop  them for large-scale use in power generation. The company's  battery consists of layers of glass filament mesh alternating  with material permeated with sulfuric acid. The battery's  features are that there is no leakage due to vibrations, the  material is resistant to corrosion, and the battery requires no  adding of water or other maintenance. The recharging rate in  rapid recharging is 50 percent in eight minutes and 99 percent  in 30 minutes. Moreover, the battery lasts through over 900  rechargings, making it superior to ordinary batteries in cost  and durability. In the United States, the company has had an  inquiry from Chrysler, which is investigating the possibility of  using its battery in electric vehicles. Horizon, judging that  there is demand in Japan, where the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry has been at the center of planning to  popularize electric vehicles, has established a representative  office here and decided to contact Japanese car makers. Horizon  is a battery manufacturer established in June 1993 as a joint  venture between BDM Technologies Inc., a company offering such  engineering services as production technology and transportation  systems, and Electrosource Inc., a venture firm that develops  batteries. Horizon has been engaged in limited production of EV  batteries. Moreover, having also been planning licensed  production on a global scale, the company has been investigating  the possibility of advancing into Japan.</p>

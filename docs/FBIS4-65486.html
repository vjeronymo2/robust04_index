			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Martino Meets </F> Delors"]    [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, May 16 -- Italy's new Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino met with European Commission President  Jacques Delors Monday morning [16 May] and assured him that  "Italy's European vocation will not diminish."    "I confirmed to Delors that the fundamental lines of our  country's European policy will not change," Martino told the  press after his 25-minute meeting with the executive Commission  chief.    During their meeting, Martino explained the current  political  situation to Delors, saying that last March's general election  "did not represent a victory for the right so much as a victory  for an alternating system in which there is a governing majority  and a minority which keeps checks on what it does, while  preparing to take its place."    Answering journalists' questions about a recent statement in  which Belgian Deputy Premier Elio Di Rupo criticised the  presence of "neo-fascist ministers" in the Italian government,  Martino said "I share Di Rupo's opinion: I would never have  entered a government with neofascists either. But in this  government there are no neofascist ministers. There are five  from National Alliance, which is different from the Italian  Social Movement, which in its turn was not the Fascist Party."    National Alliance was born last year out of the Italian  Social Movement, but two out of the five National Alliance  ministers joined the new party without ever belonging to the old  one.    Top-ranking sources at the Commission confirmed that "the  foreign minister came to reassure us and dealt with the issue of  National Alliance ministers in government. Martino stressed  that the "basic lines of foreign policy will not change."    According to Martino, a victory for the left in last March's  elections would have meant a return to the old power-sharing  system of government "similar to the one which recent electoral  changes were designed to eliminate."    Martino met Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Mahmud Musa  yesterday evening for talks on the Mideast situation, and is  expected to hold bilateral talks with foreign ministers Klaus  Kinkel of Germany, Alain Juppe of France and Douglas Hurd of  Britain during his stay in Brussels for the regular monthly  meeting of EU [European Union] diplomatic chiefs.    The new Italian foreign minister has been dubbed a  "Euro-skeptic" by the British press which cites his friendship  with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and his  membership of her mainly anti-EU Bruges Group.    Martino also focused his attention on economic matters  during  his official debut in Brussels, saying that the new government  would now have to study carefully the decision of its  predecessor to place reservations on its approval of the 1995 EU  budget.    "It is a problem that we have inherited... We have revised  our national accounts and gross national product system,  something which other countries have not yet done," said  Martino. "We are going to end up paying more. We are currently  trying to overhaul our finances, which means holding down public  spending and therefore stopping it from increasing."    Italy recently became a net contributor to the EU, paying  more to Brussels than it receives from it. The refusal to  approve the 1995 budget gave Italy a lever in difficult  negotiations over milk quotas.    On the topic of the EU loan to Italy, the third two billion  ECU tranche of which can now be released if Italy meets certain  economic goals, was also dealt with by Martino who said "it is  going to be up to the government and to the treasury minister in  particular to decide" whether to ask for the money.    "I have always seen this loan as being rather like a letter  of intents from the International Monetary Fund which, as  everybody knows, is not drawn up and imposed by the IMF but  drawn up and requested by governments so that they are obliged  to do things that they would have had to do anyway," said the  foreign minister.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan shrugs off De Benedetti news MOST BOURSES were closed for Easter yesterday, with the exception of Milan, while Madrid, Oslo and Copenhagen were also closed on Thursday. The Spanish market will be open on Easter Monday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN extended Thursday's gains on the second day of the new account. The Comit index rose 4.57 to 507.58, a gain of 1.3 per cent on the week, after rising 3.47 to 503.01 on Thursday. Turnover fell to around L63bn from Thursday's L78bn. Shares controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti recovered from Thursday's falls, caused by the unexpected news that he had been sentenced to more than six years in jail for his involvement in the 1982 bankruptcy of the former Banco Ambrosiano. Olivetti gained L55 to L2,660 after dropping L75 or 2.7 per cent to L2,605 on Thursday. Cir gained L61 to L1,568 after falling 1.2 per cent or L19 to L1,507 the previous day. Several large block trades in Euromobiliare, San Paolo and Alenia were reported on Thursday and Friday. PARIS flirted with the 2,000 level on the CAC-40 index on Thursday before falling back on profit-taking. The CAC-40 went as high as 2,000.58 before closing 12.48 lower at 1,978.21, little changed on the week, in moderate turnover of FFr2.9bn. Peugeot fell FFr19 to FFr713 as investors were disappointed that the company had cut the 1991 dividend. Euro Disney weakened further, losing FFr4.30 or 3.1 per cent to FFr132 with 1.03m shares traded. Analysts said the stock could fall as low as FFr120 in the near term as investors continued to switch into the parent company. Beghin-Say rose FFr17 to FFr646 after some French brokers issued positive notes on the company's merger with Eridania of Italy. Cerus, another Franco-Italian company, dropped FFr7 or 4.9 per cent to FFr137 on news of Mr Carlo De Benedetti's sentencing. FRANKFURT was dull ahead of the Easter holiday. The DAX index rose 5.44 to 1,749.53 on Thursday for a 0.7 per cent gain over the week. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, was 2.07 stronger at 711.16, up 0.6 per cent on the week, while turnover fell to DM5.1bn from DM5.6bn. The Cartel Office said that it would approve the planned merger between steel groups Krupp and Hoesch after the former said it would sell its car suspension division. Krupp lost DM3.50 to DM135.50 while Hoesch gained DM2 to DM252. Siemens slipped 20 pfg to DM688.10. Earlier trading in Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI) shares, the computer division of the electronics group, was suspended after Siemens said that it had completed the integration of SNI. Robert Fleming in London has issued a sell note on Siemens saying that forecasts for cost-cutting and growth at SNI are over-optimistic. ZURICH closed firmer with the expiry of share options and futures having little affect on the market. The SMI index closed up 1.4 at 1,871.3 on Thursday for a 2.3 per cent gain on the week. Among the banks, UBS bearers rose SFr20 to SFr3,880 while CS Holding bearers advanced SFr10 to SFr1,985. Georg Fischer remained active with its bearers SFr40 higher at SFr1,050 and registered shares SFr15 firmer at SFr195. AMSTERDAM closed mixed on Thursday. The CBS Tendency Index gained 0.1 to 126.5, a rise of 2.2 per cent on the week. Wolters Kluwer was Fl 1 stronger at Fl 75 following its forecast of stronger profits growth. There was little reaction to ING's announcement that it expects profits this year to match its 1991 results. Shares in the banking and insurance group slipped 30 cents to Fl 51.60. Borsumij slipped back Fl 1.40 to Fl 62.80 following its confirmation earlier in the week of a 70 per cent decline in 1991 net profit. The trading group is anticipating an improvement in 1992 earnings. Unilever improved further, rising Fl 1.90 to Fl 190.50. STOCKHOLM closed higher in thin, pre-holiday trade on Thursday. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 4.9 to 989.2, up 1.4 per cent on the week, as turnover fell to SKr378m from SKr573m. The real estate and construction sector jumped 2.6 per cent, following SKr7 gain to SKr118 in Skanska B shares after the company indicated an improvement in profit in the current year. BRUSSELS fell from Thursday's highs on late profit-taking. The Bel-20 Index ended up 4.56 at 1,196.17, up 1.5 per cent on the week. The pharmaceutical group UCB climbed BFr550 or 2.5 per cent to BFr22,200.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 16                              Hourly changes  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Open       10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm    3 pm      close 1170.77  1170.54  1169.78  1170.13  1169.64  1169.97  1170.99  1169.83                 Day's High  1171.45    Day's Low  1167.64            Apr 15     Apr 14     Apr 13     Apr 10     Apr 9            1167.06   1157.52    1153.23     1155.74   1140.98  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / BT cuts long-distance call prices by up to a quarter British Telecommunications cut the price of long-distance calls within the UK by up to a quarter yesterday, in a move likely to increase pressure on its competitors in the business market. The reductions, which will cost BT Pounds 244m over a full year, were made within the terms of an agreement with Oftel, the telecoms regulator, obliging BT to cut its charges by a total of about Pounds 500m in this financial year. They take effect from September 29. Oftel does not dictate the precise price cuts BT must make, only their total value. The reductions are the latest in a series aimed by BT mainly at business users, who account for a disproportionately large share of long-distance calls. Mercury and other new entrants in the business sector earn most of their revenue by undercutting BT on long-distance call charges. In a clear indication of its predicament, Mercury said yesterday it would be cutting business prices 'shortly after' BT, but refused to say by how much. Earlier this year Mercury briefly retained the morning peak rate for some business customers after BT abolished it. Yesterday's price cut involves abolishing the higher rate band for calls of 35 miles or more, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of all long-distance calls made in the UK. It follows a 20p reduction, to 25p, in the cost of calls to directory inquiries, which takes effect today at a cost of Pounds 75m a year to BT. Taken together, price cuts already made and those due by November will have cut BT's charges by about 12 per cent over the course of the year. BT said that an average business customer, with an annual call charge bill of Pounds 431, would save Pounds 20 (4.6 per cent) after the long-distance price cut. The average residential customer, with an annual bill of Pounds 164, would save Pounds 6 (3.7 per cent). The changes leave BT with about Pounds 190m worth of cuts to make before the end of the year. Analysts believe the most likely target is international calls, where BT faces increasingly stiff competition. Mercury earns nearly half its revenue from international calls, and several new operators - including Worldcom and MFS - are competing hard for corporate international business. Energis, a new UK long-distance operator using electricity pylons for its network, opened for business this week. BT also announced a range of improved discount schemes for high-usage customers. Small businesses with quarterly call bills of Pounds 50 or more will gain the most from the discount schemes. Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, said the price cuts 'were made possible by BT's Pounds 20bn investment in modernising the UK telephone network over the past 10 years'. The Telecommunications Users Association welcomed BT's price cuts, and the simplification of the tariff structure. Lex, Page 24</p>

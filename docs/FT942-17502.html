			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / As They Say in Europe: Italy, a case of plus ca change? Many must have envied the Italians last weekend. They could choose among any number of new parties, usually led by totally new politicians. For the first time in the history of a democracy, voters could go to the polls without being tempted from the path of reason by the siren call: 'Throw the rascals out.' The rascals had already been thrown out by the police and the judiciary. But this cheery view was mistaken, as Monday's perceptive fantasy in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung indicated. It highlighted the problems faced by the typical Italian voter: 'Mr Rossi has nothing to complain about. His wife had come through her operation satisfactorily, the children bring average reports home, the textile industry in his central Italian small town is working well. But this election breaks Mr Rossi's head.' Too much had changed, little was left over from the old system. New symbols, new words, new faces. So, even by Sunday night, Rossi had not been able to make up his mind. When he did, it seems he voted for Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia. The victory of this grouping and what the press call le tre destre italiani  -the three Italian right wing parties - led to some complex speculation. Corriere della Sera decided they each had, more or less, 'ancient and profound roots but together represent a new phenomenon'. This is part of the truth. Berlusconi's policies were described by an Italian professor, writing in Le Monde, as 'all originating in the Thatcherite pharmacopoeia of Anglo-Saxon neo-conservatism.' That highlights what was truly a new phenomenon in Italy. A party had not only put forward a political programme but had actually won the election, too. According to the professor, Marcello Da Cecco, Berlusconi's borrowed programme ends in the 'definitive defeat of the trade unions and the re-distribution of income in favour of the rich'. But Da Cecco did, accidentally, explain how an Italian party had been able to succeed when burdened with a political programme, especially such an appalling one. He noted that it had 'neither been questioned nor discussed' during the campaign. By tradition, politics were never discussed on such occasions. Italian parties had highly political names - Christian Democrats and so on - but no content. Only slogans. Berlusconi's party seems to be the opposite: it has policies, and a football supporters' slogan as its name. But will Forza Italia, in fact, now try to put its published programme into practice? The contradictions within the ramshackle electoral coalition which the party leads have been well documented. If, however, there should be an Italian government with policies that go beyond paying off appropriate interest groups and being blown half-heartedly by any wind that seems to prevail, the possibilities are revolutionary. Will foreign policy no longer consist solely of trying to find out what Washington thinks it ought to be? Will Italy's Euro-policies cease to be a poorly constructed replica of France? Berlusconi has no love for Brussels, though, and we could see one crucial element of the 'Thatcherite pharmacopoeia' emerge as the new Italian government pursues a European policy that is nearer to that of Britain. Perhaps Italy will no longer be a reliable opponent of anything that smacks of the free market and liberalisation. Such a change would vindicate fully the complex game played by the British government which, this week, ensured an increase in the number of votes needed to block proposals in the EU's council of ministers. Still, any kind of political activism will worry Rossi and the millions who voted for Forza Italia. Italy's post-war success, a real economic miracle, has been founded on the basis of a government which does nothing and creates obstacles. As an Italian colleague, an expatriate Rossi, told me: 'The trouble with policies is that they can go wrong.' He is comforted that Berlusconi was helped to his present eminence by his contacts with the former socialist leader, Bettino Craxi, now charged with corruption. And that he was a member of the powerful P2 Masonic lodge which seems to have lurked behind some unsavoury milestones of contemporary Italian history. So, the answer to the above question might still be a reassuring 'niente'. Perhaps not that much has changed, even though all the papers write of 'the Italian revolution'. As Niccolo Machiavelli, the greatest political commentator of them all, noted: 'People are always taken in by appearances and the outcome of events.'

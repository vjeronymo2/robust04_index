			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sheffield makes Pounds 52.9m acquisition SHEFFIELD Insulations Group, the supplier of insulation products and services, is to more than double in size by buying WMS Group for Pounds 52.9m, funded with a Pounds 49.9m rights issue. WMS makes fittings for plastic windows and doors. The 3-for-2 issue, priced at 135p, will reduce the roughly 54 per cent holding of the Adsetts family - who will not take up their entitlements - to about 20 per cent, making the stock more marketable. Sheffield's shares rose 5p to 176p. More than 50 institutions had yesterday contacted brokers Panmure Gordon. The issue, which is fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu, was more than twice oversubscribed, a spokesman said. Sheffield, which lifted profits by 95 per cent to Pounds 2.95m in 1992, said capital gearing of 41 per cent would be less than 10 per cent following the deal. It expects maintain the interim dividend at 1.8p and will propose a same again final of 3.6p. Pre-tax profits at WMS, whose products include knobs and locks for PVC-u windows and doors, increased from Pounds 1.95m to Pounds 5.03m in the year to August 1992 on turnover of Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 18.8m). The consideration, to be satisfied with Pounds 47.1m cash and Pounds 5.8m in shares, is based on warranted pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.5m for 1993. WMS, which planned to float until owner Mr Joe Moore decided to sell instead, has net assets of Pounds 11.1m, no borrowings and positive cash flow. The company received three bids. Mr Moore will hold 6 per cent of the company and has undertaken not to sell his stake for a year. He has signed a 12-month service contract with Sheffield. Mr David Kent, WMS chief executive, will join Sheffield's board. About 65 per cent of the value of WMS's turnover is manufactured, to the company's designs, in the Asia Pacific region, where wage costs average between 20p and 40p an hour compared with a UK average of Pounds 4.50 an hour. Some 95 per cent of WMS's turnover is made overseas. WMS covers 75 per cent of forecast currency requirements and is exposed to fluctuations. Mr Tim Steer, smaller companies' analyst at stockbrokers Smith New Court, said: 'WMS chairman, Joe Moore, is important to the company. He's the man behind the successful Far East sourcing which no-one else in the UK does. He's a bit of a taipan out there.' He said the deal was priced at 12 times forecast earnings - which compared favourably with competitor companies - but WMS must maintain operating margins of 19 per cent.</p>

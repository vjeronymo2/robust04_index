			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Food retailing The UK food retailing industry is in a transitional phase. The sector's shares are too. Fundamentals suggest grocery stocks remain undervalued. But such considerations have been swamped this year by a surge of adverse sentiment. There may be relief that the chancellor has - at least temporarily - refrained from extending VAT to all food products. Yet other fears have gnawed away valuations. The hoary old saturation debate has raised its head again. The discount sector seems set to flourish. The promised US-style warehouse clubs may not instantly see huge slices of market share changing hands but they will create a new price floor. Food volumes have fallen to their lowest level for more than a decade and will only recover slowly. The restrained spending seems not so much a factor of consumer confidence but cash: high unemployment rates and low earnings growth mean there is limited money in shoppers' purses. Despite such worries, the big grocers will record some solid earnings gains this year thanks to their prodigious opening programmes. Isosceles's continuing misfortunes will provide opportunities for cannibalistic growth. The devaluation effect will eventually feed through to prices, perhaps this summer. By then, recovery should have firmly taken root. In such uncertain times the market believes that - apart from special situations like Asda - it is wise to stick with quality stocks, such as J. Sainsbury and Wm Morrison. It is difficult to disagree.</p>

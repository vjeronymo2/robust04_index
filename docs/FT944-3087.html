			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Japan trade barriers cost consumers 'Dollars 75bn a year' Japan's trade barriers cost Japanese consumers between Dollars 75bn and Dollars 100bn at prevailing exchange rates in 1989 - or between 2.6 per cent and 3.8 per cent of gross national product - according to a study by three Japanese economists. Without the barriers, Japanese imports of the most highly protected products, such as food, cosmetics and chemicals, would have doubled and each Japanese consumer would have been about Dollars 890 a year better off at 1989 exchange rates, the study says. Complete trade liberalisation would have resulted in a fall in domestic production of more than 20 per cent in certain sectors, including wheat, oilseeds, leaf tobacco, canned fruit and vegetables, and cosmetics. However, the authors say removal of import barriers would have only a small impact on Japan's trade surplus, because a reallocation of resources and macro-economic forces would cause its exports to rise almost as fast as imports. Liberalisation would also result in the loss of 180,000 jobs. Although roughly 10 per cent of employment in the protected sectors, this is only 0.3 per cent of total Japanese employment. Furthermore, the cost to the Japanese economy of preserving each job was about Dollars 94,000 a year in 1989, almost three times the earnings of an average salaried worker in Japan. The estimates are much higher than those in similar previous analyses because the study is the first to try to calculate the impact of non-tariff barriers. These are a far more important form of protection than tariffs in Japan and raise prices by more than 400 per cent in some cases, the study says. It says that although Japan has liberalised some trade barriers since 1989, the restrictive effect of remaining protection appears to have increased in the past five years. The study is based on a comparison between the unit values on a cif (carriage, insurance, freight) basis of imports landed at Japanese ports and of Japanese producer prices for more than 40 categories of goods. It puts the unit value differential for all products surveyed at 178 per cent, and at 281 per cent for food and beverages. The highest differentials for individual products are 737 per cent for rice, 718 per cent for tea and roasted coffee and 662 per cent for cosmetics and toiletries. In most cases, the study says, the differentials are largely caused by non-tariff barriers such as import quotas, preferential government procurement, price support programmes and restrictions on domestic sales. However, it finds that a 607 per cent differential for radio and television sets is mainly due to the superior quality and technological sophistication of Japanese-produced products compared with imports. Most of the value of the differentials is pocketed by Japanese producers. After allowing for the losses to producers, importers, distributors and government revenue, trade liberalisation would have benefited the Japanese economy by at least Dollars 17.4bn in 1989, the study estimates.

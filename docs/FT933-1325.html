			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / LVHM shares fall SHARES in LVMH, the French luxury goods group, fell by 4.1 per cent yesterday after a steeper-than-expected fall in first-half profits and a warning on the full-year result. The group blamed a further deterioration in the champagne market and a 26 per cent drop in the contribution from Guinness, the UK drinks group in which it owns a 24 per cent stake, due to sterling's weakness against the French franc.

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HAS 13 IN '89 ALREADY;  </P> <P> DETROIT'S LITTLE MAN WHITAKER IS BIG WITH HOME RUN BAT  </P> <P> Lou Whitaker struck a blow for every little guy who ever aspired to play ball  when he hit eight home runs in May.  </P> <P> Whitaker now has 13 for the season, one more than he hit in his first four  years in the major leagues. He was tied with Baltimore's Terry Tettleton for  the American League lead going into today's game between the Tigers and  Orioles.  </P> <P> "He's a strong little guy and he's got a great body," Detroit interim manager  Dick Tracewski said. "And he's getting bigger. When he first got here, Lou  weighed 150 pounds soaking wet. Now he's up to about 175."  </P> <P> For most of his career, Whitaker has been a leadoff hitter. This year, he's  hitting No. 3 and seeing pitches he can hit with authority.  </P> <P> "You don't have to be big to hit home runs," Whitaker said. "Joe Morgan already  proved that, and Hank Aaron was little when he first started, too. You just  need a quick bat.  </P> <P> "I've learned what I want to do when I'm at the plate. I've always been a  patient hitter, my walks show that. Now, I just look for the right pitch in the  right situation."  </P> <P> "Lou's always had good bat-speed and that's a key regardless whether you're big  or small," said shortstop Alan Trammell. "He's getting the head of the bat out  in the strike zone and boom, he's popping some long ones."  </P> <P> As his power has increased, however, Whitaker's batting average has slipped,  dropping for four consecutive seasons after he hit .320 in 1983.  </P></p>

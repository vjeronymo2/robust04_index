			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Frontiers changes in new name deal NEW Frontiers Development Trust, the emerging markets investment trust, is being restructured in a deal which will result in a change of manager and of name to the Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets Trust. Shares in the trust rose 11p to 100p yesterday. The deal involves the disposal of the 75 per cent stake owned by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund and of its holding in the convertible unsecured loan stock. Ivory &amp; Sime, which has managed the trust for the past two years, will lose the management contract which will pass to Foreign &amp; Colonial's newly formed emerging markets subsidiary. MNOPF owns 16 per cent of Ivory &amp; Sime. Mr Allan Munro, Ivory &amp; Sime's managing director, said 'it is disappointing and frustrating to lose the trust after what we've achieved for shareholders.' He added that when Ivory &amp; Sime took over management, only 52 per cent of the trust had actually been invested in emerging markets - that proportion is now 92 per cent. 'The discount has narrowed from 25 per cent to 8 per cent,' Mr Munro added. According to Micropal, the trust was ranked third (out of 7) in the emerging markets sector over the year to September 1. The change means the loss of the third largest investment trust run by Ivory &amp; Sime, which has around Pounds 3.5bn of funds under management. Ivory &amp; Sime will receive Pounds 511,000 in compensation for termination of the contract. The deal will give Foreign &amp; Colonial an investment trust in the emerging markets field, where it had considering launching a new issue; the restructuring of New Frontiers will give it an Pounds 100m trust. The annual fee will be 1.5 per cent, compared with the 0.75 per cent charged by Ivory &amp; Sime.</p>

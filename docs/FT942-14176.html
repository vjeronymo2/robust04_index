			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Borrowed time Despite the highest ever monthly deficit in March, the Treasury has kept the 1993-94 public sector borrowing requirement Pounds 3.9bn below its own budget forecast. In normal circumstances, that might have cheered the gilt-edged market. By beating its target - and changing the rules to count gilts purchased by banks and building societies as funding - the government has already tucked away some Pounds 10bn towards this year's borrowing requirement. That leaves only Pounds 33bn gilts to be sold over the next 12 months, once redemptions and a modest contribution from National Savings are taken into account. It is a measure of the market's current pessimism that this seems such a tall order. With the benefit of hindsight, the authorities might have over-funded by more when the going was good, even if that meant living with uncomfortably tight money markets. Selling Pounds 3bn gilts a month will require a deft touch so long as bond markets remain nervous. Yesterday's rise in gilt yields in response to higher than expected average earnings shows the sensitivity. While other labour market indicators are weak, the modest rise in earnings is unlikely to mark the start of an inflationary spiral. But there are other reasons for caution: pay settlements are edging higher, the scope for further interest rate cuts has been called into question, political worries could again unsettle sterling. While economic fundamentals were exceptionally benign for bond markets, funding the PSBR had no discernable impact on gilt yields. Now that the liquidity flows from the US have dried up, this year could be different.</p>

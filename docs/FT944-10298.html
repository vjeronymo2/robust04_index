			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Silver soup tureens fetch glittering price A pair of elaborate 18th century silver tureens sold for just over Pounds 1m at Sotheby's yesterday, Antony Thorncroft writes. It was an auction record for English tureens, and Sotheby's said the tureens  -made in 1744 for Henry Bromley, 1st Baron Montfort - were the most important items of English silver to be offered at auction for a decade. The buyer was anonymous, but Arab collectors have recently acquired many similar examples of ornate silver. The tureens - which each weigh 16lbs - were designed by Palladian architect William Kent and made by goldsmith George Wickes. Their most distinctive feature is handles in the form of horses' heads. The tureens cost Henry Bromley Pounds 500.</p>

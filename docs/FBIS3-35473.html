Finance  Minister Avraham Shohat said earlier he would not agree to  endanger Israel's economy by giving in to the latest Palestinian  demands. On the background leading to the deadlock, which  focuses on the issue of customs, this report from Michel  Zlotowsky in the French capital:    [Begin Zlotowsky recording] Sources close to the negotiators  told Qol Yisra'el that everything that had been discussed during  the five previous meetings now needs to be reassessed and  rediscussed. We never said it would be fun and easy. It is  difficult, it is complicated, and it will indeed take some time,  said the sources.    It is clear now after the first meeting yesterday that the  Palestinians did not buy the Israeli idea of a customs envelope,  meaning that Israel and Gaza-Jericho would constitute one bloc  for customs-related issues. In fact, the Palestinians did not  have second thoughts, but something happened between the fifth  and sixth round compelling them to review their position. This  something, according to observers here, may well be the economic  agreements signed with Egypt, and mainly with Jordan. Following  King Husayn's stern warnings last month, a Palestinian  delegation led by Faruq Qaddumi went to Amman and signed within  two days a set of agreements at the beginning of January. Now  the Palestinians seem to be tied by those agreements, preventing  them from (?constituting) this one market proposed by Israel.  How to break this deadlock is precisely what is being  discussed. [end recording]    The talks are to resume next week. Finance Minister Shohat  is returning home today.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Hu Guohua (5170 0948 5478)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 22 Jun (XINHUA) -- During his recent  inspection of Guangdong, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the  CPC Central Committee, Chinese President, and chairman of the  Central Military Commission, offered important opinions on the  development of special economic zones. He pointed out: The  establishment of special economic zones in China is an important  step for promoting reform, opening up, and modernization. This  move fully demonstrates Comrade Deng Xiaoping's and our party's  enterprising spirit, farsightedness, revolutionary courage and  resourcefulness, and political wisdom. I hope that people of  the special economic zones, following the course set by Comrade  Deng Xiaoping, based on the achievements and experiences they  have gained, and through deepening reform in all fields, will  revamp the economic structures, improve overall management,  improve workers' training, improve the investment environment,  improve economic efficiency, refine the democratic legal system,  and promote spiritual civilization, to raise the overall  economic and social development level to a new height. All in  all, we should create new resources and raise our work to a new  level.    From 15 to 21 June, accompanied by Comrade Xie Fei, member  of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the  Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and Comrade Zhu Senlin,  governor of Guangdong Province, Comrade Jiang Zemin inspected  Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Shenzhen, and Meizhou.  During the trip, Jiang Zemin, ignoring fatigue, inspected  factories and rural areas to keep himself abreast of the current  industrial and agricultural production situation and the  building of grass-roots party organizations. He was very happy  to see the progress in reform and development in all areas. He  said: Under the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial CPC  Committee and government, Guangdong's developmental trends have  been very good, and developments in the special economic zones  have also been very good. The progress is indeed encouraging.    Wherever he went, Comrade Jiang Zemin cordially conversed  with grass-roots cadres, technical workers, and the masses,  discussing various issues with them and seeking their opinions.  In Zhongshan City's Sanxiang Town and Meixian County's Fuda  Town, he visited peasant households braving storms and muddy  roads. He cordially engaged in small talk with peasants Zheng  Xiangui, Zheng Dikun, and Liang Bo; visited their houses and  farms; inquired about their incomes and lives; and hoped they  would continue to work diligently to improve their livelihoods.    General Secretary Jiang Zemin heard work reports by the  Zhuhai City CPC Committee, the Shenzhen City CPC Committee, the  Meizhou City CPC Committee, and the Guangdong Provincial CPC  Committee. He fully affirmed the tremendous achievements and  contributions Guangdong and the special economic zones have made  over the last 15 years. He said: The establishment of the  special economic zones was an important strategic decision made  by the party Central Committee and the State Council according  to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal. With the exploratory and  diligent work over the last 15 years, the special economic zones  in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and other localities have gained many  valuable development experiences, making important contributions  to the country's reform, opening up, and modernization drive.  They have truly played an experimental role and served as the  country's showcases and pacesetters. Practice proves that our  decision to establish special economic zones is completely  correct. The special economic zones' achievements and  contributions are the result of the hard work and common efforts  of the large numbers of constructors of the special economic  zones; these achievements and contributions are also inseparable  from the forceful support of other localities.    Jiang Zemin said: Our reform, opening up, modernization  efforts, and economic and social development across the country  are a closely knit and unified whole. Cooperation should be  stepped up between special economic zones and other localities,  between the Zhujiang Delta and the Chang Jiang Delta and the  Bohaiwan region, and between coastal areas and the central and  western parts of the country. They should make use of their own  resources, fulfill each other's needs, and help each other make  progress, so they can develop in a better and more coordinated  manner. They must not try to replace others, especially not to  exclude each other. All localities, particularly special  economic zones and the more economically developed coastal  areas, should self-consciously make contributions to the  development of a nationally unified socialist market economy.    While discussing special economic zones' development  experience, Jiang Zemin pointed out: The experience in building  special economic zones all boils down to one point -- that is,  we must unwaveringly insist on using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the party's basic line as our guidance, and should emancipate  our minds and do things in light of reality. We should be bold  and yet steady; we should integrate theory with practice; we  should create on our own while making use of others' experience;  we should strive to create and develop Chinese characteristics  and a Chinese style for our special economic zones.    While stressing that special economic zones should be  further  improved, Jiang Zemin said: The central authorities' resolve to  develop special economic zones will not change; the central  authorities' basic policy toward the special economic zones will  not change; the special economic zones' status and role in the  country's reform, opening up, and modernization drive will not  change. We should interweave the development of special  economic zones with the entire process of the socialist  modernization drive. The view that special economic zones'  status and role can be reduced or even gradually eliminated in  the new situation in which a trend of all-front opening up to  the outside world is being formed across the country is  incorrect.    Jiang Zemin believes that the development of special  economic zones has entered a new stage in which we should strive  to improve the overall quality and create additional advantages  of special economic zones. Then, under the new circumstances,  how can the additional advantages be created and new progress be  made? He discussed five important points to this end.    The first point is that special economic zones should  continue to actively explore and gain more experience in  accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic  structure across the country. Jiang Zemin said: In the special  economic zones, we should accelerate the change of operational  mechanisms of state-owned enterprises and establish a modern  enterprise system. We should accelerate the cultivation and  development of the market system, with emphasis on the  development of the production-factors markets and intermediate  organizations of various categories. We should accelerate the  change of government functions and improve working efficiency.  We should speed up the establishment of an income distribution  system which takes the principle of "to each according to his  work" as its mainstay, gives priority to efficiency while taking  fairness into account; and we should improve the social security  system. We should accelerate our participation in international  economic cooperation and speed up the pace of necessary  convergence with the international economy. While carrying out  well these auxiliary reforms, we must formulate laws and  regulations for governing the socialist market economy, and we  must also handle well the relationship among reform,  development, and stability and make the three coordinate with  and promote one another.    The second point is that the special economic zones should  maintain a fast and healthy economic development through  deepening the reform and opening wider to the outside world. In  order for them to do so, Jiang Zemin emphasized the necessity to  do work well in the following respects: First, great efforts  should be made to readjust the economic structure and develop  more high-tech industries; this is an urgent task for special  economic zones at present. In principle, the special economic  zones and open coastal cities should no longer develop  labor-intensive industries with low-levels of technology, such  as processing supplied materials, processing materials according  to samples provided, assembling provided parts, and engaging in  compensatory trade. Such industries should be gradually moved  to the interior regions; such a move will help the special  economic zones and coastal regions accelerate the upgrading of  their industrial structure, and it is conducive to the economic  development of the interior regions, to reducing the blind flow  of labor forces out of the interior regions, and to gradually  narrowing inter-regional development gaps. The special economic  zones should continue making great efforts to develop an export-  oriented economy, and the key to success in this regard is to  raise levels of technology and improve the product quality. We  should strive to produce and export products of advanced  technology and high-added value. Second, great efforts should  be made to improve management. We must improve management in  order to develop the economy. The management system should be  comprehensive, the management work should be strict, and  management standards should be raised. We should raise  management standards in all fields -- economic, legal,  administrative, and social management fields alike. It is  inconceivable to engage in the modernization drive in the  absence of modern management. The special economic zones should  take the lead in performing and enforcing modern management.  Third, a further step should be taken to improve the investment  environment of the special economic zones. It should include  both the "hard" environment -- a good infrastructure -- and the  "soft" environment -- good working efficiency, service,  legislation, and systems. Fourth, we should attach importance to  and step up overall planning for the special economic zones.  Only when we have a scientifically oriented general plan can we  reduce blindness and losses in construction.    The third point is that the special economic zones should  continue to introduce investment from abroad and establish  lateral ties at home and make new contributions to promoting  common development and common prosperity across the country.  Jiang Zemin said: The special economic zones and the  economically more developed coastal regions should persistently  develop lateral ties with the interior regions, and they should  make the most of their superior features, share out work,  cooperate with one another, and take advantage of each other's  strengths. This is extremely important for the development of a  unified socialist market economy across the country, gradually  narrowing the development gaps between the coastal regions and  the interior regions, and achieving a common prosperity. I hope  that the leading comrades in the special economic zones will  constantly study how to strengthen economic and technological  cooperation between the special economic zones and the interior  regions and to support the development of poor interior regions;  and this is something to the advantage of the economic  development in the special economic zones and across the  country, and it is well worth doing.    The fourth point is that the special economic zones,  particularly the Shenzhen and Zhuhai Special Economic Zones,  should make more contributions to our country's resumption of  sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao and to its maintenance of  long-term prosperity there. Jiang Zemin said: The broad masses  of the compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao are patriotic,  actively supporting the reunification of the motherland and  willing to contribute to the modernization of the motherland.  The more the Shenzhen and Zhuhai special economic zones develop  socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist  spiritual civilization, the more they will play an important  role in helping maintain long-term prosperity in Hong Kong and  Macao.    The fifth point is that we should make great efforts to step  up the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the  special economic zones and improve the party's leadership over  the work of the special economic zones. Jiang Zemin said:  Comrade Deng Xiaoping particularly and unequivocally pointed  out in his important talks made during his southern China  inspection tour that a socialism with Chinese characteristics  can be constructed only after both material and spiritual  civilization are built well. We must have a profound  understanding of this important idea of Comrade Deng Xiaoping,  and conscientiously and persistently attach importance to both  civilizations. We should see that the special economic zones  and open coastal regions have achieved very rapid economic  development and the situation of their material civilization has  been gratifying in recent years. Relatively speaking, they  still have many problems in the building of spiritual  civilization, although they have made quite a few achievements  in this regard. In particular, we must make great efforts to  combat decadent behaviors and evils, such as disrupting public  order, corrupting social values, and infringing upon the  people's interests. We should take both stopgap measures and  radical measures, and truly build both civilizations well. I  hope that the special economic zones will not only march in the  van in reform, opening up, and economic development, but also  play a leading role in the building of spiritual civilization in  China. Jiang Zemin also pointed out: We must know clearly that  the additional advantages to be created for the special economic  zones should include economic advantages, advantages in both  material and spiritual civilization, ideological and political  advantages, and the advantages of all-around social progress.  For this reason, the special economic zones must make progress  in building both civilizations. In appraising a leading cadre's  job performance, we must assess not only his ability and  achievements in building material civilization, but also his  ability and achievements in building spiritual civilization.  Under no circumstances should material civilization be  developed at the expense of weakening or even sacrificing the  building of spiritual civilization. Instead, the development of  material civilization should help the development of spiritual  civilization. We should satisfy the needs of the people's  cultural life, while constantly providing a motive force and  intellectual support for the development of material  civilization.    Jiang Zemin stressed: As China deepens reform and  opening up, establishes a socialist market economic structure,  and advances the modernization drive, special economic zones  should also correspondingly develop their characteristics. Some  original preferential policies and measures practiced in special  economic zones will naturally undergo changes, and it is  necessary to develop new characteristics for special economic  zones through creating and fully displaying their new strengths.  Special economic zones should be "special." Jiang Zemin  encouraged special economic zones and the broad masses of cadres  and people throughout Guangdong Province to lift their spirits  and to continue their efforts to complete various tasks even  better.    General Secretary Jiang always has the production, lives,  and  well-being of the masses at heart. Because his inspection tour  coincided with serious floods in some areas of Guangdong, he on  many occasions inquired about the disaster situation, living  arrangements for people in flood-affected areas, and the flood  control and relief work and expressed his deep concern to people  in those areas. The accident of the collapse of a textile  factory building occurred during his inspection of Zhuhai, and  he thus heard a briefing by the city party committee, ordered  them to give treatment to the injured with all their strength,  and he personally visited injured workers at the hospital. When  he was informed that floods had also successively hit Guangxi,  Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang, Comrade Jiang Zemin again  gave important instructions. He asked principal leading cadres  at all levels to swiftly go to the forefront of the  disaster-stricken areas to organize and direct the people to  carry out flood control and relief work. He demanded that  flood-prone areas make preparations because preparedness averts  peril. He also urged everybody to display the superiority of  socialism and the fine tradition manifested that "whenever  people in one part of the country are hard hit, their fellow  countrymen in other parts of the country will come to their  aid." He called for concerted efforts by the party, government,  military, and the masses to strive for a victory in flood  control and relief work.    During his inspection of Guangzhou, Comrade Jiang Zemin also  went to the Guangzhou Military Region and heard a briefing by  Commander Li Xilin and Political Commissar Shi Yuxiao. He  encouraged comrades in the military region to intensify their  studying, to do their jobs well, and to comprehensively improve  the troops' quality and fighting capacity. He asked the broad  masses of officers and men to display the work style of fearing  no danger and fatigue and of conducting continuous struggles in  current flood-fighting and relief work so as to make the maximum  contribution to ensuring the security of the lives and property  of the people and to rapidly restoring production and  construction in the flood-stricken areas.    Those accompanying General Secretary Jiang Zemin in his  inspection of Guangdong were Liao Hui, Zeng Peiyan, Hu Guangbao,  Teng Wensheng, Yu Xiaosong, and other comrades in charge of  relevant departments under the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council.</p>

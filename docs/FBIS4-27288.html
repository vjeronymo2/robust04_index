			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The preparatory  committee for the formation of the South side headquarters of  the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification  (Pomminnyon) published a statement on May 26 under the title "We  Denounce in the Name of the 70 Million Fellow Countrymen Such  Outrages as Confiscation, Search and Telephone Cutoff on the  Office of the South Side Headquarters of Pomminnyon Committed by  the United States and the Kim Yong-sam `Regime' To Foil the  Second Meeting of the Joint Presidium of Pomminnyon".    The statement said the meeting was due to be held on May 26  with the headquarters of the North, the South and overseas  dispatching their views on the agenda to the joint secretariat  in Tokyo, Japan, by using telephone and fax and the joint  secretariat coordinating it. But the United States and the Kim  Yong-sam regime sent ten odd policemen to the office of the  South side headquarters of Pomminnyon on the morning of the day  of the meeting to cut off the telephone, search and seize all  documents, and illegally kept the telephone line cut off till  13:00, It noted, and went on:    Such outrage could not be seen even under the preceding No  Tae-u military regime. When the first meeting of the joint  presidium of Pomminnyon was held in 1992, even the No Tae-u  military regime dared not commit such outrage.    Thus, the violence this time fully revealed the  anti-reunification nature of the Kim Yong-sam regime styling  itself a "civilian government."    It does not make sense at all for the Kim Yong-sam regime to  hold sway over the reunification question.    Moreover, the United States, a chief culprit in the division  of the Korean peninsula and which is raking in profits from it,  can neither bring nor want an independent and peaceful  reunification of our country, and the Kim Yong-sam regime wholly  dependent on the United States, as clearly seen in the "Uruguay  Round negotiations" and in the countermove over the "nuclear  issue" of the North, cannot bring an independent and peaceful  reunification of the country.    If the Kim Yong-sam regime repent of its crimes in the past  and take progressive steps for the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country, though belatedly, it can be  pardoned in the spirit of the great national unity, but if it  continue committing anti-reunification, anti-national acts, we  will fight against it together with the 70 million fellow  countrymen.</p>

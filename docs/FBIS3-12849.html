He referred to the efforts of the Islamic republic of Iran  to  help resolve the problems in the region and said Iran has always  been after peace and contributed to establishment of lasting  peace in the region.    He also said Iran has launched mediation efforts in the  fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia and is trying to ease  the tense situation in Afghanistan through peaceful means.    Rowhani expressed concern over the presence of alien forces  in the Persian Gulf and described the movement of large warships  in the area and dispatch of military hardware to the region as  dangerous to regional peace.    Elsewhere in his remarks, he called the trend of the United  Nations activities as worrying and said some UN decisions  especially that of the Security Council did not conform to the  objectives of the Council.    The very ineffective decisions of the Security Council on  Somalia, on horrible crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on recent  massacre of Muslims in Al-Khalil prayers ground in occupied  Palestine show that the Security Council is incapable of  carrying out its obligations, he said.    Rowhani said China as a giant economic power is expected to  assume a significant role in economic development of Iran in  light of historical bonds and the friendly relations between the  two countries. Qian in response said that relations between  the Islamic Republic of Iran and China have been based on mutual  respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.  He called for promotion of Tehran-Beijing ties.    He confirmed that some committees of the United Nations have  become tools in the hands of Western governments. He referred  to the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Committee  and called it unjust becuase, he said, the committee is  scrutinizing the status of human rights in most countries but it  does not raise the issue of human rights in the United States.    He referred to close cooperation of Iran and China in the  United Nations Human Rights Committee and emphasized that the  cooperation should expand in the area.    He said that China was ready to play an active role in  Iran's  development plans and implement different plans including its  nuclear power plant, building wagons for subway trains, cement  plants and manufacturing military equipments.</p>

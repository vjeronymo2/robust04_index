			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / New group targets the roots of corruption: Michael Holman examines an attempt to fight the scourge of the developing world A CAMPAIGN to fight corrupt business practices around the world may seem the contemporary equivalent of cleaning the Augean stables. An attempt to do just that gets under way in Berlin today. A gathering of some 70 businessmen, specialists, and senior officials from development agencies and governments rich and poor are preparing for the official launch of Transparency International - 'an international coalition against corruption in international business transactions.' This objective may seem optimistic, to say the least. But its founders are confident that it is an idea whose time has come. The concepts of good governance and accountability have unprecedented international support, as relevant to exposing corruption in Brazil or Italy as in Zaire or Nigeria. Behind the project, nearly two years in gestation, is a group of hard-headed veterans of aid, commerce and development, eminent in their own fields, and with experience spanning the developing world. Among those playing an active role in the Berlin launch is Mr Robert McNamara, the former World Bank president, while the names of a distinguished 30-member advisory council are due to be announced this week. They are expected to include Mr Oscar Arias, former president of Costa Rica and Nobel prize winner, Mr Andy Young, a former US ambassador to the UN, and Mr Haartmut Ruppel, Namibia's attorney general. All share concern about the impact of corruption, generally agreed to have increased dramatically over the past decade. 'Nobody in the business world pretends any more that corruption is not one of the most important and damaging factors in third world development,' says a businessman and adviser to TI, who has drawn from his experience in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. The damage to third world economies, he points out, goes beyond the fact that the wrong supplier or contractor might be chosen. 'When a government is persuaded - that is bribed - that it needs aircraft or a food processing plant which are unnecessary or unjustified, not only is there a loss of scarce foreign exchange resources. Those resources will have been diverted from worthwhile projects.' Mr Peter Eigen, a former senior World Bank official and interim chairman of TI, has no illusions about the immensity of the task, which embraces former communist states as well as third world countries. 'We recognise the realities of international commerce and competition,' says Mr Eigen, who in the 1980s served as the World Bank resident representative for east Africa, based in Nairobi: 'Our approach must be evolutionary.' At the heart of the campaign will be the drive to win support for a code of conduct. Governments, lending and aid-granting agencies and companies will be invited to subscribe to the code, central to which is a pledge not to offer or accept bribes. What may help make the code effective is the quid pro quo tactic TI will employ. 'Initially there may be only a few countries where business and government abide by our code, a few 'islands of integrity',' as Mr Eigen puts it. The campaign will therefore focus at the start on five or six governments in developing countries and eastern Europe who are prepared to support the code. These governments - some have already had discussions with TI - will restrict tendering for state contracts to corporations who have themselves signed the pledge. 'We expect these leading countries will create a momentum by their example,' says Mr Eigen. Apart from seeking support for honest business practices, TI will offer a range of services, helping to strengthen rules and systems for international procurement bidding to help eradicate corruption, or assisting governments to establish anti-corruption investigative agencies, providing a clearing house for information on corruption, and examining serious contraventions of the code. TI may be optimistic, but it is certainly not nave. It would be invidious to suggest that some of TI's supporters in the business community are poachers turned gamekeepers, but a 50-page analysis of corruption by one of the founders displays considerable insights into the world of contracts and kickbacks. Top of the contract kickback list are aircraft, ships, military supplies and telecommunications, followed by big industrial and agro-industrial projects. Then come dams, bridges, airports and hospitals, and bulk supplies - oil, cement, fertiliser. As a rule of thumb, 5 per cent of Dollars 200,000 will win the help of a senior official below top rank. The same percentage of Dollars 2m and you are dealing with the permanent secretary. At Dollars 20m enter the minister and senior staff, while a cut from Dollars 200m 'justifies the serious attention of the head of state.' Suggestions that existing safeguards against corruption are effective, such as international competitive bidding, or pre-shipment inspection are dismissed: 'The short answer is that with complicity between buyer and seller they are largely ineffective.'

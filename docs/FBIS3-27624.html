			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong  Province will become an even more attractive "hot spot" for  overseas investors with the deepening of various new reforms,  Vice Provincial Governor Lu Ruihua said here today.    Two new reforms involve foreign investors, namely, the  reform  of the taxation system and the reform of the foreign exchange  management system, Lu told a news conference.    These reforms are beneficial to overseas investors because  they are designed to adapt China to the global market, he  explained.    According to Lu, Guangdong's unique advantages in wooing  overseas investors include a relatively developed market  economy, a fast pace of reforms and preferential policies  granted by the central authorities.    "More importantly, Guangdong Province is near Hong Kong and  Macao and is the ancestral home of millions of our Hong Kong,  Macao and Taiwan compatriots, overseas Chinese and foreigners of  Chinese origin," he said.    These advantages have enabled Guangdong to score rapid  progress in its economic and trade cooperation with the rest of  the world, he said.    He cited the following facts to illustrate Guangdong's  achievements:    -- Guangdong's exports soared by 46 percent to 27 billion  U.S. dollars in 1993, roughly 29 percent of China's total  exports;    -- Its imports shot up by 71 percent to 19.1 billion  dollars,  20 percent of China's total imports; and    -- It introduced 9.65 billion dollars in overseas funds last  year, 40 percent of the country's total.    To date, the province has brought in a total of 29.6 billion  dollars in overseas funds, excluding the Daya Bay Nuclear Power  Station, Lu Ruihua said.    He invited more overseas companies to invest in Guangdong in  such areas as the power industry, ports, railways, roads,  airports, automobiles, metallurgy, electronics, chemicals, new  materials, biological engineering, farm and sideline products  processing, export-led processing, and services.</p>

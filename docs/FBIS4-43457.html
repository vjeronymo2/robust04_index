			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Consistency in a politician certainly makes  people feel sorry for him. The consistency of Konstandinos  Stefanopoulos, who decided to dissolve the Democratic Renewal  [DIANA] party--a decision that was implemented yesterday and was  accompanied by his statement that he was leaving active politics  as he had pledged to do before the [European Parliament, EP]  election--certainly made many people, even more than those who  voted for him, feel sorry.    DIANA yesterday ended its political life after nine years on  the country's political scene. The party's Political Council  and Executive Committee, who met yesterday under Stefanopoulos'  chairmanship, decided by a majority vote to put an end to an  effort which, if nothing more, was an example of consistency.    The Political Council and Executive Committee reviewed the  EP  election results as an extreme honor "and it constitutes a  reward for DIANA's policy, which was consistent and in agreement  with the general interest." [passage omitted]    A statement notes that the party's leading members "consider  that continuing the party's efforts would be outweighed by the  difficulties, of which the biggest are the lack of media  coverage to promote the party's political platform and the lack  of financial resources."

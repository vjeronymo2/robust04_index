			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LA JOLLA  </P> <P> Eager to save a cluster of deteriorating cottages in La Jolla threatened by the  wrecker's ball, the San Diego Historical Site Board agreed unanimously  Wednesday to recommend that the City Council take tough measures to transfer  the historic Green Dragon Colony to a new owner.  </P> <P> With the Chart House restaurant chain stepping into the fray as a potential  buyer, the board proposed that the city staff help mediate the sale of the  former arts enclave.  </P> <P> The board also recommended that the council consider acquiring the property  through condemnation and selling it to a buyer willing to preserve the  structures.  </P> <P> The fate of the cottages, built from 1895 to 1906, has remained clouded since a  potential deal fell through last year between wealthy La Jolla preservationist  Bob Barrymore and a bank representing the trust that owns the 1-acre site off  Prospect Street.  </P> <P> With a one-year hold on demolition of the structures set to end April 22, the  Chart House chain has surfaced as a potential buyer willing to preserve the  cottages.  </P> <P> The chain, which operates a restaurant in a renovated structure next to the  four remaining cottages, has hired an appraiser to determine the property's  worth, according to Tony Ciani, a La Jolla preservationist eager to see the  enclave saved.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Sunday -- The number of dengue cases  in Penang in the first two months of this year has exceeded that  recorded in the whole of 1992, Health Minister Datuk Lee Kim Sai  said today.    He said records showed that there were 190 cases in January  and February compared with 152 in 1992. Last year, there were  601 cases with one death in the state.    The two-month figure also makes Penang the state with the  highest number of cases for that period.    "We are making efforts to control the disease in the state,"  he said after launching a blood donation campaign organised by  the Selangor and Federal Territory Hainan Association at Thean  Hou Temple.    Lee said there were 5,598 dengue cases with 23 deaths in the  country last year compared with 5,473 cases with 24 deaths in  1992.    So far, the highest number or cases were recorded in 1991 --  6,628 with 39 deaths.    He attributed the large number of cases to the increase in  the number of areas left as breeding grounds for mosquitoes and  the ministry's ability to detect dengue cases better.    Lee said the ministry and local authorities had intensified  efforts to check the disease.    He said 25,969 summonses were issued to those who had  allowed  Aedes mosqultoes to breed in their premises last year.    During the same period, 1.2 million ringgit in compound was  collected while 102 people were charged in court for related  offences.    Lee said the number of dengue cases were higher in urban  areas. Last year there were 4,693 cases with 22 deaths in urban  areas compared with 905 cases with one death in rural areas.</p>

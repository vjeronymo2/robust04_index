			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / German forces cleared for UN actions: Historic court decision removes ambiguity over participation The green light for German troops to participate in future United Nations' operations outside the Nato area was yesterday given by the constitutional court in Karlsruhe, the highest legal authority in the country. The historic judgment removes the constitutional ambiguity which prevented Germany from participating directly in the Gulf war and in virtually all UN military operations. The decision means German forces will be able to take part in both peacekeeping and peacemaking exercises of the UN, provided the German parliament approves each operation. It says the Bundeswehr can take part in international missions as part of Germany's international alliances, including Nato and the Western European Union, in carrying out decisions of the UN Security Council, or directly under the authority of the UN itself. The judgment was instantly welcomed by the German government, its Nato allies, including US president Bill Clinton, and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, as a move which would enable Germany to play its full part in international peace operations. It was also welcomed by the German opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), which brought the legal challenge to the constitutional court, as an essential measure to clarify a longstanding grey area in the German constitution. In two important ways, however, the constitutional court has given future German governments greater room for manoeuvre than the SPD had hoped. It makes no distinction between peacekeeping and peacemaking operations, and it requires a simple majority vote in the Bundestag rather than the two-thirds majority necessary to override the constitution. The decision was announced as part of a 142-page judgment by the court on the participation of German military personnel in three UN-sanctioned operations outside the Nato area - the aerial surveillance by Awacs aircraft of the 'no-fly zone' in Bosnia; the involvement of a German frigate in enforcing the UN embargo on former Yugoslavia in the Adriatic; and the attempt to enforce peace in Somalia, from which Germany has now withdrawn. In each case, the court concluded that the exercise did not contravene the German constitution, but it called for the two exercises in former Yugoslavia to be sanctioned retrospectively by the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. Chancellor Helmut Kohl welcomed the judgment as confirmation of the government's policy of stepping up its involvement in UN missions, but hastened to say it would not necessarily lead to a rash of decisions to send German soldiers abroad. 'We will decide on a case by case basis,' he said at a press conference in Berlin with Mr Clinton. 'We are not going to create a mood of 'Germans to the front'.'

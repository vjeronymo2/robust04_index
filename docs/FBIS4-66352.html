A large electric power construction army numbering tens of  thousands in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang now  has the attitude of a decisive battle and is fighting in the  barren and dangerous valleys in the upper reaches of the Huang  He, the "Black Belt" of Guanzhong [central Shaanxi plain], and  other construction sites as an unceasing high tide of  construction appears in each project. At the large Lijia Gorge  hydropower station, where they plan to install the four biggest  Chinese-made generators with unit capacities of 400MW, after  impounding the river and completing excavation of the foundation  for the key facility and making progress with other important  construction tasks, they entered the key construction phase for  pouring the concrete for the 165-meter-tall dam and main plant  buildings between April and July 1993. This 3,110MW power  generation facility now under construction will go into  operation and begin generating power at the end of 1993.    At the end of 1992, northwest China's installed generating  capacity was 14,417MW and its annual power output was 60.093  billion kWh, with hydropower accounting for nearly one-half of  this amount.    Development of its hydropower resources is northwest China's  first step in electric power construction. While developing  Ankang, Shiquan, Bikou, and other hydropower stations on the Han  Jiang and Bailong Jiang, Shaanxi and Gansu have also joined with  Qinghai and Ningxia to concentrate their superior forces in the  main attack on one of China's biggest hydropower "motherlodes"  on the upper reaches of the Huang He by completing five cascade  hydropower stations represented by the two big hydropower  stations at Longyang Gorge and Liujia Gorge and including Yanguo  Gorge, Bapan Gorge, Qingtong Gorge with a total installed  generating capacity of 3,268MW. Statistics show that between the  time the first generator began generating electricity in 1961  and the end of September 1993, these five hydropower stations  generated a total of 21.13 million kWh. The five large  reservoirs associated with these power stations also irrigate  more than 16 million mu of farmland along both banks of the  river. Moreover, they have used their excellent regulation  properties to basically resolve flooding, freezing, and other  disasters along the banks of the middle and upper reaches of the  Huang He, which has significantly improved the ecology and  environment of the northwest China plateau. The area around the  reservoirs, where not a blade of grass had grown for a long  time, is now shaded by green trees.    According to the newest development program by the Northwest  China Electric Power Industry Management Bureau and Northwest  China Hydropower Survey and Design Academy that was revised in  1993, besides the six power stations already built or now under  construction on the upper reaches of the Huang He, they have  also decided to build seven large cascade hydropower stations at  Gongbai Gorge, Laxiwa, and other locations and 12 medium-sized  cascade hydropower stations at Da Gorge and other locations  which can increase the total installed generating capacity to  15,740MW with annual power output of 57 billion kWh. Evidently,  the timetable for the 19 new cascade hydropower stations to be  built on the upper reaches of the Huang He has now been arranged  and it is expected that they can all be developed by the early  part of the next century.    Embodying the new idea of "changing from transporting coal  to  transmitting electricity," thermal power construction has  accelerated the pace of construction of the new Pucheng power  plant and other new construction and expansion projects in  addition to speeding up preparatory work for construction of  Baoji No. 2 power plant, Hancheng No. 2 power plant, and Shenmu,  Huangling, and other large pit-mouth power plants.    According to information provided by officials in the  Northwest China Electric Power Industry Management Bureau, after  these electric power projects are gradually implemented, annual  power output in the northwest China region will reach 69 billion  kWh in 1995. At that time, besides satisfying the needs of  industrial and agricultural production and the masses' lives in  these five provinces and autonomous regions, these abundant  power sources will also transmit power to east China, central  China, southwest China, and other regions.</p>

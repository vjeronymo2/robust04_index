			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RADIO AD URGES LATINOS TO VOTE  </P> <P> Orange County radio stations and cable television networks have begun airing an  advertisement encouraging Latinos to vote and invoking the memory of a 1988  election incident in which uniformed guards were employed by the Republican  Party at several heavily Latino precincts in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The 30-second ad, produced in both English and Spanish, does not name any of  the parties involved in the incident, nor does it urge Latinos to vote any  particular way.  </P> <P> "The point of this campaign isn't partisan," said Lowell Finley, a partner in  the San Francisco law firm of Remcho, Johansen &amp; Purcell, which filed a  lawsuit on behalf of five Latino voters after the election. "It's simply to  urge Hispanics to get out the vote."  </P> <P> Leaders of the county Republican Party and Garden Grove Assemblyman Curt  Pringle's 1988 campaign settled the civil lawsuit last year for about $400,000,  although a criminal investigation is still pending.  </P> <P> Pringle, who won a narrow victory in 1988, is facing a tough challenge this  year from Democrat Tom Umberg, a former federal prosecutor.  </P> <P> Santa Ana Police Officer Jose Vargas and Jane Fantauzzi, two of five plaintiffs  in the lawsuit, paid about $44,000 from their share of the settlement to  produce and distribute the ad. Remcho, Johansen &amp; Purcell contributed  another $10,000, Finley said.  </P> <P> Among the stations and networks playing the ad are Santa Ana radio station  KWIZ; KVEA Channel 52 in Los Angeles; Santa Ana-based Comcast Cablevision and  Garden Grove-based Paragon Cable.

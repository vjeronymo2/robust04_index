Mickey Leland  (D-Tex.) and eight other Americans killed in an Ethiopian plane crash were  returned to U.S. soil Wednesday.  </P> <P> The nine coffins bearing the bodies of members of a U.S. congressional  delegation on a hunger mission to Ethiopia were lifted from a military plane at  Andrews Air Force Base by a joint military honor guard.  </P> <P> A crowd of over 300, including members of Congress, family members and aides,  watched the solemn ceremony.  </P> <P> As the coffins were loaded into a row of hearses, House Speaker Thomas S.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- France proposed on Tuesday  [12 April] that Russia and the United States assume a bigger  role in the international peace conference on former Yugoslavia,  currently chaired by the European Union [EU] and the United  Nations.    France also said it was examining the possibility of a UN  Security Council resolution on the besieged Moslem enclave of  Gorazde providing for an immediate ceasefire and deployment of  UN peacekeepers, accompanied by a Serbian pullback "without  delay and without conditions."    Opening a National Assembly debate on Bosnia, French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe said France would propose to its EU  partners that Russia and the U.S. share the co-chairmanship of  the Yugoslavia conference.    "Each of the three main partners, the United States, Europe  and Russia, must recognise that it cannot resolve the problem  alone," Juppe said.    The foreign minister also said the the Security Council  resolution should call for an immediate ceasefire and  "deployment on the ground of UN Protection Forces to separate  the two communities." [passage omitted]    "We must fix precise political aims for our action in  Gorazde  as was the case in Sarajevo," where the threat of NATO attacks  forced back Serbian forces and lifted their siege, Juppe said.

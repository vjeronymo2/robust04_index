			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Atlas Copco shows 24% advance at nine months Profits at Atlas Copco, the Swedish industrial components group, climbed 24 per cent to SKr910m (Dollars 109.8m) in the first nine months, despite sharply lower sales volumes in Europe. The performance stemmed from a turnround in net financial items, aided by lower interest rates and exchange rate gains, to offset an 8 per cent fall in operating income. Mr Michael Treschow, chief executive, continued to highlight the contrast between Europe - where demand remains weak - and markets such as North and South America, east Asia and Australia where the trend has been much better. The group stands by a previous forecast that profits for the full year will exceed last year's SKr1.02bn. The weaker krona helped drive up nine-month sales by 16 per cent to SKr13.55bn and orders by 19 per cent to SKr14.2bn. But operating income fell to SKr826m from SKr895m, after being dragged lower by an 8-10 per cent drop in sales volumes and higher operating expenses. The group's compressor technique and construction and mining technique divisions saw earnings fall, but cost-cutting enabled the industrial technique division to improve its result despite the difficult market. The group had financial income of SKr84m, against SKr163m in costs a year ago. The turnround was helped by a drop in net borrowings and lower interest rates.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / OECD sees slowdown in steel decline THE decline in the industrialised world's steel output should slow down this year, according to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The organisation's latest steel industry outlook predicts a fall of between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent in OECD crude steel production in 1992, much less steep than last year's 4 per cent decline. This is mainly due to expected growth in its 24 member countries' average gross national product of 2.2 per cent this year, as against 1.1 per cent last year. Demand from the US and European car industries is expected to revive, but demand from their Japanese competitors should weaken. Steel use by Canada's housebuilding industry is expected to grow strongly, having been very depressed last year, while non-residential construction should slacken in the US, Finland, Norway and Switzerland, says the OECD. Geographically, the OECD expects 'notable' upturns in steel demand from the US and the Middle East, while Japanese steel consumption should decline by 6.4 per cent. Employment in the steel industry continued to fall last year, by about 2.5 per cent overall, highlighting the continued need to reduce capacity - as shown by the recent job losses at Usinor Sacilor of France and Bethlehem Steel in the US. Overall capacity fell by 1 per cent last year, but the decline in demand was still strong enough to cause a fall in capacity utilisation to 76 per cent, from 78 per cent in 1990.</p>

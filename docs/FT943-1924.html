			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Old idea sells Spain's new cars The Spanish motor industry claimed yesterday that new car sales had been increased by 85,000 in the five months from April to August this year thanks to government financial incentives for the scrapping of old cars. Anfac, the Spanish motor industry federation, called for the scheme, which runs for six months to mid-October, to be extended to run for at least 12 months. According to figures produced by Anfac, the scheme helped new car sales to jump by 23.1 per cent year-on-year to 419,736 during the five-month period. The Spanish government began offering cash incentives in mid-April to persuade owners of old cars to trade in their vehicles for new ones, in an attempt to revive flagging car sales. The launch of the scheme followed similar moves in France and Denmark. Under the terms of the Spanish scheme, the government is offering Pta100,000 (Pounds 490) each time a car which is more than 10 years old is scrapped in exchange for a new car.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a telephone call to NHTSA's Office of Chief Counsel, an attorney representing Toyota asked whether the Geo and the Corolla, are in one or two carlines. These are very similar vehicles, produced on the same assembly line, one of which is marketed by GM and the other by Toyota. NUMMI stated that the Corolla is manufactured in Japan, at NUMMI in California, and in Canada. That company stated that the NPRM, in discussing joint ownership/joint production relationships, attributed carline to the manufacturer that markets the carline, subject to certain conditions. NUMMI argued that the use of the word ``manufacturer'' in this case implies each production location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, the agency has decided that multiple manufacturers should generally be permitted to determine among themselves which of them is considered the vehicle manufacturer for purposes of the labeling requirements. NHTSA also believes it is appropriate to specify that, in the absence of such an agreement, a vehicle is attributed to the manufacturer which markets the vehicle. This approach provides maximum manufacturer flexibility, while also specifying who is responsible for labeling in the absence of an agreement among the joint venturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes, however, that additional clarification is needed concerning the meaning of ``carline'' in the joint venture context. While manufacturers may determine between themselves who is responsible for tracking, recordkeeping and labeling, they must follow the specified requirements for making carline determinations. As discussed earlier in this notice, section 210 specifies that the term ``carline'' means a name denoting a group of vehicles which has a degree of commonality in construction. It is the agency's opinion that the Geo and Corolla are in different carlines, because they have different names. Moreover, to the extent that NUMMI produced Corollas in California and Toyota produced similar or identical Corollas in Japan, all of the Corollas must be placed in the same carline, given the statutory definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Currency Exchange Rate Calculations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since currency exchange rates may fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, thereby affecting domestic content valuations, NHTSA proposed a methodology for determining the exchange rate to be used. The agency stated in the NPRM that it believes that, in the interest of consistency, the percentages printed on the labels required by section 210 should be determined using the same basis. The agency proposed a specific procedure for calculating currency exchange rates, similar to that set forth in EPA's CAFE regulation. Manufacturers would be required to take the mean of the exchange rates in effect at the end of each quarter set by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for twelve calendar quarters prior to and including the calendar ending one year prior to the date that the manufacturer submits information to the agency for a carline. The agency proposed essentially the same procedure for suppliers, replacing the date the manufacturer submits information to the agency with the date of the information the supplier provides to a manufacturer or allied supplier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA noted that EPA had suggested that NHTSA allow exchange rate calculations based on Purchasing Power Parity Rates (PPP), provided that a manufacturer was already using an approved PPP calculation for EPA purposes. EPA allows an exemption from the normally required exchange rate calculations, based on a petition. EPA stated that it believes that, by coordinating the fuel economy and content labeling decisions, consistency between the two agencies will be maintained. NHTSA stated that it was considering adopting the EPA suggestion, particularly by requiring a manufacturer to use the same conversion method for content label purposes as was approved by the EPA for fuel economy purposes. The agency sought suggestions on this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA stated that manufacturers and suppliers should have the option to convert foreign currency utilizing the exchange rates used in the financial records at the time the content calculations are made. It stated that under this option, all financial data used to calculate content will be internally consistent and tie directly with the financial records. That organization also stated that this option would avoid the major systems revisions that may be required under the proposed average exchange rate methodology. AAMA also stated that the option maintains consistency between the treatment of the prices of many commodities, where the prices fluctuate dramatically, and currency prices in that none of these prices are smoothed by averaging. Finally, AAMA stated that the option facilitates the same base cost data that is required to calculate origin under NAFTA, which will reduce the burden on manufacturers and suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota urged the agency to adopt a rule under which all manufacturers must use the same method for converting currency. That manufacturer argued that EPA's suggested approach would depart from this principle by requiring a manufacturer to use the same method as approved by EPA for fuel economy purposes. Toyota stated that the EPA approach is legally unsound and will produce inconsistent information for consumers comparing vehicles for possible purchase. Toyota argued that, from a legal standpoint, the fuel economy calculation is made pursuant to a different statute with a different purpose. That manufacturer stated further that, with respect to the currency exchange method that should be used, it believes that PPP is the most appropriate method for currency conversion and that use of this method by all manufacturers will result in consistency of calculation and avoid difficulties caused by rapid fluctuations in exchange rates. Toyota stated that if NHTSA does not require PPP, the agency should require currency conversion to be conducted according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Toyota stated that it believes that GAAP is preferable for Labeling Act purposes to the proposed method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mitsubishi stated that manufacturers should have the option of using PPP. It stated that this would be consistent with the EPA domestic content calculation for CAFE purposes. That company added that, in the interests of fairness, the same restrictions should apply as under the CAFE regulations_manufacturers should have the option of using PPP, but first they must get approval, and then cannot switch back and forth merely to get the optimal rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to adopt the proposed method for determining exchange rates, including requiring a manufacturer to use the same conversion method for content label purposes as was approved by the EPA for fuel economy purposes. The agency believes that this approach provides flexibility to manufacturers, while ensuring that they use appropriate methods for determining exchange rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that AAMA's recommendation to permit manufacturers and suppliers to use the currency rates that are used in their financial records at the time the content calculations are made is so broad as not to amount to any specification for determining exchange rates. A manufacturer could use any method it chose and could switch back and forth between methods to obtain the rates it desired. By contrast, EPA permits a degree of flexibility, but ensures that an appropriate method is used and that it is not changed back and forth between years. The agency notes that if a manufacturer obtains EPA approval for whatever method is reflected in its financial records, it can use that method for both EPA and Labeling Act purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While Toyota is correct that different manufacturers can use different methods for determining exchange rates, it has not shown that this will result in significant differences in label values. Moreover, it has not shown why differences in the purposes of the CAFE and Labeling statutes should result in different approaches for determining exchange rates. Since both statutes require making determinations about the content of passenger motor vehicles, NHTSA believes it is appropriate for EPA and NHTSA to follow the same approach for determining exchange rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / EC action call on employment Mr Padraig Flynn, the EC Commissioner for Social Affairs, yesterday said important changes were needed in research, training, industrial relations and the mobility of pension funds, in order to tackle unemployment, which could rise to 20m in the EC next year, writes Tim Coone from Dublin. He told Irish pension fund managers in Dublin the traditional maxim that employment growth could be achieved through economic growth had failed in Europe.

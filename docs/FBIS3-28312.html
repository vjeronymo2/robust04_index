			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Murray Hiebert from Hanoi] </F>   [Text] As Vietnam prises open its economy to market  forces, the cachet of foreign goods is on the rise. But  conspicuous consumpton is only one of the problems on which  Hanoi's bureaucrats now need to keep an eye. They are quickly  learning that the industrialised world has more to unload than  champagne, computers and cars; it also has garbage.    Vietnam's customs officers are the last line of defence in a  country belatedly acknowledging the need to sort the rich  world's waste from its other goods on offer. So when Tra Vinh  Cereal and Foodstuff Co. asked the Customs Department to  inspect.its 61- container shipment of "assorted, mixed plastic,"  customs officers became curious when the shipment failed to show  up. Eventually, the missing containers were located in early  January at the Anh Sang Private Enterprise in the suburbs of Ho  Chi Minh City. What they found was shocking even to the  department's seasoned veterans: the "assorted, mixed plastic"  turned out to be 1,114 tonnes of filthy, used plastic bags.    Fearing that Anh Sang would either try to recycle the bags--  causing serious air and water pollution--or bury them in a  landfill, Ho Chi Minh City's environment committee promptly  ordered the bags to be re-exported to their original owner. (The  environment committee said that the containers originated in  Germany but wouldn't identify the names of any foreign companies  involved with the shipment.) Vietnamese officials say this  incident marks the first known case of foreign waste materials  arriving in the country. But the desire to do so is not new:  government officials say many foreign companies have sought  permission to dump their waste in Vietnam since Hanoi launched  its free-market reforms seven years ago.    "Foreign companies try to exploit the poor knowledge of  local  officials by telling them these imports won't hurt Vietnam,"  says Nguyen Ngoc Sinh, acting director of Vietnam's National  Environmental Agency. "They try to prove we will earn much money  and be able to resolve our unemployment problem." These  arguments appear to have won at least some converts. During the  debate on an environmental protection law, passed by the  National Assembly in late December, some delegates argued that  Vietnam should consider accepting some solid-waste imports. In  the end, their proposal was defeated.    The new environment law, Vietnam's first, seeks to prevent  further degradation of the environment as the country rushes to  develop in the wake of the communist party's retreat from  command economics. But the law marks only the first halting  step to protect an environment already battered by years of war,  overcrowding and underdevelopment.    The law aims to provide a general framework for  environmental  protection. The task of developing concrete regulations on  environmental problems such as industrial discharge, toxic gas,  air standards and water quality has been assigned to the  premier's office and to the National Environmental Agency, which  falls under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment.  Hanoi already has adopted laws or promulgated decrees on the  protection of forests, land and mineral resources.    Sinh hopes his office will have some preliminary guidelines  in place within two months. One of the first new requirements  established under the law is for factories to complete  environmental impact assessment studies. Factories that don't  take measures to meet minimum environmental requirements within  a certain time will be ordered to stop operating. Licence won't  be granted to new factories unles they meet these standards,  Sinh says.    Although Vietnam's urban environ ment is still in better  condition than those in most neighbouring countries, pollution  is increasing rapidly in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.  Virtually no industries in either city, including those  financed through foreign investment, treat any of their waste.  An estimated 250 factories in Hanoi discharge untreated waste,  including chemicals, dyes and some heavy metals, directly into  the city's canals, river and lakes. Hanoi has no plant to treat  waste water and its ageing waste-water network, built by the  former French colonial rulers more than 50 years ago, serves  only the old part of the city. This creates serious  environmental risk, especially during the rainy season, when the  streets are often flooded with a mixture of domestic waste  water, industrial effluent and storm water.    In addition, Hanoi's factories pollute the air through the  emission of coal particles sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide.  The heavily industrialised Thuong Dinh area in the southern  suburbs suffers sulphur dioxide and carbor monoxide levels two  to five times higher than permitted levels, according to an envi  ronmental atlas completed in December by the city's Commission  for Science, Technology and Environment and the Hanoi University  of Civil Engineering. But as bad as the urban environment has  become, Vietnam's densely populated rural areas are under even  create environmental stress. Over the past five decades, the  country's forest cover has declined from 44% of total land area  to less than 24%, due to war, expansion of farmland, growing  fuel needs and commercial logging. This massive deforestation  has lead to large- scale soil erosion and increasing floods and  drought.    Gibbons, leaf monkeys, slow lorises and other animals  listed as "extremely threatened" by the Convention on the  International Trade in Endangered Species are for sale in  Vietnam's markets and smuggled to China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.  Hunters have wiped out some 200 species of birds over the past  four decades. And in the coastal province of Khanh Hoa alone,  an estimated 50 tonnes of coral reef, the habitat for a wide  variety of marine life, are being destroyed each year to produce  limestone for cement.    Although Vietnamese and foreign environmentalists laud the  new environmental protection law, they point out that it won't  change much unless Vietnam establishes a mechanism to enforce  the regulations. Sinh says his department has only 40 experts--  "one- tenth of what I need"--and another 250 officials in  provincial offices to monitor the country's environment. He  expects a budget of only Dong 60 billion (US$5.5 million) this  year.    Some observers wonder how effective environmental monitors  will be unless their salaries are increased. "The people who  destroy the forests now are the foresters," notes a foreign  environmentalist. "If they're only paid US$15 a month, they have  to find their own means of making a livelihood," he says,  alluding to growing corruption among state employees.    A recent World Bank report argues that environmental  protection in Vietnam also will require clear lines of authority  and the elimination of unnecessary duplication of  responsibility. For example, nine different national agencies  currently play a role in establishing rules for the use of water.    Vietnam, like most of its neighbours, faces a dilemma: how  to balance economic development with the cost of environmental  protection. But unlike many other countries in Asia, Vietnam  doesn't have the "luxury" of developing first and worrying about  its environment later.    Vietnam has "very little environmental capital, such as  forests, left to waste," observes a foreign economist. "Thailand  could destroy its forests as its economy grew, but Vietnam's  forests are already depleted. Further neglect is not really an  option."    Vietnamese economists and environmentalists say the real  underlying problem is that there is a limit to what they can do  until the country achieves a higher level of economic  development.    "I often talk to farmers about the value of protecting  mangroves and wildlife," says Le Dien Duc of Hanoi University's  Centre for Natural Resources Management and Environmental  Studies. "They smile at me and say, your talk is very  interesting, but we're starving. We have nothing to eat'."</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No better place to find an answer than in the late 1960s Sir, It was with some sadness that I read Malcolm Rutherford's review ('Hair is wearing thin', September 15). While it must inevitably be true that the revival of a show which captured a particular mood a quarter of a century ago should now appear dated, it is surely misguided for Mr Rutherford to be so casually dismissive of the culture and values of the late 1960s that Hair so clearly represented. While I agree with Mr Rutherford that 'the mood now is one of not being quite sure where to look', surely there can be no better place to find the answer than in the late 1960s during which a whole generation questioned the established order of things and craved for a better way of life. Again, I agree with Mr Rutherford that the fashion has changed: we live in an age which is more competitive, more stressful, more apathetic, more materialistic, more violent. In contrast the mood of the late 1960s was one of peace, love, freedom, self-fulfilment. It does not surprise me that Mr Rutherford feels it is time to bring back 'Guys and Dolls' as I am sure this would be a more suitable show for him to enjoy and review favourably. It is equally clear that he has never had much in common with the hippies that are a part of Hair. Brian Yates, 7 Highdown, Fleet, Hampshire GU13 8PS</p>

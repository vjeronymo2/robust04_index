			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Moscow to ease travel restrictions RUSSIA is simplifying restrictions on the movement of foreigners. The government said it had ended the ban on travel to closed areas, although there remained some places which could be visited only with foreign ministry permission. This was because they contained security installations and the state had not yet worked out a system for sealing off individual plants and military bases. The government spokesman, Mr Andrei Silantiev, said old rules requiring foreigners to give the foreign ministry 24 hours' notice of travel plans would be scrapped. The new list of restricted areas replaces one drawn up in 1990 which is out of date because of decrees by President Boris Yeltsin opening up whole cities. Now that the city of Chelyabinsk has been opened up, for example, just two territories outside the city will be 'regulated'. The list covers areas in 16 regions of Russia, such as the town of Komsomolsk na Amure in the Khabarovsk region, and islands in the Gulf of Finland. In another belated gift to foreigners, parliament last week approved a cut in income tax for top earners, which would include most foreign businessmen in Moscow, from 60 to 40 per cent.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti shares fall on warning SHARES in Ferranti International lost 3 3/4 p to 8 1/2 p after the struggling electronics group said profitability had not improved in the first few months of its financial year. Ferranti, which came close to collapse following the 1989 discovery of huge fraud in International Signal and Control, its US subsidiary, said its net assets had fallen to less than half its share capital. This had triggered a need for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders, set for October 7, to decide on its next moves. Ferranti said it was working on strengthening its balance sheet by equity injection or partnerships, and on winning new business, rationalising further and producing a profit. Ferranti said its board would consider, after a sustained return to profit, a reduction in capital to allow the resumption of dividends. A suitable capital reconstruction could be considered at the same time. However, the board recommended that no such action be taken in the meantime because there would be no practical benefit for the group and the associated costs could not be justified. Ferranti incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 24.5m in the year to March 31, against a loss of Pounds 46.2m in the previous year. In June, Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman since 1990, said Ferranti had cut its bank borrowings from Pounds 700m to less than Pounds 100m since 1989 and reduced its overdue creditors payments from Pounds 55m to Pounds 19m, but he said the process needed to be accelerated.</p>

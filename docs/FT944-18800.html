			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Best buys for the brokers - Bethan Hutton considers the progress of investment trusts launched this year Investors have been spoilt for choice with investment trust issues: about 50 new ones have appeared in the past 12 months, plus dozens of conversion share issues from existing trusts. And investors have poured money enthusiastically into them: new trusts have raised Pounds 5bn since January 1993 and existing ones another Pounds 1bn-plus. But what has happened to them since launch? Bristol-based financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown last week polled four leading investment trust brokers. It asked if they would buy, sell or hold each of the 170 different investment trust shares and warrants issued since the beginning of last year. About 90 per cent of the stocks were rated 'hold' - which was to be expected, given the usual advice to buy investment trusts for the medium to long term. But three were recommended particularly as buys: EFM Small Companies, Mercury World Mining and Mercury European Privatisation. One reason given for choosing them was the brokers' high opinion of the fund managers - always an important consideration. Also, all three are trading well below their highs and are, therefore, seen as good value although Mercury World Mining is still at a slight premium. The most interesting sell recommendation was 3i, the giant venture capital trust floated this summer. It went from a discount of 13 per cent at launch to a premium of nearly 7 per cent, and its share price gained more than 20 per cent, although it has since dropped back a little. The brokers felt the trust's premium was not justified and that other venture capital trusts trading at wide discounts were better value. Other sell recommendations were dominated by high-yielding trusts - Johnson Fry Utilities, Lazard High Income, Abtrust High Income, Gartmore British Income and Growth - which the brokers felt had become too expensive. Private investors are often reluctant to part with a share which has done well for them. But Mike Scott, of Hargreaves Lansdown, says that when a trust has achieved in a few months the performance you expected over 18 or 24, it could be time to sell. He points to Fleming Chinese (see graph), which was launched last year. Initial subscribers who sold at the high reached not long after launch could have made handsome profits. Those who held on have seen the value of their shares eroded to below issue price - although that could present a buying opportunity for new investors or those who sold at the peak. 'New issues can be particularly volatile, especially specialist trusts which can throw up some very good trading opportunities,' says Scott. 'In some cases, investors are presented with an early opportunity to take profits on a new issue because shares have been driven to large premiums, or markets in which they invested have soared in the short term.' But this has been rare in recent months - very few new issues are trading at above launch price (the main exception is the four new Latin American trusts). So, although you should be prepared to sell early if the opportunity arises, it is still important to invest only if you are prepared to hold a trust over the long term.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Following the proclamation of the results of the  legislative elections on 13 March, General Gnassingbe Eyadema  yesterday held preliminary consultations with the major  political parties in the country. [passage omitted]    Still on the legislative elections, here is a clarification  by the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]: The UTD Steering  Committee expresses satisfaction with the proclamation of the  results of the 6 and 20 February legislative elections by the  Supreme Court. The UTD lauds this proclamation which in itself  constitutes a new victory for the democratic opposition. It  congratulates and thanks the Togolese people for their courage  and their determination. Through their unequivocal vote, they  opted for change.    Contrary to the AFP dispatch which appeared on 15 March 1994  and was signed by Francis Ahouadi, the UTD is and remains a  party that belongs to the democratic opposition. The UTD has,  under no circumstance, sold off the victory of the Togolese  people in the February legislative elections through any  alliance with the forces that it has fought up until this point.  However, the UTD wishes to make the following clarification:  Before the proclamation of the results, it held informal  discussions with the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR]. During  the discussions, several proposals were examined by both sides.  All the same, before any agreement is reached, the CAR  contacted the presidential side to suggest to it a broad  alliance within which the post of speaker of the national  assembly will come to the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT].  But with the refusal of the RPT to negotiate with its party and  working around the UTD national chairman, the CAR chairman, in a  second move, suggested the post of the speaker of the National  Assembly to the UTD secretary general who declined the offer.  The CAR later refused the alternative proposition for  settlement made by the UTD.    In light of all this, the UTD was forced to assert its  specificity and demonstrated its determination to place itself  above the fray. The UTD is ready, in accordance with all the  components of the new majority in the elections, to assume all  its responsibilities concerning the future of the country. This  country is faced with serious political, economic, and social  challenges and which it must meet. This demands that the UTD be  treated with respect and dignity in its discussions with the  CAR. Also consensus must be sought in the fundamental decisions  concerning, particularly, the government of the country. For  the UTD, it is very important that the victory of the people be  absolutely preserved and administered within an atmosphere of  indispensable harmony.    [Signed] Edem Kodjo, for the Steering Committee.</p>

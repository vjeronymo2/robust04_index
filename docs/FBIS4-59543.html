			<p>BFN     [Text] The parliamentary bloc of the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] and its friends in the Council of Representatives has  stated that constitutional legitimacy is an integrated system  which means a rigorous and strict application of the  constitution and laws enforced by bodies, organs, and  institutions of the state. Therefore, the decisions issued by  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih are regarded as a clear and blatant  violation of the Constitution because they were not issued in  accordance with the rigorous provisions made by the Constitution  of the Yemeni Republic.    In a statement issued yesterday, the parliamentary bloc  emphasized that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's declaration of the state  of emergency is regarded as null and illegal because such a  declaration requires the existence of a special law that  regulates and explains the declaration of the state of emergency  and its circumstances on the basis of Article 94, paragraph 17  and Article 97 of the Constitution.    The parliamentary bloc of the YSP condemned the spiteful  raids against the YSP's centers and the pursuit and detention of  YSP and other political parties and organizations' leaders and  members, currently being carried out by state bodies controlled  by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his secessionist executive military  family. The YSP parliamentary bloc called on the Arab League  and all brothers and friends to exert their generous efforts to  stop the war immediately and rescue the homeland from  destruction to which it is currently exposed. It stated that  there is in the YSP initiative a truly correct and appropriate  solution to save the homeland and preserve the unity of the  territory and its people.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH INDICATES TOUGH APPROACH ON NEW CLEAN-AIR REGULATIONS  </P> <P> President Bush indicated Thursday that he plans a hard-line approach on new  clean-air standards that will "significantly improve" the quality of life of  all North Americans.  </P> <P> Bush, who will unveil his clean-air package Monday, met with industry leaders,  who said they pleaded against coming up with standards that are too tough to be  affordable.  </P> <P> "We urged him to make certain that, when the dust settles on clean air, that we  have a healthy economy left," said William D. Fay, administrator of the Clean  Air Working Group, a business coalition.  </P> <P> "We'll have to wait until Monday to see whether or not the point got through,"  Fay said after he and other industry officials met with Bush at the White  House.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Readiness to Act Described  </P> <P> Later, at a session with environmental leaders, Bush indicated that he is ready  to move ahead with strong measures, participants said.  </P> <P> "He said that he agreed this is a freight train coming down the track," said  George Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society. "He felt that he  strongly, personally wanted to be out front on this."  </P> <P> Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Action, said: "We are calling  on him to again do a NATO. It is time for him to exercise leadership and call  for strong measures to protect the health of the American people." She was  referring to Bush's dramatic call last month for unilateral troop cuts in  Europe.  </P> <P> Caplan said Bush was given information on air quality in Kennebunkport, Me.,  where he has a vacation home. "He was shocked to know that last summer there  were many days in which there were serious health problems from ozone smog,"  she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mind Not Entirely Made Up  </P> <P> White House aides, as well as participants at the industry and environmental  meetings, insisted that Bush has not made up his mind on many aspects of the  package, the first major overhaul of the 1970 Clean Air Act in 12 years.  </P> <P> But Administration aides said Bush had already decided on many key parts of the  legislation -- including tough new standards for cleaning up smokestack  emissions that cause acid rain, changes that would prove costly to industry.  </P> <P> The President also has decided on rigid new standards to prevent chemical  contamination of the air.  </P> <P> These standards will extend to hundreds of categories of businesses, ranging  from paint factories to bakeries, the sources said.  </P> <P> Such suggestions prompted praise from congressional Democrats even before Bush  submitted his proposal. "He has wholly reversed the position of the Reagan  Administration on this subject," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell  (D-Me.) said.  </P> <P> Power plants and other industries that burn coal in the Midwest, many of which  disperse their pollutants through tall smokestacks without technological  controls, will be a key target of Bush's clean-air attack, the sources said.  </P></p>

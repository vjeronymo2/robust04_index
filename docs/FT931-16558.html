			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Leaks beneath the earth - Paul Cheeseright examines a pioneering method of treating landfill gas seepage Unwittingly and certainly unwillingly, Ebourne Close, Kenilworth, may be on the verge of making chemical history. This 1980s UK housing development in Warwickshire sits on a claypit which became a landfill site. Its property values are blighted because the landfill is still releasing methane gas. An experiment is starting to see whether it is possible to treat the methane gas at Ebourne Close, not by the orthodox means of extracting it, of allowing it to ventilate, but by treating it with a chemical based on sulphonic acid. The chemical, it is hoped, will kill the methane-producing bacteria. Sulphonic acid is already used in cattlefeed. 'It inhibits production of methane from organic acids in the intestines of livestock,' explained Robert Eden, managing director of UKPS, a landfill technology company in Warwick University's science park. With specialists from Imperial College, London and Warwick University, UKPS is forming a project team to treat 'the root cause of landfill gas migration, instead of just tackling the symptoms with extraction equipment'. The technique is designed, Eden said, 'to neutralise the methane in situ'. In the old and very damp claypit under Ebourne Close, the material is largely inert debris but with organic matter resistant to decomposition or bacterial degradation. So the idea is to push a well to the pit's lowest point. Water will be drawn up through the well, run through a treatment process involving the addition of chemicals based on sulphonic acid and pushed back into the pit from the perimeter. The circulation of the treated water through the pit will attack the methogenic bacteria producing the methane. Success would have widespread implications for two reasons. First, the problem of landfill gas is both nationwide and longstanding. In 1991, the Inspectorate of Pollution identified 1,006 gassing sites in England and Wales where, because there is residential or commercial property nearby, controls might be needed. In a paper on waste management, the Department of Environment said 'there is no typical figure for the length of time that landfill gas will be evolved, but at many sites significant gas generation can be expected to continue for a period which is likely to be at least 15 years after the last deposit of waste'. What has changed in recent years has been public perception of the problem. Alarm bells rang when, in March 1986, a bungalow exploded and households were temporarily evacuated at the Derbyshire village of Loscoe. Acknowledging 'growing public concern', the department said one major area 'is the evolution of landfill gas which, when inadequately controlled, has led to explosions, fires, dangerous gas concentrations in and around houses, odour nuisance and vegetation dieback'. The second big implication is both commercial and legal. Land purchases within 500 metres of a landfill site are approached with caution because of the possibilities of gas migration. Teresa Hitchcock of Dibb Lupton Broomhead, solicitors, observed that 'initially clients get concerned when they hear land has been a waste tip or landfill site; they become more so if the tip has not been regulated'. The position is further complicated by the question of liability for any manifestations of gas: who is responsible for difficulties stemming from waste management decisions taken perhaps 20 years ago? Ebourne Close shows how complex the question can become. Roger Braithwaite of Warwick District Council's environmental health department noted in a recent paper that the earliest documented evidence of tipping in the Ebourne Close area was a 1949 planning approval for clay extraction on condition the contractor undertook continual backfilling. The site went through several ownerships. It was used for tipping both by Kenilworth Urban District Council in the 1960s and by Warwick District Council in the late 1970s. Planning permission for the present estate was granted in 1980. Routine investigations of the site by Warwick council led to the discovery of gas concentrations and, in August 1990, to the evacuation of 42 Ebourne Close, one of the worst affected houses. The council has a statutory duty to inspect its area for nuisances such as landfill gas. But this raises three snags. The first relates to action. 'Where a statutory nuisance exists, the local authority is obliged to take action against the person responsible. In this case, no action has been taken to date to abate the nuisance as no practical method of abating the nuisance is known,' Braithwaite wrote. The second snag is deciding who is responsible for the gas at Ebourne Close, given the site's chequered history. The third is deciding who should pay to rectify the problem. Provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, coming into force next April, should cut through some of these complexities by pinning financial responsibility for former waste tips on their owners. As the latest guidance from the department of environment makes clear, local authorities 'must be satisfied that the condition of the land is unlikely to cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health' before they accept the surrender of a licence granted to deposit waste. The new regulations, then, are a stimulus to the search both for a means which will prevent landfill sites from leaking gas in an uncontrolled way, as is the case at Ebourne Close, and for a technique which will eliminate years of controlled ventilation as at Loscoe.</p>

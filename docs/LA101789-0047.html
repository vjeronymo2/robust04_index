			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPEALS COURT PERMITS SHUTTLE LAUNCHING TODAY  </P> <P> An appeals court Monday dismissed a last-ditch attempt by environmentalists to  stop today's launching of the shuttle Atlantis, setting the stage for a flight  to fire the nuclear-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter.  </P> <P> Eight anti-nuclear activists were arrested Monday in a symbolic protest at the  Kennedy Space Center. But, with beefed-up security teams on guard against more  serious infiltration attempts, Atlantis' countdown ticked smoothly toward  blastoff at 9:57 a.m. PDT today, five days late because of work to replace a  faulty main engine computer.  </P> <P> "The bottom line . . . is that we think we have an excellent chance of getting  airborne . . . ," NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly said. "The vehicle's in  good shape; the crew's ready to go fly, and the weather looks like we'll have a  good chance of getting airborne."  </P> <P> Late Monday, technicians detected a problem with a "black box" that collects  speed and other data for the shuttle's navigation system and worked to replace  the cockpit device, but no delay in the launching was expected, NASA  spokeswoman Lisa Malone said.  </P> <P> Rocket crews rolled a giant rotating service gantry away from Atlantis,  exposing the 4.5-million-pound spaceship to set the stage for fuel loading  early today.  </P> <P> Commander Donald Williams, 47, co-pilot Michael McCulley, 46, flight engineer  Franklin Chang-Diaz, 39, Shannon Lucid, 46, and Ellen Baker, 36, plan to spend  five days in orbit before landing at 12:42 p.m. PDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force  Base, Calif. Lucid and Baker were scheduled to deploy the space probe from  Atlantis's 60-foot payload bay.  </P> <P> The $1.4-billion Galileo probe, the most sophisticated interplanetary craft  ever built, has generated controversy because it is equipped with two atomic  power packs loaded with 48 pounds of radioactive plutonium 238 dioxide. NASA  contends that the power packs would survive a Challenger-class disaster and  most other accidents intact.  </P> <P> Anti-nuclear activists charge that Galileo is too risky to launch, that a cloud  of deadly radiation could be released in a disaster. But a federal judge last  week refused to block the flight, and an appeals court in Washington Monday  agreed with that decision.  </P> <P> At the Kennedy Space Center, eight demonstrators were arrested when they  trespassed at a guard gate in a symbolic protest. NASA is spending an extra  $100,000 to bolster security around the launching pad. But, although gun-toting  NASA guards were prepared for more activity, organizers said that no one would  try to infiltrate the launching zone today.  </P> <P> "We're urging people not to be within 25 miles of the launch pad," said Bruce  Gagnon of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice.  </P></p>

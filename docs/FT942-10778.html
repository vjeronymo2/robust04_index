			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Shoring up the dollar Last week's intervention to support the dollar seems to have worked for the time being, but it has done nothing to reverse the fundamental problem. Japan has a current account surplus and a capital inflow, while the opposite pertains in the US. As long as that continues the dollar remains vulnerable. The immediate assumption was that the Federal Reserve would accelerate its rate tightening in order better to underpin the dollar. This may yet happen after Friday's strong employment data, but it is the Treasury which decides on intervention and is worried about the dollar. The Treasury has no control over interest rates. Any Fed decision on that score is more likely to be determined by domestic conditions than its perception of the dollar. One of the Treasury's concerns, which is all the more understandable in the light of this week's borrowing operation, is that a weak dollar saps overseas demand for US bonds. Higher interest rates, of course, would make this problem worse in the short run. If the Treasury really does believe the dollar is under-valued, perhaps it should consider another course. It could cover part of the US budget deficit by borrowing yen. That would both offset some of the capital flows which have been depressing the dollar and reduce the weight of supply on the US bond market. Moreover, with Japanese government bond yields more than three points lower than their US equivalent it could prove a cheap source of funds. The precedent is the foreign currency Carter bonds, issued when the dollar was under pressure during the 1970s. The dollar's subsequent recovery made the bonds an exceptionally good deal for the US taxpayer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Adolfas Slezevicius, Lithuanian prime </F> minister and LDDP chairman, by GK and DS in Vilnius; date not  given: "A. Slezevicius: 'We Will Stand the Test of Power'"]    [Excerpt] As we have already reported, Adolfas  Slezevicius, the country's prime minister and chairman of the  Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], paid a visit to the  TIESA editorial office.    Today, we are publishing his replies to the questions from  TIESA reporters.    [TIESA] The public is currently being incited by the  possible interpellation to the government. The document was  signed by representatives of an interesting coalition -- the  Social Democrats, the Nationalists, the Democrats, and even two  members of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] faction.    How could you explain the activeness of the Social  Democrats, although the programs of the two parties are similar,  and particularly the move of K. Jaskelevicius and A.  Ivaskevicius [LDDP members]?    [Slezevicius] I have said and can repeat that an  interpellation is a constitutional right. Not being numerous  and having few representatives in the Seimas [parliament], the  Lithuanian Social Democratic Party sometimes wants to attract  the attention of others. This may be correct from the viewpoint  of the party. However, the frequent change of governments --  ours is the sixth one -- is damaging to the country's stability  and economic reform. I have read the Social Democrats'  documents and I know who drafted them -- I have not found any  original proposals as to how to improve the situation.    The Social Democrats are extremely envious of LDDP efforts  to  become a member of the Socialist International. This may imply  the desire to prove that there can be no close cooperation  between the two parties.    This may also mean a hint at a coalition.    The fact that the chairman of the LDDP, which won the  elections, is the head of the government means the first attempt  to follow the course of Western democratic tradition. According  to this model, party members in the Seimas faction should  observe discipline because otherwise they could be recalled.  Unfortunately, Lithuania is still a "unique" country or, in  other words, the "land of wonders." Therefore, even an LDDP  Council Presidium member can sign an interpellation to the  government headed by the party leader.    There are some LDDP members who do not fit in the faction,  while the procedure of recalling is not defined. We will,  probably, begin to implement the latter only after the elections  to local governments.    At the same time, I would like to admit that the advocates  of  the interpellation also voice justified criticism. The  government's work has shortcomings, and we see them. Not  everything is done by fixed deadlines. However, we do have a  program and preserve the key trends in our work. Thus, in my  opinion, it is beneficial to the country that the activities of  the government are corrected and that governments are not  changed.    [TIESA] Many people notice that while in power, the  LDDP is beginning to follow the policy of Sajudis in the former  Supreme Council, when internal strife turned it into a minority.  Might it happen that early elections will be inspired by the  majority itself rather than the opposition?    [Slezevicius] I am far from such pessimism. We have diverse  and smart people in the Seimas. We do not need an amorphous  monolith. On the other hand, it is regrettable that sometimes  the actions of LDDP representatives cause much joy to the  opposition and its press.    A split in the LDDP ranks has been predicted and expected  for  a long time. I suppose, however, that we will stand the test of  power.    [TIESA] Hardly anyone can tell today, approximately  what part of the necessary taxes is collected by the government  -- maybe, one-fourth or 60 percent. This must be the most  pressing problem of the day. Failure to resolve it will  increase the disproportion between the rich and the poor, and  will continue to harm the least protected social groups. What  does the government intend to do to collect at least the major  part of taxes?    [Slezevicius] I would not like to use the term "to collect  taxes." State-conscious citizens should pay taxes themselves.  Unfortunately, this problem is really pressing. Illegal trade  in smuggled alcohol and tobacco has reached dangerous  proportions in all aspects. It demoralizes society and  encourages chaos on the market. Local producers cannot compete,  while smugglers, certainly, do not pay taxes. However, we will  not eradicate this problem by one resolution or another. We  require an entire set of coordinated measures.    Throughout the civilized world, 90 percent of tax money  comprises four taxes -- the value added tax, the taxes on  incomes of physical and juridical persons, and excise duties.  The creation of a similar system is nearing completion in  Lithuania. Subsequent moves that we will have to make are to  enhance the responsibility for the non-payment of taxes and  strengthen the operation of inspection offices. We are already  demanding great responsibility for contraband. It will be  necessary to reinforce the economic police which will have to  cooperate with the tax inspection. Therefore, the economic  police will receive additional staff in the near future.    Privileges which we have granted to insolvent enterprises by  canceling the deadline for paying taxes pursue one goal -- to  retrieve taxes owed to the state, even though later.    We intend to impose order in the register of enterprises in  the immediate future. Currently, we have 110,000 economic  entities registered, while taxes are paid by a considerably  smaller number of enterprises. Entrusting the register to the  Finance Ministry, it would be much easier to control the payment  of taxes. We are also considering the possibility of assigning  this task to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. However, we  doubt whether social organizations will manage to fulfill those  functions efficiently.    [TIESA] We will have to apply the bankruptcy law sooner  or later. It is this measure that will allow us to replace an  inefficient manager of an enterprise with an efficient person,  restructure the economy, and make production more effective.  The government's hesitation is understandable, because the  announcement of the bankruptcies of all insolvent entities would  mean mass unemployment. However, we will have to bring  ourselves to do this at some time. When will this moment  come?    [Slezevicius] We have already announced bankruptcies of 10  enterprises. Certainly, this, as well as the unemployment rate,  does not reflect the actual situation. However, the initiative  for bankruptcies should come from creditors. The government's  task is to facilitate this procedure. We have already  accomplished this in principle.    [TIESA] However, it is the government who is this  creditor most often. Before 1 March, the debt of economic  entities for unpaid taxes to the budget was about 0.5 billion  litai. Who should begin the bankruptcy procedure for such  enterprises?    [Slezevicius] The current debt to the budget has really  exceeded 0.5 billion litai. Moreover, the "Sodra" [state  insurance company] budget did not receive another 130 million  litai. However, formulating the problem in this way, we should  state our goal: Do we want those 200 insolvent enterprises to  go broke, although many of them are already getting back on  their feet, have found their place in the market, and have  chances for repaying the debt in the near future, or do we want  to cancel the deadline for their debt and wait until the money  returns to the budget, albeit later? The government has chosen  the second way. One must bear in mind that half of all unpaid  revenues accounts for interest. Thus, we have proposed to  enterprises to reach agreements with tax inspections so that the  latter cancel the payment of taxes and do not charge any  interest during that time. Having done this, we should receive  about 170 million litai in budget revenues this year alone,  which we would otherwise have to write off. The budget deficit  is estimated at exactly this sum. Furthermore, this will help  enterprises overcome the shortage of working capital which is  the outcome of hyperinflation.    [TIESA] Will not the tying of the litas to the U.S.  dollar impair Lithuanian exports?    [Slezevicius] I think that such fears are totally unfounded.  On the contrary, a stable currency will promote investments in  production, enhance the latter, as well as the possibilities of  exports.    [TIESA] Agriculture will not survive without support.  Who and how much will you support?    [Slezevicius] We cannot say today what farms and of what  size  will be effective in Lithuania. Farmers themselves and the  market must reply to this question. The government must create  conditions for the emergence of genuine owners and a real  market. I believe that the president was right in returning the  land law to the Seimas, one clause of which envisions the  nationalization of land that has no owner. This law is the last  one among those on land reform and it must be precise.    The issue of support is even more complicated. It is all  very well to subsidize farmers for the governments of those  countries where their produce accounts for some 5 percent of the  GNP, and a large part of it is sold on the domestic market. Our  agriculture produces almost half of the GNP, and about  two-thirds of this produce is exported. Thus, we have no  resources for subsidies. Even if we had, are prices for exports  worth reducing and consumers of other countries worth  supporting? We are not the United States which can afford this.    We understand perfectly well that Lithuania was, is, and  will be an agricultural country. Farmers will not manage without  government support. We will do this in two ways. First of all,  we will protect our market from imported produce with customs  duties. For example, Estonia is following another course, it  has opened all borders to imported farm products.    We will not leave our farmers, who have not yet reached the  level of effective production of developed countries, to such a  fate.    The other way is to extend preferential credits. The  government's task is to find and give them to the most promising  producers.    [TIESA] Rumors are again spreading about the  reorganization of ministries. Some of them are to be merged,  while others -- divided. Is this a principle, or do such  decisions depend on personalities?    [Slezevicius] Talk is usually more interesting and richer in  imagination than in reality.    We have adopted a decision concerning the division of the  Ministry of Culture and that of Education and Science. The  Environmental Protection Department, which was subordinate to  the Seimas, will become a ministry.    The Constitution does not envision deputy prime ministers,  while reform issues are complicated. We propose two offices of  state ministers. One of them would handle economic reform, and  the other -- issues of local governments.    I would like to reassure the tax payers that these changes  will not increase the number of officials, and we will use only  the money allocated from the budget.    Certainly, I wish this reorganization sped up educational  reform, improved the work of self-governments, upgraded  privatization, and so on.    [TIESA] The trial of the former Lithuanian Bank manager  has just ended. Mr. Romualdas Visokavicius has been acquitted.  LIETUVOS RYTAS commentator Rimvydas Valatka -- and the newspaper  vouches for this respectable banker -- stated that these  proceedings struck a crushing blow to your reputation.    [Slezevicius] Mr. Valatka is particularly attentive to my  person, and I am grateful for this. I do not know in what terms  he measured this crushing blow, but I did not feel it.    It is regrettable that all cases in our country acquire  political clothing, and Mr. Visokavicius called himself even the  cannon fodder of political games.    The question of a LIETUVOS RYTAS reporter whether Mr.  Visokavicius will apply for his restoration to work is strange.  So is the banker's reply: "I do not know." The Seimas  dismissed the manager not for the loan to the "Litimpex" bank  but for the monetary policy that inflicted great losses on the  country's economy.    [TIESA] The political treaty on good-neighborly  relations with Poland should be signed shortly. It should begin  a new and mutually beneficial stage in cooperation between both  countries. What are the relations with Russia and Belarus?    [Slezevicius] Dialogue is under way, but it is not as  fruitful as we would like.    It is regretful that Russia is trying to restrict some  agreements with new conditions. For example, the most favored  nation status is still frozen. Russia wants to link it with the  Kaliningrad Oblast issue.    Mr. Yuriy Matochkin, leader of the Oblast Administration,  has  been authorized by the Russian prime minister to conduct  negotiations with Lithuania. A meeting with him should take  place in the near future.    Cooperation with Belarus is impaired by the complicated  political situation in that country. Quite a number of  agreements have been submitted for signing.    [TIESA] How often do you read TIESA? How do you assess  it? Why does a newspaper which actually supports the current  government have the most modest material conditions?    [Slezevicius] Of course, I read it every day, and I find  many  interesting publications and readers' comments. I agree that  TIESA today is more modest than other newspapers. There are  several reasons. One of them is that the LDDP did not reward  the paper as rapidly as did our opponents with the "state  newspaper" [reference to LIETUVOS AIDAS]. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Democrats hold Aspin seat by tiny margin THE White House breathed a small sigh of relief yesterday when the Democratic Party narrowly held on to the House of Representatives seat from Wisconsin occupied for 22 years by Mr Les Aspin, now defence secretary. Mr Peter Barca's margin - 50-49 per cent, or about 700 votes - compares with Mr Aspin's 58-42 per cent victory last time. Mr Barca's Republican opponent, Mr Mark Neumann, was threatening to demand a recount. In another special election in a very conservative district of Ohio, the Republicans won easily. Although by-elections often favour the political opposition, a combination of a defeat in Wisconsin together with the likelihood of the loss next month of the Democratic Senate seat from Texas will not have helped President Bill Clinton's political authority at a time when he needs it most.</p>

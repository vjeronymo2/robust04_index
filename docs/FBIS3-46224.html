Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, presided over the enlarged meeting. Attending the  meeting were leading comrades, including Sun Weiben, Zhou  Wenhua, Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Chen Yunlin, Yang  Guanghong, Wang Xianmin, Li Qinglin, and Yu Jingchang.    During the meeting Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial  party committee, delivered a speech in which he made  arrangements for the province's central work at present. He  pointed out: It is imperative to display the spirit of being  highly responsible for the party and the people to realistically  do a good job in dealing with the practical difficulties  cropping up in the people's livelihood and to tighten the  flesh-blood ties between the party and the people. He said:  During the period before the Spring Festival, the party and  government leading organs at all levels throughout the province  should do a good job in organizing their personnel to go deep  into grass-roots levels to deal with the practical problems.  Leading cadres in the party and government organs at all levels  should go deep into enterprises, rural villages, schools, and  poor households in line with their work division and duty share  so as to directly listen to the opinions and demands raised by  workers, peasants, and intellectuals, as well as to deal with on  the spot the prominent difficulties cropping up in the people's  livelihood. The provincial level departments should follow the  system of being responsible for helping the difficulty-plagued  units to go deep into the money-losing enterprises and poor  counties to deal with as much as possible the problems cropping  up in production and livelihood. They should concentrate their  efforts on successfully dealing with the prominent difficulties  cropping up in the following three fields of the people's  livelihood: 1) Efforts should be made to adopt every possible  way and means to deal with the problem of having staff members  and workers be in arrears with pay. 2) A good job should be  done in realistically giving a helping hand to poor households.  3) A good job should be done in realistically providing  supplies for festive markets and stabilizing commodity prices.  As for these problems, it is necessary to strictly assign  duties for personnel to deal with them. As for localities and  departments that have encountered problems because of paying  less attention to the difficulties and adopting ineffective  measures, their leading personnel should be held responsible for  the problems. Sun Weiben pointed out at the same time: It is  imperative to correctly deal with the relation between reform or  development and stability. Party committees should regard the  work of maintaining the social peace as the first-grade matter  of their current work and be greatly determined to correct the  phenomena of passiveness and corruption. They should vigorously  publicize the social morales of selflessly making contributions,  waging arduous struggles, and stressing thriftiness. He said:  All of these require us to be greatly determined to deal with  the problems of seeking private gains by taking advantage of  power through the methods of extorting money from the masses by  making things difficult and to handle the problems of  extravagance and waste as well as of abnormal consumption. Sun  Weiben also pointed out: It is imperative to enhance the  comprehensive management of public security, to create a safe  and orderly environment for the people's work and livelihood,  and to mobilize the entire party and society to make concerted  efforts to consolidate or develop the political situation of  stability and unity.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk intends to visit  Crimea and, in particular, those regions of the peninsula which  have suffered from the drought.    At a press conference held on his return from Luxembourg on  Tuesday, Kravchuk reported that during this trip he intends to  determine the scale of the aid which Kiev would render to Crimea.    Speaking about the present conflict between Kiev and  Simferopol, Kravchuk said that Crimea would be gradually  introduced into Ukraine's "constitutional regime" by means of  reasonable compromises but not by force.    Kravchuk said there would be no coercive measures with  respect to Crimea in the future and stressed that "Ukraine will  never overstep this threshold and will not allow anybody to do  this."    Kravchuk underlined that in accordance with the treaty on  partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and European Union  signed by him on Tuesday in Luxembourg, the European Union  expresses its support to Ukraine's territorial integrity and  sovereignty.    "Europe recognizes that this is a factor of European  stability," Kravchuk said.</p>

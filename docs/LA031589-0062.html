			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Millions of commuters were stranded throughout Brazil at the start of a 48-hour  general strike called against public transportation by leftist labor groups.  However, many Brazilians ignored the strike call and went to work.  International and domestic airlines flew on normal schedules, and supermarkets  and gas stations opened. The subway in Sao Paulo operated normally but Rio de  Janeiro's was shut down. Brazil's two largest labor movements -- the radical  left Central Workers Union and the more moderate General Workers Central --  called the strike to protest President Jose Sarney's anti-inflation policy,  which has frozen workers' pay since January.  </P></p>

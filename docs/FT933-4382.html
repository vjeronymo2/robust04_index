			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Lib Dems react with joy as Tories 'panic' LIBERAL Democrat leaders yesterday greeted joyfully the government's decision to concentrate its resources on fighting the Liberals in the south of England. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the government was 'panicking' in the face of a surge of support for his party. He was speaking as Mr John Major, the prime minister, began a short visit to the West Country in an attempt to revive party workers' morale. Several other ministers and Conservative officials have visited the area recently, including Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, who has identified the Liberal Democrats as the prime threat to the government at the next election. Mr Ashdown said the government was 'quite right' to switch its attention away from Labour, which was now 'non-existent' in much of the south-west. 'It is an indication of the extent of the government's panic,' he said. Mr Ashdown said he would ignore the personal tone of recent Conservative attacks on the trustworthiness of Liberal Democrats in general and leading members in particular. 'I think most people will treat that with the disdain that it deserves. If the Tories believe they are going to change people's votes by engaging in that kind of rhetoric they are making a cataclysmic error,' he said. The change of tack by the Conservatives follows the government's crushing defeat in the Christchurch by-election this year, when the Liberal Democrat candidate overturned a 30,000 majority. Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat MP in charge of campaigning policy, said the party had signed up 5,100 new members in August - its highest monthly total.</p>

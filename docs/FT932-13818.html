			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Hundreds of Czech companies face bankruptcy under new law HUNDREDS of Czech companies are bracing themselves for a tide of claims from creditors when a new bankruptcy law comes into effect today. It is unclear how many companies might be affected, but western consultants estimate that up to one third of the 1,500 companies sold last year through the voucher privatisation programme are technically bankrupt. Many others are on the brink of bankruptcy. After 40 years of safe but uninspired communist management, Czech companies face a big shake-out as they adapt to a market economy and foreign competition. Their immediate problem is a mountain of debts which makes them vulnerable to bankruptcy proceedings under the new law. The collapse of traditional markets in the former communist bloc, recession at home, and the impact of the break-up of Czechoslovakia, have intensified companies' financial difficulties. Debts have mounted rapidly as companies have stopped or delayed payments to one another. Unofficial estimates suggest inter-company debt is above Kcs200bn (Pounds 4.6bn). The government hopes the law will help to clear up at least part of the debt, while giving indebted companies a breathing space to negotiate with their creditors. Unlike an initial bankruptcy law approved in 1991 which was suspended because it left companies without defences against claims by creditors, the new law establishes a protective period of three to six months during which debtors and creditors can attempt to reach a settlement. Failing that, the company will be declared bankrupt and its assets seized. Lawyers say the bankruptcy process is rapid. Debtors and creditors can file for bankruptcy in a district or municipal court. Debtors have 15 days to apply for three months' protection, and creditors have 30 days to file claims after which time they are deemed to have waived their rights. 'This is a very aggressive bankruptcy law. Major creditors will need to watch developments closely and move quickly,' says Mr Daniel Arbess of White &amp; Case, the US law firm. Once proceedings have began the company cannot dispose of assets. The courts can also declare void any transaction concluded by the company during the previous three years if the transaction was made with intent to 'curtail' the creditors' rights. Lawyers say this clause is a potential minefield for foreign investors because it is open to widely differing interpretations. Under many joint venture agreements signed in the past three years, important assets of local companies have been transferred to joint ventures. Many of the local companies' liabilities were left out of the venture for legitimate business reasons, but lawyers fear anyone with a grudge could claim these agreements were designed to defraud creditors. 'Foreign investors had better be very careful in establishing joint ventures, and make sure everything is very transparent,' Mr Arbess says. While an initial rush of bankruptcy proceedings is expected, the full impact of the law is likely to take some time. 'The courts have no expertise in bankruptcy. You have a fancy bankruptcy law, but it's a big question whether the courts will be able to operate within the timetable set by the law,' says another lawyer. In any event, proceedings against companies privatised through the voucher programme can only begin two months after the companies' shares have been distributed - this has been indefinitely postponed in the Czech Republic because of a dispute with Slovakia - while proceedings against other privatised companies have to wait until at least one third of the shares are distributed.</p>

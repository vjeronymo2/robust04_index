			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: WITH GRILL AND A GLAZE, HIS DINNER'S A WINNER  </P> <P> Bob McCray spent most of his life having his dietary needs determined by  others.  </P> <P> First there was his mother, then the Army and then a wife.  </P> <P> He barbecued -- "burned" is a better word, he says -- occasionally, as befits  any dutiful suburban husband and father.  </P> <P> Then came the divorce and the jolting realization that (1) there's only so much  cornflakes a family of three can consume in a day and, (2) the quickest way to  go broke is feed yourself and two teen-agers three times a day in restaurants.  </P> <P> "I was forced to take a self-taught crash course in cooking," says McCray, 46,  of Newport Beach. "That was 8 years ago, and I like to think I've done pretty  well. At least, no one has died from my cooking -- that I know of, anyway."  </P> <P> Actually, the self-effacing McCray has done quite well, judging from comments  by those who have enjoyed his culinary efforts.  </P> <P> What he has actually done, he says, is simply master the barbecue process, both  outside with charcoal and inside with an electric grill.  </P> <P> "I think things just taste better, whether it's fish or venison," the avid  hunter and fisherman says.  </P> <P> "A little glaze can do wonders."  </P> <P> One of his favorites is the glaze he shared with Guys &amp; Galleys, which he  uses on many dishes but particularly pork chops. It's basically a mixture of  teriyaki and red-wine vinegar, with a little sugar and ginger thrown in.  </P> <P> "It's not a marinade, although I do marinate the meat a little in it," he says.  "The real flavor comes during the grilling process, and I baste the meat often  while it's cooking."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BOB McCRAY'S GLAZED PORK CHOPS  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ingredients  </P> <P> 6 medium pork chops  </P> <P> 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce  </P> <P> 1/2 cup red wine vinegar  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon sugar  </P> <P> Pinch of ground ginger  </P> <P> 8 to 10 drops Maggi sauce  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt  </P> <P> </P> <P> Preparation  </P> <P> Mix all sauce ingredients and set aside. Soak each chop in sauce for a few  minutes. When barbecue is at medium, place chops on grill and brush with sauce.  Barbecue 5 to 6 minutes a side, basting with sauce every few minutes. Serve  with rice and tomato wedges. (Serves 6.)  </P> <P> Each week, Orange County Life will feature a man who enjoys cooking and a  favorite recipe. Tell us about your candidate.

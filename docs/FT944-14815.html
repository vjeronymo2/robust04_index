			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Business blow for 'dapper' lobbyist At least one of the clients of Ian Greer Associates yesterday said it was considering severing its links with the lobbyists at the centre of the cash-for-questions allegations. IGA, which denies allegations that it was the channel for payments to MPs in return for parliamentary questions, is one of the longest-established and most influential of the lobbying groups. It numbers among its clients British Airways, British Gas, Cadbury Schweppes and Kingfisher. One corporation said yesterday: 'A lot of Ian Greer's major clients will be embarrased by this. It could be very damaging to his business. You're innocent until you're proved guilty, but I'm sure a lot of people are thinking very carefully.' Yesterday's comments were the first indication that IGA may have to fight to maintain its position. Mr Greer, a former Tory party agent, has established a formidable track record since he founded his company in 1982. Known for his attention to detail and his understanding of the way Whitehall works, his list of contacts is thought to be unrivalled. One client said: 'He's got a considerable amount of political clout. He has had a very good reputation for helping people to get their point across. He's a dapper little chap - rather serious.' Mr Steve Bevan, reporter with PR Week, described Mr Greer as 'charming, autocratic and inspiring fierce loyalty' among his Mr Bevan said that Mr Greer' strong links with the Tory party could pose a problem in the future. 'Not only did he lend John Major a car during the election, he is even rumoured to have driven it himself,' he said. 'But as companies wake up to the fact that there's a strong possibility of a Labour government, they may consider moving to lobbyists considered to have better Labour party links.' According to one senior public relations executive with a close knowledge of lobbying, Mr Greer specialised in cultivating an 'old-boy network'. IGA is one of five groups which recently founded a trade association and launched a code of conduct banning all financial links with MPs. Mr Andrew Gifford, group chairman, said at the time: 'With attention on MPs and their outside interests growing, a great deal of confusion has arisen over the relationship between lobbyists and MPs. By establishing a register of lobbyists . . . we hope to separate two distinct issues - the activities of professional lobbyists on the one hand and the outside interests of MPs on the other.'</p>

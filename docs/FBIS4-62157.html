			<p>BFN     [Text] [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Yeltsin and Kohl  reached a decision on the sendoff ceremony for Russian troops in  Berlin. [Video shows Defense Minister Pavel Grachev being  interviewed]    Pavel Sergeyevich, now that the president and the chancellor  have reached agreement on holding the ceremony in Berlin, can we  say that all the problems connected with withdrawing our troops  from Germany have been settled?    [Grachev] You cannot say that all the problems connected  with  withdrawing our troops have been settled. The fact is there are  fundamental political decisions by the chancellor and our  president. The ceremonial sendoff of the troops will take place  from Berlin. Now the onus is on us.    [Correspondent] There were plenty of discussions in the  German press about the Russian military insisting, I emphasize  insisting, that the ceremonial sendoff be with the Allies. In  order for there not to be any misunderstanding here, perhaps you  could comment on this.    [Grachev] This is really a misunderstanding. I do not want  to say that this is some sort of provocation, provocative  questions; no, this is purely and simply a misunderstanding.  We were not insisting, we were not even suggesting that the  withdrawal should be organized together and simultaneously with  the Allies. The timescale was laid down a long time ago.

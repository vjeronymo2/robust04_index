			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORD  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has increased its military presence in the Persian Gulf since  the Iran-Iraq cease-fire despite publicly urging withdrawal of foreign navies  from the region, a top U.S. commander said in Manama, Bahrain. "I see no  withdrawal of the Soviets in this area," said Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who  commands U.S. forces in the gulf in his post as chief of the U.S. Central  Command. "As a matter of fact . . . I see an increase in their diplomatic  initiatives . . . and their military assistance initiatives." Schwarzkopf said  there has been a gradual reduction of U.S. forces in the gulf since the Aug. 20  cease-fire but that the United States will keep at least six warships in the  region.  </P></p>

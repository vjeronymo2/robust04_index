			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: 3i's new accounts lift veil on activities 'IT'S ABOUT lifting the veil,' says Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive of 3i, the venture capital group, in a reference to the accounting changes and greater disclosure in the company's latest set of accounts. This year's financial statements provide far more information than either their predecessors, or many of their investment trust and venture capital competitors. They also represent a move to less conservative policies. In his review, Mr Macpherson highlights three areas of change in the accounts for the year to March 31 1992, which he says should provide a better understanding of the company's 'strengths and long term philosophy': disclosure of valuations policy on investments, and a change in some of these policies division of operating costs between revenue and investment realisation profits details of the portfolio, listing investments in excess of Pounds 5m, and giving a geographical and industrial split for all He says the changes reflect 3i's intention to seek a listing. They may yet be in the last set of accounts before the delayed flotation takes place. Mr Brian Larcombe, executive director for finance and planning, argues that the new approach places the accounts 'on the high ground', notably with a fair value for the assets on the balance sheet, while he says the accuracy of some other companies' valuations has been criticised. A three-page valuation policy statement shows that 3i calculates the gross valuation of profit-making companies by multiplying the latest reported earnings by the FT-Actuaries p/e ratio for the relevant industrial sector. Loss-making companies are generally valued at half the net tangible asset value, or if failure is expected, the equity is valued at nil. New investments are generally valued at cost until the first post-acquisition accounts are received. 3i then applies a liquidity discount to the gross value to reflect their lack of marketability. These have ranged from 40 per cent for companies with a capitalisation below Pounds 5m, through 20 per cent for investments on the unlisted securities market to nothing for listed investments and those valued at cost. The company recently reviewed the valuation policies reducing its top rate 40 per cent discount to 30 per cent, and valuing USM stocks at mid-market prices. That has increased net asset values by Pounds 32m. By transferring Pounds 13.6m of the operating and administrative costs from revenue to an investment realisation profits reserve, 3i is adopting a policy used by many investment trusts. But it also has the advantage of increasing the company's dividend cover, since it is only allowed to pay dividends from revenues. The geographical and industry-sector break-down of investments gives an insight into the breadth of the 3i portfolio. But the disclosure of investments above Pounds 5m is not complete. Up to ten of the 80 enterprises did not want to be named.</p>

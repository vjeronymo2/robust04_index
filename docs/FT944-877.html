			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Dublin allows release of nine IRA prisoners The government of the Irish republic last night approved the release from prison of nine IRA members. Ms Nora Owen, the justice minister, confirmed the release of the nine - which had been due last month but was cancelled after the shooting of a postal worker in Newry, County Down, during a robbery on a sorting office. Ms Owen, who also announced seven days' seasonal parole for 30 other IRA members, described the release as a significant gesture and a sign that the Irish government was moving to consolidate the peace process. But the move provoked fury among unionists. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said: 'This is political interference in the legal system to achieve short-term political gain. It is something that happens in a banana republic, not a civilised country.' Meanwhile, security sources in Northern Ireland said they believed a bomb found in Enniskillen last Sunday was made by the IRA - and may have been planted as a way of keeping up pressure on the government. The IRA leadership earlier this week denied that any of its units were responsible for planting the bomb, which was defused. But there are suspicions that the organisation has within it an element which is becoming increasingly impatient with the ceasefire. The prisoners include two men serving life sentences for murder, Mr Aaron O'Connell (35) and Mr Eamonn Nolan. The other seven men are serving between three and nine years and are all due out of prison within the next 12 months. They are Mr Owen Gallagher (44), serving four years for arms possession, Mr Gerard Hamilton (34), serving seven years, Mr John Hartnett (36), serving three years for arms possession, Mr Gerard Burns (38), serving six years for arms possession, Mr Richard Comerford, serving three years for arms possession, Mr Patrick Griffin (54), serving nine years for armed robbery and Mr Patrick Daly (49), serving four years for arms possession. Mr Thomas McMahon who was convicted for the murder of Lord Mountbatten in 1979 is not among the nine - but he is one of the 30 prisoners convicted for terrorist-type activities that have been granted short periods of Christmas parole.</p>

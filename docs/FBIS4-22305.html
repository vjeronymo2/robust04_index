			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with former General Procurator of the Russian </F> Federation Aleksey Kazannik by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA correspondent  Nikolay Kutorgin; in Omsk, date not given: "Why I Parted From  the President"]    [Text] Twice over the past five years of the  tumultuous Russian history has the name of an Omsk resident,  jurist Aleksey Kazannik, been prominently connected with that of  Boris Yeltsin. The first time was when he have up his seat in  the USSR Supreme Soviet for the disgraced politician.    Now the "unauthorized" resignation of General Procurator  Kazannik--immediately accepted by the president--is being  discussed equally heatedly. The jurist, in turn out of favor,  has returned to Omsk, where our correspondent met with him.    [Kutorgin] Aleksey Ivanovich, when you took the job you said  that the procuracy's work will be subordinate to the law.  However, the first serious disagreement with the authority, with  the president, showed that the "law of authority" in our country  is currently stronger than the authority of the law. Or is it  now quite so?    [Kazannik] Almost so. I was very well aware that the  president and his team are masters of creating dead-end  situations and resolving them by unlawful means. Take, for  instance, the October crisis, when the president placed the law  on the Constitutional Court on the list of suspended acts. But  it never occurred to me that they would so frankly, so crudely  violate the still "warm" Constitution, and the State Duma Decree  "On Political and Economic Amnesty." In a civilized country the  entire team would have been sent packing for such a violation.    Still, I am convinced that this is not a defeat of the law  and not a personal tragedy for General Procurator Kazannik. In  the final analysis, this is the defeat of the entire  presidential team. People who blindly believe in the primacy of  force over legality are doomed. Society cannot exist without  continuity, stability, predictability. Without strict compliance  with the law we will not know what awaits us tomorrow, even by  the end of the day. Daily uncertainty wears people out, makes  their life unbearable. We cannot live like this any more.    [Kutorgin] Does this mean that you have reappraised your  values? I am a witness that the act of giving up your seat in  the Supreme Soviet in favor of Yeltsin was not an emotional  reaction--rather, you carried out your electoral promise to Omsk  residents, which you had given at a rally long before you were  elected to the Supreme Soviet. You sincerely believed in Yeltsin  then--a democrat and a statesman. Does this mean that you see  him differently now?    [Kazannik] I will tell you honestly. Until recently I saw  Yeltsin through the rose-colored glasses of 1985-1989. I was  greatly impressed by his speech at one of the last party  congresses, in which he talked about the lack of democracy,  about abuse in the upper echelons of power. I especially liked  his confession that in the past he had been afraid to tell the  truth. I also liked Yeltsin's democratic style: He goes to the  stores himself, rides the subway and trolley buses. I did not  pay attention, though, to the fact that whenever he went to a  store, by pure coincidence there were also journalists with  television cameras there. Not least, there was also this  traditional feeling of sympathizing with the underdog. And I  sincerely hoped then that he would be able to bring together  truly democratic forces in the USSR Supreme Soviet.    He did not bring anybody together.    [Kutorgin] Wait a minute, your protege was a leader in the  Interregional Deputy Group [IDG].    [Kazannik] You know, there are formal and informal leaders.  Yeltsin was the leader by virtue of his job. The IDG's informal  leader was Andrey Dmitriyevich Sakharov. I have no doubt that  had Sakharov still been with us now, he would have voiced his  contempt for the president and his team's petty intrigues around  the amnesty, for instance.    [Kutorgin] So when was it, Aleksey Ivanovich, that you saw  the light?    [Kazannik] Paraphrasing the well-known lines of a poet, I  can  say that you see big things better from a distance, but small  ones in close-up. Looking from Omsk, I thought that Boris  Nikolayevich was not a bad leader. It was painful for me to see  his mistakes, which were literally there on the surface. But to  get to know a person you have to eat a bushel of salt with him.  In my time as the general procurator I was not that close to  Yeltsin. Nevertheless, I became convinced that this man has no  respect for the law. He can make a decision at any moment that  would be contrary to the law and the Constitution, and instruct  his team to find a way to get around the prescriptions of legal  norms. And they would work hard to accomplish it...    Yeltsin never asked me in our conversations whether the  procuracy strictly observed the law in investigations of  criminal offenses. But he did ask often why such or such people  were still free. After all, he would say, they have committed  crimes, and something should be done about it. I calmly  explained to the president that I would rather put a brand on my  own forehead than put my signature to a blank piece of paper.  That until we have convincing proof that these people have  committed a crime, they cannot be detained or arrested. This is  out of the question. And the president agreed with my arguments.  But when it came to the notorious amnesty, I finally realized  that our views on the law differ. Neither an individual nor  society will benefit from arbitrariness and lawlessness,  however. As soon as we learn to observe the law, in a month or  two our life will become much easier...    [Kutorgin] So perhaps it was a different "reading" of the  procuracy's duties on the part of you and the president that  gave rise to rumors about the need to downsize it as a body not  well suited to contribute to the envisaged reformation of our  state? Or were these rumors groundless?    [Kazannik] The president had nothing to do with it. There  was  a large group of democrats at the Constitutional Assembly who  were hostile to the procuracy. Now they work as the president's  representatives in the State Duma, are generously represented in  parliamentary factions Russia's Choice and PRES [Party of  Russian Unity and Accord].    Interestingly, I have not met opponents of a strong  procuracy  either among communists or liberal democrats. Only "real  democrats" kept proposing to eliminate the procuracy or  substantially cut its functions and subordinate it to the  Ministry of Justice. The arguments in support of it were  laughable. The procuracy, they said, does not fit into the  system of separation of branches. Besides, it used to "serve"  the totalitarian regime. I had the impression that these people  were seriously trying to fit our traditional Russian reality  into dogmatic theories of Western thinkers, and with the naivete  of a six-year-old believed that other state bodies did not serve  the totalitarian regime.    It appears that everything has been ruined in Russia by  now--the economy, legality, culture, morality... Only the  procuracy remained as a single centralized system. To a certain  extent it acts as a guarantor of the unity and territorial  integrity of Russia. In an environment where our country is  overcome by a tidal wave of crime, we cannot tinker with the  procuracy. It took a tremendous effort on my part to "squeeze"  Article 129 into the draft Constitution literally days before  its publication, and thus protect and legally formalize the  system of procuracy organs.    It is regrettable that Western specialists understand the  danger of reforming the procuracy, but our democrats do not. In  May last year a pan-European conference on the problems of  procuracy reform was held in Vienna. And specialists from all  countries came to two fundamental conclusions. First, attempts  to reform the procuracy without taking into account historical,  national, and cultural specificities usually do not succeed.    Second, in the environment of instability, social crises,  and  cataclysms, it is extremely dangerous to reform the procuracy.  We have ignored the conclusions of this extremely authoritative  conference. Of course, I support an increased role of the  courts. But what is the court now, with its high court costs?  Not every person, especially a disfranchised one, can turn to it  for protection of his interests. The procuracy has ended up  being the only organization that provides free legal aid.    [Kutorgin] In Russia since time immemorial the procuracy  also  carried out general oversight. Especially now that the sarcastic  conclusion of the classic is more true than ever: People do  steal in Russia...    [Kazannik] Only a blind man would not see this. The  democrats, however, have started telling us: You have no  business at enterprises; if they have a problem, let them go to  court. How do we resolve this new controversy: theft on an  immense scale and new forms of managing production? Under my  leadership the General Procuracy developed a concept of  reforming general oversight: The procuracy must interfere  immediately wherever the interests of entire regions, cities, or  certain categories of the population are encroached upon.    For instance, we were checking on compliance with the  legislation on preferences for Chernobyl victims. The situation  is bad. And who except ourselves will check it out objectively?  The sectoral inspectorate? Of course not. Or, for instance, the  problem of implementing the legislation on support of orphaned  children. We absolutely have to protect the interests of those  without a voice, too. That is, the interests of disabled,  underage, and elderly people. Those who for some reason do not  even know where to turn to.    Third. There now exist 49 inspectorates--tax, customs,  environmental protection, and others. They quite often violate  the law. Who will keep them in line? And fourth. There are now  many parties and various sociopolitical entities. By their  unlawful activities they can bring society to an explosion in a  matter of days. Who will conduct oversight in this area? The  same goes for numerous private investigative and protection  services. All of this falls into the sphere of general  oversight. Instead, we are told: We need to fold the procuracy...    [Kutorgin] Perhaps it is the mafiosi structures that have  the  greatest stake in weakening the procuracy? And those people who  have something to fear?    [Kazannik] I said the same thing many times publicly...    [Kutorgin] Could it be that the arguments over the  procuracy's oversight rights also reflect the mushrooming  administrative apparat's struggle for existence?    [Kazannik] Undoubtedly. The apparat has grown almost 10-fold  as compared to the end of 1980's. And in my opinion, the growth  of the apparat is in direct correlation to the bureaucrats'  incompetency. This actually is obvious. When there is a highly  skilled professional, he carries out a certain function or task  alone. When there are no professionals, you need 10-15 clerks. A  sad sign of our times... The government moved into the huge  White House--there are no vacant offices there anymore. The  president's staff moved to Staraya Square--no more available  space there. In the Kremlin everything is filled to capacity.  Even in our General Procuracy, which I wanted to reduce by half,  there are twice as many staff as there were in the all-Union  procuracy.    [Kutorgin] Where does such a influx of incompetency come  from?    [Kazannik] I see two reasons for it. The first, and most  important one. When the democrats came to power they did not  have experience in administrative work. They did figure out, of  course, that this way they would not stay in power. So they  started to appoint people not by their business or professional  qualities but by the principle of personal loyalty. It is not  accidental that we kept reading in the newspapers at the time  the assurances of contenders for cushy jobs: "I am loyal..." The  second reason. A predominant amount of people in the highest  echelons of power were party leaders. They, however, provided  only general leadership. As they say, upheld the general line.  As to routine work, they considered it beneath themselves to  engage in it. This generally has led to the apparat's growth and  its incompetency.    [Kutorgin] It looks as though the new constitution will not  provide a barrier to this process either...    [Kazannik] We may criticize the new constitution, but  currently it is a guarantee of stability of the state. This is  the first constitution that clearly codifies the principle of  separation of branches. But I see tremendous danger in the  attempts that immediately ensued--to violate the constitution or  get around it. One such attempt manifested itself in the  attitude toward the issue of the amnesty. Another is in the idea  to draft and sign a Memorandum of Civil Accord. Now many  democrats sing praise for the president's initiative, admire his  "propensity" for compromise and "desire" to establish peace and  accord in society.    Excuse me, but what can you write in such a memorandum?  Proclaim to the entire world that parties and sociopolitical  movements will temporarily suspend their political activities  and will not hold rallies and demonstrations? That miners and  oil industry workers undertake to work without pay--just for  moral satisfaction? And that all of us are to work hard strictly  for the benefit of the coming generations? We have already lived  like this for 70 years.    A reasonable question arises, though: How will the  Memorandum  and the Constitution correlate? The constitution has supreme  legal force over any legal act. The constitution has given us  extensive rights, including the right to engage in political  activities. And if we put these restrictions into the  Memorandum, it will again be lawlessness. I am amazed that such  ideas, cataclysmic for society, occur to the bright minds in the  president's team. For us, the constitution is the foundation of  civil peace and accord. By the way, the president himself said  that. But his words often diverge from his deeds.    [Kutorgin] And in whose, as you put it, bright minds,  specifically, are such ideas born?    [Kazannik] Here is an example. The unsinkable democrat  Poltoranin speaks at a press conference and says: We should not  hold general elections in 1996; what we need is to extend the  terms of the president and the Federal Assembly for two more  years. We should not, he says, distract the people from creative  labor with an election campaign. While they--that is, Mikhail  Poltoranin and company--will direct. Let people work. It does  not matter that the constitution says the direct opposite. The  important point is that the democratic authorities are not bound  by any laws; they are above the constitution!    Or, I read contrived "analytical" articles written by the  patented democrat Gavriil Popov. Without a second thought he  accuses me of some collusion with the president, faults me for  not protesting, as Russia's general procurator, the Duma  decision on political and economic amnesty while it was still at  the stage of drafting and adoption. According to him, I was  supposed to go to the Duma and convince the deputies to not  adopt the "bad" decree on amnesty.    But it was the democrats at the Constitutional Assembly who  stripped the general procurator of the right of legislative  initiative, the right to issue at his discretion an evaluation  of draft laws!    And more "practical" advice from Popov: Instead of carrying  out the State Duma's amnesty decision, I should have simply...  resigned. In his logic, the general procurator behaved not like  a mature politician but as a professional jurist. Is this where  the root of all evil is?! Wait a minute, Mr. Popov, no  procurator likes the obsolete Criminal Code these days, among  other reasons because it does not contain norms on combating  corruption and organized crime. So what do we do now--do all  procurators stop applying the norms of criminal law and resign  en masse? It is not a procurator's business to discuss such  things! He must ensure precise and undeviating compliance with  the law. Regardless of what kind of law it is.    Perhaps the minds of many democrats are organized in a way I  cannot comprehend. Their thoughts regarding compliance with the  law go in an entirely different direction. It was recommended to  me, for instance, not to release the Lefortovo prisoners without  first obtaining a pledge from them that they would not engage in  political activities. But all of this would be contrary to the  constitution! The most adamant democrats maintain, however,  quite seriously that observing the constitution and the law is  not the main task of the general procurator. You see, he must be  a politician and personally loyal to the president.    [Kutorgin] Is this not where the proposal came from to  transfer Lefortovo prison to the procuracy's jurisdiction?    [Kazannik] For us, it was a complete surprise. Although, you  know, I have also begun to get used to the fact that you cannot  find the authors of presidential edicts and directives no matter  how hard you look. The liquidation of the Ministry of Security  was a surprise even for our glorious chekists. Thousands of  criminal cases that were being investigated by security organ  investigators were left hanging. In many of them, people had  been arrested. They started moving "cases"--in sacks!--to the  general procuracy without any legal grounds. We, however, do not  have the staff, office space, or money to investigate "outside"  criminal cases. We got our heads together. Prepared a draft  presidential directive to transfer the investigative detention  facility in Lefortovo to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs],  and the investigative staff, money, etc. to the procuracy. The  heads of all the agencies involved initialed the draft--myself,  Golushko, and Yerin. Then the directive comes out, from which I  learn that the general procuracy for the first time in its  history has acquired its own prison. That is something to see!    [Kutorgin] The paradox of the case with your resignation,  Aleksey Ivanovich, is apparently clear to everybody. The press,  however, especially the Moscow press, tirelessly continue to  label you as a Don Quixote, a fighter of windmills. Why do you  think this is happening?    [Kazannik] I think that it is simply beyond comprehension  for  journalists that a normal person can give up a high-level state  job and a good salary. For this kind of goodies, some probably  reason, one could keep in prison nearly the entire population of  the country! After all, in the 1930's-1950's some criminal cases  were fabricated for the single purpose of confiscating good  apartments from honest people and giving them to chekists who  did well in uncovering "enemies of the people." And here a man  voluntarily, for the sake of some amnesty, gives up material  things. Is it not obvious that he is God's fool?    [Kutorgin] Forgive me for asking, Aleksey Ivanovich, but  could you reveal the burning secret: How much was the general  procurator paid?    [Kazannik] The working people's acute curiosity regarding  this issue is understandable. After all, we are still ruled by  the Bolshevik perception that only wealth is worse than poverty.  Well, after the new year my salary with all allowances amounted  to almost 1 million rubles. A month. I was given an apartment in  the so-called "presidential house." The general procuracy, in  keeping with the law, provided me with financial aid (fully  repayable), to help me settle in Moscow. But now it is all...  history. I returned the apartment to the government of Moscow,  and the furniture and other property--to the general procuracy  apparat, in accordance with the inventory. Everything, to the  last nail.    The second reason for all the scoffing around my persona is  completely paradoxical: I wanted... to increase the fight  against crime, to protect the individual's inalienable right to  life. To this end, I intended to reform the procuracy. But this  is not a realistic undertaking, they said; this is fighting  windmills. We, meanwhile, drafted a concept of procuracy reform.  We put at the forefront (on a pedestal, if you wish) the central  figure in the criminal process--the investigator. He should be  paid well, and be positioned high in the rank structure. A  talented investigator, even in a rayon procuracy, should be  awarded the title "distinguished," "honorary," "people's  academician." Like rural school director Sukhomlinskiy!    In this undertaking I was met with understanding by the  general procuracy's collegium, support in the regions, and  frankly, I was joyous. Some journalists, however, began to  contend that I had been deceived... everywhere. That is, that I  was allegedly surrounded only by crooks.    [Kutorgin] Is it true that the presidential representatives  in some regions attempted to "pressure" you and your staff,  "influence" you, so to say, in their interests?    [Kazannik] Yes. After the October events the entire scope of  authority in the regions essentially shifted to heads of  administration and presidential representatives. Much like a  long time ago, when petitioners went to Lenin, they began  showing up at the general procuracy with one and the same  request--to immediately remove the local procurator and replace  him with one of "their people!" The main reason? Procurators'  "hesitation" during the October crisis. In other words, they  were making demands on the procurators in the spirit of old  party traditions: You did not support the president's course,  they said, did not show political maturity. "Vacillated together  with the course..." We immediately turned away such petitioners.    I have not relieved of duty a single procurator for  political  reasons. Not a single one! The important point is not in waving  the presidential banner, which has long turned into a worn rag,  but, I repeat, strictly observing the law.    [Kutorgin] Those who have visited you at home before,  Aleksey  Ivanovich, will confirm, as I can, that the pilgrimage to power  has not given you any material wealth. You still live in a  Khrushchev period small apartment. With a view of an oil  refinery and a penal colony. Next door is a dormitory for early  parolees. Honestly--do you not regret that you ended up where  you started?    [Kazannik] Honestly--a professor and a doctor of science  probably could count on better housing. But I do not regret the  loss of Moscow conveniences. Money is dear, but honor is dearer.    My own fate is not that important. I will return to the  university, to my old collective, to my students. I will nurture  new jurists into independent procurators who respect the law.  They are the future... Will get involved in political activities  as a volunteer. Perhaps I will give a hand to some people in the  parliamentary and presidential elections in 1996. I realize that  I have used up the limit of errors. If I am going to "fall" for  someone, this time there should be no mistakes. It should be  once and for all...</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Draft proposal signed "President of the Republic of </F> Kazakhstan": "Formation of a Eurasian Union of States"]    [Text] At the present time all CIS countries are continuing  to experience a profound crisis in all spheres of social  life--the economy, policy, ideology, and inter-nation  relations--and socioeconomic tension is on the rise. This is  happening under conditions where the development of the CIS is  being determined by two trends. On the one hand the continued  formation of national statehood is taking place, on the other, a  trend toward the integration of the CIS countries is being  observed.    The CIS, as an interstate association, is performing a  positive role in the legal structuring of the interstate  relations of its constituent countries. CIS potential is not  exhausted. Nonetheless, the structure of CIS organs that exists  at the present time is preventing the realization to the full  extent of the available integration potential. Not only the  leaders of the CIS countries, but also a large part of the  population of these states are calling attention to this.    The experience of CIS functioning in past years shows the  need for a transition to a new level of integration that would  guarantee observance of the jointly adopted commitments by all  the participating states.    International practice shows that any interstate association  goes through different stages in its development and is  supplemented by new forms of cooperation. The CIS has  appreciable advantages--the high degree of integration of the  economy and similar sociopolitical structures and mentality of  the population and also the multinational composition of the  majority of the republics and common historical traditions.    All this testifies to the need for a combination of the  process of national-state building and the preservation and  development on this basis of interstate integration processes.  The logic of history is such that integration in the world  community is possible only by the joint efforts of all CIS  countries taking advantage of the powerful integration potential  that has taken shape over decades.    The actual conditions show that while perfecting the  mechanisms of the CIS, we should not regard it as the sole form  of association. As practice has shown, the further development  of the CIS countries is being held back by the insufficiency of  the intrinsic potential of each of them. The development of the  latter is possible only with the economic integration of the  countries of the post-Soviet space on a new, market basis.    The inherited structures of the single national economic  complex are continuing to corrode. Outmoded forms of economic  relations are objectively dying away. At the same time perfected  production engineering relations corresponding to the economic  interests of our countries in the near and distant future are  being disrupted.    Market reformations have universal regularities. No country  can ignore them without succumbing here to economic romanticism.  It would be expedient to combine the efforts geared to market  reform of the economies of the countries of the former USSR on  the basis of the close business relations that have already  taken shape over the course of decades.    As world practice shows, only with collective efforts are  transitional societies in a position to undertake successful  modernization. At the same time, on the other hand, we see that  the continuing attempts to tackle this task by individual  countries of the CIS alone are, as before, proving unsuccessful.  They will remain such until the realization of economic  integration on new conditions. On the other hand, the  unrealistic nature of the attempts at a reorientation toward  some regional economic associations in the far abroad is obvious.    The lack of coordination in price policy in respect to  exported raw material, which is having a negative effect on the  states' economic position, has become a serious problem for  them. On the other hand, this is introducing an element of  instability to the settled world economic relations and forcing  third countries to adopt strict sanctions. Exports of raw  material and energy resources are our states' most important  revenue item. There is an urgent need in this connection for a  unified export policy system within the CIS countries in the  interest of all the participants with the adoption of serious  measures in the event of some country's failure to observe the  quotas and prices agreed upon.    An important component of the successful implementation of  market reforms is an improvement in the national legislative  bodies of the CIS countries. Further modernization is impossible  without the rapprochement of the legislative foundations of  economic activity, inasmuch as the current differences between  them are becoming a serious obstacle to integrative processes in  the economy.    Considering the differences among the countries in levels of  development of the market economy and the democratization of  political processes, we propose the formation of an additional  integration structure--a Eurasian Union--in harmony with the  activity of the CIS. Account is taken here of the polyvariant  nature of the integration and the different pace and the  heterogeneousness and varying vectors in the development of the  CIS states. This is reason to speak of the urgent need for the  formation of a new economic order in the CIS. The purpose is the  harmonization of economic policy and the adoption of joint  programs of economic reforms binding on the participating states.    The socioeconomic and political crisis is occurring against  the background of the multinational composition of the  population of practically all the CIS states. As a consequence,  interethnic tension leading not only to intrastate tension but  also, in a number of cases, growing into interstate conflicts is  on the rise. This situation is undermining the very institution  of the CIS. Consequently, it is essential by joint efforts to  devise mechanisms for deterring, localizing, and extinguishing  various types of conflicts.    At the present time all CIS countries are searching for  forms  of constitutional arrangement appropriate for the internal  conditions. But, as practice shows, neither the unitary nor the  federative CIS states can be considered completely stable.    A solution to the questions of economic integration dictates  the need for the creation of political institutions possessing a  sufficient volume of authority. They must incorporate within  themselves the regulatory functions of states' mutual relations  in the economic, political, legal, environmental, cultural, and  educational spheres proper.    Thus the time has come for the removal of the obstacles to  interaction at the highest level and the simultaneous creation  of the instruments for this.    A process of disintegration in the sphere of science,  culture, and education is taking place at this time. The once  unified cultural and educational space is becoming disconnected.  The claim under these conditions that "science has no borders"  is proving to be simply unfounded. Against the background of the  intensifying socioeconomic difficulties the drain of specialists  from the sphere of science, culture, and education, the decline  in intellectual potential, and the fall in the standard and  quality of education are increasing. These processes are leading  not only to the rupture of the once unified system, but also to  isolation from the cultural and scientific achievements of world  civilization.    At the same time, on the other hand, the aspiration to  intensify integration processes in the economy and policy should  be based on the preservation and development of a concerted  policy in the sphere of culture, education, and science. It is  essential to preserve and augment the internationalization of  the processes of the acquisition and practical use of new  knowledge. The integration of R&amp;D in the S&amp;T sphere has  become  an inalienable part of the globalization of industrial activity  in general.    The isolation of the post-Soviet space from the world  cultural and scientific community is fraught with the danger of  a new stage in the lag of the technological sphere.    A key task for the new states is the assurance of  territorial  integrity and security. At the present time the post-Soviet  space is a zone of instability and the combination of various  types of conflicts and is also experiencing the impact of  centers of tension outside of the CIS. The guarding of the  exterior borders and the stabilization of the situation in the  conflict regions may be accomplished only by the joint efforts  of all the states concerned and requires the concerted approach  of the participants to a range of questions of a defense nature.    The problem of environmental safety remains one of the most  painful and unresolved problems in the CIS countries. The  environmental tension has been caused by a number of factors.  The consequences of the testing of nuclear weapons and the  activity of the nuclear power stations, the contamination of the  environment with industrial waste, and the degradation of the  natural environment as a result of man's economic activity (the  running dry of water basins, deforestation, soil erosion, and so  forth) may be attributed to these.    These problems are urgent for practically all CIS countries,  especially since the main zones of ecological disaster are  located in border areas, as a rule. They have been caused by the  community of the evolved production engineering base and the  methods of economic activity, the basis of which was the  extensive focus. Not one of these problems can be resolved today  by the independent efforts of one, even the biggest, state.  Environmental preservation is a global task requiring  large-scale capital investments and a combination of the efforts  of all states.    The draft of the creation of a new integrative association,  provisionally entitled the Eurasian Union, is offered for  discussion.  <H8>  Eurasian Union </H8>   The Eurasian Union is a union of equal independent states  that is geared to the realization of the national-state  interests of each participant and that has an aggregate  integration potential. The Eurasian Union is a form of the  integration of sovereign states aimed at a strengthening of  stability and security and socioeconomic modernization in the  post-Soviet space.    Economic interests determine the bases of the convergence of  the independent states. The political institutions of the  Eurasian Union should adequately reflect these interests and  contribute to economic integration.  <H8>  I. Principles of Association </H8>   The following principles and mechanism for the formation of  the Eurasian Union are proposed:    national referenda or parliamentary decisions on states'  membership in the Eurasian Union;    participant signing of a treaty on creation of the Eurasian  Union based on principles of equality, noninterference in one  another's internal affairs, and respect for sovereignty,  territorial integrity, and the sanctity of borders. The treaty  shall contain the legal and organizational prerequisites for an  extension of integration in the direction of the formation of an  economic, currency, and political union;    associate membership in the Eurasian Union is not permitted;    decisions shall be adopted in the Eurasian Union on the  basis  of the principle of a necessary majority of four-fifths of the  total number of participants.    Independent states shall be members of the Eurasian Union  given fulfillment of the following preliminary conditions:    obligatory observance of adopted interstate agreements;    mutual recognition of the evolved state and political  institutions of Eurasian Union participants;    recognition of territorial integrity and sanctity of  borders;    renunciation of economic, political, and other forms of  pressure in interstate relations;    termination of mutual hostilities.    New countries shall be admitted to the Eurasian Union  following the presentation of expert findings concerning their  readiness to join the Eurasian Union by the unanimous vote of  all members of the Eurasian Union. The expert findings shall be  produced by a body formed on a parity basis by the states that  have expressed consent to become members of the Eurasian Union.    Eurasian Union states may participate in other integration  associations, including the CIS, on the basis of associate or  permanent membership, or they may have observer status.    Each participant may withdraw from the Eurasian Union,  having  given the other states advance notice no later than six months  prior to the adoption of the decision.    The formation of the following supranational bodies is  proposed:    A Council of Heads of State and Heads of Government of the  Eurasian Union--the supreme organ of political leadership of the  Eurasian Union. Each participant shall preside in the Eurasian  Union for six months at a time in Russian alphabetical order.    The supreme consultative-deliberative body is the Eurasian  Union Parliament. The parliament shall be formed by way of the  delegation of deputies of the parliaments of the participants on  the basis of equal representation from each participant or by  way of direct elections. Decisions by the Eurasian Union  Parliament shall take effect following their ratification by the  Eurasian Union state parliaments. The question of ratification  must be considered within one month.    The main area of Eurasian Union parliamentary activity shall  be to coordinate the legislating bodies of the participants to  ensure the development of a single economic space and the  accomplishment of tasks pertaining to the protection of the  social rights and interests of individuals and mutual respect  for state sovereignty and the rights of citizens in Eurasian  Union states.    A common legal base regulating the mutual relations of the  economic transactors of the participants shall be created via  the Eurasian Union Parliament.    A Eurasian Union Foreign Ministers Council for the purpose  of  the coordination of foreign policy activity.    The Eurasian Union Interstate Executive Committee--the  permanent executive and control body. The leader of the  Executive Committee shall be appointed in turn from  representatives of the participants by the heads of state of the  Eurasian Union for a time that they determine. The structures of  the Executive Committee shall be formed from representatives of  all the participants.    The Eurasian Union, in the shape of its Executive Committee,  should acquire the status of observer in a number of important  international organizations.    The Eurasian Union Executive Committee Information Bureau.  The adoption of a special commitment or law by the participants  to prevent unfriendly words about the parties to the treaty that  could damage relations between them.    An Education, Culture, and Science Council. The shaping of a  concerted educational policy and cultural and scientific  cooperation and exchange and joint activity in the creation of  textbooks and aids.    For the more in-depth coordination and efficiency of the  activity of the Eurasian Union countries, the creation in each  of them of a state committee (ministry) for Eurasian Union  affairs would be expedient.    At the level of ministers of Eurasian Union countries the  holding of regular meetings and consultations on questions of  health care, education, labor and employment, the environment,  culture, the fight against crime, and so forth.    Encouragement of the activity of nongovernment organizations  in various spheres of cooperation in accordance with the  national legislation of the Eurasian Union participants.    The official language of the Eurasian Union, together with  the functioning of the national bodies of language legislation,  shall be Russian.    Citizenship. The unrestricted movement of citizens within  the  Eurasian Union will require the coordination of external--in  relation to third countries--visa policy. Upon a change in the  country of residence within the Eurasian Union, an individual  shall, if he so wishes, automatically acquire the citizenship of  the other country.    A city at the intersection of Europe and Asia, Kazan or  Samara, for example, could be proposed as the capital of the  Eurasian Union.  <H8>  II. The Economy </H8>   For the purpose of creating a single economic space, it is  proposed to form within the framework of the Eurasian Union a  number of supranational coordinating structures:    a commission for economics under the auspices of the  Eurasian  Union Council of the Heads of State elaborating the main  directions of economic reforms within the framework of the  Eurasian Union with regard to the interests of the national  states and presenting them for confirmation to the Eurasian  Union Council of Heads of State;    a commission for raw material resources of Eurasian Union  exporting countries for the harmonization and confirmation of  prices and quotas for exported raw material resources and energy  and the signing of the corresponding interstate agreement.  Coordination of policy in the sphere of the mining and sale of  gold and other precious metals;    a fund for economic and technical cooperation formed from  contributions of the Eurasian Union countries. The fund would  finance promising, research-intensive economic and S&amp;T  programs  and assist in the accomplishment of a wide range of tasks,  including legal, tax, financial, environmental, and so forth;    a commission for interstate financial and industrial groups  and joint ventures;    an Eurasian Union international investment bank;    an Eurasian Union interstate arbitration tribunal for  economic matters legally ruling on contentious issues and  imposing penal sanctions;    a commission for the introduction of a monetary unit of  settlement (transferable ruble).  <H8>  III. Science, Culture, Education </H8>   It is proposed to implement a number of measures to preserve  the potential achieved in previous decades and increase  integration in this sphere:    to create Eurasian Union common research centers for basic  research in the sphere of modern learning;    to create a Eurasian Union fund for the development of  scientific research uniting the research outfits of various  countries;    to create a committee for relations in the sphere of  culture,  science, and education under the auspices of the Eurasian Union  Council of Heads of Government;  <H8>  IV. Defense </H8>   The conclusion within the Eurasian Union framework of the  following accords is proposed:    a treaty on joint actions to strengthen the national armed  forces of Eurasian Union members and to protect the exterior  borders of the Eurasian Union.    The Eurasian Union proposes the creation of a common defense  space for the coordination of defense activity:    the formation of a collective Eurasian Union peacekeeping  force for maintaining stability and extinguishing conflicts in  the participating countries and between them. With the consent  of Eurasian Union participants, in accordance with international  rules of law, the dispatch of the peacekeeping force to conflict  zones on the territory of the Eurasian Union;    the presentation of a collective appeal of Eurasian Union  countries to international organizations, including the UN  Security Council, for conferring the status of peacekeeping  force on the joint contingent;    the creation of an interstate center for problems of nuclear  disarmament with the participation of representatives of  international organizations.    All states of the Eurasian Union, aside from Russia, shall  maintain their nuclear-free status.  <H8>  V. The Environment </H8>   The formation as soon as possible of the following  mechanisms  is essential:    an environment fund under the auspices of the Eurasian Union  Council of Heads of State realizing within the framework of the  Eurasian Union environmental programs and financed by all the  participating states;    the coordination of operations with international  organizations to reduce the degree of environmental pollution;    the adoption of short-term and long-term programs on major  problems of environmental restoration and the elimination of the  consequences of ecological catastrophes (the Aral, Chernobyl,  the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Range);    the adoption of a Eurasian Union interstate treaty on the  storage of nuclear waste.    History is affording us an opportunity to enter the 21st  Century by the civilized path. One method, in our view, is the  realization of the integration potential of the initiative  pertaining to the creation of a Eurasian Union reflecting the  objective logic of the development of the post-Soviet space and  the will of the peoples of the former USSR to integration.

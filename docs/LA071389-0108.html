			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMOVAL OF SODIUM COMPOUND SPILLED IN TRAIN DERAILMENT BEGINS  </P> <P> Trucks have begun hauling sodium bicarbonate from a San Bernardino neighborhood  where 15,000 cubic yards of the sand-like material spilled from a runaway  train.  </P> <P> Southern Pacific spokesman Jim Loveland said the railroad obtained a permit  from the State Lands Commission to dump the sodium bicarbonate in the dry bed  of Owens Lake in Inyo County.  </P> <P> It will take 20 days and cost $500,000 to relocate the material, which  originally was mined from Owens Lake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Health Problems  </P> <P> Some San Bernardino residents, complaining of health problems, have pressed the  railroad to move the sodium bicarbonate, which spilled from a freight train  that derailed and killed four people May 12.  </P> <P> But Inyo County environmentalists have fought the effort, saying the railroad  should first have been required to complete an environmental impact report.  </P></p>

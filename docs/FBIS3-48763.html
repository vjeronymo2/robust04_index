The sources said that next week Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata  will announce the government's intention on bilateral assistance  to Macedonia, along with additional medical and food assistance  through United Nations organizations.    They said the government will dispatch a five-to-six member  survey mission to Macedonia in the spring to study what kind of  technical assistance Japan should render.    Japan will send experts on business management and  revitalization of small and medium-sized enterprises to  Macedonia and receive two or three Macedonian Government  officials in Tokyo, they said.    The sources said the government will also continue studying  whether to contribute personnel to the former Yugoslavia under  the country's law on cooperation with UN peacekeeping operations.    Shunji Yanai, a senior Foreign Ministry official and head of  a Japanese survey team that recently visited the region to look  into the matter, told a press conference last week that  Macedonia asked for economic assistance and cooperation to solve  its debt problem.    Macedonia, which is the poorest and the most economically  troubled of the former Yugoslav states, is presently untouched  by the conflict that has spread through the region.</p>

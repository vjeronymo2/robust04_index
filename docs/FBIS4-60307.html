			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah: "Al-Jawi: The Fighting in Yemen </F> is a Belated Dowry for the Preservation of Unity"]    [Excerpt] London -- Yemeni political sources do not rule  out the possibility that the next 24 hours will witness some  political developments which might overturn the current military  balance between the northerners and the southerners. The  sources did not disclose details of the discussions at the  emergency meeting of the Political Bureau of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] which was held the day before yesterday  and paved the way for yesterday's meeting, but they expected  important decisions to be made that would strengthen the  steadfastness of the southern forces on all fronts to halt the  advance of the northern forces and prevent them from controlling  the main roads leading to Aden.    'Umar al-Jawi, secretary general of the opposition's Yemeni  Unionist Grouping, who supports the YSP's position, however,  dismissed the claim that the Higher Salvation Council announced  in Aden three days ago was a government substitute in the south.  He reaffirmed his support for the preservation of Yemen's unity  despite the deepening military crisis.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, al-Jawi said that the  opposition urged the rest of the political parties to support  the initiative which aims at stopping the war and "rescuing the  country from the daily pools of blood."    He added that "the signatories to the agreement seek to  impose a broad political reconciliation between all the  conflicting sides, parties, and rivals at home and abroad."    He emphasized that the opposition is capable of achieving  that "despite the terrible artillery shelling, explosions, and  killing." He said: "We will endeavor to convince the General  People's Congress [GPC], which is led by President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], which is  led by House of Representative Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah  Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar; but if they reject this initiative, they  would clearly be making a mistake and their aim would be to  continue the war."    Al-Jawi reaffirmed that "there is no longer north and south,  but a united Yemen, and those who promote secessionist talk in  fact want to abort the plan for the rescue of the homeland."    Referring to the formation of the Higher Salvation Council,  he said that "branch councils will be formed anywhere in Yemen  where these parties have a presence, and the participating  parties will comply with the same agreement and with the  resolutions and directives issued by the Higher Council and  based on the Pledge and Accord Document."    He saw the grinding battles between the northerners and  southerners in Yemen as "the belated dowry for unity we had  expected, but it is by no means a divorce. It is a  reconstruction of unity."

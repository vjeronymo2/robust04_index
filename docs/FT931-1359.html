			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Greenspan cautions on tax increases THE US Federal Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, yesterday stepped into the political debate about deficit reduction by urging greater reliance on spending cuts than on tax increases. The federal budget deficit was a 'malignant force' that was threatening the economy's stability, Mr Greenspan said. He warned Congress not to rely too heavily in the long run on tax increases which 'by their very nature restrain business activity'. He was testifying on Capitol Hill following the release of official figures showing an increase in new orders for durable goods of 2.2 per cent last month and 14.5 per cent in the year to February - another sign recovery is on track. Mr Greenspan has previously argued that the Fed should stay aloof from political wrangles about the relative merits of tax increases and spending cuts - decisions which are the responsibility of Congress and the White House. Without challenging specific elements of the administration's economic plan, Mr Greenspan yesterday appeared to lend support to Republican critics arguing for greater spending restraint. He said senators should recognise that 'trying to wholly, or substantially, address a structural budget deficit by increasing revenues is fraught with exceptional difficulties, and is more likely to fail than to succeed'. From 1997, budget outlays were set to rise appreciably faster than the tax base. 'If such trends aren't altered, stabilising the deficit-GDP ratio solely from the receipts side, not to mention reducing it, will necessarily require ever-increasing tax rates.' This would inevitably damp long-term growth prospects. Addressing possible reforms of the budgetary process, Mr Greenspan rejected a balanced budget amendment to the constitution because it would probably prove impossible to enforce. Instead, he favoured a constitutional amendment stipulating that 'all revenue and spending initiatives require super-majorities - for example, 60 per cent - to pass both houses of the Congress'. If combined with 'sunset legislation' imposing explicit termination dates for spending programmes, this might help 'neutralise the obvious propensity of our political system toward structural deficits'. The increase in durable goods orders was larger than expected on Wall Street but mainly reflected a 10.9 per cent surge in orders for transport goods which tend to be volatile on a monthly basis. Excluding transport, orders fell slightly. Orders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as the best guide to underlying civilian investment trends - rose just over 2 per cent last month and by 15 per cent in the past year.</p>

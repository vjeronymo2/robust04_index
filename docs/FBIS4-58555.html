			<p>BFN     [Text] Pakistan has said that India is vitiating the  mutual atmosphere by harping upon the baseless and malicious  allegations of Pakistan's involvement in Kashmir and some other  parts of India. A Foreign Office spokesman commenting on the  recent propaganda campaign against Pakistan launched by Indian  Government said that Indian Government is trying to divert  attention from its own failures and brutalities in held Kashmir.  The Muslim ambassadors based in New Delhi after visiting the  occupied Kashmir have observed that gross violation of human  rights are taking place in the valley and the Kashmiris hate  India. One of the members of the delegation -- the Iranian  ambassador, Mr. ('Ali Raza Shaykh Ata) -- in a statement has  said that the program presented to the delegation in New Delhi  was never implemented. He said the members of the delegation  were not allowed to visit Hazratbal shrine, Sopor and Bijbiara.  He said the meeting with the leaders of Hurriet Conference was  not arranged and we were not allowed even to meet and talk with  the common people in the valley.</p>

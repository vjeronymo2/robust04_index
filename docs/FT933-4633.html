			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Arts: Happy night at the club - Jazz CEDAR Walton's seasonal quartet is the kind of band jazz clubs are made for. The sound of a rusty toned tenor relaxed against easy swinging piano and ice bucket accompaniment while the heads around dip to the pulse of a drummer happy in his work is enough to make you want to give up the concert hall for good. So comfortable is the pianist at Ronnie Scott's club that the first set featured 'Ronnie's Decision', a bobby ode to the wisecracking Frith Street proprietor. Yet though he is an inveterate tourer, whose quartets have usually featured a top shelf saxophonist (young Ralph Moore in this case), Walton is fixed in most people's minds as an accompanist whose prints are to be fond on many of the great bebop sessions, notably from Blue Note. He spent the golden years of hard-bop freelancing as well as working for a spell with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and has led his own bands since the early 1970s. Ever a stimulating and bright accompanist he has also contributed to the book of standards with original numbers such as 'Mosaic' and 'Bolivia'. For this week at Ronnie's, Walton is reunited with the conversational time keeping of drummer Billy Higgins and bass player David Williams, on/off partners since the mid-1960s: the addition of talented young bop stylist Moore on tenor keeps the Walton quartet tradition alive As a leader, Walton mixes the understated persistence which kept him in demand as accompanist with a sparkling but spare solo technique to give Moore space to work freely and sometimes precisely in the mix of standards and originals. Walton addresses the keyboard as if sitting down to a particularly intricate jigsaw puzzle, picking chords experimentally before embarking on a long blue line against the grain of the tenor's muted wailing. Higgins, emitting a self-absorbed and gravelly gurgle from the throat, roams across the cymbals, the bass drum rolling low and hard. Modest and economical in delivery. 'Bluest Blues' and 'My Ideal' had Walton sitting out entirely between solos for Williams' fret tramelling excursions on the string bass. Smokey rather than smoking, this superior late night jazz grows more intoxicating as the night wears into the wee hours. As the new CD title suggests, it is Simple Pleasure and well worth enduring Ronnie's elderly jokes for. Look out next week for more in a similar vein from tenorist's James Moody's quartet at the same place.</p>

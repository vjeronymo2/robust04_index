			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) has officially informed North Korea that  its inspectors will be present when nuclear fuel rods are  changed at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, as proposed by  Pyongyang.    One senior South Korean Government official said, "the IAEA  has made a decision to accept the North Korean proposal and  conveyed its intention to send its inspectors to North Korea so  that they can be present for the changing of nuclear fuel rods  at the 5-megawatt reactor."    As a result, IAEA inspectors could arrive in North Korea  sometime next week as the nuclear fuel rods will likely be  replaced in early or mid-May.    The UN Security Council, in a statement by its president,  urged North Korea to accept additional IAEA inspections before  the middle of next month.    "The IAEA has told North Korea to ensure safety measures  needed by IAEA experts during the nuclear fuel rod changing,"  the official said, indicating that the agency and Pyongyang are  still negotiating follow-up measures to the rod replacement and  problems related to further checks.    In particular, the IAEA is said to be stressing the need for  additional inspections of the 5-megawatt reactor and a  radiochemical laboratory, which Pyongyang refused to allow last  time, he said.</p>

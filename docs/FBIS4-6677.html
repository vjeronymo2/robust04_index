			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 19 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The  Council for National Security of Mongolia has discussed the  current political situation established due to the hunger strike  at the D. Suhbaatar and Erh Choloonii Squares and their possible  aftermath and taken a decision in this connection which provides  for that it would be expedient to keep the Great State Hural  informed about the political situation settled in the country  with hearing during its discussion at the parliament's session  of the demands put forth by those participating in the hunger  strikes.    Then it goes on to say that the demands by the participants  of the hunger strike at the Suhbaatar Square are not to be  accepted as being groundless. Taking into account that the  hunger strike and the following political crisis might be of  adverse consequences for the national interests the council  considers it is necessary to call upon the hunger strikers to  stop their actions.    Then the council also recommended to submit for  consideration  to the Great State Hural for approval the draft law on  procedures of holding demonstrations and meetings.    In this connection it is thought to be necessary to work out  in immediate future proper law on the press and until its coming  into force it recommended to the government to carry on the  radio and television "Tribune of Political Parties" programme as  well as to settle urgently all the topical issues of concern to  be regulated in terms of the press.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The board of trustees of each Fund, including a majority of the independent trustees, will review the services to be provided and fees to be charged to a class pursuant to a proposed Class Addendum, and will make a determination (i) that the Class Addendum is in the best interests of the class of the Fund subject to the Class Addendum and the shareholders of the class; (ii) that the fees charged to the class by the administrator in relation to the services to be provided to the class under the Class Addendum are fair and reasonable; and (iii) that the services to be provided for the class and the Class Administration Fee to be charged for such services are reasonably designed so that such services that benefit only a class, as opposed to the Fund generally, would augment (and not be duplicative of) services rendered to the Fund pursuant to the Administration Agreement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants represent that, to enable the board to make such determinations, the board would be provided with information regarding all of the expenses borne by the Administrator in providing or procuring services for each class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. On an ongoing basis, a Fund's trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Each Fund's investment adviser, sub-investment adviser (if any), administrator (if separate), and distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict arises, the adviser and the distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Administrative Services Arrangements will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> 12b&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The trustees of each Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning expenditures of a Fund or class thereof pursuant to 12b&hyph;1 plans and Administrative Services Arrangements complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that payments made by a class under its 12b&hyph;1 plan or administrative fees, and any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations would be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Fund that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by applicants (which applicants agree to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon written request by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in Statement of Accounting Standards No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 9 above and will be concurred with by the Expert or an appropriate substitute Expert on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 9 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

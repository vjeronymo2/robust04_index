			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A.I. Maglevanyy, Center of Scientific </F> Organization of Labor in Nonferrous Metallurgy; UDC 334:669.2]    [Text] Russia's metallurgical complex consisting of  hundreds of independent enterprises and ferrous and nonferrous  metallurgy organizations represents 24 large subbranches of the  industry each of which has clearly defined specific features of  production, its own practices, equipment, units and machines,  and specially trained personnel. In essence, each subbranch is  an independent base branch of the industry with a high value of  fixed capital.    Mining operations have a discrete and cyclic character and  depend on the systematically changing natural conditions (the  tempo and scale of geological exploration efforts, the  availability of mineral deposits and their quality, the deposit  occurrence conditions and location, etc.).    Most ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy enterprises are  characterized by a continuity of production processes and the  availability of numerous installations with a high unit capacity  closely interrelated in a single production process.  Furthermore, individual subindustries and enterprises are linked  to each other by constant cooperative shipments.    The high capital-to-output ratio of mining and metallurgical  production and a continuous increase (in recent years) in the  fast metal production tempo without sufficient capital  investments for replacing the fixed capital led to a sharp drop  in operating ore extraction production capacities and wear and  obsolescence of the capital stock.    The production processes used in production systems  operating  in metallurgy can explain the rather complicated and tense  environmental situation which developed in various vast Russian  regions. Suffice it to say that atmospheric discharges of  harmful substances by metallurgical complex enterprises reach  27% of all Russian enterprise discharges while  contaminated  water effluents exceed 15%.    The need to address a broad range of global issues related  to  decreasing harmful substance discharges over large territories  and air and water space and improving the working conditions and  daily life of metallurgical enterprise workers led to  considerable increases in the cost of production and a drop in  the effectiveness and profitability of individual productions,  enterprises, and subindustries since improvements in the air and  water quality involve considerable expenditures.    Thus, operating metallurgical complex enterprises are  characterized by the high cost of fixed capital and its  considerable wear and obsolescence (more than 50%), vast  outlays for solving environmental and social problems, and the  existence of marginally profitable or unprofitable  infrastructure both at enterprises and individual subindustries.    The economic reforms which have been carried out in recent  years and involve changes in managing the enterprises and the  industry as a whole, improving cost accounting, self-financing,  raw material and metal price deregulation, profit taxation, and  limitations in the wage fund did not sufficiently take into  account (or to be more precise, did not take into account at  all) these very important characteristics of mining, dressing,  mining-metallurgical, and processing enterprises in Russia's  basic industry of the national economy--metallurgy.    As a result, instead of stabilization and an increase in the  production effectiveness, we are witnessing its sharp decrease,  while the mining extractive and metallurgical enterprises which  produce metals and items crucial for other enterprises and  industries have become marginally profitable or unprofitable.  The situation in the metallurgical complex is continuing to  deteriorate, pig iron and steel production and smelting are  dropping, rolled stock and steel pipe production is declining,  and nonferrous metallurgy enterprises are in a critical state  due to a deterioration of their supplies of raw material  resources and intensive retirement of ore capacities from  operation.    An analysis of the status quo in metallurgy demonstrates  that  by late 1992, the drop in the production of individual types of  metals will reach 50% compared to the preceding year  which, in  turn, will lead to an even greater reduction in the production  volume in mechanical engineering and the output of industrial  goods for consumer use.    The principal reasons of the declining production in  metallurgy are shortfalls in the shipments of coking coal, a  considerable scarcity of scrap metal due to the absence of  market mechanisms for its collection and an increasing volume of  its imports, a sharp decrease in mining and metallurgical  equipment shipments, a noticeable and ever-increasing gap  between the economic and business links under intergovernmental,  interbranch, and industry-wide cooperation, and the lack of  economic and social incentives for stabilizing and increasing  the production volume and stable financial conditions of the  enterprises.    The measures taken in 1992 to deepen the economic reforms  which involve divestment and privatization of enterprises  pursuant to the state privatization program and Russian  Federation Presidential Decree No. 721 of 1 Jul 92 which cite as  an example the critical situation which has developed in the  metallurgical complex lead to a rather definite conclusion: the  economic reforms already underway call for a radical correction  in order to take into account the characteristic features of the  basic branches of industry without which future realization of  the measures to expand and deepen the privatization processes  becomes questionable and reinforces the continuing slide and  decrease in the production effectiveness.    The state privatization program of state and municipal  enterprises in 1992 is largely aimed at privatizing small- and  medium-size enterprises in the retail trade, consumer services,  and transportation spheres whose balance sheets show a  relatively low cost of property and does not take into account  the characteristic features of large enterprises which include  most of metallurgical complex enterprises.    Furthermore, the cost of property has risen substantially by  the end of 1992 due to a multiple increase in the cost of  working capital which, in a number of cases, exceeded the cost  of fixed capital by tens and hundreds of times.    This jump-like increase in the cost of enterprise property  limited the ability of the employees to buy out this property  and required a more detailed analysis and economic feasibility  of the issues related to assessing the cost of property,  classifying the enterprise infrastructure objects according to  various forms of property, and taking into account the interests  of kindred industries which are a part of a consolidated  production process with the privatized enterprise in buying out  a proportion of shares of the joint stock company formed on the  basis of this enterprise.    With respect to the foregoing, the deadlines set up by the  presidential decree for transforming state enterprises into  publicly traded joint stock companies (by 1 Nov 92) turned out  to be unrealistic and led to hasty, economically unjustified,  and at times inefficient decisions.    Thus, out of the total number of metallurgical complex  enterprises and organizations already transformed into joint  stock companies in 1992, no more than 25% of such  entities met  the deadline (1 Oct 92) in holding employee meetings  (conferences) and submitting the necessary privatization  documents to the Russian Federation government, Russian  Federation State Committee on Property, and committees for  controlling the property of local administrations.    Among the large metallurgical complex enterprises which  successfully, and in a timely fashion, completed the preparation  and submission of the necessary documents (privatization plans,  property assessment documents, and joint stock company articles  of incorporation) to appropriate state property control bodies  for converting them into publicly traded joint stock companies,  one should especially note the Uralruda Production Mining  Association, the Mikaylovsk Mining Ore Dressing Complex, the  Cherepovets Integrated Iron and Steel Works, the Berezniki  Titanium-Magnesium Works, the Achinsk Alumina Combine, the  Khrustalnyy Mining Ore Dressing Works, the Pervouralsk Tube  Making, Chelyabinsk Tube Rolling, and Uralsk and Irkutsk  Aluminum Plants, the Krasnyy Vyborzhets Leningrad Production  Association for Nonferrous Metal Treatment, and others.    A number of metallurgical enterprises has been privatized  and  registered in appropriate bodies and are carrying out productive  and economic activity in the framework of a publicly traded  joint stock company (the Tulachermet Scientific Production  Association, the Verkh-Isetskiy Metallurgical Plant, the  Kandalaksha Aluminum Smeltery, the Domodedovo Refractory Plant,  and the Solnechnogorsk Metallurgical Screen Plant).    We should note that the preliminary technical and economic  analyses and subsequent feasibility studies and timely and  proper preparation of founding documents for privatization at  most of these enterprises were carried out with the help of the  Central Scientific Research Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy,  Central Scientific Research Institute of Nonferrous Metallurgy  Economics and Information, Center for Scientific Organization of  Labor in Nonferrous Metallurgy, and other scientific research  organizations.    Yet for a number of reasons, particularly due to the absence  of the necessary regulatory documents, e.g., statutes of  enterprise employee stock funds (FARP), the procedure for  transferring blocks of shares to trusts, the rate of land taxes,  mineral use taxes, etc., privatization documents submitted on  time for consideration and approval by the majority of  enterprises are being considered past the deadlines established  by the presidential decree.    The unsolved problems in the banking and credit system and  the delinquency in payments for supplier products have largely  prevented timely preparation of documents for transforming  enterprises into joint stock companies.    The abnormal situation which has developed due to nonpayment  at mining and metallurgical enterprises and the forthcoming  surge in the injection of money due to the energy resource price  liberalization will call for urgently addressing the issues of  replenishing the working capital, indexing the cost of property,  eliminating the cash deficit at the enterprises, expanding the  checking and noncash transactions, accelerating the interbank  clearing, and increasing the responsibility of the banks which,  in contrast to enterprises, are successfully functioning and  flourishing in their financial and economic activity.    A classification of metallurgical complex enterprises  according to the possibility of their privatization in 1992  pursuant to the state privatization program demonstrates that  most of these enterprises (about 67%) must be privatized  in  coordination with local property management committees. The  remaining enterprises (except for those which have already been  transformed into joint stock companies) must be privatized in  coordination with the Russian Federation State Committee on  Property (20%) and Russian Federation government  (12%).    The experience of local property management bodies  considering the privatization documents submitted by enterprises  attests that the privatization committees set up within these  bodies are physically incapable of properly and in a timely  fashion considering and coordinating the large volume of  articles of incorporation and take into account the industrial,  production-technical, and socioeconomic characteristics of the  enterprise activity.    The fact that authoritative bodies represented by the  Metallurgical Industry Department (today--Russian Federation  Committee on Metallurgy), namely such structures as concerns,  companies, associations, joint stock companies, and scientific  research institutes have been virtually prevented from  developing the organizational-technical and economic measures to  transform state enterprises into joint stock companies, is a  serious drawback in managing the privatization efforts.    As a result, the privatization plans being developed by the  enterprises themselves do not include the most important  measures aimed at increasing the operating efficiency of the  enterprises and developing incentives for a production volume  stabilization and increase and for a stable financial position,  i.e., enterprise transformation into joint stock companies and  privatization become an end in itself.    An analysis of enterprise privatization efforts in the  industry shows that the enterprises which possess sufficient  resources to set up a privatization fund and which have formed  this fund in a timely fashion and introduced personal  privatization accounts for employees are the ones that prepared  and submitted privatization documents on time and selected  benefits version, II which is the most profitable and acceptable  to the employees.    From the total number of enterprises prepared for  transformation into joint stock companies, almost three-quarters  selected benefits version II which ensures redemption of  51% of  the entire block of shares and makes it possible to guarantee  the controlling block of shares for the enterprise. Highly  profitable aluminum production enterprises, tube mills, and  nonferrous metal processing plants are dominant in this group of  enterprises.    At privatized enterprises with marginal profitability and  limited resources to set up sufficient privatization funds  ensuring redemption of the controlling block of shares,  22% of  employee groups selected version I benefits. This version was  selected by employees of the Mikhaylovsk and Lovozerskiy Mining  Ore Dressing Combines, the Northern Onega Mine, the Ufaleynikel  Production Association, Berezniki Titanium-Magnesium Works,  Verkh-Isetskiy Metallurgical Plant, and others.    Only the employees at individual small enterprises (the  Novosibirsk Rare Metals Plant and the Krasnoyarsk Vtortsvetmet  Secondary Nonferrous Metals State Enterprise) selected benefits  version III which provides for giving a small group of  enterprise employees (under certain contractual conditions) the  right and possibilities to carry out the privatization plan.    Several employee groups which leased the property of small  state enterprises expressed the desire to convert to a limited  liability partnership and buy it out.    For most of the remaining metallurgical complex enterprises,  the conditions of their transformation into joint stock  companies provided by the state privatization program do not  enable the employees to buy out a large proportion of state  property shares since, on the one hand, the enterprises do not  possess a sufficient privatization fund formed primarily due to  a surplus of economic incentive funds and after-tax profits,  while on the other--employees at the enterprises selecting  benefits version I are limited to 20 minimum monthly wages in  the case of a gratuitous transfer of a part of preferred shares  and when selling regular shares at a discount--to 6 minimum  monthly wages per employee.    The option of purchasing 51% of shares is virtually  unrealistic for large metallurgical enterprises with the high  cost of capital stock since the selling price of such shares in  accordance with the statutes of closed subscription of shares  under state and municipal enterprise privatization approved by  the Russian Federation State Committee on Property increases by  a factor of 1.7.    The fact that the privatization program does not call for  the  possibility of privatized enterprise share redemption at par  value by juridical persons whose share of state property exceeds  25% decreases the activity and efficacy of the program and  makes it impossible to involve the suppliers and consumers  closely related by cooperative deliveries in redeeming the  shares of the entities they are interested in.    The experience of enterprise privatization plan development  with respect to searching for the resources to redeem shares  demonstrates that most enterprises have forwarded to the  privatization fund resources from their profits at the expense  of other important profit utilization applications. As a result,  financing of social programs and investments for the development  of production and new equipment has been sharply reduced or  terminated at these enterprises altogether.    We should note that to a certain extent, the Russian  Federation Presidential Decree ``On Developing the System of  Privatization Vouchers in the Russian Federation'' published in  October 1992 solves this problem; it stipulates that in selling  the privatized enterprise stock, the total number of shares to  be sold for privatization vouchers to the joint stock companies  developed in the course of privatization by converting state  enterprises which are a property of the Russian Federation is  equal to 80% and for enterprises which are a property of  the  constituent republics within the Russian Federation--35%  of the  total number of ordinary and type B preferred shares. Moreover,  pursuant to the resolution of these republics' supreme councils,  the total number of shares to be sold for privatization vouchers  may be increased to 80%. This measures makes it possible  considerably to expand the privatization scale if the  enterprises do not have sufficient resources to set up  privatization funds, reduce the use of profits for these  purposes, and direct profits to social needs and production  development.    A number of unsolved problems which lower the employee  incentive to accelerate privatization has been revealed in the  course of assessing the capital stock cost at mining, ore  dressing, and mining and metallurgical enterprises in order to  determine their authorized capital.    An important characteristic of property formation in this  group of enterprises is the considerable proportion of the  exploratory, capital, and preparatory operations in mining in  the cost of capital stock. This is a peculiar type of property,  and it does not appear possible either to sell it or use it for  other purposes in the subsequent period since this property is  subject to liquidation and write-off after a certain time (as  the deposit is being depleted).    Consequently, it appears necessary to subtract the cost of  this peculiar property in determining the authorized capital in  order to accelerate the development of joint stock companies on  the basis of marginally profitable mining extracting enterprises  and providing an even playing field for them among other  enterprises.    It is also necessary to subtract from the authorized capital  the cost of environmental protection installations which is  reflected in the cost of fixed capital since maintenance of  these facilities involves considerable outlays yet does not  guarantee profits while not only the enterprise employees, but  also the entire population of the region derive benefit from  their operation.    The aforementioned facilities must be transferred to the  balance sheet of joint stock companies without compensation  under an appropriate agreement.    The issues related to increasing the competitiveness of  metal  products in the external market, expanding the enterprises'  export possibilities, developing production of scarce import  substituting products, developing an ore and raw material base  for stabilizing the enterprise operation, and creating new  technologies and equipment which have been completely ignored in  the enterprise privatization plans are especially acute at the  privatized enterprises of the metallurgical complex.    At the stage of enterprise conversion to joint stock  companies, it is necessary to develop special programs (business  plans) to implement these high-priority trends and set up the  sources and volumes of their financing, including the method of  setting up subsidiary joint stock companies.    Holding companies as well as trust companies which possess  blocks of stock (a share) which belong to the government and  carry out these necessary investments in order to implement  these programs due to the dividends derived from these shares  could become the institutional management framework for the  corresponding programs in various subindustries. Business plans  must become part and parcel of enterprise privatization plans  and should be considered and approved by the Russian Federation  Government and State Committee on Property and by appropriate  property management committees.    Conversion of large metallurgical complex enterprises into  joint stock companies requires time, serious preparation, and an  accounting of the characteristic features of the industries, the  character of operations, and the outlook for the technical and  economic development of each enterprise.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Latin America sector in the doldrums - International Among the financial markets which have been battered this year, the Latin American bond markets have suffered more than most. As a result, the yield spreads available on Brady bonds (created from restructured country debt) and eurobonds relative to the US Treasuries market now appear generous. 'Investors have attractive opportunities for capital appreciation and total return in this asset class,' according to Mr Thomas Trebat, head of emerging market research at Chemical Bank in New York. 'From a fundamental standpoint, the market is oversold and undervalues the long-term commitment in Latin America to political and economic reform.' In fact, the spreads available on much of the region's debt have ballooned back to levels last seen several years ago. For example, in Venezuela, the worst performer, par bonds are now trading at 1,475 basis points over the comparable US Treasury yield, compared with 530 basis points at the start of the year. In recent weeks, the spread on its debt conversion bonds due 2007 has widened to close to 2,000 basis points, from 1,269 points at the beginning of June, as a result of the country's worsening economic and financial situation. Venezuelan debt is 'cheaper now than before the Brady restructuring in 1990, when it was in default and paying no interest,' said Mr Aidan Freyne, head of emerging market sales at Salomon Brothers Europe. 'Basically, the market is looking at the possibility of default, though I think that's unlikely,' he said. Even Mexican par bonds, are now trading at a spread of 520 basis points  - wider than the level of 430 basis points at the end of 1992 - compared with 230 basis points at the start of the year. Argentine par bonds are actually trading at a tighter spread now than at the end of 1992, at 730 basis points, compared with 950 basis points. However, the comparison with the start of the year, when the spread stood at 350 basis points, is still stark. The question for investors is whether current spread levels leave room for the sort of tightening seen in the market in 1992 and 1993. The general view is that such a bull run for Latin American bonds cannot be repeated - and not simply because investors have been badly burnt. More importantly, the bearish environment for US interest rates is likely to cap the potential performance of Latin American bonds. 'The market is very much overshadowed by the US Treasuries market,' said Mr Peter West economic adviser at West Merchant Bank. 'One would have thought that individual countries' stories will provide some room for tightening - for example, Mexico - but at the moment we are in the doldrums. Just because something's cheap doesn't mean it can't go down.' The other factor constraining the performance of the market is the fact that the universe of investors in Latin American bonds has shrunk. Hedge funds and mainstream fund managers who flocked to the market during the bull run have pulled out and are unlikely to return in a hurry. Political uncertainty has also made investors reluctant to commit funds to these markets. But, according to Mr Freyne, 'things should clear up in about three months, when the Mexican elections are out of the way, when we'll have a clearer idea about who will win the Brazilian elections, and when the situation in Venezuela may have improved.' For the moment, however, investor flows are very thin. This has taken its toll on the new-issues sector, where the supply of eurobonds has all but ground to a halt. The volume of external bond offerings in the second quarter of the year fell below Dollars 1bn per month, according to West Merchant Bank. Volume in the first half of the year totalled Dollars 8.4bn, mostly concentrated in the first few months before the reversal in the US interest rate cycle. By contrast, for the second half of 1993, volume was close to Dollars 16bn. The effect of the decline in capital flows to Latin America could be higher domestic interest rates in some countries, as governments and companies are forced to step up borrowing in their own markets, which could, in turn, cause a slowdown in growth. On the other hand, there are some balancing factors. Rising commodity prices and the strength of the US economy are both positive for these countries. In the coming months, occasional country-specific news and pauses in the upward trend in US interest rates may allow short-lived rallies in Latin American fixed-rate bonds to take place. However, in an environment of rising interest rates, investors seeking a low-volatility exposure to Latin American markets may be better off holding floating-rate notes, which have recently outperformed fixed-rate bonds.</p>

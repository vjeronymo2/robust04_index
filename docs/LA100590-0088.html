			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SERIOUS FUN WITH ISO AND THE BOBS;  </P> <P> DANCE: FOUR MAVERICKS WHO MOVE TO THEIR OWN BEAT JOIN FORCES WITH A NEW-WAVE A  CAPPELLA GROUP TO CREATE A LIGHT-HEARTED MIX OF MUSIC AND MODERN DANCE.  </P> <P> During the 1970s and '80s, Pilobolus and its offshoot Momix -- the zanies of  modern movement -- turned dance on its ear with no-holds-barred moves and  trompe l'oeil theatrical effects.  </P> <P> Now, fugitives from both groups are riding roughshod on new terrain. Daniel  Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, Ashley Roland and Morleigh Steinberg formed ISO ("I'm  So Optimistic") and added another wrinkle to the formula.  </P> <P> The four dance mavericks teamed up with a new-wave a cappella group -- the Bobs  -- that takes doo-wop to the brink and became "ISO and the Bobs." This  post-modern fusion will dispense free-form acro-dance (dance rooted in  acrobatics) and musical mayhem tonight at Mandeville Auditorium.  </P> <P> The concert will kick off a diverse season of dance, which includes an April  visit from the acclaimed Lewitzky Dance Company, sponsored by UC San Diego's  University Events Program.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview from Denver, Ezralow talked about the move from Momix,  and the group's special bond with the singing Bobs.  </P> <P> "All four of us were Momix," Ezralow said. "We're different as ISO, but I have  to think the people aren't different. We still have the same hormones and  chromosonic structure. The faces didn't change. We just tried to change our  style.  </P> <P> "At Momix, we created a show with Moses (Pendleton)," Ezralow said. "When it  got stagnant, we realized we had grown as individuals. We needed responsibility  for ourselves, and Moses had grown to want to do mostly his work."  </P> <P> ISO has not abandoned the cockeyed sense of humor or the double-jointed  maneuvers and pretzel-shaped configurations that characterize Momix. But the  new group veers away from prop manipulation, body-disguising costumes, and  blatant sight gags.  </P> <P> "Serious fun is the best way to describe our dancing," Ezralow said. "Momix  kind of goes for the gag. We do less of that. When we find ourselves using  gimmicks, we move away from it."  </P> <P> While the quartet was still part of Momix, they discovered the Bobs and  realized they were kindred spirits. That association led to "The Serious Fun  Festival," a collaborative show created in 1987.  </P> <P> "ISO is four people, and the Bobs are also four people," he said. "It's eight  people collaborating. Sometimes the Bobs sing. Sometimes we dance. Sometimes we  work together. They've dissected dances of ours, and we've worked with their  sounds. (The program) is tailor made, and very much a collaborative effort. In  essence, our bodies sing, and their voices dance.  </P> <P> "It's something like a cabaret show," he continued, groping for the right words  to explain ISO and the Bobs. "It's not meant to be serious modern dance, but  it's good dancing. And their songs are very clever, very humorous."  </P> <P> What makes ISO and the Bobs different from other music and dance combos?  </P> <P> "At a dance show, you can't really start screaming," Ezralow said. "This one  takes dance beyond the fourth wall. It brings dance into the fourth row, and  people get involved. That's the element the Bobs bring. We're still set up for  a proscenium stage, but we'd like to start getting away from it."  </P> <P> The cabaret connotation has had a negative impact, however, particularly on the  critics. Ezralow recognizes that.  </P> <P> "The problem is they don't know what the show is," he said. "They think that's  not what dance is about. Normally, the crowd jumps to its feet. The music and  dance are very accessible, but that's not necessarily bad. You can be very  commercial and very good."  </P> <P> The ISO and the Bobs show has remained pretty much intact since its inception,  but San Diego may get a little surprise when the production makes its local  debut.  </P> <P> "I won't guarantee it," Ezralow said, "but we're adding a new solo, and we hope  to show it in San Diego. Although it's a set show, we keep changing it around.  It's fluid, and it can be flexible. There are about 15 pieces."  </P> <P> The ISO and the Bobs show is only part of the ISO persona. In fact, the group  will perform in Italy without their musical partners after the San Diego  concert.  </P> <P> "ISO is a collaborative," Ezralow said. "We have our own shows, and sometimes  we work with the Bobs. As a group, we're now leaning more toward working  separately. We don't all participate in everything.  </P> <P> "When everybody is a boss, no one's a boss. We're just four creative minds  doing complementary choreography," he said. "We found we don't all have to cook  the same stew. We're all growing as individuals and creative entities. Any  artist shares a voice with the world, until that voice becomes stagnant or  repressed. In ISO, we won't have to disband. There's room for us to grow."  </P></p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / ECGD sees first surplus for 7 years THE Export Credits Guarantee Department yesterday revealed its first trading surplus for seven years as a steep fall in provisions transformed a Pounds 754m deficit in 1990-91 into a surplus of Pounds 340m in the 12 months to March 31 last year. Mr Brian Willett, ECGD chief executive, said he expected that claims were likely to fall and that the organisation was likely 'in three to four years' to become a net contributor to the exchequer for the first time since the onset of its debt crisis almost a decade ago. That would contrast with most national export credit agencies which receive large, often hidden, government subsidies. It would be seen by the Treasury as a vindication of the sweeping reform of risk assessment methods almost two years ago even though exporters complain that the reforms have led to UK export credit premium rates being among the highest in the world. The ECGD also revealed yesterday that it is close to concluding deals selling Tanzanian and Nigerian debts amounting to Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.7m), part of a new strategy to use debt sales to reduce liabilities. The debts of up to 20 countries are involved. Bids are being invited for Pounds 48m of Egyptian debt. The Pounds 1.1bn swing in provisions which swept the ECGD into surplus resulted in the cumulative deficit being trimmed from Pounds 4.62bn to Pounds 4.28bn. Premium income remained static at Pounds 159m while payment of claims fell slightly from Pounds 968m to Pounds 954m. These claims, coupled with notional interest on liabilities amounting to Pounds 371m, meant that the ECGD's deficit with the Consolidated Fund rose from Pounds 3.11bn to 3.84bn. The trading accounts were greatly complicated by two factors. First, they included eight months of operations of the ECGD's former short-term credit arm, which was sold to NCM, the Dutch export credit insurer, at the end of 1991. Second, they included an effort by the ECGD to separate liabilities pre-dating the introduction in May 1991 of the Portfolio Management System of assessing credit risk from liabilities taken on since the system came into force. That allows the ECGD to segregate the very high liabilities pre-dating April 1991 which led to special provisions of Pounds 3.8bn in 1990. 'The return to trading surplus does reflect us going through the hump,' Mr Willett said yesterday. Improvements leading to lower provisions were reported in Egypt, Poland, Jordan, Argentina and Brazil. The only significant reversal was in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

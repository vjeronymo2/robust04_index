			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BRONCOS WOULD TAKE SHANAHAN  </P> <P> If Mike Shanahan wants to become an assistant coach again, he is welcome to  return to the Denver Broncos' staff, head Coach Dan Reeves says.  </P> <P> Reeves said that although he has not talked with Shanahan, who was fired  Tuesday as head coach of the Raiders, he definitely was receptive to discussing  Shanahan's return to Denver. Shanahan was offensive coordinator with the  Broncos before going to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't rule out any possibility," Reeves said. "Mike is a great coach. I  don't know what his plans are, but I would love to have Mike Shanahan on our  staff."  </P> <P> Asked what capacity he would fill, Reeves said, "Anything but head coach."  </P> <P> Shanahan was believed to have two-plus years remaining on his contract with the  Raiders, a deal that pays him approximately $300,000 a year.  </P> <P> "I feel badly for Mike because I don't think he was given an opportunity,"  Reeves said.  </P></p>

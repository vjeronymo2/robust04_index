			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEEN-AGER HOLDS CLASS CAPTIVE AT ANAHEIM SCHOOL  </P> <P> A 15-year-old Loara High School student, armed with a shotgun and pistol,  walked into a drama class, shot one boy in the face and held other students  hostage for more than a half hour Thursday, Anaheim authorities said.  </P> <P> The armed ninth-grader, reportedly beset with family problems, ordered the  drama teacher out of the room and later allowed the injured student and  terrified female classmates to leave. The student held the rest of the class at  gunpoint while talking to police on a classroom phone and then surrendered.  </P> <P> "Who would have thought he was serious?" said the wounded student, 15-year-old  Anthony Lopez, interviewed at his hospital bed Thursday evening. "I mean, the  guy was calm. He didn't look crazy. . . .  </P> <P> "I asked him whether the gun was for real and then I said if it was real, why  didn't he just start shooting."  </P> <P> Lopez was in satisfactory condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange after being  shot in the left side of his face. His jaw is shattered, and the bullet is  lodged in his neck, said Lopez's mother, Pam Lopez. He is the son of an Anaheim  police officer.  </P> <P> Police said the incident began shortly before 9:30 a.m. when the youth,  identified by students as ninth-grader Cory Robb, entered the school's choir  room where the drama class was being held and ordered the teacher, Kenneth  Tuttle, to leave. The teacher tried to take the rest of the class with him, but  Robb insisted that Tuttle leave alone, students said.  </P> <P> About 10 minutes later, after firing one shot, Robb allowed most of the girls  in the class and the wounded boy to walk out, said Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth.  Police negotiators talked Robb into surrendering about 10:10 a.m.  </P> <P> By the time the police had talked Robb out of the room, word of the hostage  situation had spread. Students were lined up to call their parents on the two  pay phones outside the school office, and many of the girls were crying.  </P> <P> "My son called me from here and said, 'Get me out of here. There's a shooting  going on,' " said Jackie Blacketer, who waited for her son Brian along with  other parents who said they had heard word of the shooting on the radio or from  friends and neighbors.  </P> <P> Most of the school's 1,600 students remained in class for the rest of the day.  Two psychologists were sent to the school to talk to students from the drama  class, and three psychologists will be at the campus today, said Anaheim Union  High School District Assistant Supt. Lee Kellogg.  </P> <P> Police and school officials provided few details about the incident and what  might have led up to it. Family members refused to discuss the incident.  Students and parents, some shaken by the ordeal, talked about what they knew of  the young man and his problems.  </P> <P> They described the brown-haired freshman as a troubled but friendly youth who  fought bitterly with his stepfather and was upset about his family's impending  move to Northern California. Several students, some of whom said they have  known Robb for years, said Robb had also told them that his father, a Vietnam  veteran, committed suicide, although that account could not be confirmed by  family members.  </P> <P> Several students said Robb had hinted for the past few weeks that he was  planning some act involving weapons and possible violence. But they had not  taken him seriously, they said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drama Class  </P> <P> Nor did most of the students in the drama class at first take seriously the  threat posed by Robb, dressed in jeans and a green T-shirt beneath a red-plaid  flannel shirt, when he walked into the ampitheater-style classroom and ordered  teacher Tuttle to get out.  </P> <P> Tuttle tried to take some students with him, Pam Lopez said, but Robb would not  let him and ordered him to leave again.  </P> <P> The teacher could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Tuttle had been teaching the class -- in which Robb was not enrolled -- about  the various parts of a theater stage, students said.  </P> <P> "Everybody thought it was a joke," said ninth-grader Season Rodriguez, who was  in the room. "He came in and kicked back, said 'I'm not gonna hurt you, don't  worry.' I don't think Cory meant to go in there and shoot anyone."  </P> <P> After Tuttle left, Robb -- who police said was armed with a .12-gauge,  short-barreled shotgun and a semiautomatic handgun -- told the students that  they could change seats and sit by their friends if they wanted to, said  15-year-old Matt Grimsley.  </P> <P> "He just kind of screwed around," Grimsley said. "Then he said he wanted to get  back at his stepfather."  </P> <P> Anthony Lopez, said Season Rodriguez, mocked Robb, saying, " 'Oh, we've got a  suicidal killer on our hands.' " Other students said Lopez told Robb he didn't  believe the guns were real.  </P> <P> Robb fired one shot in the classroom of 36 students, hitting Lopez in the face,  students said.  </P> <P> "He grabbed his face and fell down by my feet," Grimsley said. "There was blood  everywhere. I went to help him, but he (Robb) said, 'Don't move.' "  </P> <P> Another student talked Robb into allowing the girls -- who were crying and  screaming after the shooting -- to leave, along with the wounded student,  Grimsley said. Lopez was able to walk out under his own power, he said.  </P> <P> With only about 10 boys remaining in the classroom, Robb used a phone at the  teacher's desk to try to reach his mother, said Jimmy Hurley, another student  in the class.  </P> <P> Lt. Hedgpeth said he did not know if Robb got through to his mother. Someone  must have contacted her, he said, because she called police before her son  surrendered. She came to the school but did not come onto the school grounds  because of the crowd of reporters that had gathered near the entrance, Hedgpeth  said.  </P> <P> Anaheim police trained in hostage negotiations contacted Robb on the phone and  talked him into surrendering at 10:10 a.m., Hedgpeth said.  </P> <P> Robb is being held at Orange County Juvenile Hall in Orange on charges of  attempted murder, aggravated assault, bringing a firearm on campus, false  imprisonment and hostage-taking, Hedgpeth said.  </P> <P> One student, 15-year-old Doney Philpott, said Robb told him Wednesday: "  'Tomorrow's my last day. I'm going to come over here and do something bad.' "  </P> <P> Philpott said that when he asked Robb what he meant, Robb said he planned to  come to school armed and have police call his stepfather to the school.  Philpott said Robb told him that when his stepfather arrived, he would shoot  him. "I didn't believe him," said Philpott, who attended Ball Junior High in  Anaheim with Robb. "He used to say things like this all the time."  </P> <P> Police said students they interviewed Thursday also told them of Robb's threats  and plans. But they said none had been reported to authorities.  </P> <P> Several students said Robb had told them he often fought with his stepfather.  </P> <P> Damien Christian, who called himself "a good friend" of Robb, as did other  students, said that Robb told him about his father's suicide.  </P> <P> "It was after he came back from Vietnam, he killed himself in front of Cory,"  Damien said.  </P> <P> A neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said Robb told his son a similar  story: that Robb's father had summoned his son to the attic one day and then  shot himself.  </P> <P> Robb's mother, Kathy Y. McAfee, declined to speak to a reporter at the family's  house, which recently had been sold. Neighbors said Robb's stepfather, Paul D.  McAfee, moved to Northern California for work reasons several months ago and  that his wife and stepson planned to follow soon.  </P> <P> "He had told my girls that he didn't want to move," said Renay Hill, who lives  across the street from Robb. Robb showed one of her daughters -- who was in the  drama class Thursday morning -- a gun Wednesday night, but did not say anything  about using it, Hill said.  </P> <P> Another parent, Linda Tucker, said Robb had been a classmate of her daughter's  since elementary school, when she was a room mother.  </P> <P> "I just can't believe this. I know he got into trouble, but there are worse  kids than him," she said. "He always called me 'Mrs. Tucker,' and not many kids  do that anymore.  </P> <P> "You hear about other people doing things like this, but not a kid you've seen  go to school since he was only this high," she said, putting her hand no higher  than her waist.  </P> <P> Robb's friend Damien Christian said that he sometimes played football or other  games with Robb but that Robb "doesn't really get into sports."  </P> <P> Christian said that Robb liked reading -- particularly Stephen King books and  other horror fiction -- and he liked guns.  </P> <P> Still, Christian wondered: "Why would he do something like this?"  </P> <P> Season Rodriguez, despite just having suffered through the ordeal, said she  felt sorry for Robb.  </P> <P> "I hope he gets help," she said. "I feel bad for him."  </P> <P> At UCI Medical Center, Anthony Lopez, too, looked disbelieving as he fingered  the bandages wrapped around his neck.  </P> <P> Anthony is the son of Lou Lopez, a resource school officer with the Anaheim  Police Department, who is a school board candidate in the Anaheim City School  District election Nov. 7.  </P> <P> "It was like a punch, the worst punch ever," Lopez said of the shot. "But I  still didn't think I was hurt. I thought he fired a paint gun at me. . . . "  </P> <P> Times staff writers Lily Eng, Jean Davidson and Davan Maharaj and Tom McQueeney  of Fullerton contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LOARA HIGH SCHOOL  </P> <P> Where: 1765 W.

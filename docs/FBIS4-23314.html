			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Negotiations between the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] and the government forces resumed at Amahoro Hotel, Remera  District in eastern Kigali yesterday. The negotiations were  aimed at jointly assessing ways of reaching a cease-fire  agreement so that relief operations can be carried out  peacefully. The delegations from both sides left without  reaching any agreement.    They discussed at length the conditions set by the RPF  forces, conditions which are a prerequisite for the actual  negotiations to start. [passage omitted].    The government forces' delegation promised the RPF forces'  delegation that they would address the demands of the RPF in  order to correct misdeeds. The two delegations agreed that the  UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] would meet both sides  in order to fix another date for the resumption of negotiations.    Meanwhile, the two delegations agreed that UNAMIR's  operation  of taking civilians from the fighting areas to the sides of  their choice would resume today. In this respect, the RPF  forces' delegation announced in the meeting that the RPF had  agreed that government forces could send envoys to Amahoro  stadium, in the RPF- controlled area, to talk to people who have  taken refuge there.    It is worth recalling that the people who took refuge at  Amahoro stadium and whom the government claims belong to its  side, have clearly stated that instead of going to die in areas  still controlled by government forces where nobody cares, they  have chosen to stay at Amahoro stadium. This means that they  are not afraid of reports that those who go to the government  side are shot by RPF forces, as the government forces'  negotiator, Colonel Gatsinzi, said on Radio Rwanda this morning,  to deceive the [word indistinct].</p>

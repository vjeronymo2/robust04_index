			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / EC clears Berlin deal with Sony THE European Commission has decided that the Berlin city authorities did not 'sweeten' unduly a 1991 property deal with Sony, to persuade the Japanese electronics manufacturer to move its European headquarters to a prime city site. The Commission yesterday closed its 15-month inquiry into the DM101m (Pounds 42.7m) deal, by deciding that the Japanese company would not have to pay extra for the site on Potsdamer Platz, which used to be bisected by the Berlin Wall. Brussels has been looking closely at property deals in Berlin, where prices have increased substantially since unification of the city. Companies which are found to have paid less than market value for state-owned properties can be asked to 'repay' what amounts to an illegal state subsidy. Last April, the Commission ordered Daimler-Benz to make an additional DM33.8m payment to the Berlin authorities, on top of the DM93m which it paid in July 1990 for another office site on the Potsdamer Platz. The Commission applied the same reasoning to the Sony sale. Following an independent valuation, Brussels estimated that the 30,900 sq m Sony site was worth between DM128m and DM149.5m. However, it agreed that figure should be adjusted downwards by about DM41.3m to take account of strict conditions imposed by the Berlin authorities. After adjustment, the Commission estimated that the potential state subsidy in the deal was too small to be significant. Daimler-Benz has never pursued its objections to the Commission's decision on its property deal, and is also believed to be happy with the ruling favouring Sony.</p>

He added: The government's dialogue with political  parties and youth of various tendencies as well as with any  group or individual, regardless of their inclination, is a good  thing. It is required for each side to listen to the views of  the others in the interest of the country, presuming that the  intentions are sincere.    Asked how the youth branded as "extremists" could be  represented in the national dialogue, the mufti said: The  important thing is to start the dialogue. As for the question  of how, this could be judged by the competent experts who will  send the invitation.    It is worth noting that the mufti took part in a seminar  held  at Cairo University on Wednesday. He stressed that all  religions oppose injustice, whether it is done by the ruler or  the ruled, noting that corruption cases are widespread in  society.</p>

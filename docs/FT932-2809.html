			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / MoD is criticised over ship refits THE MINISTRY of Defence's handling of naval vessel refitting was criticised by MPs yesterday as the service's privately managed dockyards awaited a crucial government decision on their future. The Commons public accounts committee complained of slow progress in changing procedures at the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards since management was transferred to private consortia in 1987. The cabinet will decide shortly which yard should service the new Trident submarines. The decision - not expected until next week at the earliest - will mean concentrating all work on refitting and refuelling nuclear-powered submarines on one site. Thousands of jobs are at stake in Devon, Cornwall, and Fife. The cross-party committee, chaired by Labour MP Mr Robert Sheldon, said reductions in the Navy's refitting programme and short-notice changes had made it difficult for the new managers to operate on a commercial basis. Faster progress should have been made in tightening specifications for work at the yards, the committee said. 'Poor specification of the work to be undertaken in refits has contributed to difficult contract negotiations, excessive extra work, delays and cost increases,' the committee's report found. It criticised 'deficiencies' in the system for procuring materials, most of which were still supplied to the yards by the Navy. 'This is a legacy of history, but it is not appropriate for a commercial regime,' the report said. The report also attacked Pounds 137m worth of 'abortive expenditure' on two submarines, which the ministry decided to decommission in 1990 while the submarines were both in refit. The cross-party campaign among MPs trying to ensure that Rosyth dockyard wins the Trident contract stepped up its efforts yesterday, Alison Smith writes. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, is to meet Mr John Major today and will give the prime minister a copy of the report setting out Rosyth's case. His Dunfermline East constituency includes Rosyth. Devonport is widely regarded at Westminster as the front-runner but several Scottish Conservatives have indicated that they would be prepared to vote against the government if Devonport wins.

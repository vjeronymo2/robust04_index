			<p>BFN     [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- In 1993 Daimler-Benz AG  (Stuttgart) increased the volume of its purchases in the new  laender by 200 million German marks [DM] compared with the year  before, thus reaching DM800 million. This exceeded the goal set  by the company for itself by DM100 million despite the  recession, Karl Engelhardt, chief coordinator for purchases in  the corporation, stated at the Hannover Fair on Friday [22  April]. The plan of buying goods and services for DM1 billion  from eastern Germany by 1995 will certainly be fulfilled.    The corporation has a considerable advantage regarding costs  by issuing orders in eastern Germany. Ancillary wage costs in  the west are twice as high as in the new laender. The increase  in purchases is a sign of the competitiveness of east German  suppliers. The corporation is buying most in Brandenburg,  followed by Saxony, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, and  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The northernmost land was able  to increase its volume by 60 percent last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev report: "In the State Duma, 11 January, </F> 1000: Calls for Cooperation Against the Backdrop of the First  Skirmishes"]    [Excerpts] The first sitting of the Russian State Duma  passed off under the banner of a wish to avoid confrontation  from the very beginning. This was the reason why the agenda  comprised questions agreed in advance among the factions.  Elections for the tellers' commission, the commission for  overseeing the electronic ballot, and the provisional  secretariat took place without any particular difficulties.  [passage omitted]    It was expected that some differences of opinion might arise  during discussion of the Central Electoral Commission's report,  delivered by Deputy Chairman A. Ivanchenko. Among other things,  he reported that a total of 444 deputies representing 32  nationalities had been elected to the State Duma (of which 430  were present for the first session), that 95 percent of them  have higher or incomplete higher education, and that one in 10  deputies is a professor, academic, and so on. However, it was  not this interesting information which proved the cause of  conflict but rather the Central Electoral Commission's blatant  attempt in delivering the report to preclude all questions  associated with the election of deputies. Even the possibility  of a proposal not to set up a credentials commission in the Duma  but to transfer its functions to the Central Electoral  Commission has not been ruled out. However, State Duma members  are determined pretty unanimously to include a discussion of the  Central Electoral Commission's Report in the agenda, so a  credentials commission will probably be set up anyway.    Nevertheless, despite all the efforts, clashes in the  opening  hours of the Duma's work could not be avoided. As expected, the  opening skirmishes took place in connection with the Statute on  Deputies' Factions.    During preliminary consultations, deputies were unable to  reach accord in respect of the minimum number of deputies  required in order to secure the right to set up a faction.  Communist representatives suggested that the ceiling be raised  to a minimum of 50. Communist Leader G. Zyuganov justified this  stance by saying that a multitude of small radical factions and  groups will otherwise take shape in the Duma and paralyze its  work as a result. Democratic Party of Russia Leader N. Travkin  spoke in support of this.    Their opponents' proposal to reduce the minimum to 14 was  put  forward by "Russia's Choice" and supported by Shakhray's party,  as well as supporters of "August" represented by I. Khakamada.  As for the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], its  leader, Zhirinovskiy, adopted an emphatically neutral stance,  declaring that any outcome would satisfy him.    There has already been occasion in the preceding edition to  write about the reasons behind the tension. The matter concerns  the plans of "Russia's Choice." If it is decided to form  factions comprising 14 deputies, "Russia's Choice" may split  into several amicable factions in order to strengthen its  influence in the Duma.    Among other things, a faction leader has the right of access  to the microphone out of turn, plus other privileges. Of  course, this situation does not benefit the Communists and the  Agrarians. The situation is further complicated by shortcomings  in the electronic balloting system, as well as many deputies'  dissatisfaction that it was an LDPR representative who chaired  the sitting. By the time the first recess began, passions were  noticeably stirred.    As a result, the nigh-on hour-long debate failed to  culminate  in accord despite the well coordinated actions of the Communists  and the Agrarians in defending a quota of 50 people. The 20-man  quota supported by the democratic factions also failed to  attract a majority of votes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, April 20 KYODO -- Mexico's Trade  Ministry said Wednesday [20 April] it has begun an investigation  into alleged dumping of sulfuric acid, used in fertilizer  production, by seven foreign companies, including five Japanese  concerns.    The five Japanese companies include Dowa Mining Co.,  Mitsubishi Materials Corp., and Japan Energy Corp. The names of  the two other Japanese concerns were not known immediately.    The ministry said the five Japanese firms are alleged to  have  shipped sulfuric acid for fertilizer use at prices below fair  value between January and June in 1993.    During the period, the value of sulfuric acid imported from  Japan fell by 13 percent, the ministry said.    The ministry did not disclose other details.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 644.32(d)(1) accurately reflects both the intent of the 1992 Amendments to the HEA and the Secretary's commitment to coordination. Waivers of the requirement for a full-time director are available under &sect;644.32(d)(3) if an applicant can show that efforts to coordinate among projects will be hindered by not allowing one person to direct more than one project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that in many cases the size and scope of an EOC project require the attention of a full-time director. The average EOC project receives more than a million dollars over the course of a project period and serves more than eight thousand participants. Given the size and scope of EOC projects, the Secretary believes that the appropriateness of allowing a part-time director must be evaluated with great care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested that the Secretary should change &sect;644.32(c)(3), relating to records of educational benefits. The commenters requested that the Secretary eliminate the phrase ``the specific educational benefits to the participants that resulted from the services'' because keeping a record of how each participant benefited from the services would be too burdensome. The commenters suggested that &sect;644.32(c)(3) require only that grantees keep a record of ``the specific educational benefits  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> received  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> by the participant.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the Secretary should not change the recordkeeping requirement in &sect;644.32(c)(3) because it formed the basis for collecting valuable statistics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees that the phrase ``that resulted from the services'' implies that a grantee must demonstrate and record a causal relationship between services and benefits. The Secretary believes that such a record is not necessary to indicate a benefit, particularly in instances where the services provided can be deemed to be benefits in and of themselves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The recordkeeping requirement at &sect;644.32(c)(3) is changed to read ``the specific educational benefits received by the participant.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;903 Filed 1&hyph;14&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4000&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

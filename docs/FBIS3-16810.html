The Estonian Government ruled to cut back from March 11 the  time that Ostankino broadcasts are available to viewers in  Estonia, after the Moscow television company failed to pay for  the transmission of its program on Estonia's national network.  The government ruling says the broadcasts will be cut off  completely from March 28 if Ostankino by that date has not  signed a new agreement with the Estonian Telecommunications  Company or has paid its debts for the last months.    The step would negatively affect the Russian-speakers'  loyalty to the Estonia Government, Estonia's Russian Assembly  says. The document also says that the assembly has already  called on the respective Russian institutions to resolve the  financial problems connected with the transmission of Ostankino  broadcasts.    The assembly suggests that the Ostankino program be  transmitted in Estonia via a cable network. The representative  body says a respective agreement together with a financing  project should be signed at the level of the two countries'  governments.    Ostankino owes to the Estonian company about 105,000 German  marks for the transmission of its broadcasts in 1993, plus some  80,000 German marks for January.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ARREOLA LOOKING FOR FAST FINISH;  </P> <P> CROSS-COUNTRY: NORTHRIDGE SENIOR EXPRESSES DISAPPOINTMENT WITH HER SEASON  HEADING INTO DIVISION I CHAMPIONSHIPS.  </P> <P> No Cal State Northridge athlete appeared as prepared for the move from the NCAA  Division II ranks to Division I this fall as distance runner Darcy Arreola.  </P> <P> Arreola, the 1989 Division II cross-country champion, had won three individual  Division II track titles, had earned nine Division II All-American certificates  in track and cross-country, and had placed third in the 1,500 meters in the  1989 Division I track championships since arriving at Northridge in five years  ago.  </P> <P> This cross-country season, however, has been frustrating for Arreola, who will  compete in the NCAA Division I championships at Pine Lakes Golf Course in  Knoxville, Tenn., on Monday.  </P> <P> "I've been disappointed," said Arreola, the lone Northridge qualifier for the  national meet. "I think that's why I'm really looking forward to nationals and  the end of the season. I know that's not the greatest attitude to have going  into nationals, but I haven't won a race yet. And I haven't improved as much as  I wanted to." Last season Arreola won four of five cross-country races,  including the California Collegiate Athletic Assn., Division II West regional  and Division II titles.  </P> <P> This season she has finished second once, third twice and fourth twice.  </P> <P> After falling behind in her races, Arreola has been forced to battle for second  -- or worse. It is a notion as foreign to Arreola as liberalism is to  Republicans.  </P> <P> "Before the season began, I thought I had a chance at winning Division I,"  Arreola said. "But after (the) Stanford (Invitational), I started to realize  that that probably won't happen."  </P> <P> Arreola has had her best cross-country season -- lowering her personal best on  the Stanford course by 39 seconds -- but after being a dominant force in  Division II, she won't be one of the favorites when the women's 5,000-meter  race begins at 11 a.m. (EST) Monday.  </P> <P> "It's hard to accept that I'm one of the unknowns," the 22-year-old Arreola  said. "It puts less pressure on me, but it's hard to accept that you're not  going to be one of the ones they're looking at.  </P> <P> "In the school newspaper the other day, (Northridge Coach Don) Strametz said  that a good goal would be the top 10. I saw that and said, 'Top 10?' But then I  realized that I'm going to be running against a lot of good girls that I've  never run against, and that a top-10 finish would probably be a good goal."  </P> <P> Arreola, a fifth-year senior, was a well-beaten third in the Stanford  Invitational on Oct. 6, 29 seconds behind winner Suzy Favor of Wisconsin and 22  seconds behind Buffy Rabbitt of UC Irvine.  </P> <P> "Suzy was just so far ahead of me," Arreola recalled with a laugh. "And she  probably won't be the No. 1 favorite on Monday."  </P> <P> That role will fall to Michelle Dekkers of Indiana and South Africa, the 1988  NCAA Division I champion who defeated Favor for the Big Ten and District 4  titles.  </P> <P> "Dekkers appears to be the favorite," Strametz said, "with (District 8 winner)  Rabbitt looking for a finish in the top seven. . . . But a lot can happen in  cross-country."  </P> <P> Strametz linked Arreola's early-season difficulties to her 70-miles-a-week  regimen, more than she has ever run before.  </P> <P> "She was training through the meets," Strametz said. "She was racing tired. She  was not as fresh as some of the people she was running against."  </P> <P> Arreola, the 10th ranked 1,500-meter runner in the country in 1989, concurred  with Strametz.  </P> <P> "I kept telling myself, 'Don't worry about it. Just think about regionals and  nationals, that's all that matters.' " she said.  </P> <P> Based on Arreola's fourth-place finish in the District 8 meet at Fresno's  Woodward Park last week, Strametz figures that things are going according to  plan.  </P> <P> He has tapered Arreola's training to less than 50 miles a week, and with a  little fine-tuning, he expects her to be firing on all cylinders Monday.  </P> <P> "She ran her best race of the season at districts," he said. "But she's capable  of running better. Physically, she was ready to run a great race at districts,  but mentally she wasn't all there.  </P> <P> "There were certain mental things that she didn't do, like accelerating out of  the curves. If she runs a great mental race at districts, she runs 15-20  seconds faster."  </P> <P> The mental aspect of cross-country running is something that Arreola admittedly  has never mastered. She made marked improvement in that area last season, but  she has never been as aggressive in cross-country as in track.  </P> <P> "You put her within 10 feet of a track during track season and she becomes an  animal," Strametz said. "In cross-country, she works hard, but her attitude  isn't as intense. She is disciplined, but her work ethic has to go to another  level to reach her potential."  </P> <P> Arreola is aware of her mental shortcomings, but she is hopeful of rectifying  them by the time she races in Knoxville.  </P> <P> "I don't think I've been anywhere close to being mentally there (this season),"  Arreola said. "I think (Strametz) would like to think that I'm a lot closer  than I am. I'm really trying to improve in that area, but it's just been hard  this season. . . . It seems like I keep thinking about track when I should be  concentrating on cross-country.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, I can end the season on a good note."  </P></p>

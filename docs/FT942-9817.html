			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Rank Org shares fall following lacklustre statement Shares in Rank Organisation lost 15p to 403p yesterday after the leisure company issued a trading statement described by one analyst as 'lacking sparkle'. The company said it has had a 'satisfactory first half so far, and there are continuing indications that leisure spending in the US and UK is likely to be at higher levels than in 1993'. In spite of bad weather in the US, which contributed to a slight decline in profits from its Hard Rock restaurant business, trading results up to the middle of April were ahead of last year. The film and television division had performed 'particularly well'. But Mr Bruce Jones, leisure analyst at brokers Smith New Court, said that holiday bookings and the marginal increase in bingo turnover were 'a little disappointing'. Although holidays sold for the first half were up 12 per cent, bookings for the second half were only 2 per cent ahead, in line with a slowdown in the total holiday market. Mr Jones held his full-year profit forecast at Pounds 335m but BZW trimmed its prediction by Pounds 10m to Pounds 322.5m before exceptionals. Mr Peter Hillier, BZW's analyst said: 'Once again the growth is coming from Rank Xerox which has been an incredibly strong performer.' In spite of difficult market conditions in Europe, Rank Xerox's results for the first quarter to January were 'significantly' higher than last year. Its underlying revenues increased by 6 per cent before adverse exchange rates with UK sales up by over 10 per cent. Rank's interim figures will include a Pounds 62m charge, representing the group's share of the restructuring costs announced by Xerox in December, and a Pounds 50m provision for the closure of its US video distribution business.</p>

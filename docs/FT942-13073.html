			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: GE and Skoda in power co-operation General Electric of the US and Skoda, the Czech Republic's leading industrial company, have announced a 10-year agreement of 'co-operation and strategic association' between them in projects for power generation. The deal, signed at Plzen, is a coup for GE, which has negotiated the agreement in the past few weeks in spite of long, intermittent talks between the Czech company and Siemens of Germany. Mr Ronald Pressman, chief executive of GE Power Systems Europe, said that Skoda would be supplying mainly steam turbine components to GE. The US company expects to place about Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m (Pounds 3.35m-Pounds 6.7m) in orders with Skoda in the next two years, with commitments expected to increase after that. GE will supply gas turbines and combined-cycle engineering for Skoda-designed power plants in eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and Vietnam. Both companies have also agreed to explore opportunities for co-operation in individual power plant construction projects elsewhere. Skoda has been wooed by westerners since the opening of the old Comecon markets in the early-1990s. GE had also talked with the company at that stage, said Mr Pressman. Skoda reached agreement in principle on a broad co-operation in power with Siemens in 1991.</p>

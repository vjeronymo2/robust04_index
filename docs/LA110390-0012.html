			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEASURE C MUDDLE  </P> <P> A political dirty trick is being foisted on the people of Huntington Beach. The  trick: Paid telephone solicitors are identifying themselves as calling for Save  Our Parks and urging support for Measure D and the developer candidates.  </P> <P> The truth: Save Our Parks is the group that founded Measure C, the Citizens'  Charter Amendment. Measure C gives the citizens a direct vote before the  pro-developer City Council majority can lease away our beachfront for  35-foot-high restaurants and Central Park for hotels, large restaurants,  amusement parks, etc. The public has the right to participate in decisions  regarding major commercialization of their parks and beaches.  </P> <P> Save Our Parks rejects Measure D (the developers' measure) as a fraud that was  put on the ballot by the pro-developer City Council majority with the intent of  deceiving the voters. Save Our Parks supports Measure C and the slate of Grace  Winchell, Mark Porter and Linda Patterson.  </P> <P> Don't be fooled: Measure C represents citizens. Measure D represents  developers.  </P> <P> DAVID A. SULLIVAN  </P> <P> Co-founder, Save Our Parks  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

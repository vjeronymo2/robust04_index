			<p>940414 FT  14 APR 94 / Compensation scheme levy The Investors Compensation Scheme is raising a levy of Pounds 17.5m to meet the estimated costs of compensation and management for the 12 months to the end of March this year. The ICS offers a safety net for investors who are entitled to redress but find that the company responsible for their predicament has gone out of business. The bulk of the charge - Pounds 15.4m - will fall on Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Tax measures 'will help cut gas emissions' The government's decision to impose value added tax on domestic heating bills and to make annual increases in road fuel duties will help it to meet its target for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says today. The institute says that the measures will 'make a substantial contribution to reducing UK emissions of carbon dioxide'. It also predicts that the government's target for stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000 will be 'comfortably achieved', in large part because of the fiscal measures. In 1992 Mr John Major, the prime minister, committed the UK to freezing its emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000. The fiscal measures adopted last year will add 'slightly' to inflation, the institute says. But it suggests that they will have little impact on real growth in gross domestic product or consumer expenditure because other tax increases would have been forthcoming to cut the public sector borrowing requirement. The report notes, however, that a carbon tax, such as that proposed by the European Commission, would be more effective in reducing harmful atmospheric emissions. It describes the imposition of VAT on heating bills as a 'one-off measure', which is unlikely to have much impact on the 'underlying long-term growth of carbon dioxide emissions from households'. The study also criticises the government's failure to provide a 'convincing solution' to the problem of emissions from electricity generators and other industries. The government's plan to raise the rate of duty on road fuels by 5 per cent a year in real terms is seen as an 'innovative approach' and will 'almost certainly slow the growth of emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases and associated social costs'.</p>

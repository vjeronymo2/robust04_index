			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram chief awaits fate The fate of Mr Bill Rooney, chairman and chief executive of Spring Ram, is likely to be decided at a board meeting of the bathroom and kitchens group tomorrow Prudential Corporation, the group's biggest institutional shareholder, wants to see the departure of Mr Rooney, who yesterday returned early from a holiday in Barbados to fight for his future in the company, which he co-founded. Sources close to the company suggested that the other executive directors would not wish to work with an imposed chairman, but the Prudential seems confident that its views will prevail. Spring Ram's shares yesterday closed 5 1/2 p higher at 54p, well below last year's peak of 181p. The shares have collapsed because of three profits warnings in eight months, the most recent a fortnight ago.</p>

Control Devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carbon adsorbers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Adsorption systems are used to remove organic compounds from gas streams when strict limits on the outlet concentration must be met, or when recovery of the compound is desired. Adsorption is effective on inlet concentrations ranging from a few parts per billion to several thousand parts per million, and a flow rate of several hundred to several hundred thousand cubic feet per minute. Carbon adsorbers typically have a removal efficiency of 95 to 99 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the carbon reaches saturation, it can be removed from the adsorber vessel and disposed or regenerated. The carbon can also be regenerated with steam within the adsorber vessel. This option readily allows for the recovery of the organic compounds for recycling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Incinerators.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two basic types of incinerators, thermal and catalytic, are used in the aerospace industry to remove organic contaminants. Each type is discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Thermal incinerators.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thermal incinerators can be generally used on air streams with a wide concentration range of organics. These control devices have minimal dependence on the characteristics of the organic contaminants, so they can be used to control a wide variety of emission streams. Thermal incinerators can achieve removal efficiencies of 98 percent and higher.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The basic operation of thermal incinerators involves raising the inlet air stream to the incineration temperature of the contaminants and maintaining the temperature for a specific residence time. The waste heat content of the incinerator exhaust stream is used to preheat the inlet air stream. An auxiliary fuel is then typically required to raise the air stream temperature to the incineration temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Catalytic incinerators.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Catalytic incinerators are similar to thermal incinerators except that they use a catalyst (a substance that accelerates the rate of oxidation without undergoing a chemical change itself) to assist in the oxidation of organic compounds to carbon dioxide and water. These incinerators are typically used for air streams with a low concentration of organics. The removal efficiency of catalytic incinerators can be as high as 98 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ultraviolet oxidation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An ultraviolet light oxidation (UVOX) system has been developed as an abatement device for air streams with low concentrations of organic compounds. The air stream passes through particulate filters, then enters a reactor where it is exposed to ultraviolet light which initiates the oxidation of the organics. Ozone and other oxygen-based oxidants are injected into the reactor to react with the organics in the air stream to begin the oxidation of organics into carbon dioxide and water. A typical removal efficiency for UVOX is reported to be 95 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Activated carbon fiber adsorbent.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another technology has been developed to control low concentration organic compound emissions (e.g., paint spray booths). This technology utilizes an activated carbon fiber adsorbent to initially capture the organic emissions, the concentration of which is too low to be removed by a control device such as an incinerator. The adsorbent system consists of a honeycomb structure element made of activated carbon fiber paper in corrugated form. This structure adsorbs the organics in the exhaust stream. As the activated carbon structure becomes saturated, the organics are desorbed using hot air. This concentrated air stream can then be sent to an incinerator or other control device. The portion of the activated carbon structure that was regenerated then begins the adsorption cycle again.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Catalyst-coated filter media.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Low concentration organic emissions (e.g., paint spray booths) can be controlled through the use of a catalyst-coated filter media. The catalyst material is impregnated onto the fibers of a dry filter which can then be used wherever conventional dry filters are used. The catalyst material, unlike activated carbon, permanently binds the organic material into its crystalline matrix so that it will not later desorb. In addition to the coated filters, the catalyst material can be used in a granular form to control emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

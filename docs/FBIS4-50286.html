			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The size of the overseas  personnel employment in China should be about 300,000 to 500,000  by the turn of the century, which will account for 0.2 to 0.3  percent of China's total workforce of 150 million people.    This is the employment proportion set preliminarily by the  Chinese Government for overseas personnel by the year 2000,  according to Wang Dongyan, a senior official with the State  Labor Ministry.    According to the official, China will balance and readjust  the total number of overseas personnel employed in various  regions in light of the economic development and the labor  supply and demand in various localities.    He mentioned the necessity of strictly limiting the  employment of non-technical personnel and other ordinary  laborers from overseas, for China is very populous and has huge  redundant labor resources.    The labor official noted that only those with special skills  and managerial personnel who are in short demand in China can be  employed. On no account should localities exceed the employment  quota set by the government.    The state's labor departments will also decide on the list  of  industries and types of work which overseas personnel are  allowed to take on.    The official stressed that overseas personnel should be  banned from employment in industries and departments which  concern national defense as well as national security.    In addition, the official said, overseas employees should  get  "employment permits for overseas personnel" before being allowed  to settle in China.</p>

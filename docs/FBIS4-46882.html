			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Solovov, candidate of economic sciences and </F> deputy chairman of the Bank of Russia: "The Monetary Policy of  the CIS Countries: Coordination Is Needed"]    [Text] At the initiative of the Association of  Russian Banks, the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy,  Mezhekonomsberbank [Intereconomic Savings Bank], and the "Novaya  Politika" [New Politics] Center for Humanitarian Relations and  Business Cooperation, an international banking conference is  being held with the title "Possible ways to establish an  efficient mutual settlement of accounts system for Russia with  the states of the near abroad on the level of central and  commercial banks."    Taking part in the conference's work will be  representatives of the central and commercial banks of Russia  and the countries of the near abroad and managers of state  departments. The material by deputy chairman of the Bank of  Russia V. Solovov has also been prepared within the framework of  this conference.    At the present time, resolving the problems of  developing the monetary systems of the CIS states and organizing  payments between the legal and physical persons of these states  is becoming increasingly urgent. Introducing national currencies  and making the currencies and credit markets of the states of  the former Union distinctive have generated a lot of questions  which must be answered to eliminate the obstacles which have  formed in mutual settlement of accounts and to create an  effective payment system.    I must confess that at this time there is no proper  coordination of monetary-credit policy of the CIS states, most  economic organizations are experiencing serious difficulties in  transferring money from one country to another, the national  currencies market is not developed, and certain currencies of  these states are not quoted at all by the Bank of Russia, even  for accounting purposes. Accordingly, there is no developed  system of exchange of currencies of the Commonwealth states,  freely convertible currencies and the Russian Federation ruble  act as the real means of payment when citizens travel to  neighboring states, and the Russian ruble's role on the "black"  market of virtually all the CIS states remains significant,  which naturally concerns their central banks when they are  resolving questions of stabilizing their national currencies.    In these conditions, the desire to solve the problems of the  accounts-payment relations of the members of the Commonwealth is  becoming stronger and stronger. The need for such a solution is  the result of the extremely close economic interrelations  between the enterprises of these states, the many relations of  kinship and friendship among citizens, traditional passenger  traffic, and other factors which allowed the Soviet Union to be  a real unified national economic and civil complex. Resolving  the problem should provide legal entities the opportunity to  make payments for output delivered and settle accounts on other  debt obligations.    Since there are different currencies in the two states,  payments must be made either in one currency or the currency the  payer has must be converted beforehand into the currency the  recipient of the payment needs. The first thing all the  participants in interstate settlement of accounts of the states  of the former Union encountered was their lack of an organized  currency market. The central banks have to perform the task of  creating currency exchanges. Not all states have managed to this  at this point. A currency policy requires coordination.    After July 1992, the tendency toward a policy focused on  full-scale introduction of national currencies in the states of  the former Union increased. However, representatives of many  states continued to declare their commitment to preserving the  common ruble space and their intention to follow coordinated  monetary-credit, currency, budget, tax, customs, and price  policies. These sentiments were most fully reflected in the  interstate agreement signed in Bishkek on 9 October 1992. But by  November 1992, Ukraine had already introduced its own national  currency, and then Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kirghizia, and  Turkmenistan did so.    With the introduction of national currencies, the central  (national) banks faced the task of supporting the payments of  economic subjects to their partners from other states of the  former Union, which is feasible with mutually convertible  currencies. Banks, with the exception of the Bank of Russia, had  no experience in currency regulation and the organization of  trade in currencies, and many questions had to be resolved in  slapdash fashion. Since both the Russian Federation ruble and  the currencies of the other CIS states were constantly being  devalued, the exchange rates of the currencies could not be  stabilized. The Russian Federation currency in fact played the  leading role in interstate settlement of accounts of the CIS  countries, which again put the question of the role of the  Russian ruble and the Bank of Russia on the agenda.    In practice, the mechanism for managing payments in the  central (national) banks of the states of the former USSR (other  than Russia) was reduced to selecting the top priority payments  (at the discretion of the representatives of the governments and  national banks) which the balance in the correspondent account  in the Bank of Russia (in Russian book entry rubles) permitted  to be transferred to the banks of Russia. With such a practice,  commercial banks and their clients were deprived of the  opportunity to manage receipts from the banks of Russia, and the  capital passed entirely to the disposal of the national banks,  which was not in the interests of the commercial banks' clients.    It got somewhat easier for commercial banks to handle  interstate accounts in the second half of 1992 after the Bank of  Russia allowed accounts to be done through the correspondent  accounts of the commercial banks which they opened in others'  banks. When an account was opened, certain conditions had to be  met, in particular the requirements of legislation of both the  Russian Federation and the state of the nonresident bank.    As for payments through the central banks, to an increasing  degree they began to depend on the amount of technical credit  which the Russian Federation offered to the particular state of  the former USSR. From the very start, the Russian Federation  government restricted the granting of technical credits, and  starting on 1 July 1993, by decree of the Russian Federation  Supreme Soviet of 30 June 1993, the Bank of Russia was  prohibited from offering credits to governments and central  (national) banks of the states of the former USSR. The new state  credits began to be offered using only the capital of the  Russian Federation budget. By the second quarter of 1993, a  substantial part of trade exchange had already begun to be  served by settlements on the accounts of commercial banks, and  the role of the correspondent accounts of central banks in  serving commodity turnover substantially declined.    This situation was the result of the fact that the currency  and credit policy followed by the central (national) banks and  governments of the CIS states did not give incentive to  enterprises and commercial banks to transfer Russian rubles  through the central (national) banks' accounts in the Bank of  Russia. The problem of currency regulation and organization of a  currency market arose in all its fullness for the central banks.    A normal market of the currencies of the CIS states has  still  not been organized in the Russian Federation's currency  exchanges. The volumes of national currencies offered on the  Russian Federation's currency exchanges are much greater than  the demand for these currencies, and the quotation of these  currencies made by the Bank of Russia based on the results of  trading sessions can hardly be called representative. And it is  no accident that in publishing these rates, the Bank of Russia  does not assume the obligation of buying or selling the  corresponding currencies at the rates set, and they are largely  employed only for the purposes of accounting and taxation.    The shortage of Russian rubles on the markets of the CIS  countries was created not only by objective factors (the  imbalance of commodity exchange with Russia and the nonpayments  of Russian purchasers), but is also a result of the currency  policy of the corresponding states which makes it unprofitable  for exporters of goods to Russia to transfer the rubles received  through the official channels of the central banks. Commercial  structures are actively speculating on various currency rates.    At present Russian sellers still have little interest in  receiving payment in the national currency, since they  experience some difficulty spending this capital on the  territory of the corresponding states, including because of  limited potential to convert the national currencies into rubles  or freely convertible currency, as well as limited access to  highly liquid goods of the local market, which is frequently  monopolized.    The condition of the Russian Federation's credit-settlements  and payment relations with the CIS states throughout 1993 was an  object of special concern during all interstate negotiations.  The crisis in interstate accounts settlement was in many  respects also tied to the insolvency of Russian enterprises, and  because of that the CIS states could not have at their disposal  all the revenue from exporting output to Russia which could have  been used to stabilize the national currency's rate relative to  the ruble.    The fact that the customers from the CIS countries did not  have ruble assets and that the Russian sellers were unwilling to  accept payment in their national currencies from them in itself  paralyzed normal market relations and led to a cutback in  economic ties, which, given the high degree to which the  economies of the members of the Commonwealth were integrated,  had extremely bad consequences for all the states, including  Russia.    So-called barter clearing began to be used as one of the  measures for maintaining interstate cooperation; this meant that  products vitally important to the states were exchanged in kind  based on their equivalent values in world prices. But barter  clearing substantially impaired the possibility of forming  currency markets both in Russia (in view of the demand for the  national currencies of the CIS countries) and in the  Commonwealth states (in view of the supply of Russian rubles).    On 22 January 1993, the Agreement on the Creation of an  Interstate Bank of the CIS States was signed, and it was  supposed to help primarily in improving interstate settlement of  accounts. But up to this point, this bank has not begun to  perform its operations, since not all the founding states and  members of the Interstate Bank have fulfilled their obligations  to the bank.    The difficulties in handling interstate settlement of  accounts by book entry instead of cash created increased  interest in settlements in cash. Despite the prohibitions, these  settlements became more and more popular. The migration to  Russia of cash in the form of 1961-1992 series ruble notes of  USSR Gosbank and the Bank of Russia, issued by the banks of  Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and other states which had  not introduced their own bank notes, reached a scale which  threatened the interests of monetary circulation in the Russian  Federation.    For this reason, on 23 July 1993 the Bank of Russia declared  that 1961-1992 series banknotes of USSR Gosbank and the Bank of  Russia would cease to circulate on Russia's territory starting  on 26 July 1993. Previous to this decision, from the very start  of 1993, the Bank of Russia had been putting exclusively 1993  series banknotes of the Bank of Russia into circulation on  Russia's territory, and they were not turned over to the  disposal of the central (national) banks of the other states of  the ruble zone. The result of this action was completion of the  process of Russia's introducing a national currency, which  started in mid-1992 with the introduction of a correspondent  accounts system for interstate settlement of accounts.    This decision of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation  required that Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan,  and Armenia immediately decide what paper money they were going  to use on their territories and how their monetary systems would  be managed in the future.    The Russian Federation expressed its readiness to offer the  1993 series banknotes of the Bank of Russia to the disposal of  the central (national) banks of these states, but given that  they definitely comply with a number of conditions, the most  important ones being that they transfer to the Bank of Russia  the authority to regulate the volumes of credit and cash-money  emission, strictly comply with the unified rules for completing  banking transactions and interbank settlement of accounts, and  follow a unified currency and interest policy.    These conditions defined the essence of the new type of  ruble  zone, and the agreement on practical measures for its creation  was signed in Moscow on 7 September 1993 by the heads of the  governments and central (national) banks of the Russian  Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, and  Tajikistan. Turkmenistan had already made the decision to  introduce its own national currency by this time and did not  take part in the agreement.    During interstate negotiations on the intergovernmental and  interbank levels which took place afterward on particular  conditions for combining the monetary systems of the states  participating in the agreement of 7 September 1993, the parties  did not manage to achieve accord on the conditions for the  central (national) banks to immediately receive for their  disposal cash in the form of 1993 series banknotes of the Bank  of Russia, which these states (other than Belarus) desperately  needed. The adoption of a decision dragged out for an indefinite  time and that destabilized the domestic market of the states  where the Soviet ruble continued to circulate; in connection  with that, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Armenia made the decision  to refrain from hastily combining the monetary systems and  introduced national currencies (November-December 1993), while  Tajikistan received a state credit from the Russian Federation  in the form of 1993 series banknotes of the Bank of Russia.    In this way, in 1993 the new type of ruble zone did not come  about on the territories of six CIS states. At this time (late  March 1994), negotiations on unifying the monetary systems of  the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus continue and  are close to completion.    So, as a result of the lack of proper coordination of  monetary-credit policy followed in 1991-1993 by the states of  the former USSR, the monetary system of the Soviet Union had  ceased to exist by the end of 1993 and all states of the former  USSR had acquired their own monetary systems headed by the  central (national) banks formed on the basis of former USSR  Gosbank institutions. These banks are accumulating experience in  autonomous existence and almost all of them are encountering the  same problems of development and growth. So regular exchange of  experience is important and a joint search for decisions to the  problems arising is necessary.    The extreme interdependence of the economies of the CIS  states objectively serves as the basis for currency integration.  It cannot be considered accidental that there is a growing  awareness of the importance and objective need for economic  integration of all or some of the CIS countries with the  creation of superstate organs, including an emissions bank. It  is noteworthy in the situation in the Commonwealth states that  they are able, by relying on recent past experience, to resolve  the problems of a currency union much faster than, say, the  states of the European Community.</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Business Travel: When tickets crumble to dust - FT Writers explain the rights of passengers who find their flights overbooked or seriously delayed Laden with your suitcase, briefcase and suit-carrier, you stagger to the airline check-in desk. All you want is to relax in your business-class seat with a glass of champagne, and a flight attendant tending to your needs. Instead you hear: 'I'm sorry, sir, the flight is overbooked. You'll have to wait.' Your confirmed ticket crumbles to dust. Angry and frustrated, you wonder what will happen next. Most airlines in large business destinations try to soothe you with cash, meal vouchers and free telephone calls to your destination. They have to do this under European Union or US rules, which set out minimum, and in the US case, maximum cash compensation for 'bumped' passengers. In the EU, for flights of up to 3,500km (mainly within Europe and north Africa) compensation should be at least Ecu75 (Pounds 59) where the airline offers an alternative flight arriving within two hours of the original time, and Ecu150 for flights arriving over two hours later. On longer flights, Ecu150 should be paid for flights arriving within four hours of the original time, and Ecu300 where the delay is more than four hours. In the US, the figures are 'an amount equal to the one-way fare up to a maximum of Dollars 200' for delays of between one and two hours (two and four hours for international flights) and twice the fare up to Dollars 400 if the delay is longer. The US Department of Transportation points out that 'you always get to keep your original ticket, and you can use it on another flight or have it refunded. The . . . compensation is essentially a payment for your inconvenience.' Many airlines prefer to offer flight vouchers instead of cash as compensation. Vouchers give discounts on flights, generally of Dollars 300-Dollars 500, but you should ensure that they can be used on discounted, as well as full-fare, tickets. You can insist on a cash payment. Some airlines, especially those in the US, operate auctions, in which they offer progressively higher amounts of compensation until the excess number of passengers has voluntarily agreed to take a later flight. United Airlines, the second biggest carrier in the US, says that this system means that only one in 30,000 passengers is bumped off a flight against his or her will. Flights originating outside the US or EU may be less straightforward. Some carriers, such as American Airlines, Swissair and Japan Air Lines, apply US or EU rules across their entire network. Others, especially carriers from developing countries, may try to pay substantially less. The rules do not apply to charter flights. For all passengers, a few steps can be taken to minimise the chances of losing your seat: Confirm your flight, and check in on time. These are prerequisites for the US and EU compensation rules to take effect. Checking in early will reduce the risk still further. Travel business class, first class or on a full-fare economy ticket. Most airlines claim they never overbook the first-class cabin, and if you are on a full-fare economy ticket you should be first in line to be bumped into business or first class. Furthermore, with a first or business-class ticket, other airlines on the route will be keen to take you on their flights, because they then get the ticket revenue. Join frequent flyer or other privilege programmes. All the airlines contacted by the Financial Times said that holders of such cards should be less likely to be bumped. Kick up a fuss. Ground staff have a lot of discretion over who flies. If you have a business meeting, anniversary dinner or medical condition, tell the ground staff. Persistence works: one terrier-like FT journalist was bumped on to Concorde as ground staff strove to rid themselves of his attentions.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS;  </P> <P> SEPT. 16 CELEBRATION AT LINCOLN PARK CANCELED  </P> <P> In response to a melee that marred this year's Cinco de Mayo celebration at  Lincoln Park, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre has canceled the  traditional Mexican Independence Day observance scheduled for Sept. 16 at the  park.  </P> <P> After meetings with community groups, the police and other interested parties,  Alatorre said the policy of allowing beer consumption at such events needs more  study. Also to be studied, he said, are security, entertainment and whether  such events should be two-day observances.  </P> <P> Other Sept. 16 celebrations are still planned throughout Southern California.  </P> <P> Critics have charged that the consumption of beer at the park celebrations,  allowed by the city in part because beer companies underwrite the festivities,  has changed the focus and tenor of such holidays. Events to promote ethnic  pride have turned into glorified beer busts, they contend.  </P></p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Attempting to waken a slumbering Greek giant - Management efforts to improve services and win back corporate clients at National Bank NATIONAL Bank, the sleeping giant of Greek banking, is being prodded awake by a new management team. The three state-run commercial banks dominate Greek banking and National Bank, with assets of around Dollars 28bn (60 per cent of total banking assets), is much the biggest player. It has a network of 550 branches and is well placed to benefit from the deregulation. The debit side is that National Bank's proportion of non-performing loans is high following decades of government-influenced lending, it is overstaffed, and expertise in several specialised banking areas is in short supply. The stimulus for change eventually came from within the government. The Finance Ministry, which acts as proxy for an unwieldy group of state organisations that control the bank, appointed a team of younger managers, several of whom had worked abroad or with foreign banks in Greece. The new governor, Mr Michael Vranopoulos, has a mandate to restructure the bank's operations to compete effectively in the single European market. 'In management terms, we have to catapult the bank from the 1950s to the 1990s. We have to improve services and win back corporate clients. Our big problem is that we have a lot of business which nobody else wants.' An example of this is that National Bank handles almost all state pension fund contributions and payments. It also acts as paymaster for several hundred thousand employees of public sector corporations. The bank's first step towards reform was to admit the extent of bad credit, by abandoning the practice of accruing interest on doubtful loans. It reported a loss of Dr12.3bn (Dollars 64m) for 1990, its first negative results in living memory. Last year, National Bank almost doubled its capital base through a Dr36.6bn preferential rights offering and a Dr120bn convertible bond issue. Most of the bond issue was taken up by the government. At the same time, the bank set up a new subsidiary (National Capital) in order to syphon off weak assets such as bad loans, low-yielding shares, property and subsidiaries awaiting privatisation. So far, assets of Dr35bn have been transferred to National Capital. 'It will take two to three years to weed out the company's portfolio. Then it can be merged again with the bank,' says Mr Spyros Capralos, a deputy governor. The overhaul has brought a swift return to profit. National Bank reported its best earnings of Dr43.1bn for 1991, despite an increase in provisions from Dr7bn to Dr45.9bn. Provisions are now equivalent to eight per cent of lending and will be increased again next year, according to Mr Vranopoulos. This is partly because the bank has exposure to a group of nationalised industrial companies whose debts will have to be written off before they can be privatised. National Bank is adopting an aggressive lending policy, taking advantage of deregulation of interest rates. The bank's computer system is being upgraded to bring on-line all but a few branches on remoter Aegean islands. About 100 automated teller machines have been installed around Athens and in major tourist resorts and 300 more are planned. National Bank's overseas operations, set up to serve Greek immigrants to the US, Canada and South Africa, are also being reviewed. 'It's no longer enough to help a Greek migrant send remittances home. The overseas units must start competing in their local markets,' says Mr Stefanos Vavalidis, who has the task of upgrading the bank's 67 subsidiaries and branches abroad. There is still a long way to go. Despite its improved results, National Bank's return on assets remains negative. The government promises to introduce legislation this year to abolish the Finance Ministry's proxy. 'The bank needs to be much more independent of government. The new law is a priority,' says Mr Vranopoulos.</p>

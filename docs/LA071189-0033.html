			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEFLON SUPPLIER SEEKS NAME THAT WILL STICK  </P> <P> It may not be the challenge of the century, but Peter Churm has thrown down the  gauntlet: As chairman of Fluorocarbon Inc. in Laguna Niguel, he is daring the  public to engage its imagination and come up with a new moniker to replace his  company's nettlesome name.  </P> <P> The deadline: Aug. 31. The reward: 100 shares of company stock, valued at  around $14 per share.  </P> <P> OK, so it's not a million dollars, but Churm's already gotten some 70  suggestions since the company's annual meeting on June 6, when he announced  that Fluorocarbon was planning a name change.  </P> <P> "They come in on scraps of paper, in formal letters, by fax," Churm said  Monday, the contest's first official day. "A lot of them involve the word  polymer. Some involve the word Teflon. Others involve taking our name and  breaking it into initials. Some are really off the wall."  </P> <P> Polymer? Teflon? How snappy an appellation can you dream up for a company  that's spent some three decades fashioning fixtures from fluorocarbon, the main  ingredient in Teflon? Churm is well aware of the difficulties of the task  ahead, but it's worth it, he says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Business Lost  </P> <P> Fluorocarbon has been beset with an image problem caused by its not-so-harmless  handle. To Churm, the name sounds too much like chlorofluorocarbons -- the  gases that are blamed for burning holes in the Earth's ozone layer.  </P> <P> While the company has lost no business because of its name, Churm said that in  the past six months he has been told by several stockbrokers that they will no  longer pitch his stock to clients.  </P> <P> These brokers contend that it takes too much effort to explain to prospective  shareholders that fluorocarbons are harmless solids, not destructive gases, and  that Fluorocarbon is a good company, not a bad guy, Churm said. Hence the name  change.  </P> <P> "If we had our preference we would like to have a name that more closely  describes what we do," Churm said. "We make industrial components . . . that go  into other peoples' machinery."  </P> <P> Now, let's face it, you can't call the company Industrial Components, he says,  because it's so long and clumsy. But he's not willing to give up on the idea of  a name that describes what the company makes.  </P> <P> "Industrial components out of high performance polymers, plastic and rubber,"  Churm said with a sigh. "All those are big words. We have to boil all that big  wordage into something snappy and short and eye-catching. You see why we're  having a contest?"  </P> <P> Well, yes.  </P></p>

During the  inauguration of the 20th extraordinary period of sessions of the  Inter-American Cooperation for Development General Assembly at  the Foreign Minister, OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena  Soares warned that the downtrodden need much more than just a  chance to be heard in order to maintain stability and democracy  in the region.    [Begin Baena Soares recording] Just giving the downtrodden a  chance to be heard is not enough to improve the fate of large  segments of our society, rescue them from scarcity and  exploitation, and ensure their full right to live with hope. We  need sustainable democracy to overcome extreme poverty. [end  recording]    Speaking to 20 Latin American foreign ministers and 34  special delegates from member countries, Baena Soares warned  government representatives of the danger that extreme poverty  and social injustice may break the region's democratic order.  Recalling the Mexico Declaration, signed in March 1945, which  emphasizes the right of equal opportunity for all people in the  hemisphere, Baena Soares hit the nail on the head when he  affirmed that more progress is made today consolidating wealth  than in halting the avalanche of extreme poverty and neglect,  although the growth of these factors dampens possibilities for  stability, development, and peace, which the countries of Latin  America require to advance on the path of democracy.    As an example, the OAS secretary general said that 230  million citizens in the region lack the resources to meet their  basic needs. He stressed that in at least 11 Latin American and  Caribbean countries, the available firsthand information reveals  that one-fifth of the population earns less than 6 percent of  the total per capita income. He noted that even those societies  that have achieved high levels of production exhibit serious  deficiencies linked to the displacement of indigenous  communities, neglected populations, a lack of food and housing,  high rates of crime and violence, the illegal trafficking and  use of drugs, and environmental deterioration.    Baena Soares noted that among the international community,  close to 6.5 percent of the labor force in the wealthier  countries is jobless. The unemployment rate of the hemisphere's  industrialized countries is almost 7 percent. This segment of  society, the poorest, must work an average of nine weeks to  acquire the resources earned in just one week by the richer 20  percent. Although cold and repetitive, the figures are a cause  for reflection after almost half a century of OAS assemblies,  where extreme poverty, injustice, and democracy are recurrent  themes. The OAS secretary general stressed the need for the OAS  member countries to ratify their commitment to base the  preservation of democratic order on an open struggle against  extreme poverty and on the consolidation of social justice.  American countries, he said, have the resources to defeat  poverty.    In turn, Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello, who was  elected president of the extraordinary assembly, stated during  the inaugural ceremony that Mexico is convinced that the  people's aspirations for justice and welfare demand an end to  the backwardness and neglect in which millions of Latin American  live. That, he said, can only be achieved as peoples and  governments make new commitments to cooperation and development.  The war on extreme poverty, Tello concluded, should become a  priority of the OAS, because inequality hurts everyone.</p>

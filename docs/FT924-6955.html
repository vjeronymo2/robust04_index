			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Interest charges behind 20% fall at Young &amp; Co's Profits before tax at Young &amp; Co's Brewery showed a 20 per cent decline, from Pounds 3.07m to Pounds 2.45m, for the six months to September 26. However, Mr John Young, chairman of the south London-based brewer, was quick to point out that the fall was partly attributable to high interest rates during the period - interest charges jumped Pounds 685,000 to Pounds 1.7m; profits at the trading level improved 8.3 per cent to Pounds 4.15m. The previous period included a profit of Pounds 247,780 from the disposal of Young's stake in Taunton Cider. Mr Young said the poor summer had 'badly affected' riverside and garden pubs while recession hit houses in the City. Nevertheless, turnover, taking in a full contribution from HH Finch, rose some 16 per cent to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 32.1m). Barrelage was 6.2 per cent higher, Mr Young added. He was 'reasonably optimistic' about the outlook: 'We estimate that the new, lower interest rates will lead to a saving of Pounds 400,000 in the second half.' The interim dividend is maintained at 7p, payable from earnings of 12.27p (15.45p).</p>

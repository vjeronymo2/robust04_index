			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Construction Contracts: Servicing the oil industry EDMUND NUTTALL has won a Pounds 4m contract from Peterhead Bay Authority to construct a new jetty and breakwater in Peterhead Harbour, in the Grampian region of Scotland. The jetty is to provide berthing facilities for North Sea service vessels, while the breakwater will give protection to a future marina development planned for the harbour area. The main works involve the construction of a reinforced concrete jetty 170 metres long and 23 metres wide, supported on tubular steel piles. The breakwater will consist of a 250-metre long layered rubble mound. Associated works include dredging and rock removal, the placement of graded fill over the existing foreshore and sea bed to reclaim a 180 x 40 metre storage area and a marina base area. Sheet piling, and electrical and drainage provisions will also be undertaken. The location of the works is to the west end of the ASCO (Aberdeen Service Company) south base berths within Peterhead Bay harbour.</p>

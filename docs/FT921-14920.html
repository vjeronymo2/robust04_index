			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Trade News: British group joins in Qatar methanol project QATAR plans to build a joint methanol plant with Penspen, the British consulting engineers, to benefit from huge reserves at the Gulf state's northern gas field, Reuter reports from Bahrain. Industry sources in the Gulf said yesterday that Qatar last week signed an agreement with the London-based group to design and project manage the 2,000-tonne per day plant in Umm Said, on the east coast. They said construction of the plant would cost around Dollars 400m (Pounds 214m) and would be financed jointly by Qatar and British companies. The money would probably be raised from commercial banks in the area, they said, but gave no other details. Penspen declined to comment on the agreement. Qatar's vast north field gas reservoir, the world's biggest, began production last August with a target rate of 800m cubic feet per day. The reservoir contains 380 trillion (million million) cu ft of reserves.</p>

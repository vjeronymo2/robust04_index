			<p>BFN     [Text] Six more people were found to be infected with the  virus that causes AIDS and two died of the deadly disease last  month, health officials said yesterday. Two AIDS victims who  died March 6 and March 7, respectively, sent shock waves through  the nation because they hid or did not know of the fact that  they had been infected with the HIV virus.    The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs estimates those  infected with AIDS across the country at around 1,000, one-third  of whom are under the ministry's strict health control.    The cause of death was found to be connected with the AIDS  virus one day after a 36-year-old only identified as Ku died  March 6, a ministry official said. And a man identified as So,  37, had been dead four days before he was diagnosed as an AIDS  victim, he added.    An Ethiopian seaman was ordered March 14 to leave the  country  after he was found to be HIV positive, the official said. He  was the 43rd foreigner diagnosed as an AIDS carrier. Those  foreigners are forced to return to their countries.    According to the figures released by the Ministry of Health  and Social Affairs, the country has seen a total of 337 people  infected with HIV since the first AIDS case was reported in  Korea in 1985. Of them 44 have died and one emigrated to an  unknown country. HIV causes AIDS or acquired immune deficiency  syndrome.</p>

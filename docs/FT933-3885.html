			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Italy approves budget cost-saving measures ITALY'S government early yesterday morning, after an 11-hour cabinet session, approved tough cost-saving measures to raise an extra L28,000bn (Pounds 11.8bn) in the 1994 budget. The planned extra revenues, combined with limited new fiscal measures, will raise L32,000bn. This will hold the public sector deficit down to L144,000bn. The cuts, which caused considerable ministerial tensions, will have to be endorsed by parliament. The speed with which parliament approves the budget will have a direct impact on the date for early elections. Parliament is technically meant to pass the budget by December 30 but this date has often been ignored. With new electoral laws in place since last month, parliament is expected to have completed the introduction of legislation on constituency changes by late December. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, said yesterday the austerity budget sought to spread the burden of sacrifice. Several tax measures were specifically designed to benefit the less wealthy, such as provisions for property tax and exemptions on basic health payments. However, the government risks being accused of failing to address sufficiently, either in terms of direct aid or tax incentives, the problem of Italy's rising unemployment. Mr Ciampi, a former governor of the Bank of Italy, insisted the budget was a strong signal to the international community that the country was intent on regaining financial credibility by putting its public accounts in order. The budget, he said, would have a primary surplus (the balance of income and revenue excluding debt service payments) of L32,000bn, equivalent to nearly 2 per cent of GDP. The 1994 budget devotes unprecedented attention to finding savings through reform of the public administration and reducing the privileges of civil servants. The proposals include: Transformation of the ministry of posts into a public company/agency. Abolition of the ministry of merchant marine and the absorption of its activities in a restructured transport ministry. Abolition of all but two inter-ministerial committees and 'quangos'. Devolution of central control of universities and schools to the institutions themselves. A virtual block on civil service recruitment and greater job mobility combined with greater freedom to hire and fire. Reducing pension privileges by penalising early retirement. Ministers said yesterday the transformation of the posts ministry into an agency would save L1,500bn. Potentially bigger savings will come from reforms in the education ministry. Between officials and teachers this ministry accounts for 1.1m public sector employees. There will be a block on hiring new teachers while the devolution of management to the educational establishments is expected to create a far efficient use of resources. Furthermore the civil service will be subjected to a policy of limited recruitment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Topic of the Week" by commentator Aleksandr Golts: "Chill </F> Must Not Develop Into Confrontation"]    [Text] What is happening in U.S.-Russian relations now  brings to mind a well-known anecdote: The pessimist says: "For  some reason everything's gone wrong." Optimist: "That's  nothing, it's going to get even worse." Conflicts and  microcrises, beginning with the Ames affair and ending with  former U.S. President Nixon's somewhat scandalous visit to  Russia, have been following one another virtually  uninterruptedly and in ever-increasing intensity. Furthermore,  they are clearly assuming the character of a tendency toward a  serious cooling off between Moscow and Washington.    For example, hardly had mutual understanding on the Yugoslav  settlement been achieved than the United States was "gloating"  over the negative reaction to Russia's idea of holding a  conference on the Near East settlement. This week another  alarming feature emerged -- namely, the intensification of the  American factor in CIS affairs. It is certainly not the actual  fact of a U.S. desire to play a more active role in the  post-Soviet area that is causing alarm but the fact that this is  happening, to put it mildly, without even a hint of cooperation  between Moscow and Washington.    I have in mind the recent visits to the United States by the  leaders of Ukraine and Georgia. On the one hand, one can only  welcome contacts in which economic cooperation and the ensuring  of peace and stability are discussed. But at the same time you  cannot fail to see that the sides are most actively playing the  "Russia card." Without the participation of Russia itself.    What, for example, was the point of Leonid Kravchuk's  statement that "cooperation with the West will provide an  opportunity to avoid the dire process now developing in Russia"  where, according to him, "there is a perceptible tendency toward  the creation of difficulties of an extremist and expansionist  character." To translate that from the language of diplomatic  innuendo to normal everyday speech, it can only mean one thing:  Ukraine is offering itself to the West as a partner in  preventing "Russian expansionism." You can understand Kravchuk:  He is offering the little that he has to offer. But it is  alarming that the United States did not consider it necessary to  explain its own position clearly.    All this was expressed even more candidly during  Shevardnadze's visit. As an experienced politician with an  excellent grasp of the way things really are, he immediately  presented the United States with a choice: either a UN  peacemaking operation, or the performance of peacemaking  functions by Russian troops. The Americans were quick to  confirm that they will give every support to option one in the  Security Council. Admittedly, Clinton immediately ruled out the  very possibility of the direct involvement of U.S. troops.  This, by all accounts, is not the only condition. A  high-ranking administration representative cited by the  WASHINGTON POST stressed in particular that the administration  wants to restrict Russia's participation a much as possible in  the peacemaking operation for fear of the rebirth of Moscow's  imperial ambitions.    If all this is really so, such an approach not only goes  beyond the bounds of normal mutual relations between states  which just yesterday were virtually calling themselves allies,  but also goes beyond the bounds of common sense. It turns out  that for Washington it is more important to prevent the revival  of the "empire" that it dreads so much. Even if that is to the  detriment of a settlement of the conflicts on the territory of  the former USSR. Incidentally, the U.S. secretary of state's  recent statement confirms that this is indeed close to the  facts. Christopher stressed that the United States does not  recognize Russia's right to undertake any actions in the newly  independent states without coordination with the United Nations  and other international organizations. One can hardly object to  the need to coordinate particular actions. Russia tried to do  that by seeking a UN mandate to conduct peacemaking operations.  But such coordination must happen exclusively through the will  of the states directly involved in the resolution of conflict  situations. On a voluntary basis, and certainly not to the  order of the United States. Does Washington allow its own  freedom of action to be restricted anywhere at all by  consultations with international organizations? This is  Orwellian: Everyone is free but some are freer than others.    It is not hard to find grounds for a cooling off between  America and Russia (you can find quite a few grounds in the  relations between two major states if you are prepared to look);  the hardest thing to find is the real reason for it. In my  view, the real reason is that Russia is beginning, albeit  agonizingly and not without an inner struggle and inevitable  vacillations, to reconsider its place and role in the world.  That is prompted by the development of the internal political  situation and an understanding of the West's real potential for  supporting the reforms and settling conflict situations in the  former USSR. It has become clear (regrettably quite late in the  day) that this potential is not very great at all.    It has also become absolutely clear that people have to  resolve their problems -- economic, military-political, and  geostrategic -- themselves. But a country must feel that it is  capable of doing that. Yes, Russia's new, active role in  unblocking conflict situations in the countries of the former  USSR and beyond, be it participation in the Yugoslav settlement  or the Near East settlement, is important primarily because  Moscow is offering sensible ways to end the sufferings of many  thousands of people. But it must be said bluntly that this is  also fundamentally important for Russia's self-consciousness now  -- once again it feels that it is a state capable of raising  and, importantly, resolving global tasks. And, when it comes to  strengthening this consciousness, hopes are pinned on the  successful solution of our internal difficulties.    But across the ocean it seems that they were not prepared  for  such a development of events. Over there they are too  accustomed to regard themselves as the sole world center of  power. And Russia's new view of itself and its role has  provoked an irritated and not unduly rational reaction, in my  view. The essence of the U.S. position and of the new U.S.  prejudices was expressed quite recently by international affairs  expert Dimitri Simes. The United States, he stated, is a great  global power; Russia is a regional power. And a conflict will  always occur whenever Moscow lays claim to globalism. If the  United States is proposing to take just such an approach, this  will obviously lead to deadlock.    Meanwhile the contradictions that exist are not insoluble.  To eliminate them people only need to renounce the stereotyped  images of Russia as a second-class country that have developed  so quickly. It is important for both Moscow and Washington now  not to be distracted by hysteria or be led along by those for  whom the Cold War was the most precious thing on earth. Such  people exist in both countries. There can be no doubt that they  are trying to take advantage of the present cooling off. The  danger today is that the search for a new model of mutual  relations can easily give way to an escalation of charge and  countercharge. However, neither Russia nor the United States  can permit themselves the luxury of a new confrontation.    I believe that concern for the future of Russo-U.S.  relations  is by no means the least reason for Monday's meeting between  Andrey Kozyrev and Warren Christopher in Vladivostok. Both  states have a good opportunity to prevent an undesirable  development of events. We shall see if they are successful.</p>

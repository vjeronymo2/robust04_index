			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Best mousetrap dials captor PERHAPS THE ultimate 'better mouse trap' has been devised by Rentokil, the UK-based pest control company. The Mouse Alert system uses a series of strategically sited mouse-acceptable boxes, each fitted with two miniature infra-red beams and a radio transmitter. When a mouse enters and breaks both beams (to eliminate false alarms), the transmitter signals the control box and shuts the trap's doors. The control box, which can serve more than 200 traps, displays a visual alarm, sounds a bleeper (which can be muted for discretion) and then automatically dials a sequence of up to four telephone pager numbers. Once alerted, the control technician switches off the alarm, removes the mouse in a special container for humane disposal off site and re-sets the system. The whole process is also confirmed by a control box print out. No toxic bait is used in the trap, so there is no risk of contamination. Labour intensive inspections and reporting are also eliminated, the response is immediate, and the system provides round-the-clock protection. Mouse Alert is intended for high risk premises or high value goods where damage or contamination caused by even one mouse could be catastrophic, such as food and pharmaceutical manufacture and protecting high technology equipment. Potential users of the advanced mousetrap include air and rail traffic control centres. Rentokil: UK 0342 833022.</p>

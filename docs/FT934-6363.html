			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / PowerGen in move to cut pool prices: Profits rise 10% - Shake-up suggestion comes before regulator's MMC decision PowerGen, the power company, yesterday floated the idea of a significant change to price determination in England and Wales's electricity trading pool as it revealed a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 108m. The suggestion comes ahead of a decision later this year by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, on whether to refer PowerGen and National Power, the other large generator, to the Monopolies and Merger Commission. His inquiries have been prompted by sharp pool price rises. Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said there was a strong argument in favour of the main determinant of the pool price being the average price of all generating plant needed to run the system. The main determinant of the existing system is the 'marginal' price, that is the cost of the most expensive plant. Invariably the marginal plant is owned by either National Power or PowerGen, who critics say have too much influence. Mr Wallis said moving to an average price system would overcome the perception that two big players dominate the pool. PowerGen's interim figures for the six months to October 3 showed the company's turnover fell 3 per cent from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 1.27bn. Earnings per share were up 13 per cent to 9.71p (from 8.58p) and the dividend, already announced, rises 18 per cent from 3.35p to 3.95p. Mr Wallis said market share fell marginally from 26.3 to 26.1 per cent and predicted it would reduce to 22 per cent by 1998. This compares with 30 per cent at privatisation three years ago. The half year's performance was helped by a reduction of 200 in job numbers to 5,770 and a fall in coal stocks from 15.5m tonnes to 14.25m. The company expects to cut stocks to 5m tonnes by 1997-8, with most of the reductions achieved in the next two years. In contrast to National Power, PowerGen is not expecting significant closures of power stations by the end of the decade. Mr Wallis said it was possible all 11 stations could survive until the next century, although it was unlikely that two, High Marnham and Drakelow, would survive much after that. The company charged Pounds 12m to the profit and loss account, the same as last year, but unlike National Power did not make adjustments for the positive effects of a European Community ruling on pensions. An adjustment of about Pounds 16m is likely for pensions at the year-end results. Of the half-year charge of Pounds 12m, some Pounds 9m related to liability and damage claims. Sir Colin Southgate, announcing his first results as PowerGen chairman, said performance this year had been up to expectations. Lex, Page 22; Scots developing power to invade England, Page 26</p>

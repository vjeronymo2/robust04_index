			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Observer: Twit to woo Is it wise of Guardian Royal Exchange to drop Royal Exchange from its title? Puzzled investors might wonder whether they are dealing with the insurance group or the newspaper. Changing its symbol from the GRE logo to an owl might also arouse consternation. The owl is intended to connote 'stability, wisdom and friendliness - all of which are very important to us', says the insurer's press release. Let's hope it doesn't also indicate a preference for daytime napping.</p>

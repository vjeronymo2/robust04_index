Slovakia backs any joint initiative by the Visegrad  countries  (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland), Sitko said.  But he added that Slovakia did not consider it a sole basis for  all activities and tolerates the individual partners' right to  their independent approaches.    Sitko said Slovakia fully supported the U.S. Partnership For  Peace project and would seek to develop good bilateral as well  as multilateral relations with its neighbors.    Asked whether the problem of the Hungarian ethnic minority  in  southern Slovakia would be on the agenda of the two countries'  talks in Prague, Sitko said that this problem was intentionally  dramatized. He said that ethnic Hungarians in southern Slovakia  enjoyed standard rights and that relations between Slovak and  Hungarian residents in the area were not conflicting. In his  opinion, the problem serves certain Slovak and Hungarian  politicians as a pretext for increasing their popularity.</p>

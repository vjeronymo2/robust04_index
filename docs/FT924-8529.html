			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden 4: A name to remember - Profile of Procordia PROCORDIA, the food and pharmaceutical conglomerate, remains one of the few bright lights on Sweden's gloomy industrial scene. Its financial performance is impressive and its outlook promising, writes Robert Taylor. It had been expected that the Swedish state would sell off its 40.4 per cent voting shares and 34.2 per cent equity in Procordia this autumn but a sluggish bourse and the turmoil on the currency markets in September compelled a postponement. The national agreement between the Swedish government and the Social Democrats includes a moratorium on the planned privatisation of the country's 35 state-dominated enterprises, but this does not apply to Procordia. Mr Jan Ekberg, the company's president, hopes that the sale of the state's shares in Procordia can go ahead next spring. If successful, the launch could help to complete the transformation of Procordia into one of Europe's leading corporate players in both the growing food and pharmaceutical markets. Much will depend, however, on what happens to Volvo over the coming months. The troubled auto giant remains - with the state - the joint dominant shareowner of Procordia with 45 per cent of its voting rights and 39.5 per cent of the equity. Earlier this year Mr Pehr G y l l e n h a m m a r, Volvo's charismatic executive chairman, tried in a highly public power bid to take over the whole of Procordia but he was rebuffed by the Swedish government. It would not take much for Volvo to lift its stake to half that of the company in the event of flotation. Volvo - which is believed to be losing money at a rate of SKr2bn a year at the moment - could gain majority control of Procordia in order to use its resources as a necessary financial support to prop up its ailing auto division rather than to boost the long-term future of its food and pharmaceuticals. Such an outcome would be a setback to Procordia's long-term plans. But Mr Jan Ekberg, the company's newly appointed chief executive, insists: 'If we run Procordia in a professional manner, Volvo will support it and be satisfied. How Volvo behaves will depend very much on how we manage.' As one of the key figures who drew up the strategy that transformed Procordia in the late 1980s from being a rather unwieldy state monolith into a commercially successful enterprise, Mr Ekberg is keen to trumpet the achievements of the company over the past eight years. This involved deliberately focusing on niche products in a number of limited business areas for sale and distribution in global markets. 'Our aim is to achieve market leadership in all the niches where we operate,' he explains. The most lucrative activity is pharmaceuticals. In the first half of this year alone Kabi Pharmacia enjoyed an 11 per cent improvement in its operating income to SKr1.391bn and a 15 per cent boost in sales to SKr6.7bn. Its profits (after financial items) almost doubled to SKr4.197bn last year from SKr2.282bn in 1989. But Procordia's achievement in its food and beverage activities looks impressive, too. Operating income went up by 16 per cent to S K r 1 4 1 m for the first six months in its food division and sales rose by 1 per cent to SKr2.739bn. Sweden's hot summer boosted the company's beer, water and soft drink sales by 6 per cent to SKr2.227bn in the first half of the year, while its operating income shot up by 35 per cent to SKr145m. The only troubled business area is biotechnology, where operating income dropped to only SKr42m in the first six months from SKr66m for the same period of 1991 and sales also stagnated at SKr908m, down from SKr918m. Over the past eight years, Procordia has gone through considerable structural change. 'In that time we have sold off around 100 companies and acquired up to 50 in health care and consumer products,' explains Mr Ekberg. The pace has not lessened much in 1992 either. This September Procordia purchased for SKr1.37bn Swedish Match, the world's largest manufacturer of matches and disposable cigarette lighters from an international consortium led by Citicorp Venture Capital. At the same time, divestments have continued. The company sold off its sugar production facilities to Danisco, the Danish group and its 7 per cent stake in Freia Marabou, the chocolate company, for NKr450m. Procordia's long-term aim is to concentrate ever more on pharmaceuticals and food. Mr Ekberg stresses the connections between the two core business areas as he sees the distinction between people as patients and consumers breaking down. In future the sick will be able to exercise more personal choice than now in acquiring health care products while at the same time more emphasis will go into making foods of higher nutritional value. At present, Procordia has little name recognition outside the Nordic region. But this looks set to change during the 1990s. As the company grows apace in an integrated European market, it should be able to establish a clear sense of identity elsewhere alongside other blue-chip Swedish companies such as Volvo, Electrolux and Ericsson, which have already done so many years ago.</p>

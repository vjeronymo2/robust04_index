			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Galina Kovalskaya: "Behind a Line a Stone's </F> Throw From Home"]    [Text] I remember these trailers. Typical temporary  trailers made of planks, void of conveniences--God knows how  many people stuck inside... It seemed to me then that unless the  refugee problem were resolved in the immediate future, a quick  explosion would be unavoidable--you cannot live that way.    Now that a year has passed, the number of temporary trailers  has multiplied. There are 11 refugee settlements in Nazran  alone, with 100 families in each. You can live months with the  most loving relatives, the most cordial and hospitable hosts,  but not for a year and a half--with a mob of kids (the way the  Ingush see it, a four-child family is a small family) and other  people hanging on.    And all those who have not yet moved into a temporary  trailer  look into your eyes ingratiatingly when they run into you: "Will  you be meeting with our leadership? Could you not help me  out--to speed up the time I have to wait in line for a trailer?"  While the settlements grow one by one--enclosed areas densely  covered with trailers and two or three wooden outhouses.  <H5>  Crowded and Pinched </H5>   Gas and electricity lines have been laid to the settlements.  Now and then the light goes out due to overloads--heating  devices are hooked up everywhere and some people have obtained  old television sets from relatives, though the power supply is  intended only to energize room light bulbs...    There is yet another stinging refugee problem--sickness. Due  to the terrible population density, lack of normal hygiene  conditions, and simply the moral and physical shock of a year  and a half ago, epidemics flare up and spread rapidly in the  refugee camps. The shortage of medicines is felt more acutely in  this republic than on the whole across Russia. Medical  institutions designed to treat a certain number of patients are  located in areas where the population has almost doubled since  November 1992.    The settlements are attached to nourishment facilities which  provide food free of charge once per day. The rest comes from  what relatives dish out--one is not going to live it up on the  Russian allowance of R1,800 per month. There are also  "children's" allowances and unemployment compensation. Without  any doubt, there is not enough money to live on. And only a  certain few specialists manage to find work in Ingushetia.    It is not only the residents of Prigorodnyy Rayon that the  war has doomed to unemployment. From a time long ago, ever since  they returned from Kazakhstan, it was so ordered that the  residents of Nazran and the large and small villages would  travel to work every day in Vladikavkaz, the capital of Northern  Ossetia (the Ingush prefer to use the Soviet name Ordzhonikidze,  but most often simply call it the city), or--which was  considered less prestigious--to the Chechen city of Groznyy.    Today there is no work in Groznyy even for its own  residents,  and the Ingush are prohibited from going to Vladikavkaz. It  turns out that the newly formed republic has collected tens of  thousands of active, able-bodied people without normal living  quarters, without the means of existence, without prospects to  quickly find work.    The bulk of the refugees are rural people who have become  accustomed to their own gardens and orchards, their own  livestock, their own housekeeping. Tens of thousands of people  who day after day without exception fed livestock, milked,  plowed, sowed, fished, and gathered the harvest--for a year and  a half now have been lying about with nothing to do, half  starving for days on end.  <H5>  Just a Stone's Throw From Home </H5>   Human beings become accustomed to everything. No matter how  many refugees there are in this unfortunate country, adaptations  and accommodations are made. For these people deported from  Vladikavkaz and Prigorodnyy Rayon, however, their own homes are  just a few dozen kilometers from their present location. You  could get into the car of any relative. No need to load any  things--you left with just what you had on you, and you would be  home in half an hour.    There, at home, war has not been seen for a year and a half.  Your garden sits there unsown. Your neighbors have your cow, if  it is still alive, and they would probably return it to you. How  do you resign yourself to the fact that situated between you and  your own home is the Russian Army? How do you tell yourself that  you will go home no more and might as well get settled in your  new location, where no one needs you?    The Ingush is accustomed to putting everything into his  home.  About 30 percent of the adult male Ingush population have  engaged in so-called "moonlighting." In Vladikavkaz, in Groznyy,  and in Russia, the Ingush have been hired to perform the most  menial daytime labor. But at least they received decent pay for  it, at least they had the opportunity to build themselves a  house. Without his own home, a man is not a man. It is not  befitting for him to marry, let alone start a family.    The most important thing sustaining the Ingush Republic  today, the thing that is on everyone's lips--from politicians to  kolkhoz workers, from refugees to inhabitants as local as can  be--is the return of those deported. A change has taken place in  the overall national concept. Whereas before, the main idea  uniting the Ingush was the return of Prigorodnyy Rayon, today  the main thing is the return of the refugees.    It is not that the Ingush are prepared to reconcile  themselves to the fact that Prigorodnyy will remain within  Northern Ossetia. It is simply that this question has been  shifted to the background for the time being as compared with  that of the deportees. This is without any doubt due to the  personal efforts of President Ruslan Aushev, who declared that  over the period of moratorium with respect to territorial  redistribution declared by Russia (until the end of 1995),  Ingushetia would not raise the issue of Prigorodnyy Rayon.  <H5>  The Other Side of the Terek </H5>   Any modern political figure would envy Aushev's prestige in  the republic. In the year of his presidency he has been able to  accomplish what until quite recently was considered  impossible--to announce the rejection of any claim to the right  bank of Vladikavkaz and demonstrably lay the foundation of a new  future for the capital of Ingushetia.    The history of the right bank issue is as follows. In 1924,  when the Ingush Autonomous Oblast emerged, Vladikavkaz became  the dual capital of Ossetia and Ingushetia. In 1934, the Ingush  Autonomous Oblast was merged with the Chechen Autonomous Oblast,  Groznyy was declared the capital of Checheno-Ingushetia, and  Vladikavkaz (then Ordzhonikidze) was given to Ossetia.    When in 1991 the Law on Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples  was issued with its famous Article 6 providing for territorial  recovery, the Ingush declared that the repression of their  people began not in 1944, the year of deportation, but in 1934.  The inference drawn here was that the Ingush Republic should be  restored to its 1924-1934 borders, i.e., that half of  Vladikavkaz be ceded to the Ingush.    This concept was very quickly assimilated by the Ingush  masses--the point being that the Ingush did not simply lack  their own capital, they virtually lacked a city of their own.  Nazran is essentially a city-type settlement. It has no  institutions of higher education, no scientific research  institutes, no major enterprises. A tremendous part of the  Ingush people was associated with Vladikavkaz, where they went  to earn a living and to market far more frequently than to  Groznyy.    It would be difficult to imagine the future republic without  this city. It is precisely for this reason that people  stubbornly refused to hear the voice of a few Ingush politicians  with common sense who tried to warn that an undertaking with  Vladikavkaz was pure adventurism which could only impede efforts  to get back Prigorodnyy Rayon.    And so it came about that Ingush representatives failed to  approve, and thereby prevented, signing of the edict already  drawn up on the reassignment of jurisdiction of Prigorodnyy  Rayon only because this left the whole of Vladikavkaz within  Northern Ossetia. In addition, they did not build a capital of  their own out of useless expectations of getting Vladikavkaz.  They did not work to create republic industry, a system of  education, public health care, or an infrastructure.  <H5>  Ruslan and His Team </H5>   In addition to everything else, Aushev's decision marked a  transition to real state structuring. Aushev knew what he was  doing when he moved toward the universal presidential elections.  One year ago his only capital in Ingushetia was popular  recognition and trust. His main ties and contacts remained in  Russia.    Relying on this trust, he has today been able to create a  political structure comprised of people loyal to him, a  structure fairly strong on the local scale. The key positions in  Ingushetia are occupied by pro-Aushev Afghanistan war  veterans--people whose reliability the president need not doubt  and with whom he can truly effect teamwork. The clearest example  of this--though far from the only one--is that of Vice President  Boris Agapov, not even Ingush in nationality but Aushev's fellow  comrade in the military.    The rapid movement along the path of turning the Ingush  Republic from myth into reality led to an almost equally rapid  movement of previous national leaders now living and working in  Groznyy to the periphery of political life. Groznyy is today an  ever more alien center, the capital of a different republic, and  the Ingush intelligentsia of Groznyy have correspondingly less  and less influence on the public opinion of the Nazran Ingush.    According to the Ingush Constitution, all heads of  administration, from top to bottom, rayon to village, are  appointed by the president. Here too Aushev has been actively  replacing leaders, preferring to appoint people who are at least  "his own"--tested and reliable, if not from among local  residents.    It cannot be said that replacement of the entire political  and economic elite has been effected without any pain. Protests,  complaints, and petitions requesting that the former leader be  restored have assumed such a large scale that Aushev was forced  to respond to them with the military straightforwardness that is  characteristic of him. He issued a special edict warning of  accountability for attempts to intercede on behalf of "notorious  criminals."  <H5>  The Hotel and OMON </H5>   All the same, neither the decision on Vladikavkaz nor the  landslide flow of resignations has managed yet to temper the  people's love for the president. He and his team remain  completely effective. Changes made over the past year are even  evident to the eye. Eternally dirty, ragged Nazran has quietly  become cleaner and tidier, especially in its center.    For the first time in the entire history of the Ingush, a  hotel has appeared. This is no trifling matter, but rather a  significant political act. Up until now, officials visiting the  Ingush Republic were forced to stay over in Vladikavkaz. It is  even more significant that state structures have begun buying up  weapons from the populace.    It is in fact a buy-up that is taking place and not a  confiscation--which would be entirely unrealistic. In other  words, actual efforts as stipulated by agreement with Northern  Ossetia with respect to disarmament and disbandment of unlawful  armed formations are underway.    In addition, Aushev has managed to reduce criminal tension  in  the republic. It is being done with difficulty, in a far from  faultless process at present, but the activity of OMON [Special  Missions Militia Detachment], the police, and the courts is  being set on track. In this sense, the absence of roots in local  tradition by the Aushev team works for the good.    A state of emergency was maintained in the village of  Troitskaya and OMON detachments stationed here by presidential  edict for half a year. The OMON people are now gone, and the  order which was restored is still generally present.    Troitskaya is that very village from which the mass exodus  of  Russians began following the sadly well known pogrom of the  spring of 1991. At the outset of 1991, 90 percent of the village  population was Russian (mainly the descendants of Terek  Cossacks). Today 11 percent of the populace is Russian. I  travelled to Troitskaya immediately following the pogrom and  again last year, and I can attest that local authorities not  only did not force the Russians out--they tried in every way  possible to halt their departure.    But people continued to leave, frightened by the growth of  banditry and crime against which they found themselves  defenseless. (The Ingush also suffered from the ineffectiveness  of law enforcement organs, but they very quickly engaged a  system of familial and clan self-defense, while the Russians  simply found themselves victimized by the hooligan lawlessness.)    Now that protection is at least in some way restored, it  would seem that there is no longer any reason to leave. However,  the change in demographic interrelationship has already been so  strong that in itself it seems to provoke resettlement. People  accustomed all their lives to living in one cultural milieu  found themselves in an entirely different world literally in the  space of two years.    Although relations with neighbors are good, as a rule, many  of those who remain talk about the fact that they would like to  move to where their relatives are. To the credit of the Aushev  team on the highest and on local levels, leaderships understand  full well that any and all measures must be taken to preserve  the Russian community.    First of all, all political speculation regarding oppression  by Russians is undesirable for Ingushetia in its present  state--after all, it is to the Russian authorities that the  Aushev leadership is looking to obtain measures on refugee  resettlement, and in the long term--measures to effect the  rejurisdiction of Prigorodnyy Rayon.    Secondly, there is simply the existence of national  specialization. Who is going to work on a pig farm without  Russians? Indeed, like doctors and teachers, Russian  agricultural specialists are presently irreplaceable.    In order to sustain the Russian community, it is necessary  to  augment it. Serious negotiations are underway and a delegation  is being sent to Krasnodar Kray, to those who recently  resettled. Aushev is proposing certain benefits for "returnees."  At present just a few people have returned to Troitskaya--13  families in all. But the process is in fact underway.    Of course, the refugee problem remains one of the main  obstacles on this path. Conversation arises now and again: "Why  must we go around persuading departed Russians to return when we  have 60,000 people we do not know what to do with?" But official  ideology and the mood of society are oriented on the idea that  the refugees must be settled back to their origins immediately.  <H5>  Attacks Coming Not From Neighbors, but From Bandits </H5>   To what degree are these hopes realistic? The Ossetian  leadership is trying in every possible way to impede the return  of Ingush refugees. However, some have returned in defiance of  threats and prohibitions.    Those with whom we managed to speak explain that their  arrival has not elicited any "spontaneous protest" on the part  of neighboring Ossetians. The danger confronting the Ingush  comes from quite a different direction--at night, at any moment,  armed people in speckled uniforms may appear (who knows whether  they are OMON or Ossetian, the Guard--now renamed the  Directorate for Defense of Economic Facilities, or simply  bandits?) and begin firing at windows, setting fires, and  raiding.    Russian forces, of which there are 30,000 in the state of  emergency zone, are in no position to protect residents from the  bandits. In the view of the Ingush, they appear to manifest a  rare helplessness.    According to prescribed procedures, Ingush refugees who want  to take a look at their home or take something from among their  things which has miraculously remained intact must provide a  statement of their intent beforehand, wait in line, and then  move to the village in question in organized column formation,  accompanied by Russian military personnel.    But often the column is attacked and forced to return,  sometimes assaulted and pelted with rocks. Under these  conditions, soldiers not only fail to fire warning shots into  the air--they also do not use gas, water, or whatever is  available to put a halt to the hooliganism.    So what are the Ingush counting on, since the Russian  protective force is not working, or at least is not working in  their favor? From all appearances they are counting on a change  in the aims and sentiment of Russian leaders--from  "pro-Ossetian" to "pro-Ingush."    Judging from the recent session of the Federation Council,  certain shifts are taking place in this direction, although not  as rapidly as Aushev would like. The drama lies in the fact that  the refugees must at least begin to resettle immediately.</p>

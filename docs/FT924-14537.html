			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nations agree to try to limit rubber supply THE world's key rubber producers have agreed to draw up plans to co-ordinate their production and marketing strategies to beat weak prices, but Malaysia said the move will not amount to a producer cartel, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. The Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (ANRPC), whose members account for over 80 per cent of world output, said at the end of a two-day meeting in Malaysia that it has set up a committee to formulate the plans. It said the move would help bring about a supply and demand balance which 'would favour remunerative prices for rubber'. Senior Malaysian officials said the measure would not amount to a production cartel or production quotas. 'It is merely aimed at maintaining a balance between supply and demand. It will help avoid an excess supply,' one said. Rubber prices have been declining steadily for the past three years, falling to their lowest since 1986 in December. They have recovered only slightly since. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told the meeting on Tuesday that the present trend is towards a supply glut due to the slowdown in industrial activity in Western countries as well as higher Asian and African output. The London-based International Rubber Study Group has forecast a rubber surplus of 150,000 tonnes in 1992, down from a 180,000 tonne surplus in 1991, Mr Lim said, though this could be even higher because OECD growth prospects have been downgraded.</p>

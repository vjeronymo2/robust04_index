			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (4): Smaller venues work better - Christopher Price finds that conferences provide a safety net While discounted room rates and empty beds have become the norm during one of the industry's worst downturns, conferences have emerged as a vital part of many hotels' financial well-being. As a result, many hotels are expanding their facilities and increasing investment in an attempt to win a bigger market share. The importance of the conference business should not be underestimated. For a primary business centre hotel, industry estimates put earnings from conference business at between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of total revenues. (Those in the industry stress that these revenues are additional and do not displace other sources of income.) They are particularly important out of season, and one of the main developments has been in the type of venues required. 'Meetings used to be held in very large venues in big gateway centres,' says Ms Cam Cooper, vice-president of conference sales at Holiday Inns. 'Now the trend is towards regional and secondary market meetings.' Mr Rik Danielson, managing director of sales and marketing at Forte, says the demand for conferences - and for a wider variation in venues - is partly the result of advances in information technology. 'Training and information conferences have become the important way to re-tool for the 1990s.' While demand has, in the words of one hotel company executive, been 'solid' during the recession, there are signs that the recovery will give the conference trade a further boost. Meridien Hotels, the French-owned international group, reports a doubling of conference inquiries in the past year, and a similar rise in converted bookings. Two-thirds of the confirmations are in Europe. Mr Danielson believes this is also because conference organisers put more emphasis on quality than on getting reduced prices. In a recent poll of organisers conducted in the US, the most important requirements from hotels were also the most basic: good-sized well-fitted meeting rooms, basic materials such as projectors and stationery, and efficient service. The package price was well down the list. Not surprisingly, hotels are concentrating their efforts on improving their service, while at the same time trying to keep ahead of the opposition. All the big international hotel chains have moved to coordinate their conference business. For example, Holiday Inns has introduced its Conference Network system which aims to underline the group's consultancy role. Videoconferencing is one area being given much attention, as are more basic items such as en suite fax and video facilities in all meeting rooms. Incentive travel is another source of additional income allied to the conference business. Travellers are often participants in VIP packages and receive corresponding service. 'Consequently the hotels enjoy the revenue from banquets, gala dinners and special themed events taking place under their roof,' says Ms Sarah Webster, executive director of the UK-based Incentive Travel and Meetings Association, 'plus all the extras from room service'. However, there are some elements of concern in the industry. The number of venues offering meetings facilities has grown significantly and, despite reports of growing demand, some hoteliers privately tell an opposite story of intensifying competition and consumers beginning to shop around for the best deals. The growing trend to hold shorter meetings is undermining the lucrative accommodation spin-off. Running costs are also high, and there are worries that a rash of special package deals introduced by some of the large chains to fight off smaller more flexible - and cheaper - rivals, may become the norm.</p>

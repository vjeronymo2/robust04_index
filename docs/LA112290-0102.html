			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BITES  </P> <P> The following are capsule reviews of some of the better restaurants recently  visited by our critics:  </P> <P> Ristorante Fabrizio, tucked away in the corner of a shopping center, can give  you excellent food and dismal service. But when Fabrizio is around -- which is  often -- you're likely to find the same excellent dishes, plus attentive  service. Try the linguine Portofino or the sweetbreads Chez Maxim. 3731  Thousand Oaks Blvd., Westlake Village, (805) 496-9033. Lunch Tuesday-Friday  11:30 a.m.-2 p.m., dinner Tuesday-Thursday 6-9 p.m., Friday-Saturday 6-10 p.m.,  Sunday 5-9 p.m. Meal for two, food only, $25-$65.  </P> <P> The rumor is that Giovanni's is the best Italian restaurant from Los Angeles to  Camarillo. Giovanni's does an excellent job of living up to its reputation. The  classic, formal restaurant offers a menu ranging from simple, grilled-to-order  dinners to sophisticated, amazing dishes. There is the double-duty entree of  opah fish wrapped in red leaf cabbage with red peppercorns and saffron,  alongside a fine piece of cod covered with a lemony crab sauce. Lamb on greens  is a superb salad, with sweet pine nuts, white beans, warm goat cheese and a  perfect vinaigrette. 5227 Mission Oaks Blvd., Camarillo, (805) 484-4376. Lunch  is served Tuesday-Friday 11 a.m.-2:30 p.m. Dinner is served Tuesday-Sunday 5-10  p.m. Dinner for two, food only, $40-$75.  </P> <P> Middle America and its hearty food are alive and well at Doc'n Sandy's Cafe on  the edge of Saticoy. Doc's is an outstanding value, but be hungry. This is not  light fare. A hearty hot beef, open-faced sandwich leads the list, followed by  the beautifully flavored chicken-fried steak and the California omelet stuffed  with chili beans, onions, green peppers, salsa and cheese. 11033 Citrus Drive,  Saticoy, (805) 647-2619. Open for breakfast and lunch Monday-Friday 7 a.m.-1:45  p.m. Meal for two, $14-$20.  </P> <P> Looking like a small French eatery plunked down in a Western frontier town, the  Kitchen Cafe has a cross-cultural, cross-historical charm. It's only open for  continental breakfast and lunch, and the menu is petite. But it delivers to  downtown Ventura and the food is first-rate. Try the daily quiche, with its  outstanding crust, or the generous marinated tri-trip sandwich on a sesame seed  bun. Salads are appealing too. 34 N. Palm St., Ventura, (805) 641-9926. Lunch  is served Monday-Saturday 9 a.m.-4 p.m. Lunch for one, $6 to $10.  </P></p>

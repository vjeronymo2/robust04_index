			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maryam M. Shahin] </F>   [Text] Gaza City -- Every day hundreds of people gather  outside the headquarters of the Palestinian police force waiting  to meet with officials. Carrying papers and a request of some  sort, they seek to make their first contact with Palestinian  authorities, who they hope, will begin to solve some of their  problems.    But the Gaza police headquarters, with only 500 policemen at  its immediate disposal, is completely overworked.    "Our priorities are law and order, to clean up Gaza and to  help set the ground-work for a civic society," said the overall  commander of all military units in Gaza, Major General Nasir  Yusuf.    Meeting delegation after delegation of well-wishers and  people with complaints in his spartan office overlooking the  Mediterranean Gen. Nasir is visibly tired, keeping a  dawn-to-midnight office schedule.    The return to Palestine is much harsher than expected by  Gen.  Nasir and most other Palestinians here. The 500 policemen  stationed in Gaza and 3,500 other members of the Palestinian  National Security Forces (PNSF) as well as the two investigative  branches of the armed forces have not been paid in months.  Housing is extremely sparse and most of the policemen and PNSF  members are still being dined by Gazans' in on-going gestures of  welcome.    But Gen. Nasir comes straight to the point. "We have not  received sufficient promised equipment and aid from the donors,"  he said. According to Gen. Nasir almost none of the promised  aid with the exception of blue police-uniforms and some weapons  have reached the police force.    "The communications equipment, the cars, the office  furniture  have not materialised. I don't know how the donors expect us to  work," says Gen. Nasir with a tone of frustration.    A tour of several police stations showed that the furniture  has been donated by local Gazans. The sanitary conditions of  police and army bases left behind by Israel are "unacceptable"  and belied Israeli prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statement  promising to leave well-kept and well-equipped stations behind  for the Palestinians.    No furniture was left behind. Sewage systems are being  totally renewed, creating some work for Gazan plumbers.    Last week newspaper ads called on eligible Palestinians to  join the Palestinian police.    "We waited so far because we can't train people without some  equipment. So we want to start recruitment in the hope that the  needed equipment will arrive soon. The donors in Cairo and Oslo  signed papers but thus far have done very little follow-up  work," said Gen. Yusuf.    Palestinian policemen are being driven to their posts by the  PNSF members in their American-provided khaki coloured Chevrolet  jeeps.    Gaza, says Gen. Nasir, needs some 3,000 policemen. The  "requirements" listed in the local newspapers for a policeman is  that he be between 18 and 25 years of age, have a secondary  school certificate, be of two Palestinian parents, be of good  "national character" and agree to serve 12 years in the police  force.    Most of the serving policemen where either policemen during  Egyptian and later Israeli rule or men conscripted outside the  occupied territories specifically for police work.    Its purpose is to control traffic and deal with civic issues  and register and act on complaints about crime.    So far there has not been much crime, but at the police  headquarters in the southern part of the Strip in Khan Yunus,  eight men have already been arrested on charges ranging from  theft to rape. Four men each sit in cells which measure five  metres by five metres and the local police chief allows  journalists to take a peek to observe the clean conditions of he  cells. Photographs, however, are not allowed.    Prior to the arrival of the Palestinian police, crimes were  punished through the intervention of local notables or tribal  leaders or through retaliations, says Gen. Nasir. "Now people  come and report to us and we must act fast to show that we can  take control and make people feel secured by our presence."    But most of the work that Gaza policemen have to deal with  is  either traffic control or land complaints.    When not directing the rather chaotic traffic in Gazan towns  and refugee camps, policemen dutifully sit at their desks and  register land complaints.    Since the Israeli occupation began in 1967 land registration  stopped; 27 years later issues of inheritance and family feuds  over inheritance is by far the most prominent police-related  issue for many Gazans.    "These land issues are taking up a lot of our time. Soon a  judiciary will be in place to deal with them in a more concrete  form. We are being a bit overburdened by these issues because  we have very little power to make legal decisions of this kind  -- once these decisions are taken we can implement them," said  Gen. Yusuf.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- President Jiang Zemin  answered questions on China's domestic situation and important  international issues during an interview by NHK chief  commentator Hatsuhisa Takashima at Zhongnanhai this morning.    On China's position on the Korean nuclear issue, Jiang Zemin  said: We follow with great interest current events. We always  believe that sufficient patience is required to solve such  complex issues as the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.  The greater the difficulties, the more it is necessary to keep  calm. We appeal to all parties concerned to exercise restraint  and act prudently. In solving the problem, the ultimate  objectives should be to safeguard peace and stability on the  peninsula and to achieve denuclearization there. So long as we  do not deviate from these two basic objectives, there is always  the possibility of finding out a proper way to solve the  problem, no matter what temporary difficulties might happen.    We should see that the door of negotiations has not yet been  closed, and room to maneuver and the possibility of dialogue  still exist. All parties concerned should take active measures  to avoid intensifying the crisis, and not let the efforts made  by all parties over the last year and more be wasted. China  does not approve of sanctions. It is because sanctions do not  help the solution of the problem. On the contrary, they will  escalate the event and have consequences which none of the  parties is willing to see. I believe that only dialogue and  consultations are the effective way to solve the problem, as  well as the fundamental way out.    On Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang Zemin said: President Clinton  recently announced his decision to extend China's most favored  nation [MFN] status and to delink the human rights issue from  the MFN status in the days to come. The decision will help  China and the United States strengthen and expand economic  cooperation and trade, and it conforms to the fundamental  interests of the two countries and their peoples. I believe  that so long as both sides consider the future, the world  situation as a whole, and their fundamental interests, adhere to  the principles set in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques,  enhance trust, reduce trouble, develop cooperation, and avoid  confrontation, Sino-U.S. relations will develop smoothly and  healthily.    Jiang Zemin also expressed his views on Sino-Japanese  relations. He said: Despite several changes in Japan's  political scene, the friendly cooperation between China and  Japan in various fields is still progressing steadily. Japan's  various parties in the government and the public and the broad  masses of the Japanese people are of the same view in  strengthening and developing the good-neighborly, friendly, and  cooperative relations between China and Japan. Established on  the basis of extensive common interests and long historical and  cultural origins, as well as on a solid mass foundation, the  Sino-Japanese friendship is full of great vitality. A politician  should conform to the historical trend and do some solid deeds  for the development of bilateral relations. The 20th century is  coming to an end soon. There is a civilian organization between  China and Japan -- the 21st Century Committee for China- Japan  Friendship. It indicates that both Chinese and Japanese peoples  wish to bring Sino-Japanese relations characterized by mutual  understanding and trust, equality, cooperation, and common  prosperity into the 21st century, so the friendship between the  two countries will pass on from generation to generation. I am  fully confident in the future of Sino-Japanese relations.    When the reporter asked about China's stand on Japan's  becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council [UNSC],  Jiang Zemin said: We have noticed that Japan wishes to become a  permanent member of the UNSC and play a greater role in  international affairs. We understand and attach importance to  such a wish. China is in favor of expanding the size of UNSC  when the time is ripe to reflect the reality of the changing  international situation, and the increasing number of UN  members. We maintain, in the meantime, that the wealth of a  country should not be the sole condition taken into  consideration, and that the principle of fair regional  distribution, and the principle of unanimity in consultation  should be fully honored in approaching this issue. The reform  of the UNSC is presently at the preliminary stage, and opinions  should be solicited from the vast number of its members on  specific ways to carry out the reform.    Hatsuhisa Takashima is a senior commentator on international  issues in Japan and has interviewed numerous famous world  leaders. President Jiang Zemin met him once in November 1989.</p>

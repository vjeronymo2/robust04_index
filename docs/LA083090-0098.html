			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER LIFTS A GLASS OF STOUT TO FREED HOSTAGE  </P> <P> Freed hostage Brian Keenan had an emotional reunion Wednesday with his  69-year-old mother, who had her first drink in 11 years to toast his release.  </P> <P> Minnie Keenan was driven to Dublin from her home in Belfast to see her only  son, who is resting and undergoing medical tests at Mater Private Hospital.  </P> <P> The 39-year-old university lecturer was freed Friday after 4 1/2 years as a  hostage in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Mrs. Keenan laughed and joked with her son, who looked healthier than in recent  days as he sat on his hospital bed surrounded by cards and flowers from  well-wishers.  </P> <P> After the two-hour reunion, during which she sipped from a glass of Guinness  stout, she was too emotional to speak to reporters.  </P> <P> "She enjoyed meeting Brian so much and even had a glass of alcohol, her first  one in 11 years," said family friend Frank McCallam. "She has had a ball."  </P> <P> There are 13 Westerners still held hostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest  is Terry Anderson of the Associated Press. He was kidnaped March 16, 1985.  </P></p>

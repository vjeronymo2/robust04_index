			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Delay on E&amp;A scheme A SCHEME of arrangement between English &amp; American, the London market insurance company, and its creditors could take at least a year to negotiate, according to Mr Tony McMahon of KPMG Peat Marwick, the provisional liquidators. Mr McMahon said the company had been hit by a rise in 'attritional' claims on its marine book. Underwriters said last year that a rise in marine cargo claims had caused a downturn in the company's fortunes. More recently it has been forced to build up reserves against future marine liability claims. E&amp;A's other insurance businesses, which include a run-off and insurance management company, are unaffected by the developments. Meanwhile, provisional liquidators of Trinity Insurance, another UK company seeking to negotiate a scheme of arrangement, announced yesterday that the scheme had been sanctioned in the courts. Mr Richard Boys-Stones and Mr Colin Bird of Price Waterhouse have been appointed as scheme administrators.</p>

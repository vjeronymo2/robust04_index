			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The staff of the State Customs Committee released  the first currency control figures relating to the return of  proceeds from the export of Russian goods. In the last three  months the total volume of currency retained by exporting  organizations rather than handed over is $70 million. A total  of 40 organizations are among the guilty ones. But according to  observers, the volume of currency which has not been handed over  in detected cases may seem paltry compared with the amounts of  currency which simply disappear. One wonders whether the control  mechanisms introduced are effective.</p>

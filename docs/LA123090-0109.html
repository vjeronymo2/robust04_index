			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OUR READERS WROTE LETTERS THROUGHOUT 1990 EXPRESSING THEIR VIEWPOINTS ON A  VARIETY OF ISSUES. HERE ARE CONDENSED VERSIONS OF SOME OF THOSE LETTERS TO HELP  US REMEMBER THE EVENTS THAT MATTERED TO ORANGE COUNTY READERS THIS PAST YEAR.  WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE READERS WHO TOOK THE TIME TO SHARE THEIR VIEWPOINTS  AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THEM AND OTHERS IN 1991.;  </P> <P> ABORTION-RIGHTS MALE FELT SLIGHTED  </P> <P> Being a pro-choice advocate is not an easy job when you happen to be a male.  </P> <P> Recently, I attended another pro-choice rally, this time at a Fullerton clinic.  </P> <P> As I stood there with my buttons and sign, I listened to the women around me  talking to each other. The conversations were full of derogatory statements  about men. Now don't get me wrong, women are justified in having many ill  feelings about men for the oppressions they've suffered through the ages.  </P> <P> But I think the women in the pro-choice movement should try and be more aware  of the men who are standing side-by-side with them on this issue, not to  mention putting their bodies on the line for women's rights for reproductive  freedom.  </P> <P> I'm sure that most would agree that the pro-choice movement would attract more  men if men felt more welcome. Also, I'm sure that more men in the movement  would surely be a benefit.  </P> <P> GREGG A. RICHIE, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

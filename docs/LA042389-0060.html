			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL: 'GET IT DONE'  </P> <P> Dick Gregory said, "Hell hath no fury like a liberal scorned." Though still  honored by the media, liberals have not thrived lately in the West,  particularly in the U.S.  </P> <P> The liberal run amok is seen clearest in the orchestrated response to the  Patrick Purdy killings in Stockton. By a precarious margin, a bill was rammed  through the California Assembly banning "semiautomatic assault weapons."  Ignored in all the screaming was any realistic definition. Dictated by common  sense and protected by the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights, I keep by my  bed the service .45 I brought back from World War II. It's a semiautomatic  weapon. I do not plan to surrender it.  </P> <P> The irrationality of the clamor for anti-gun legislation is best demonstrated  by considering the drug problem, which threatens to bring the nation to its  knees. Dealing, use, or possession of drugs have long been felony offenses  carrying the harshest penalties and condemned at every level of society. Yet  all this legislation has hardly rippled the surface of the drug culture. We're  now considering draconian enforcement, including the use of the armed forces.  </P> <P> Conversely, American gun owners have historically been a majority in this  country, overwhelmingly law-abiding. Since the failure of British efforts to  confiscate the arms of American colonists before and during our Revolution,  this right has been embedded in our Constitution. Efforts to dislodge it are  unlikely to succeed.  </P> <P> Drug users and dealers are criminals. Very few gun owners are. Purdy was one of  them. Before his murderous rampage in Stockton, he'd been arrested seven times  on charges ranging from armed robbery, firearms and narcotics violations, to  sexual assault. His attorneys and the judicial system plea bargained his felony  offenses down to misdemeanors, leaving no felony record. Purdy should've been  in prison long before he slaughtered five children. It was not the lack of gun  laws that kept him free, or killed those kids.  </P> <P> Americans have forgotten the maxim, "If it is ain't broke, don't fix it."  Fixing things has become a national passion. Out of several billion Chilean  grapes, two grapes showed traces of cyanide, and fruit spray on apples seemed  to cause cancer in mice . . . or was it the other way around? When the smoke  cleared, the harvest of Chilean and American farmers was ruined by "fixing it."  </P> <P> Edmund Burke, one of the architects of democracy, observed how ready men are to  substitute emotion for reason "until past the time when reason can any longer  serve." With Chilean grapes, American apples and American guns, let's hope  reason can still serve.  </P> <P> CHARLTON HESTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

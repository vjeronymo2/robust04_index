			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report under the "Diplomacy" rubric: </F> "Russia Does Not Need any Authorization for Peacekeeping in CIS.  They Think in Moscow That the Operations Are Fully Legitimate"]    [Text] The UN headquarters has distributed as a UN General  Assembly and Security Council document a joint statement by the  Russian Federation Defense and Foreign Ministries saying that  Russia carries out peacekeeping operations in CIS countries  fully in accordance with the UN Charter and that it needs no  "authorization" from the community of nations or the CSCE to  carry them out. The document, the text says, is a response to  statements made by some politicians and publications in foreign  mass media regarding the "ambiguity" of the Russian Federation's  peacekeeping mission on the territory of countries that are part  of the CIS.    Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov commented on  the joint statement at the request of your SEGODNYA  correspondent. He said that Moscow has never raised the  question of legitimizing its peacekeeping operations on CIS  territory, but it has asked and is still asking the United  Nations for support. Financial considerations are not the least  important factor here: Russia has been contributing large sums  of money to finance peacekeeping forces, whereas its own  operations in the CIS have been seen by the international  community as something that does not fall under the definition  of "peacekeeping." We think, however, Sergey Lavrov continued,  that they are part of a general effort to ensure global  security. Russia believes that its peacekeeping activity is in  no way at odds with the UN Charter -- on the contrary, the  Charter encourages regional agreements to participate in the  settlement of conflicts. There are just different kinds of  operations, Mr. Lavrov explained. One of them is an operation  under a UN flag, authorized by the Security Council. In this  case the peacekeeping forces must be multilateral, and expenses  involved must be shared in accordance with the specified amounts  of contributions. Another type is an operation on the basis of  regional agreements, something that is taking place in Liberia.  The UN secretary general, the deputy foreign minister said,  fully shares this point of view and has no doubts as to the  Russian actions' legitimacy.</p>

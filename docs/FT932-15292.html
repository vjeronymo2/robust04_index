			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Sykes-Pickavant lower at Pounds 629,000 Sykes-Pickavant, the USM-quoted manufacturer of hand tools and diagnostic equipment, reported another downturn in 1992 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 629,000, compared with Pounds 731,000 previously and Pounds 1.19m for 1990. Turnover improved from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 18.7m, reflecting an increase in export sales and a full year's trading from Auto Service Products. After a lower tax charge, earnings per share were 6.23p (5.25p) but the final dividend is halved to 1.75p for a total of 4p (5.75p). There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 511,000, mainly related to writing off the investment in Motortest of Germany.</p>

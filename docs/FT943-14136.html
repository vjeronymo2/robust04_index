			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (11): Accentuating the positive - Tokyo has risen while other markets have fallen, and foreign investors have done particularly well. Is this the moment to put money into one of the new Japanese funds? Japan, in the second quarter of the year, was one of the few markets to buck the global decline. Fund managers overweight in Tokyo this year should have a nice story for their trustees, or at least some significant paper gains to set against losses on Wall Street, London and the main European markets. Sterling- and dollar-based investors in Japan were helped by the strong yen and continued buying by foreign investors. The Nikkei 225 index marked a two-year high in mid-June, and showed a total return in the quarter, as measured by the FT-Actuaries World indices, of almost 8 per cent in sterling terms, and some 50 per cent more for dollar-based investors. Given Japan's high weighting in the world equity index, reading Tokyo correctly has been a key factor for investment returns. But who got the weightings right? Most fund managers keep their investment decisions close to their chests, but if market gossip is anything to go by, end-June valuations should be good for Nikko Securities, the Dutch Robeco funds and Germany's Commerz International Capital Management. Commerz is believed to have doubled its Japanese exposure at the end of March. Against the negative total return globally for sterling investors in the quarter (minus 0.5 per cent ), assuming weighted averages across the FT world index, what should be the next move? The terrible twins of fear and greed continue to drive most markets, and fear is now in the ascendancy, not least because of chaos and confusion in global bond markets and the associated concern over higher interest rates, especially in the United States. Brave new investors in Japan need to leave fear behind, and concentrate instead on hope. The Nikkei has done well this year, especially for non-Japanese investors, and a number of new Japanese unit (and mutual) funds are about to be unleashed in both London and New York. But is Japan right for tapping? Even greater political uncertainty comes with the arrival of an untried socialist prime minister heading a coalition government which has, in effect, given many of the levers of power back to the long-ruling right-wing Liberal Democrats. The crucial trade talks with Washington are getting nowhere fast, and the yen is ever-rising. On the surface, this is not a good investment scenario. But there are targets to aim at. The higher yen hits exports, but almost certainly it will be an excuse for Japanese companies to become even more efficient, to trim paternalistic work practices and to shed surplus labour. The OECD's latest projection of economic growth sees real GDP output in Japan rising sharply in 1995. Another target is the Nikkei index itself. It has been fair weather so far this year, but the end-June close of 20,600 is still little more than half its high of 1989. Some optimistic Tokyo market-watchers think that, over time, markets, like water, reach their own level; and that, in the long haul, why should Japan, coming out of recession and with some encouraging corporate profit forecasts, buck this trend? For non-Japanese holders, the currency factor is also an important consideration. A significant factor could be the non-Japanese investment overhang. A number of American and (even more) European funds got into Tokyo at the top of the market, and many are waiting to cash in at original investment levels, given that the earnings yield is negligible. But other funds switched to Japan earlier this year, and are in for the long haul and for the market (and economic) recovery. As long as the Japanese currency remains strong, they are likely to maintain global weightings in Tokyo. Japan is certainly not without risk, but a strong combination of domestic deregulation and a heavy Yen could transform the Japanese economy. The Nikkei seems to have a floor at around the 20,000 level, but the upside could be significant in the medium term.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (14): Risen from the ashes - Case study, Leyland Trucks defies the recession When Dutch commercial vehicle maker DAF collapsed at the beginning of this year, receivers in both the Netherlands and the UK found themselves picking up a bewildering array of pieces. But their underlying resolve, to find solutions which would keep as much as possible of the business as going concerns, paid off. The group has been split up, with several different owners and substantial refinancing. But workforces have been retained - though they are much shrunken - and trucks are continuing to come from assembly lines in Holland, Belgium and Leyland, Lancashire, with vans still being made at Washwood Heath, near Birmingham. It nevertheless took several months to pull together the management buy-out led by Mr John Gilchrist at the Leyland truck manufacturing plant, once the headquarters of UK state-owned Leyland Vehicles which DAF effectively took over in 1987. That potential backers were not falling over themselves to come forward is not surprising, for what is now Leyland Trucks Manufacturing is operating in markets which have been undergoing one of their most savage recessions since the second world war. In some Continental regions, its end is still nowhere in sight. In leading the buy-out, Mr Gilchrist, who had been managing director of Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of the collapsed group, finally found backing in the form of Pounds 5m of equity funding from Barclays Development Capital, with working capital finance provided by National Westminster Bank in a total package estimated at some Pounds 40m, although the total has never been formally disclosed. By the time a deal was concluded with the receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, of accountants Arthur Andersen, Leyland's workforce had been slashed from 2,200 to 700. But a structure was also emerging from the ashes of the old group, which has provided Leyland Trucks Manufacturing with a 'captive' customer, while also allowing it to pursue other possibilities for manufacturing vehicles for other truck companies. The 'captive' customer is DAF Trucks NV, formed in March with Pounds 370m in equity and loan backing from the Dutch and Flemish regional governments, banks and institutional investors, and which effectively represents a resurrection of the Dutch and Belgian truck manufacturing and distribution operations. Mr Gilchrist's company has signed a long-term contract, under which Leyland's truck output will continue to be sold through 'new' DAF's continental outlets. As part of what Mr McKillop describes as the biggest and most complex manufacturing receivership in the UK since the collapse of Rolls-Royce in the early 1970s, the rescued Dutch company also reached agreement with the UK receivers to acquire Leyland DAF Trucks, the 'old' DAF's former UK marketing and sales arm in Thame, Oxfordshire. Thus the Leyland company is also selling to a Dutch group back in control of the UK dealer network, and so providing the key market for the 45 series light trucks and some heavier models produced at Leyland. The Leyland MBO was also made possible in part by the entire 230-acre site being acquired from the receivers by Lancashire Enterprises, the development arm of Lancashire county council, for development as a business and technology park - thus cutting costs for LTM, which is merely leasing the site of the assembly plant. Apart from the slashed workforce, far-reaching reforms in working practices agreed with those who have kept their jobs, and a pay freeze agreed until the end of next year, the receivership has freed Mr Gilchrist and his colleagues from the debt burdens and restructuring and rationalisation costs, which did so much to drag down the Dutch group. Indeed, Mr Gilchrist maintains that Leyland is now a lower cost plant per vehicle than any rival. Six months after LTM's renaissance, the UK truck market is recovering sharply. Sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes were up 14.4 per cent in the first 10 months of the year, and Leyland DAF is once more closing the gap to market leader Iveco Ford. Mr Gilchrist has forecast a turnover of Pounds 140m and an output of about 8,000 trucks annually from 1995, and asserts that the company will be shown to be profitable when the results for the financial year to the coming December 31 are disclosed. Mr Gilchrist's backers - he refuses to discuss the company's shareholding structure - still have some time to wait before the true strength of the company's renaissance can be judged. It is, for example, lacking the normally lucrative revenue stream which a manufacturer can expect from the sale of parts. It derives only a royalty income from them, the parts distribution company having been the subject of a wholly separate management buy-in. In the long term, substantial investments will be required in new products - one of the key factors which brought the old DAF group to its knees. Mr Gilchrist is undeterred: 'Challenging market circumstances overwhelmed our former parent company. But they have created here one of the leanest manufacturing operations in the European automotive industry.'</p>

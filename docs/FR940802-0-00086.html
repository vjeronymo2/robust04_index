			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments questioned the definition of ``Reasonable Rent'' as contained in the rule. As a substitute for rental payment, it was proposed that officers provide specific services equal to the value of the unit. This is not the intent of the rule. Reasonable rent may be a flat amount not related to an officer's income, but it must be consistent with the limited loss of income requirements of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the terminology used in the proposed rule was that the rule implemented a ``waiver'' of the eligibility requirements. This rule implements a statutory waiver, but the term used is ``exemption'' from the eligibility requirements, in order to avoid administrative problems that may result because the Department follows additional processing requirements for actions, also called ``waivers,'' that suspend non-statutory requirements on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that the rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule is limited to exempting from the public and Indian housing admissibility criteria for certain police and security personnel. By its terms, the rule limits the number of units that would be subject to such exemptions, thereby limiting the economic impact on all PHAs and IHAs, including any that may be small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made on the proposed rule in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50 which implements Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332. That Finding is available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Since the environmental provisions of this final rule are unchanged from those published in the proposed rule, the original Finding of No Significant Impact is still valid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612, Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the order. The rule will effect a minor exception to a previously existing scheme of federal assistance to programs run by state and local government, but it will not alter the existing division of responsibility among federal, state and local governments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12606, the Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606, The Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and thus the rule is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Agenda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was listed as sequence number 1702 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20473) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 24 CFR Part 905  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aged, Grant programs_Indians, Grant programs_housing and community development, Handicapped, Indians, Loan programs_housing and community development, Loan programs_Indians, Low and moderate income housing, Public housing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 24 CFR Part 960  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aged, Grant programs_housing and community development, Handicapped, Public housing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Department amends 24 CFR parts 905 and 960 as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 905_INDIAN HOUSING PROGRAMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

The Department's objective in granting the exemption allowed by this section is to permit long term residence in Indian housing developments by police officers and security personnel, whose visible presence is expected to serve as a deterrent to criminal activity in and around Indian housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of this section:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 2 BLACK BANDS GET INVITATION  </P> <P> Amid NFL lobbying to include more minorities in Super Bowl-related events,  marching bands from two predominantly black colleges have been invited to be in  this city's annual Gasparilla parade.  </P> <P> Band directors from both Florida A&amp;M and Bethune Cookman said plans weren't  final but they were excited about the possibility of playing for a national  audience.  </P> <P> "We are very much interested," said Harold Bray, director of the Bethune  Cookman marching band.  </P> <P> If the two groups reach an agreement with the task force, it might be the first  time any predominantly black group will march in the traditional parade, which  was rescheduled for the day before Super Bowl XXV in January.  </P></p>

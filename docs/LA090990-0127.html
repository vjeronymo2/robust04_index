			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEN'S FALL FASHION;  </P> <P> REVOLUTION IN COLOR  </P> <P> WHILE NEW women's styles regularly burst onto the fashion scene, swinging from  neon miniskirts to leopard-look full-lengths in the blink of a season, men's  fashions have a tendency to plod. Year after year, blues, dark greens, browns  and grays pass down the runways in a predictable blur. Those moments when  designers have taken a risk -- pink polo shirts, colorful ties, wild socks,  sport shoes with suits -- are rarely earthshaking.  </P> <P> Until this season. Get out your sunglasses and all your fashion courage,  because there's a menswear revolution brewing. For fall, designers are offering  patterns and ensembles that have one thing in common -- adventure.  </P> <P> Start with color -- bold, mixable color. Shades of turquoise, purple, orange,  red and yellow are guaranteed to turn even the most classically shaped jackets,  suits, pants, sweaters and shirts into shocking and innovative fashion  statements.  </P> <P> Traditional stripes, florals and plaids are thrown about fearlessly, and the  old rules of pattern mixing are forgotten, replaced with a sense of humor and  experimentation. Painterly prints in broad color spectrums are the most modern  choices, gracing shirts of velvet, silk, rayon and cotton knits.  </P> <P> This revolution comes complete with that key fashion ingredient, accessories. A  chain belt around an otherwise classic tuxedo makes a play on Chanel; an  embellished vest glimmers beneath a traditional suit; fancy necklines offer  quirky alternatives to ties; special buttons, textural trims and unique pocket  treatments give jackets and pants that extra oomph.  </P> <P> If you're not quite ready to take the plunge and restock your wardrobe,  colorful ties, socks, belts, watches and glasses can offer a hint of audacity  -- a bold start for a beginning sartorial risk taker.  </P> <P> Many men will be delighted at the absence of rules; others will be terrified.  And an unsuspecting few will find themselves suddenly on the cutting edge: The  golfer in his bright green pants and orange shirt or the tourist in his  flower-print shirts and plaid shorts just may have the most fashionable looks  going.  </P> <P> Stylist: Jill Sokolec / Celestine / L.

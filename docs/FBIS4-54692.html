			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 3 May (TANJUG) -- President of the  republic of Srpska Radovan Karadzic said in Pale today that the  Serbian side had offered a truce in the Brcko region and added  the truce would be implemented unilaterally, even if the Muslims  did not accept it. Karadzic held over three hours of talks in  Pale with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special  envoy, and after the talks expressed satisfaction with the  outcome.    "This is a very good example of cooperation, for we achieved  significant progress at the talks today. Primarily, we cleared  some problematic aspects of the situation in Sarajevo, Gorazde,  and Brcko," Karadzic told reporters. "We offered the Muslim  side a truce in the Brcko area, and if they do not accept, it we  shall implement it unilaterally. If the Muslims agree to the  deployment of military observers on both sides in the Brcko  region, it will be a good example of a preventative action aimed  at ending the crisis," Karadzic said.    Yasushi Akashi said they agreed to continue work on the  stabilization of the overall situation, in particular in  Gorazde, in accordance with an agreement reached in Belgrade.    "We also discussed the events around Tuzla and Brcko, where  some military movements have been registered," Akashi said.</p>

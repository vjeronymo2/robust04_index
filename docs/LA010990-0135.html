			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NBA;  </P> <P> IN CHARLOTTE, REALITY HAS SET IN -- HORNET FANS NOW WANT WINS  </P> <P> The honeymoon would appear to be over.  </P> <P> They still sell out every game at the Charlotte Coliseum, where the Hornets  drew the second-most fans in NBA history last season, and long ago proved that  concerns of this being strictly college basketball country were unfounded.  </P> <P> But in the second season, people now want wins, not just the novelty of the NBA  in their city.  </P> <P> In other words, the fans have gotten sophisticated.  </P> <P> "Last year was fantastic," Carl Scheer, the Hornets' president and general  manager, said Monday. "They were so for anything we did. They cheered  out-of-bounds plays. But it was so unrealistic."  </P> <P> Right. Kelly Tripucka, one of the most popular Hornets a year ago but in a  shooting slump now, recently went to the grocery store and got booed by a fan.  Tripucka has been hearing that, multiplied, at games.  </P> <P> "Nobody feels worse about it than us," Tripucka said. "All of the boo birds and  knuckleheads go home feeling disappointed about the way we played, but they  won't feel anymore disappointed than us."  </P> <P> The Hornets, who will play host to the Clippers tonight, come into the game  with seven wins and in sixth place in the Midwest Division. Last season at this  point, they had nine victories, a minor difference that couldn't account for  any cooling trend by the paying customers.  </P> <P> "I don't know if it's that the novelty has warn off," Scheer said. "Our fans  are every bit as passionate as before."  </P> <P> But something is different.  </P> <P> "They are more critical," he said. "The expectations are much higher because  they got a dose of success last season. Maybe I'd like them to be a little more  patient, and the players and coaches would, too. But nothing has surprised me."  </P> <P> Has the change surprised players, though?  </P> <P> "It may have," Scheer said. "Kelly certainly. I think it took him back. But his  ego is really on the fringe."  </P> <P> The Hornets gave up Mike Brown, acquired in the expansion draft, to get  Tripucka from the Utah Jazz, and he responded by averaging 22.6 points, second  best in his eight-year career.  </P> <P> The boos he has been hearing this season serve as the most dramatic indication  of the changing climate. Tripucka had been hearing scattered boos for a while  when he was benched for the first time in his Charlotte career Dec. 28. But  after getting a season-high 25 points, including 14 of the Hornets' 18 points  in the fourth quarter of that game against Cleveland, it was cheers.  </P> <P> He was asked to come to center court for a postgame radio show that is also  broadcast in the arena on the public-address system, and at first refused.  Tripucka finally consented, then broke down from the frustration, and cried on  the air.  </P> <P> "This has been very difficult for me," he said, choking out the words during  the broadcast. "You people have a right to boo us, but don't ever accuse us  players, or myself, of not trying to bust our butts. Some nights we deserve to  be booed, but this is going to take time.  </P> <P> "When I came here last year, I thought it was the greatest thing that ever  happened to me. I wanted to end my career here. Now, I have to go home and  think about it."  </P> <P> Tripucka then got up and left the court.  </P> <P> Take that, you knuckleheads.  </P> <P> General Manager Ray Patterson has given his vote of confidence, but rumors  persist that Houston's Don Chaney will be the next coach fired, with Tom  Nissalke, a former coach and now a television analyst for the Rockets, coming  back.  </P> <P> "What we've been going through is not a reflection on Don," Patterson said.  </P> <P> Indeed, the Rockets have labored with a backcourt firing blanks, which allows  defenses to pack in on center Akeem Olajuwon. Mitchell Wiggins, who is expected  to miss another two weeks with a sprained knee ligament, is the only guard  shooting better than 50%.  </P> <P> Something has to give, though. Should any team with Olajuwon have gone 3-12 in  December, the second-worst record for the month, behind only the 2-13 by  expansion Orlando?  </P> <P> The New York Knicks will retire Dick Barnett's jersey, No. 12, during  ceremonies March 10. He is the last member of the 1969-70 championship team to  be so honored.  </P> <P> "I was beginning to wonder," he said.  </P> <P> Most-ly recovered: Announcer Johnny Most, who is to the Celtics what Chick  Hearn is to the Lakers, made his first appearance of the season on Wednesday  after triple-bypass surgery and was greeted by a standing ovation at Boston  Garden.  </P> <P> The Boston Herald said that Most sounded weak, but had "a touch of that  old-time fire at the enemy" that has helped make the 38-year, gravel-voiced  broadcaster famous.  </P> <P> Just a touch?  </P> <P> Most said that Washington's Ledell Eackles threw "his first pass since last  December" and that Mel Turpin of the Bullets looked "like a big tub of lard"  and "committed about 14 personal fouls, but they only called four."  </P> <P> That about answered any questions as to whether heart surgery would change his  approach.  </P> <P> "I feel great," he said. "I'm like a kid with a new toy. When I walked in here  tonight, I thought the Garden is the most beautiful building in the world."  </P> <P> Never mind the heart. Better check those eyes.  </P> <P> The surprise selection of Dick Motta as Sacramento coach rekindled an old  story, back from when he was at Dallas and a reporter accused him of hating  every Maverick except Brad Davis.  </P> <P> "What are you talking about?" Motta shot back. "I don't like Brad Davis."  </P> <P> John MacLeod, himself a former Dallas coach, was the front-runner for the King  job, but team officials were turned off when he showed up to interview and  ticked off what he considered problems with the organization.  </P> <P> "MacLeod is just too slick," one Sacramento official said.  </P> <P> NBA Notes  </P> <P> The Seattle SuperSonics have finally given up on Nate McMillan, who was last  among all starting point guards in shooting percentage and scoring for 1988-89.  Avery Johnson is the new starter. "I don't know if Avery can do it," Coach  Bernie Bickerstaff said. "But we need to give him the opportunity. We've got to  find someone who can create offensive opportunities for other players." . . .  Detroit Coach Chuck Daly, on Golden State's Chris Mullin: "I've got to be  honest with you. I never thought Chris would have this much impact in the NBA.  I mean, I knew he'd be a good player in this league, but like this? No.  Everyone knew he could shoot, but I don't think anyone thought he could pass,  rebound and run the show like he does."  </P> <P> It didn't take 5-year-old Danny Grunfeld long to catch on while watching his  father, New York assistant Coach Ernie Grunfeld, play in a recent old-timers'  game at Madison Square Garden. "Daddy doesn't pass very much, does he?" Danny  said to his mom. . . . After Dallas' Adrian Dantley completed the first  scoreless game of his career, playing only 13 minutes in the process, Coach  Richie Adubato approached him in the locker room to explain the shortage of  playing time. Dantley waved him off. "Don't worry about it," he told Adubato.  "I'm not Mark Aguirre."  </P></p>

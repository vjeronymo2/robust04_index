			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Bhutto starts to build her cost-cutting cabinet MR VA JAFFERY, a former governor of Pakistan's central bank with a reputation for financial discipline in government spending, was among six ministers and advisers yesterday appointed to the cabinet of Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister. Although there is speculation that Ms Bhutto would keep the finance and commerce portfolios herself, Mr Jaffery's appointment as an adviser was seen as an encouraging signal that serious measures would be taken to reverse a large budgetary deficit. Mr Jaffery said the government would take steps to cut spending on expensive programmes begun under the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister. Those include projects for building motorways, and schemes for importing a large number of taxi cabs, which were backed by huge loans from government-owned banks. Pakistan's last fiscal year closed in June with a record high budgetary deficit of 7 per cent of gross domestic product, substantially lager than the target recommended by the IMF, the World bank and bilateral aid donors. Mr Jaffery said the new government would try to bring the deficit down to 5.4 per cent of GDP by the end of the current fiscal year. He also said most wide-ranging economic reforms begun by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime minister, would remain in force. Mr Naseerullah Babar, a retired general and member of Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP), was sworn in as interior minister. She allocated portfolios to three members of other parties in her coalition government, giving parliamentary affairs to Sher Afghan Niazi, an independent elected with PPP support in the October 6 general election. Mr Mohammad Asghar, a retired brigadier and senior member of her main allied party  - a splinter group of ex-premier Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League  - became minister of industries and production. Mr Mohammad Afzal Khan, of a small party from the North West Frontier Province, was also sworn in. His portfolio was to be announced later.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Former Deputy Premier and  Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe reiterated a wish Friday to run  for a prime ministerial election, suggesting forming a new  political party by breaking away from the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    Watanabe told reporters ahead of a meeting with LDP  President  Yohei Kono on Friday afternoon that "I am groping for (a way) to  realize our ideas and principles."    But Watanabe did not give a specific answer to a question of  whether he has already decided to leave the LDP and set up a new  party, saying, "now is not the time to declare it."    Asked when he will make an official announcement of his  candidacy, Watanabe said, "I have to talk with my party's  colleagues before speaking out on a final decision."    Kono is to meet with Watanabe in a last-ditch effort to  settle on a sole LDP candidate for the prime ministerial  election.    Political sources said Watanabe's remarks suggest he will  reject Kono's request for giving up his candidacy, which may  lead to a breakup of the LDP.    Although ousted from its 38-year grip on power last August  by  the coalition government led by Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, the LDP remains the largest force in the Diet.    Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, once a mentor of  Watanabe as the former head of his faction, denied the  possibility of Watanabe forming a new political party, saying  that such a move "is not imminent."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  agreed Saturday to work together for the economic development of  the Asia-Pacific region.    In their second summit meeting at the official Guesthouse,  Kim and Hosokawa also discussed the need for their countries to  jointly cope with the new round of global trade negotiations.    The expanded summit was attended by their cabinet ministers  concerned with economy and trade. The two leaders' wide-ranging  discussions included the North Korean nuclear issue, expanded  and balanced bilateral trade and technology cooperation.    The two sides also touched on joint projects involving South  Korea, Japan and China, co-action in the APEC (Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation) forum, and multilateral security  arrangements in northeast Asia.    Seoul and Tokyo agreed to strive for an early resolution of  the North Korean nuclear issue, including concerted efforts at  the United Nations Security Council, Kim said in a press  conference he gave jointly with Hosokawa after the summit. "If  North Korea changes its attitude even now, South Korea is ready  to take appropriate steps," Kim said.    Kim is to wind up his three-day visit to Japan and leave  Tokyo for Shanghai Saturday to start a five-day tour of China.    Earlier in the day, Kim and Hosokawa had a breakfast meeting  and reaffirmed their commitment to cooperate on the North Korean  nuclear problem.    They also shared the opinion that China's active  participation and cooperation are essential for the interests of  the entire Northeast Asia, said South Korean presidential  spokesman Chu Ton-sik.    Touching on the trade imbalance in his talks with Hosokawa,  President Kim asked Japan to buy more Korean products and send a  mission to Seoul to help increase Japanese investment in Korea.    Noting the need for increased exchanges between small- and  medium-sized companies in the two countries, Kim requested that  Korean firms be allowed to participate in construction projects  in Japan. Kim also proposed that Korean and Japanese builders  bid jointly for construction projects in third countries.    In addition, Kim proposed that South Korea, Japan and China  undertake joint endeavors including development of oriental  medicine, standardization of Chinese characters and formation of  a Northeast Asian environmental consultative organization.  Hosokawa said he was agreeing in principle to the proposal.    Moreover, South Korea asked Japan to jointly cope with the  new round of international negotiations on environmental issues.</p>

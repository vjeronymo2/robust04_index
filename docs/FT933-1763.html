			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Allen seeks Pounds 5m and full listing ALLEN, the Wigan-based housebuilding, hire services and contracting group, is raising about Pounds 5m after expenses by a placing and open offer of 4.44m shares. It is also seeking to move up from the USM to a listing. Of the proceeds Pounds 2.5m will be spent on expanding the number of land bank sites from the current 29 to about 35. The company said it only bought land if a suitable return could be expected. The approach had resulted in not having to make provisions against its land bank throughout the recession. A further Pounds 2m will be spent on hire services. It is negotiating to acquire a six-outlet small tool hire chain for about Pounds 1m and plans to spend about Pounds 30,000 apiece on its existing outlets. In contracting, the group is in talks to acquire a Midlands-based contractor for about Pounds 400,000. The directors have forecast that pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 would be not less than Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 855,000), that earnings would be at least 3.6p (2.5p) per share and that the interim dividend would be maintained at 1.65p. The shares are being placed at 119p per share and shareholders can apply on a one-for-five basis. The issue has been underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and the brokers are de Zoete &amp; Bevan. The shares closed down 2p at 130p. Mr Ken Fox, deputy managing director, said the move up from the USM to the senior market would change and raise the profile of the group, widen its institutional shareholder base, and offer more opportunities for raising further funds, if necessary.</p>

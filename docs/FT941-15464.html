			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Quaker Oats warns of sharp fall Shares in Quaker Oats, the Chicago-based cereal, pet food and sports drinks company, lost Dollars 3 5/8 to close at Dollars 65 3/4 yesterday as the company warned that it would report a slump in second-quarter earnings next week. It said net income per share could be 15 to 20 per cent below the previous year's 77 cents a share because of weakness in the European economy, the impact of financing costs in Brazil, and lower gains from hedging against shifts in European currency exchange rates. Quaker said it remained confident that its full-year target of a 7 per cent increase in real earnings was attainable because of growth in its US businesses and productivity improvements worldwide. Mr William Smithburg, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Our key US businesses are performing well in terms of strong volume growth, margin improvement and maintaining market share.' Last October Quaker Oats surprised the market with a stronger-than-expected performance for its first quarter, ending in September. Net income of Dollars 91.4m, against a loss of Dollars 55.3m a year earlier. Much of the growth was attributed to strong sales of Gatorade, the sports drink that is now Quaker's biggest-selling product, and to better sales of cereals and grain-based snacks in the US.</p>

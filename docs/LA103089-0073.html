Gene Kennett, a minister  from Erie, Pa., conducted a service for the 100 faithful who showed up at the  dingy storefront church in Orlando. The owner of the shopping center has said  the ministry will have to vacate by Wednesday. But a statement from Tammy  Bakker said they would hold services there Sunday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MRS. BUSH SHARES FIRST DOG STORIES WITH CZECH STUDENTS  </P> <P> Barbara Bush on Saturday shared the secrets of a dog's life in the White House  with Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel's wife, Olga, and schoolchildren.  </P> <P> In a quick tour of Prague during President Bush's one-day visit to  Czechoslovakia, Mrs. Bush and Olga Havlova visited pupils at an  English-language school.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush read excerpts from a book written in the name of her dog, Millie, to  the schoolchildren.  </P> <P> "Look at that," Mrs. Bush said, displaying pictures of the President sprawling  on a White house lawn with spaniel puppies.  </P> <P> "Can you imagine a President of the United States being that serious?"  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush told the class of wide-eyed 11-year-olds that her dog is allowed to  roam the White House and regularly attends meetings of the National Security  Council.  </P> <P> "So Millie knows more about the Persian Gulf and Czechoslovakia than I do," she  said.  </P> <P> Bush, the first U.S. President to visit Czechoslovakia, arrived in Prague on  Saturday morning to celebrate the first anniversary of Czechoslovakia's return  to political freedom after four decades of Communist rule.  </P> <P> As Bush and Havel met in Prague's lavish Hradcany Castle, their wives visited  mentally handicapped children in a gray, wind-swept suburb.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 16 May (AFP) -- The Police Operations  Command has informed AFP that students from a vocational school  in downtown Caracas today looted a grocery truck. Also, police  in a nearby area arrested two troublemakers, seizing from them  an Army pistol and another .38-caliber weapon.    Meanwhile, in the Montalban area in northwestern Caracas and  on Baralt Avenue in downtown Caracas, students staged two other  marches on Monday morning but they did not degenerate into riots.    At Candelaria Square in downtown Caracas, about midday today  residents blocked traffic to protest the shortage of water,  another ill affecting residents of Caracas due to the protracted  drought that began late last year.    Over the past two weeks, violent student demonstrations have  been staged in Caracas and 10 other Venezuelan cities. These  demonstrations have resulted in the death of one student amid  renewed rumors of a coup d'etat and the bolivar's drastic  decline on the parallel market, where it is now selling for 153  units per dollar.    Foreseeing an intensification of the disturbances, Defense  Minister General Rafael Montero Revette said the Army is  prepared to implement the "Avila" and "Sovereignty" plans which  would require the militarization of Caracas and the entire  country.</p>

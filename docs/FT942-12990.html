			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Observer: Whither WTO? Meanwhile, with Sutherland counting himself out of the top slot at the new World Trade Organisation, how about a consolation prize for Sir Leon Brittan, whose chances of securing the EU presidency look slimmer by the day? Only joking. Brittan's office was yesterday roundly quashing any such flights of fancy and, with his lofty ambitions, Europe's trade commissioner might be right to turn up his nose at Geneva. But son of Gatt obviously needs to lure some other heavyweight. Sutherland's happy blend of pugnacity, charm and political skill makes him a hard act to follow; his performance certainly has made it highly unlikely that the WTO would go for a trade bureaucrat, however skilful, of the kind that used to run the Gatt. As the world's trade policeman, the new organisation will need someone who is not afraid to dress down governments that break fair trade rules. The forum for continuing trade talks will also have to have as its boss a skilled negotiator to deal with an expected membership of more than 100 nations, three-quarters from the developing world. And hence to the small matter of nationality. While the Europeans squabble over the division of a number of international jobs up for grabs at the moment, they could find the WTO eluding their grasp. The Gatt may traditionally have gone for a European, but this time developing countries will be pushing a candidate of their own - as may Japan.</p>

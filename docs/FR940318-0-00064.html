			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations treat an option as exercised only if it is issued or transferred for an abusive principal purpose. The proposed regulations define an abusive principal purpose as a principal purpose of manipulating the timing of an owner shift to avoid, or ameliorate the impact of, an ownership change by one of two means. These two means are (1) providing the holder of the option, prior to its exercise, with a substantial portion of the attributes of ownership of the underlying stock, and (2) facilitating the creation of income to absorb the loss corporation's losses prior to the exercise of the option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The determination of whether an option is issued or transferred for an abusive principal purpose is based on all relevant facts and circumstances. The proposed regulations include a nonexclusive list of factors that evidence an abusive principal purpose. One factor, for example, is the receipt by the loss corporation of a capital contribution (in exchange for stock or otherwise) in connection with the issuance or transfer of an option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Treasury Decision adopts the proposed regulations with several revisions. The following discussion describes the principal differences between the proposed and final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Ownership, Control, and Income Tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final regulations treat an option as exercised if it satisfies either an ownership test, a control test, or an income test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ownership test is substantially the same as the first element of the abusive principal purpose test of the proposed regulations. An option satisfies the ownership test if a principal purpose of its issuance, transfer, or structuring is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change by providing the holder of the option, prior to its exercise or transfer, with a substantial portion of the attributes of ownership of the underlying stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The control test applies to an option held by a major shareholder or used in connection with a major corporate acquisition. An actual or constructive holder of more than 50 percent of a corporation's stock can generally exercise significant influence over the corporation prior to the exercise of the option. The rules of the proposed regulations, however, may not adequately take into account the relationship between a major shareholder or option holder and the loss corporation. In particular, the attributes of ownership element of the abusive principal purpose test of the proposed regulations focuses only on the attributes of ownership of the stock covered by an option. It does not take into account an option holder's influence over a corporation as a result of owning other stock or options. In addition, the proposed regulations imply (and, as described below, the final regulations explicitly state) that the ability of the holder of an option with a fixed exercise price to share in future appreciation of the underlying stock is not, by itself, a substantial portion of the attributes of ownership of the stock. However, the extent to which a fixed price option transfers an economic interest in the loss corporation to an option holder may be of particular concern when the option is held by a major shareholder or is used in connection with a major corporate acquisition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons described above, the final regulations adopt a control test that applies to options held by major shareholders or used in connection with major corporate acquisitions. An option satisfies the control test if (1) a principal purpose of its issuance, transfer, or structuring is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change, and (2) the holder of the option and any persons related to the option holder have, in the aggregate, a direct and indirect ownership interest in the loss corporation of more than 50 percent (determined as if the increase in such persons' percentage ownership interest that would result from the exercise of the option in question and any other options to acquire stock held by such persons, and any other intended increases in such persons' percentage ownership interest, actually occurred on the date the option is issued or transferred).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The control test will subject certain options to inquiry even if it is unlikely that the option holder (or a related person) will actually acquire (directly or indirectly) more than 50 percent of the stock of the loss corporation. The control test is not satisfied, however, unless a requisite purpose is present. For example, the control test will apply to a contingent option to acquire more than 50 percent of the stock of a loss corporation even though the option holder has no other relationship to the corporation. Nevertheless, in such a situation, the option would not be treated as exercised if it were not issued with a principal purpose to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The income test is substantially the same as the second element of the abusive principal purpose test of the proposed regulations. An option satisfies the income test if a principal purpose of its issuance, transfer, or structuring is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change by facilitating the creation of income prior to its exercise or transfer. The final regulations clarify that the creation of income concept is a broad one, and refers not only to the creation of income, but to the creation of any value (e.g., unrealized built-in gains that would ameliorate the impact of an ownership change), and also to the acceleration of income or the deferral of deductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Clarification of Principal Purpose Concept  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations treat an option as exercised if a principal purpose of its issuance or transfer is abusive. Various forms of this purpose standard are employed throughout the Code and regulations. See, e.g., sections 306(b)(4) (``one of its principal purposes''); 336(d)(2)(B) (``a principal purpose''); 453(e)(7) (``one of its principal purposes''); 7872(c) (``1 of the principal purposes''); 1.707&hyph;6(b) (``a principal purpose''); 1.1275&hyph;2T(g) (``a principal purpose''); and 1.1504&hyph;4(g)(3)(iv)(B) (``a principal purpose''). The IRS and the Treasury Department considered other formulations of a purpose test in an effort to provide greater clarity on the application of the test. No appropriate substitute was identified. Accordingly, the final regulations retain the ``a principal purpose'' standard, but clarify that the relevant inquiry under this standard is not limited to the purposes for which an option is issued or transferred. The inquiry also focuses on the purposes of structuring the option, either alone or in combination with other arrangements. An abusive purpose can be a principal purpose even when it is outweighed by the non-tax reasons (taken together or separately) for the occurrence or structure of a transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Elimination of Abuse Factors and Disclosure Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the proposed regulations provide a nonexclusive list of factors that evidence an abusive principal purpose. The proposed regulations require a loss corporation to disclose certain information to the IRS if it does not treat as exercised an option to which one of the specific abuse factors applies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRS and the Treasury Department have determined that the enforcement benefits that would be achieved by the disclosure requirement do not justify the administrative burden it would impose on taxpayers (in addition to the general disclosure requirement of the temporary regulations; see &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(a)(2)(ii)). Therefore, the final regulations do not retain the disclosure requirement of the proposed regulations. The accuracy-related penalty of section 6662 may apply, however, if a substantial underpayment results from a position that lacks substantial authority that is not adequately disclosed by the taxpayer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

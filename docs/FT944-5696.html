			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Pension schemes win concession on bill The government is preparing to accede to pleas from the UK's largest occupational pension schemes not to saddle them with a disproportionate share of financing a new pensions regulator. It is understood that the forthcoming bill for the reform of occupational pensions will call for a flat per-member levy across the industry to help finance a compensation scheme for benefits lost through fraud or misappropriation. However, the cost of the new regulator, estimated in a June white paper at Pounds 10m a year, will be spread differently. The government is expected to propose a 'weighted' levy which will ease the contribution required of schemes with the most members. Department of Social Security officials made clear this week that the main provisions would be included in a bill that is expected to run to around 140 clauses and be published before the end of the year. It is expected that the bill will be introduced in the House of Lords, probably in mid to late December. 'The vast majority of our provisions will be in the bill and everything will be debatable,' DSS officials said. 'There may be some secondary regulations but these will not inhibit debate.' DSS officials say the main provisions of the bill are little changed from those stipulated in the government's white paper on occupational pensions which was published this summer. It is understood that there will be no change in the proposed powers of the Occupational Pensions Regulator. However, ministers have been engaged in last-minute consultations with the industry on a number of important aspects of the bill. In particular, there has been fierce debate over how a proposed minimum solvency requirement on pension schemes will be set. While employers' groups have been lobbying heavily to allow their equity holdings to count more heavily towards the solvency calculation, actuaries - the profession that must certify scheme solvency - have resisted. Equities offer too little certainty of return to be held against liabilities for pensions currently in payment. Actuaries have told the government they will only use the looser standard if a political decision is made by the DSS. The bill will also clarify some aspects relating to the election of trustees to pension schemes. Labour MPs and many parts of the pensions industry have become concerned that some of the most contentious clauses of the bill will not be contained in the initial legislation, but will appear in secondary legislation or in guidance notes issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. However, DSS officials have been anxious to stress that public debate will be held on all aspects of the bill.</p>

He was taken away at 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) by three police  officers, Tong said, adding that Wei had telephoned later in the  afternoon to tell her to cancel all his appointments for the  next two days. According to Tong, Wei gave no indication as to  why he had been picked up or when he would be released.    During a meeting in Beijing with U.S. Undersecretary of  State  John Shattuck last Sunday, Wei had called on the U.S. Government  to take a tough stand with China over human rights.    Wei, 43, was released from prison on September 14, six  months  before the end of a 15-year sentence handed down in 1978 for  counter-revolutionary activities. Wei played a leading role in  the 1978 Democracy Wall movement when he called for full  democracy in China and denounced senior leader Deng Xiaoping as  a despot.</p>

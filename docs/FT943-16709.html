			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Travel: Myth and reality of the Rio Grande - Nicholas Woodsworth hangs out on the US-Mexican border Boca Chica. In my imagination the Rio Grande has always loomed large and wide, a substantial expression of the frontier and all that is heroically American. But what is true of the country's favourite sweet and sticky soft-drink is also true of the river - the real thing is never as impressive as the myth that surrounds it. Here, at its mouth on the Gulf of Mexico, more than 1,500 miles from its source, the Rio Grande is no mighty river. Shallow, muddy and sluggish, it is barely more than 15 yards across. Standing on its crumbling banks, I felt deceived. Life on the border is not quite the old west romance you might think. It is, in fact, far more more curious and compelling than that. On the other side, a line of rusty pick-up trucks was parked on the beach and a dozen cowboy-hatted Mexicans were spending a sunny Saturday morning fishing. Seagulls screamed overhead and excited Latin rhythms floated on the mild winter air from truck radios. On the beach, one of the Mexicans threw a metal grill over a fire of broken fruit crates. Another, all whiskers and paunch, stripped to his bright green boxer shorts. Wading gingerly into the river, he began casting a circular throw-net for the whiting that come to the river's mouth at low tide. His casting was interrupted by the approach of a small motor boat from up-river. It cut cross-stream and nosed into the Mexican shore. A woman climbed out of one of the trucks, hopped into the boat, and in 30 seconds was ferried to the American side. Jumping into a waiting vehicle, she disappeared down the flat sand beach towards the main road and the city of Brownsville, half-an-hour away. 'Just one more Dollars 50-a-week cleaning lady,' said Jesse, the young Chicano I had been chatting to, as he cast a baited hook into the stream. 'No work papers, no resident's card, no minimum wage.' Jesse has no such worries. Hispanic by blood but American by birth, he is of two minds about the country across the river. He is a product of la frontera, and tied to the strongly-flavoured, hybrid border culture that has grown up along the Rio Grande. He is as 'Tex-Mex' as tacos and enchiladas, or as Radio Caliente, the local station which serves rapid-fire bilingual chit-chat and conjunto, the Anglo-Hispanic accordion music of the border. But Mexico itself appeals little: Jesse knows that if Mexicans are willing to take up exploited, illegal lives in the US for Dollars 50 a week, it is because life at home is harder still. Did he himself often cross the border to Matamoros, I asked? 'Not much. Liquor is cheaper there. But there's too much hustling - stolen cars, hookers, drugs, phoney documents, smuggling, scams of all kinds. There are some real bad guys over there. Last time they took my money.' Who were 'they', I asked. Street toughs? No, he said, laughing. The police. For most, life on the border is rarely fair or easy. Matamoros. An air of shabbiness, poverty, and impermanence hangs over the Rio Grande, especially here in the seamy bars and billiard halls, the dog tracks and strip joints, the pawn shops and gun stores. On both sides of the border you will find people and services providing for and exploiting human need. Americans cross the border in search of exoticism and surreptitious pleasures. Most Mexicans seem happy to find rough survival on the other side. Essentially, this is no man's land. Trust and familiarity are foreign here - shop windows are grilled, fences abound, 'No Loitering' signs hang in parking lots and gas stations. Few outsiders linger along the underbelly of the US. Most feel a strong sense of place here, but little sense of belonging. If the border belongs to anyone, it is to the anonymous transients who stream over it. The international crossing points over the Rio Grande are a travel bargain. Where else on earth can you pay 25 cents and in seconds walk from a society of high-tech mass-consumption to third world neglect and deprivation? It is along the Rio Grande that the techtonic plates of the north-south divide run edge to edge. But in spite of the cracked pavements, the cheap blankets and tourist trinkets, the sleazy come-ons to buy marijuana or half-an-hour with a young girl, there is something refreshing about Mexican towns on the Rio Grande. They have a heart. On the US side, community life has largely disappeared from downtown pavements. If it exists anywhere, it is in freeway shopping malls and fast food places out on the urban peripheries - there are times when America's soul seems approachable only by car. Mexican life, though, is immediately accessible. In Matamoros there were mobile vendors and shoe-shine boys, blind musicians and sellers of lottery tickets, squeezers of fruit juice and pavement grillers of skewered lamb. There were crowded markets and city squares graced by orange trees and bandstands of ornate wrought iron work. Whole families promenaded, entire armies of men chatted the day away. Shopping malls may be more efficient, but I will take the streets of Matamoros any day. The lower Rio Grande Valley. I spent a morning in a trailer park with Barbara and Archie Dick. If they make the only decent cup of tea in the whole valley, it is because they have not forgotten their native Glasgow. They had driven down from the frozen wastes of Ontario, where they now live, for some winter sunshine. But was it really worth it, I wondered? Not long ago the valley's wealth came largely from the market gardens and fruit orchards, sugar cane and cotton fields worked and harvested by Chicano and Mexican immigrant labour. These days, it is the fast-growing retirement industry that fills the roadside fields the length of the lower valley. I do not begrudge retired people their place in the sun, their health and leisure centres, their golf carts and woodworking classes, their social evenings that have turned the valley into the square-dancing capital of the world. But I did have difficulties with their 80,000 'RVs' - recreational vehicles  -and the more than 500 monstrous 'RV parks' that blot the landscape here. RVs - great blocks of lumbering, wheeled real estate that permit the transfer of ghastly suburbs from one part of the country to the other - may one day take over the US. When I left the valley to follow the river up to Big Bend, I counted a convoy of eight 55-ft monsters from Quebec pulling out behind me, a lost tribe seeking its destiny in the desert. Laredo. Saturday night in downtown Laredo, on the US side of the border, is deader than it ever was when this was a dung-spattered frontier town. I spent the early evening at my motel off Interstate 35 drinking beer with a crowd of over-nighting truck-drivers. We sat out in the parking lot in front of a plastic garbage can filled with ice and bottles of Bud, and told dirty jokes. I have long known that truck drivers are the folk heroes of modern America. Now I am trying to figure out why. Nuevo Laredo. Where do all the hip cowboys in Laredo head on a Saturday night? Answer: Nuevo Laredo on the other side of the Rio Grande. Near the clubs on Plaza San Miguel, the pavements were jammed and noisy. By midnight there was car gridlock downtown, and the line to get into the OK Tijuana discotheque stretched round the corner. There were no signs of the usual Rio Grande poverty in the OK Tijuana, none of its striking contrasts. Like the Americans in the place, the Mexicans were all young, good-looking, well-dressed and well-off. What is more, the two groups were hardly distinguishable. The Mexican city has a sizeable middle-class, and its US sister-city a mixed Anglo-Hispanic population. Big Bend. Nancy Kerrigan, the Bobbitts, California earthquakes, Elvis Presley, the Cowboys vs the Bills - you can twiddle the car radio knob late at night and catch all of America's madness as the striped lines fly by, but in Big Bend country none of it will touch you. Big Bend - a big bend in the Rio Grande - is what is left of the unspoilt frontier. It is a huge, remote, largely uninhabited tract in the Chihuahua desert, and breathtaking in its beauty. For US tourists, who still believe strongly in the idea of the frontier, its national park is a sanctuary protected from everything but tourism itself. But even wagon trains of RVs lose themselves in this vast space, and I found a serene stretch of riverbank. On the other side, the little Mexican village of Santa Elena slumbered in the winter sunshine. There were no bridges or border posts or hustlers here, just a rowboat and a ferryman sitting on the far bank beside a burro. The ferryman dozed, the burro dozed, and I, too, settled quietly to an afternoon of dreaming. Here, at least, the river was as wide and deep and peaceful as it has always been in my imagination.</p>

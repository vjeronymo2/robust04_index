			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Gemina lifts pre-tax profit to L30.8bn GEMINA, the Italian investment and financial services group controlled by Fiat, raised pre-tax parent company profits for the first half of its 1991-1992 financial year to L30.8bn (Dollars 24.85m) from L23.2bn last time. However, consolidated pre-tax earnings in the six months to December 31 fell to L130.9bn from L142.5bn. Gemina forecast that parent company earnings this financial year would be in line with those in 1990-91. The book value of its holdings rose by L339.8bn to L1,494bn, largely because of rights issues at RCS Editori and Fila, two companies under Gemina's control. Parmalat Finanziaria, the holding company which controls the big Italian foods group of the same name, raised net group profits to L42bn last year from L6bn in 1990, due partly to a 20 per cent jump in sales to L1,327bn and a L9bn drop in interest charges to L70bn. The company is to pay an increased dividend of L115 a share.</p>

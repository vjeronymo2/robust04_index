			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: NatWest surprises High Street bank National Westminster surprised the market - but more because of the performance of its shares than the details of its first half profits. Once the reduction in the bad debt charge had been taken into account underlying profits were down by 9 per cent. However, the shares have fallen so far this year that by the time the figures came out they looked very cheap. Analyst Mr Michael Lever of Nomura said: 'It was the cheapest in the sector in p/e terms. The results were disappointing in terms of underlying profits but this was more than adequately compensated by the rating.' The stock rose 17 to 470p, with a number of investors taking the opportunity to close out their bear positions.</p>

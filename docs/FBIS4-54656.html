			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrei Badin: "The Authorities Fear Not So Much </F> the King as the People Who Acclaim Him"]    [Text] Their Majesties King Mihai and Queen Ana will not  be in Romania over the Easter Holidays. Again, the authorities  have prevented, in an elegant way, it is true, the visit of the  Sovereign. After the royal family had handed in their passports  [for the granting of the visa] on 8 April to the Romanian  embassy in Bern and the King reasserted his declaration  according to which he does not intend to contest the  constitutional order (which does not mean that he also  acknowledges the Constitution), the Bucharest authorities sent  their representative to Versoix [royal headquarters in  Switzerland]. That representative was Ion Gorita, state  secretary of the ministry of foreign affairs. Being in Paris,  accompanying President Ion Iliescu on his visit in France,  Gorita contacted His Majesty's secretariat over the telephone.  In the afternoon of the same day, 16 April, he received an  audience at Versoix. At that time the point of view expressed  by the envoy of the Romanian authorities was that "the  government sees no impediment to the visit of the King."    Thus, a significant change in the stance of the authorities  began to take shape, a shift compared to the hysteria that they  referred to whenever the king previously tried to return to his  native country. They agreed that during the following days the  King would designate the persons who were to represent him at  the negotiations scheduled to take place in Bucharest with the  representatives of the authorities. His Majesty the King  designated Messrs. Gheorghe Antoniade and Dan Badic to conduct  the talks. On behalf of the Romanian authorities the talks were  attended, in the first phase, by Messrs. Ion Gorita, George Ioan  Danescu, state secretary at the ministry of interior, and other  officials. Initially they raised the issue of his visit to  Timisoara, as the King had been officially invited by the mayor  of that municipality, Viorel Oancea, and His Holiness Nicolae  Corneanu, the Metropolitan of Banat. The talks were also  attended by the Timis County prefect and the head of the county  police. Their first stipulation was the King's isolation from  Timisoara. The authorities suggested that his residence should  be at one of Ceausescu's former Houses, in the locality of  Pischia, 27 kilometers away from Timisoara. The royal house  could not accept that offer, first because the king had wanted  to stay in a house owned by the church and, second, because  having been invited by Timisoara, he could not understand why he  should keep out of Timisoara. Then the authorities invented  further pretexts, such as the fact that the king's protection  (against whom?) could not be ensured in Timisoara, or they  claimed they held information (from what source?) according to  which during the royal visit in Timisoara both pro-monarchy and  anti-monarchy (?!?) demonstrations were planned. Eventually,  after further discussions, the authorities openly admitted that  Timisoara could in no way be the scene of the royal visit.  Trying to stall reaching an agreement, the government then  invented an extreme solution: They would officially invite the  King to visit, "wherever" else he wishes to go.    The King pondered this new proposal a great deal, after  which  he authorized his representatives in Bucharest to state that for  the good of the country and for the sake of national  reconciliation, the King accepts, in principle, that proposal,  provided that Viorel Oancea, the Timisoara mayor, as well as  Metropolitan Corneanu should accompany him wherever he goes. It  was quite difficult for the King to accept that government  proposal as he felt bound by very deep feelings to Timisoara,  the martyr city, which the authorities had several times  prevented him from visiting. On Wednesday [27 April] evening,  at government headquarters, new talks were held between the  King's representatives and those of the executive, among whom  Mr. Viorel Hrebenciuc, the general secretary of the government,  also attended. They came up with yet another thing: Having  said that the king could visit "wherever" he wished, the  government now suggested a new variant containing three  possibilities: The king should visit Curtea de Arges, Putna, or  Olanesti [monasteries], where he would be sheltered in "palaces"  and "copious meals" would be served to him. It is worth noting  that the representatives of the authorities were constantly  trying to flatter the king's envoys by mentioning the palaces,  meals, and other such "favors" that the government would be  ready to provide for His Majesty. What is more, the government  suggested that they would send a BAC-type aircraft to Geneva  solely for the transportation of the royal family to Romania,  which would mean spending a huge amount of money. The King's  representatives replied that there was no need for such a thing,  as the King wished to travel by a normal airline flight and he  did not intend to stay in palaces or dine copiously. The  government people found it very difficult to comprehend that  point of view. Eventually, the King expressed his wish to visit  Bucharest, a thing that originally had been suggested by the  Government. However, now they did not accept. This is, in  general terms, how the 10-day Bucharest talks among the  representatives of the king and those of the government evolved.    Anyone can easily see that the authorities changed their  stance each time the wind changed direction. The final  impression was that actually they were merely trying to delay  making a decision and to finally convince His Majesty to accept  that the visit should be as secretive as possible and in a place  selected by the government. Having requested that the visit  should have a private character, the government wanted an  official one, kept secret, the schedule of which was also to be  established by the government. All this happened after Ion  Gorita, on 16 April, in Versoix, had said that "there are no  problems." No comment needed!</p>

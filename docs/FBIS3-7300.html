The plan will include tax incentives, low-interest  loans and support in establishing welfare facilities for foreign  companies operating in Japan.    In order to encourage foreign companies to export more to  Japan or to make more investment in the country, the plan will  also call for enhancing information provided by Japanese  organizations. For example, it will call on the Japan External  Trade Organization (JETRO), which long pushed Japanese exports  but has recently begun promoting imports, to send its experts on  trade and investment to 12 cities overseas such as San Francisco  and Milan.    The action plan will be unveiled as part of a new  market-opening package the government is expected to announce  Tuesday, the sources said. They said the government will review  the action plan every year to show its trade partners its  continued efforts on the matter.    The plan for fiscal 1994, starting from April 1, will be in  line with the government's budget plan, they said.    Another feature of the action plan will allow foreign  companies to carry over losses incurred within the initial three  years of operation in Japan for a period of 10 years, rather  than the current limit of carrying losses for seven years, they  said.    The government will also ease within the year conditions for  providing a government-guarantee of debt for foreign companies,  so as to make it easier for them to raise capital, the sources  said.</p>

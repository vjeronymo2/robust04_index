			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Biggest monthly rise in house prices since 1988 reported Further evidence of the continuing recovery in the UK housing market emerged yesterday as Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, confirmed that house prices rose 2.2 per cent in February, the biggest monthly gain since September 1988. Figures produced by the Inland Revenue show that the number of homes sold has also risen sharply. According to Halifax the average price of homes has risen 3.8 per cent in the past 12 months to Pounds 62,498. The latest price rise follows two months of small price falls. The society said this confirmed that the slow recovery which started in the housing market last year was continuing. Inland Revenue conveyancing records show that the 113,000 house purchases completed in England and Wales in January were more than a third higher than the figure in January last year. Conveyancing completions have exceeded 100,000 in all of the last seven months compared to just once in the previous seven. Even so sales last year rose only 5.1 per cent to 1.19m. This compared with a low of 1.13m in 1992. The 1993 figure was still the second lowest annual result since transactions peaked at 2.14m in 1988. Halifax said that if the recent trend continued transactions could rise by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent this year, which would be the highest level since 1990. The society expects prices to rise at a slower rate and is forecasting an average increase of 5 per cent this year. It warned purchasers and sellers not to read too much into one month's figures, saying that the rate of annual price increase was likely to fall in the next two months 'because of the large monthly rise which occured last March and April'. As a result the society 'would expect to see much smaller rises in coming months'. According to the society the average price of a new house rose 0.4 per cent in February and 1.7 per cent over 12 months to Pounds 67,523. Halifax's latest figures conflict with a report on Tuesday by Nationwide, the country's second largest building society, which said that UK house prices on average had fallen by 0.6 per cent in February compared with January. It is the third month running that the societies' figures have differed. Nationwide in January and December reported monthly increases of 0.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively while Halifax reported falls of 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent. The societies are in closer agreement on the annual rate of increase, with Nationwide reporting 3.2 per cent and Halifax 3.8 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment stated that the ``current test for erythema'' is inadequate to test for the full spectrum of UVA radiation because erythema is not a valid measurement of UVA exposure. The comment argued that using the erythema action spectrum to test for UVA protection will give consumers a false sense of the extent of UVA protection afforded by a product. The comment added that the immediate pigment darkening (IPD) action spectrum is preferable because it is broad enough to take into account almost all UVA wavelengths. Another comment stated that the IPD action spectrum is indicative of a true broad spectrum UVA response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment noted that the IPD action spectrum was first described to extend from 300 to 420 nm, with a broad peak between 340 and 370 nm (Ref. 5). The action spectrum was later described to extend from 300 to 620 nm, with a peak effectiveness between 400 and 500 nm (visible light) (Ref. 6). Because of the difference between these two reported spectra, the comment reevaluated the action spectrum for IPD between 310 and 400 nm and reported that the IPD action spectrum extends from 320 to 400 nm with a low peak around 340 nm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concurrent with determining which testing procedure is appropriate for use in validating the UVA protection provided by a sunscreen drug product, the agency must determine what portion of the UVA spectrum should be blocked by the product before consumers are effectively protected against the hazards of UVA radiation. The agency would like to consider the following specific questions at the meeting:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Which action spectra are the most important with respect to skin damage caused by UVA radiation?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Is the erythema action spectrum an adequate surrogate for UVA biological risk, or is some other action spectrum (such as the IPD action spectrum) more appropriate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Can a sunscreen drug product that protects consumers against the shorter UVA wavelengths (320 to 340 nm) but not against longer UVA wavelengths (340 to 400 nm) prevent significant UVA damage?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. What should consumers expect from a sunscreen drug product that is labeled to provide protection against UVA radiation or as a ``broad spectrum'' sunscreen?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. UVA Testing Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency did not propose a method for determining UVA protection in the tentative final monograph for OTC sunscreen drug products. The agency stated that a method should be developed and validated in the same manner as the sunscreen testing procedure for protection against UVB radiation (58 FR 28194 at 28250). The agency noted that any such method should clearly demonstrate that a particular product provides significant protection against UVA radiation. The method should include the use of a control sunscreen preparation that absorbs UVA radiation and that can be used to assure the reliability of the testing procedure and equipment. The method should demonstrate that a sunscreen ingredient either does or does not protect against UVA radiation. The agency requested comments and data regarding an appropriate testing method for OTC sunscreen drug products that protect against UVA radiation. In response, the agency received information and data pertaining to several UVA testing procedures, including both in vivo and in vitro test methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment recommended adoption of an in vitro test method that does not rely upon either photosensitization or nonsolar light sources for determining UVA protection for normal skin (Ref. 8). According to the comment, this method involves:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Determining the UV absorbance spectrum of the sunscreen product,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Calculating a convolution spectrum by multiplying the solar spectrum with the current CIE Hazard Spectrum, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

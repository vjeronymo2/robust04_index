			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEAROUT;  </P> <P> SLOWER THAN BURNOUT, IT'S EXPIRATION DATE FOR EFFECTIVENESS  </P> <P> Burnout isn't the only affliction that pushes professional coaches into  retirement prematurely.  </P> <P> There's also lassitude, Raider executive Al LoCasale said the other day.  </P> <P> "Nine or 10 years are about as long as any pro coach can operate at top  efficiency," LoCasale said. "After that, most of them find that they're better  off moving out.  </P> <P> "They aren't burned out, exactly. They just can't do it any more -- not the way  they want to do it, not the way they used to do it."  </P> <P> This is a theory first advanced by Raider owner Al Davis. The theory gained  more credibility a few months ago when Bill Walsh ended 10 years as coach of  the San Francisco 49ers by resigning after his third Super Bowl triumph. At 57,  Walsh is now an football analyst for NBC.  </P> <P> Earlier, John Madden and Tom Flores had both left the Raiders after a decade or  so as coach, and after each had won the Super Bowl at least once.  </P> <P> In 1967, the late Vince Lombardi left the Green Bay Packers after winning two  Super Bowls in nine years.  </P> <P> "It's hard for a pro coach to maintain the level of his enthusiasm for more  than a decade," LoCasale said.  </P> <P> "He has been motivating many of the same players all that time. They've heard  all his lines and all his funnies -- over and over, probably. Most players get  to where they can even impersonate a veteran coach nicely at parties.  </P> <P> "After 10 years or so, the coach has given all of himself that there is. He's  generated the best results he can get. When the time comes to put it into third  gear, he discovers that third gear isn't there any more."  </P> <P> The famous exceptions are Don Shula, who has been coaching pro teams for a  quarter-century, lately at Miami, and Chuck Noll, who has led the Pittsburgh  Steelers all that time.  </P> <P> Tom Landry led the Dallas Cowboys for 29 years until a new owner fired him this  spring.  </P> <P> However, the league's three senior coaches have all hovered around .500, if  that. The Dolphins were 6-10 last year, the Steelers 5-11, the Cowboys an  NFL-worst 3-13. Landry's last three teams were losers.  </P> <P> Last year, however, neither Noll, Shula nor Landry seemed close to burning out.  BOB OATES  </P></p>

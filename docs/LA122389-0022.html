			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON AND LINCOLN S&amp;L SCANDAL  </P> <P> Hooray for Shirley Lampel! It took guts to disrupt one of Sen. Alan Cranston's  political forums on behalf of 23,000 holders of worthless junk bonds sold by  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan ("Cranston's Promise on Bonds Told," Dec. 17). But  some folks will believe anyone and anything. After trusting Lincoln and losing  her savings, how can Lampel be "absolutely positive" Cranston will keep his  pledge to help the bondholders after his unabashed acceptance of some $900,000  in political contributions through Lincoln's President Charles Keating?  </P> <P> It's naive to presume a cunning, unconscionable and obsessed political animal  like Cranston is interested in helping anyone but himself. After some two  decades dedicated primarily to the job of raising funds and getting reelected,  does Lampel truly believe Cranston is really interested in helping anyone but  himself while he lies atop the political trash heap? Is she blind to the fact  that Cranston spent the past couple of years fiddling with Keating's political  contributions while the bondholders burned?  </P> <P> NORMAN JACOBSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

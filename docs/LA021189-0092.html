			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EL DORADO WINS 14TH GAME IN ROW  </P> <P> There was plenty of incentive for El Dorado and Cypress high schools Friday  night in their Empire League boys' basketball finale.  </P> <P> El Dorado, which already had clinched the league title, had an opportunity to  close out the regular season with a 14-game winning streak and enter the  Southern Section 3-A playoffs with a perfect league record.  </P> <P> Cypress had a chance to avenge a defeat earlier in the season to El Dorado  before heading into the 4-A playoffs.  </P> <P> The Golden Hawks remained perfect in league play, 60-57.  </P> <P> "Obviously we're playing well," El Dorado Coach Wayne Carlson. El Dorado is  20-4 overall, 10-0 in league play, the first El Dorado team to go undefeated in  league competition.  </P> <P> Cypress (11-13, 6-4) and Los Alamitos tied for second in league play.  </P> <P> It looked as if the Centurions might claim second place outright for nearly  three quarters. They led, 19-18, lead on a Mark Johnson basket with 47 seconds  remaining in the first quarter. Johnson led Cypress with 20 points.  </P> <P> Cypress built an eight-point lead, 45-37, in the third.  </P> <P> The Centurions held leading scorer and rebounder Matt Luke and starting guard  Mike Renaud to three points each in the second and third quarters.  </P> <P> But they couldn't contain either in the final quarter, when the Hawks outscored  Cypress, 16-7, to escape with a victory.  </P> <P> Renaud led the Hawks' balanced scoring attack with 15 points, including nine in  the final 8 minutes. Luke finished with 12 points, 21 rebounds and four steals.  </P> <P> The Hawks trailed, 50-46, going into the final quarter, but Luke sank two free  throws and tipped in a Jerome Facione miss with 7:17 left to get the Hawks to  within a basket at 50-48.  </P> <P> In the final 4 minutes Luke had three steals, the second of which led to a  Renaud basket at 2:57 that tied the score at 54-54. Another Luke steal with  1:36 remaining led to two Renaud free throws and El Dorado's first lead of the  game since the first quarter at 56-54.  </P> <P> One of Luke's biggest rebounds came after a miss with 50 seconds to go by Jared  Rice, who had 19 points. Mike Bradach was fouled and sank both shots for a  58-54 lead.  </P> <P> Katella 64, Los Alamitos 56 -- Brian Yourstone scored 25 points to lead the  Knights (7-15, 3-7) at Katella. The Knights outscored the Griffins, 19-11, in  the fourth quarter to pull away for the victory. Mike Wilson scored 17 points  and Robert Conlisk 14 for Los Alamitos (11-14, 6-4), which enters the 5-A  playoffs.  </P></p>

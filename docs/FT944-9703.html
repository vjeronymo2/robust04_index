			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / WEU pledge on Bosnian arms embargo European allies of the US pledged yesterday to maintain the arms embargo against Bosnia, despite Washington's abrupt withdrawal from the operation, which they almost unanimously regretted. The nine full members of the Western European Union - a defence club which is emerging as the European pillar of Nato - also agreed on the need to solve the Bosnian war by peaceful means, including the efforts of the 'contact group' of senior officials from five nations. Experts of the contact group, which has had credibility problems recently, will meet in London on Thursday. Several WEU countries deplored the US position on grounds that it implied support for a military solution in Bosnia. Turkey - an associate member of the WEU - was alone in voicing approval for President Bill Clinton's move last week, which took his allies by surprise. The Bosnian issue dominated a meeting in this windswept Dutch seaside town of nine WEU nations and 15 other countries - nine of them ex-communist - which enjoy an associate or observer status. Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian politician who has just taken over as secretary-general of Nato, will fly to the US this week with a warning that transatlantic differences could scupper any efforts by the west to provide security and stability for ex-communist countries. 'On both sides of the Atlantic, we must avoid decisions which can endanger solidarity,' Mr Claes said. Mr Claes added that Nato would continue to enforce the embargo against Bosnia because it had been mandated to do so by the United Nations. His implied criticism of the move, forced on the US president by Congress, marked one of the few occasions in Nato history when the holder of the top job in the alliance has censured Nato's most powerful member state. The WEU gave broad approval yesterday to a Dutch paper on upgrading defence co-operation in Europe but lively discussion over Bosnia left less time than expected to discuss the proposal, which Britain has reservations over. However, UK officials confirmed that they were softening their traditionally sceptical attitude to purely European security initiatives by cautiously approving a Franco-German move to set up a joint armaments agency, as long as it was open to all WEU members and efficiently managed. Croatia yesterday threatened to intervene if Bihac, the north-western Moslem enclave, was in danger of falling to Serb forces, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. At the same time, the Bosnian Serbs kept up their assault on Bihac. Serb forces have recovered 80 per cent of the land seized by Moslems during their two-week offensive there, the UN said.</p>

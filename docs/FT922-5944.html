			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television Judging from Max Loppert's recent review on this page we should all be sure to switch on Radio 3 at 7.05 for the live relay from Cardiff of the Welsh National Opera's new production of Iphigenie en Tauride. The story, taken from Euripides by Francois Guillard, is that of Iphigenie, daughter of Agamemnon, and her brother Orestes, in the aftermath of the Trojan war. The opera was written by Gluck when he was 65 and Kobbe tells the story of a contemporary who remarked that there were many fine passages in it. 'There is only one' said the Abbe Arnaud. 'Which?'  - 'The entire work'. In this production Iphigenie is sung by Diana Montague and Orestes by Simon Keenlyside. Two television programmes look at wholesale and retail trade. Business Matters returns to BBC2 with a documentary about Levi Strauss, the original manufacturer of denim jeans and now the world's largest clothing company, which faces a serious problem from counterfeiters (7.25). Channel 4's series The Black Bag (8.00) looks into allegations that wholesalers of newspapers and magazines are refusing to supply Asian shopkeepers.</p>

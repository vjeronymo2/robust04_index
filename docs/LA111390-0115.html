			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. ABSENTEE BALLOT COUNT ORDERED HALTED;  </P> <P> ELECTION: A JUDGE ACTS AFTER ARLO SMITH, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR ATTORNEY  GENERAL, CHALLENGES THE PROCEDURE.  </P> <P> As Democrat Arlo Smith's lead faded Monday in the bitterly fought race for  state attorney general with Republican Dan Lungren, Smith campaign attorneys  were mounting a legal challenge in Orange County concerning the way absentee  ballots are being tabulated.  </P> <P> In the first major update of the absentee ballot count since last Tuesday's  election, former five-term Congressman Lungren picked up 5,904 votes on Smith  in Los Angeles County, the county registrar's office announced.  </P> <P> Until Monday, Smith, the San Francisco district attorney, had led Lungren by  28,836 votes statewide with up to 500,000 absentee ballots remaining to be  counted. A statewide update of absentee votes -- which tend to tilt toward the  Republican Party -- is scheduled to be released by the secretary of state's  office today.  </P> <P> The Smith camp, which has raised the possibility of absentee-vote fraud, is  moving to legally challenge the tabulation of absentee votes. The first step  was their asking that the vote count be stopped in Orange County, where Lungren  was leading by a 2-1 margin in semiofficial returns and where about 50,000  absentee ballots remain unopened, enough to possibly swing the election in  Lungren's favor.  </P> <P> Court actions elsewhere in the state are being considered.  </P> <P> After an unusual weekend hearing in Orange County, Superior Court Judge James  Smith ordered Orange County Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney to cease  counting absentees pending a hearing on the issue Wednesday unless Tanney  alters his tabulating methods.  </P> <P> Tanney said his staff would have begun tabulating the ballots Sunday afternoon  and could have issued an updated report today. But the judge's order has  temporarily frozen results in Orange County, leaving not just the race for  attorney general up in the air, but also city council races in Anaheim and  Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Citing scattered reports across the state, the Smith camp has charged that GOP  workers may have illegally submitted absentee ballot applications on behalf of  an undetermined number of voters by forging signatures. The state election code  requires that voters apply for their own absentee ballots. Smith is alleging  that many voters who otherwise properly cast absentees did not apply for the  ballots themselves.  </P> <P> Smith campaign attorneys are demanding that Tanney and other registrars not  count absentees until they compare signatures on ballot applications with those  on completed ballots.  </P> <P> County registrars throughout the state have been comparing the signatures on  completed ballots with those on voters' original affidavits of registration.  </P> <P> Until Wednesday's hearing, Smith said, Tanney could begin his count anew only  if he checked all three signatures -- those on the registration affidavits, the  ballot applications and the ballots themselves -- to ensure that voters applied  for their own absentee ballots. But Tanney, calling the method unnecessary and  wasteful, said he would not proceed until after the hearing.  </P> <P> "My position is that what we're doing is fine, and I want to fight that one  out," he said.  </P> <P> Marc Dann, Smith's campaign manager, said: "Those are illegal votes. . . . The  GOP saw a loophole, they knew . . . Orange County never checks applications."  </P> <P> But GOP officials said Lungren may pick up more than enough votes elsewhere in  the state today to surpass Smith even without Orange County's reporting. In Los  Angeles, where more than 60,000 absentees are still uncounted, Lungren's  5,904-vote gain came out of 77,000 votes counted since Tuesday.  </P> <P> Terming Lungren's gain in Los Angeles County "great," campaign spokesman Dave  Puglia said, "We're confident we're going to win this."  </P> <P> Dann said: "I would have rather it had been us gaining votes in Los Angeles  County . . . but it (still) looks like it's going to be very close."  </P> <P> Dann added that additional court cases may be filed in other counties today.  "If it's close," he said, "Arlo will exercise his rights to the full extent of  the law."  </P> <P> State Republican Party officials reacted with disdain toward Smith's legal  maneuverings.  </P> <P> "He ought to stop being a crybaby," state GOP Chairman Frank Visco said at a  Burbank press conference. "To spend public money on a redundant type of an  activity . . . is ludicrous . . . and is stalling the process."  </P> <P> Visco said the Republican Party -- which mailed more than 6.5 million absentee  ballot applications to GOP households -- strictly cautioned its workers not to  sign any absentee applications on behalf of voters.  </P> <P> "They're taking some isolated situations and blowing so much smoke," he said.  </P> <P> Countered Dann: "Look, if Visco had nothing to hide, he'd encourage the Orange  County Board of Supervisors to tell the registrar to compare the (signatures).  . . . Why they just won't do that . . . I don't understand."  </P> <P> Dann said the Smith campaign received numerous reports of voters arriving at  the polls to find that they had already been sent absentee ballots.  </P> <P> Tanney, however, said such incidents occur sporadically and this year is no  exception.  </P> <P> Even if some absentee ballots were applied for illegally, the registrar said,  ballots ultimately cast by voters to whom they were issued should be counted.  </P> <P> "The intent of the law is to encourage people to participate in the election,"  Tanney said. "Why would you disenfranchise the voter who in good faith voted? .  . . If I have a sealed ballot with the signature of the voter, as far as I am  concerned that is a valid ballot and deserves to be counted."  </P></p>

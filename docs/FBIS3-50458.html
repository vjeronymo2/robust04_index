			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Victor Manuel Reinoso] </F>   [Text] Ramon Espinoza, minister of the Presidency  Secretariat, has reported that the Council of Ministers approved  yesterday the implementation of the value-added tax (VAT) at the  retail level starting on 1 January 1994. Espinoza added that  the implementation was approved with certain new exemptions that  the ministers of finance and Cordiplan [Ministry of Coordination  and Planning], along with a special commission, were drafting as  late as yesterday afternoon.    The approval of VAT by the government of President Ramon J.  Velasquez is also contemplating a 15-percent tax hike on luxury  items, an area led by cars with prices of more than 4 million  bolivares.    Today we reached the goal given to us by the Special Powers  Act. The Public Registry Law was approved, and minor  modifications were introduced to the VAT Law, particularly in  the area of exemptions. The exemptions were expanded in areas  dealing with goods and services of low-income sectors, but in  general the law's basic principles will remain. It was also  agreed to increase taxes on luxury items by 15 percent to  compensate and make this law more equitable and fair, Minister  Espinoza explained.    The official added that the expansion of exemptions includes  such items as oil, sugar, paper, and mass consumption goods, as  well as pensions for low-income people and cultural and sports  events. The new table of exemptions also includes airplane  tickets but not international airplane tickets.    Espinoza said that the commission would meet yesterday and  was especially designated to determine which products and  services will be exempted.    The luxury items that will have an added 15-percent tax are  vehicles worth more than 4 million bolivares, yachts, billiard  tables, and products such as caviar and salmon, which are  consumed by high-income sectors. Alcoholic beverages and  cigarettes have a special tax that went into effect before VAT  approval.    Among the exemptions, the Finance Ministry and Cordiplan  experts--led by Ministers Carlos Rafael Silva and Hernan  Anzola--are studying medicines sold by the private sector.  Espinoza explained that the new exemptions are added to the  other, comprising 30 percent of the basic market basket.    Among the exemptions are products consumed in cafeterias,  corporate dining rooms, and whatever is purchased in education  establishments.    Espinoza said that the 15-percent tax hike on luxury items  compensates for the exemptions to keep VAT revenues unchanged  for 1994, which had been estimated to be approximately 250  billion bolivares.    This amount will be important to correct the fiscal deficit  and somehow reverse inflation and interest rates, which are  adversely affecting the production sector. It will also serve  to balance the bolivar with respect to foreign currencies,  Espinosa said.    The minister said that VAT will allow the government to  reverse the current picture, adding: "We believe that this is a  temporary, provisional sacrifice, and if it is implemented  quickly with certain correctives on public spending, especially  on debureaucratization, privatization, and decentralization, we  can correct the fiscal deficit during the next government's  first or second year."    We could have a one-digit inflation figure, stabilizing  interest rates so that the production sector can generate more  goods, services, more jobs, and satisfaction, Espinoza added.  <H5>  80 Million in Propaganda </H5>   Meanwhile, Rosana Ordonez, director of the Central  Information Office [OCI], has said VAT approval means that the  tax will be effective on 1 January in its second stage with the  application of Regulation Two, namely, at the retail level.  This is so because until now VAT is only being applied at the  importer level.    Therefore, the government, Finance Ministry basically, will  initiate an information campaign that consists of explaining to  consumers how VAT is paid, of what the crossed tax [impoesto  cruzado] consists, what the exempted items are, what the  tax-paying items are, and how bills are made and in what  outlets, Ordonez said.    She said that this campaign, which has had international  advisers' support, will be publicized on radio, television, and  in the written press, and a series of short television spots  were aired yesterday informing the public about the details.    The OCI minister has said the modifications the economic  advisers made to the government regarding exemptions are being  incorporated into the latest regulation, while luxury items are  being taxed more.    Ordonez concluded that aside from the free information on  VAT  reported by different media, which makes it the more important  campaign due to its explanatory nature, the official executive  campaign will cost an estimated 80 million bolivares.</p>

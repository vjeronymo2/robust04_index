In addition, in &sect;178.345&hyph;3, the following changes are made:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. In paragraph (a)(1), the phrase at the beginning of the sentence ``Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the'' is removed and replaced with the word ``The''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. In paragraph (a)(3), the wording ``paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section'' is revised to read ``paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section'' each place it appears.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Paragraph (d) is removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Paragraphs (e) through (g) are redesignated as paragraphs (d) through (f), and in redesignated paragraph (d) the wording ``cargo tank wall'' is revised to read ``cargo tank shell and heads''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. In &sect;178.345&hyph;5, a new paragraph (f) is added to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;178.345&hyph;5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Manhole assemblies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f) All fittings and devices mounted on a manhole cover, coming in contact with the lading, must withstand the same static internal fluid pressure and contain the same permanent compliance markings as that required for the manhole cover. The fitting or device manufacturer shall verify compliance using the same test procedure and frequency of testing as specified in &sect;178.345&hyph;5(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;178.345&hyph;6  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Amended]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 19. In &sect;178.345&hyph;6, in paragraphs (a) and (b), the second sentence of each paragraph is revised to read ``The design calculations of the support elements must include the stresses indicated in &sect;178.345&hyph;3(b) and as generated by the loads described in &sect;178.345&hyph;3(c).''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. In &sect;178.345&hyph;8, paragraphs (a)(3), (b) introductory text, (b)(1), (c) introductory text, (c)(1), and (d)(3) are revised; and a new paragraph (e) is added to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;178.345&hyph;8  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Accident damage protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Accident damage protection devices attached to the wall of a cargo tank must be able to withstand or deflect away from the cargo tank the loads specified in this section. They must be designed, constructed and installed so as to maximize the distribution of loads to the tank wall and to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting the lading retention integrity of the cargo tank. Accident induced stresses resulting from the appropriate accident damage protection device requirements in combination with the stresses from the tank operating at the MAWP may not result in a tank wall stress greater than the ultimate strength of the material of construction using a safety factor of 1.3. Deformation of the protection device is acceptable provided the devices being protected are not damaged when loads specified in this section are applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Each outlet, projection or piping located in the lower 1/3 of the tank circumference (or cross section perimeter for non-circular tanks) that could be damaged in an accident that may result in the loss of lading must be protected by a bottom damage protection device, except as provided by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and &sect;173.33(e) of this subchapter. Outlets, projections and piping may be grouped or clustered together and protected by a single protection device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Any bottom damage protection device must be able to withstand a force of 155,000 pounds (based on the ultimate strength of the material) from the front, side, or rear, uniformly distributed over each surface of the device, over an area not to exceed 6 square feet, and a width not to exceed 6 feet. Suspension components and structural mounting members may be used to provide all, or part, of this protection. The device must extend no less than 6 inches beyond any component that may contain lading in transit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Each closure for openings, including but not limited to the manhole, filling or inspection openings, and each valve, fitting, pressure relief device, vapor recovery stop valve or lading retaining fitting located in the upper 2/3 of a cargo tank circumference (or cross section perimeter for non-circular tanks) must be protected by being located within or between adjacent rollover damage protection devices, or by being 125 percent of the strength that would be provided by the otherwise required damage protection device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A rollover damage protection device on a cargo tank motor vehicle must be designed and installed to withstand loads equal to twice the weight of the loaded cargo tank motor vehicle applied as follows: normal to the tank shell (perpendicular to the tank surface); and tangential (perpendicular to the normal load) from any direction. The stresses shall not exceed the ultimate strength of the material of construction. These design loads may be considered to be uniformly distributed and independently applied. If more than one rollover protection device is used, each device must be capable of carrying its proportionate share of the required loads and in each case at least one-fourth the total tangential load. The design must be proven capable of carrying the required loads by calculations, tests or a combination of tests and calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The structure of the rear-end protection device and its attachment to the vehicle must be designed to satisfy the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section when subjected to an impact of the cargo tank motor vehicle at rated payload, at a deceleration of 2 ``g''. Such impact must be considered as being uniformly applied in the horizontal plane at an angle of 10 degrees or less to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Longitudinal deceleration protection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In order to account for stresses due to longitudinal impact in an accident, the tank shell and heads must be able to withstand the load resulting from the design pressure in combination with the dynamic pressure resulting from a longitudinal deceleration of 2 ``g''. For this loading condition, the allowable stress value used may not exceed the ultimate strength of the material of construction using a safety factor of 1.3. Performance testing, analytical methods, or a combination thereof, may be used to prove this capability provided the methods are accurate and verifiable. For cargo tanks with internal baffles, the decelerative force may be reduced by 0.25 ``g'' for each baffle assembly, but in no case may the total reduction in decelerative force exceed 1.0 ``g''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. In 178.345&hyph;10, paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) are revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;178.345&hyph;10  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Pressure relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

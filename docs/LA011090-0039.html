			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: BELL-BOTTOM BLUES  </P> <P> The Movie: "Born on the Fourth of July"  </P> <P> The Set-Up: Tom Cruise plays Ron Kovic, gung-ho Marine turned disabled Vietnam  War vet and anti-war activist.  </P> <P> The Look: Spanning three decades, from the apple-pie Eisenhower era to the  riotous political age of the Nixon Administration, the film runs the gamut,  sartorially speaking. Cruise's wardrobe is enormously significant for the way  it reveals his character's personal transformation. Early on, he's the  clean-cut, all-American kid dressed in short sleeve plaid shirts, jeans, and  high tops. After his tour of duty, he's a hippie with long, thinning hair and a  wardrobe of well-worn denim bell bottoms, plaid flannel shirts, ripped Marine  sweat shirts and sandals.  </P> <P> The Labels: Please, don't even ask. For the most part, we're talking Woodstock  Generation.  </P> <P> The Stores: Costumer Judy Ruskin, who worked as an assistant on "Wall Street,"  "Fatal Attraction" and "New York Stories," launched a perfect-oldies quest that  makes a good story in itself. She was driving on the Long Island Expressway,  pulled over because she was exhausted, and happened upon a neighborhood general  store chock full of vintage bell bottoms, Nehru jackets, fringe vests, pointy  '50s "bullet" bras, the works. "We bought the entire contents of the basement,  sight unseen, and sent in a semi-truck to pick it up," Ruskin says. "I was  blessed by the costume gods." Other fashion dinosaurs came from Domsey's, a rag  house in Brooklyn, where Ruskin and her crew sifted through mounds of used  clothing that is dumped onto conveyor belts and ultimately shipped to Third  World countries. Then there was the dry goods store in a small New Hampshire  town, whose attic was stocked with hundreds of period shoes -- original prices  still intact. "There I found everything from '50s saddle shoes to hippie  sandals and clogs to '70s platform shoes," Ruskin says.  </P> <P> The Conflict: Although Cruise had to wear bell bottoms in the film, he despises  them, Ruskin says. "Tom and I have a bet that if bell bottoms ever return to  mainstream fashion, he'll buy me the car of my choice."  </P> <P> The Payoff: The end of the '80s is a apt moment for looking back on past  decades of fashion. The clothes in the film convey transitions in American  style. In particular, we are reminded of the powerful message of clothing in  the '60s, when a resounding political statement could be made simply by tossing  on love beads or a peace symbol.  </P> <P> Postscript: Before his death in April, 1989, Abbie Hoffman made a brief  appearance in the film, playing himself as an anti-war organizer. He's decked  out in a tie-dyed T-shirt, a popular fashion of the love-and-peace generation.  After completing his role in the film, Hoffman gave Ruskin his Woodstock  T-shirt, one simple garment that carries a wealth of meaning. FRANCINE PARNES  </P></p>

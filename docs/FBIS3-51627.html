			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union of Young  Communists [UJC], today denied that there exists in our country  a generational struggle for political power. Contino, the  top-ranking UJC leader and also a member of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, told PRENSA LATINA in  an interview that people are in the habit of talking about a new  generation's taking over from the old and that the term is  inappropriate, because it is like saying: You have come this  far; now only I will go forward, alone.    Contino stressed: There are three generations of  revolutionaries living in Cuba today, who, far from having a  tradition of antagonisms, are in full agreement regarding the  principles, paths, and objectives of the revolutionary process  begun in 1959.    The youth leader also denied that Cuban society is currently  facing a values crisis. He did admit, however, that there are  segments of the youthful population with whom Cuba is having  difficulties because of the national economic situation.</p>

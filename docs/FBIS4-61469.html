			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the heading "Panorama": "Iraqi </F> Embassy in Azerbaijan Is Closing"]    [Text] In the course of a meeting with Minister of Foreign  Affairs of Azerbaijan Hasan Hasanov, Faruq Salman Da'ud, head of  the Iraqi Embassy in Baku, stated that the Iraqi diplomatic  mission in Azerbaijan is being temporarily closed because of the  difficult economic situation that has developed recently in that  country. As the foreign policy department noted while informing  the ANS-PRESS agency about this, F.S. Da'ud stressed that in  view of a shortage of foreign exchange funds in Iraq, the  government of that country has also been compelled to wind down  the operation of diplomatic missions in [word illegible],  Hungary, Romania, Poland, India, and a majority of African  states. With reference to the significance of reinforcing  Azerbaijani-Iraqi relations, the diplomat expressed the hope  that the financial situation of his country will shortly make it  possible to resume operation of the Iraqi Embassy in Baku.</p>

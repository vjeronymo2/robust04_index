			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Sale of many branches likely to be difficult - The Battle for Midland THE PROPOSED merger would result in the closure of 800 to 1,000 branches over the next four years, according to Lloyds. Chartered surveyors believe that the clearing bank might not find it easy to shed so many branches at a time of weak demand, although the disposal programme is unlikely to make a significant impact on the market for high street property. Well-located branches would attract good demand, said Mr Chris Peacock of Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyor. 'However, if the more poorly located secondary and tertiary buildings were offered, there would need to be an upturn in the market in order to implement a successful disposal programme.' In the past year, however, Midland has had no difficulties in disposing of 20 or so branches in secondary and tertiary positions in the south-east, according to its advisers. 'They tend to be prominent sites in the heart of a small community,' said one surveyor. Disposing of bank branches poses particular difficulties. They tend to be housed in substantial stone buildings with few windows - in short, the kind of buildings which need extensive conversion work to render them suitable for retailers. The style and the position of the buildings often lend themselves to fast food outlets, pubs and restaurants, although obtaining planning permission for this change of use can sometimes be difficult. In the past, building societies have been a strong source of demand for unwanted bank branches, although banks were sometimes unwilling to sell their leases to a direct competitor. However, after rapid expansion during the 1980s, building societies have been retrenching. 'The backlog of demand from the building societies is not there,' according to Mr Richard Smith, retail director at Debenhams Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, the property adviser. The closures are likely to make the greatest impact in the Midlands and South Wales, areas where both banks have a large number of branches. However, high streets in these areas have been relatively robust at a time when some parts of the country are struggling badly as a result of surplus space, increased business rates and depressed demand. According to Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyor, retail rents fell by 2.2 per cent in Wales and by 1.1 to 2.2 per cent in the Midlands in the year to February. The proposed bid highlights the large amount of potentially surplus property owned by banks. Lloyds maintains that the same number of branches will be closed even if the banks remain independent. Mr Brian Pitman, its chief executive, believes that half the 20,000 bank and building society branches across the UK will close over the next decade. Over the past three years, Lloyds has closed and merged 400 branches, reducing its total to 1,900, while Midland has closed 180 branches reducing its total to 1,830. Banks have been acutely aware of the need to improve their property management, as their premises account for a significant proportion of their assets. At the end of 1991, the net book value of Midland's property was Pounds 1.1bn with a shortfall between the book and market value of Pounds 226m. At the end of 1990, Lloyds' premises were valued at Pounds 1.2bn. The prospect of several thousand buildings seeking new occupants over the course of the decade raises broader issues about the state of the high street. The growth of out-of-town stores during the 1980s led to concern that high streets were being undermined. However, these fears have tended to subside as high streets have held their own against shopping centres in a difficult letting market. 'The death of the high street is greatly exaggerated,' says Mr Harold Couch of Hillier Parker. Vacancy rates in high streets are relatively low at less than 5 per cent, according to Mr Couch. High street rents have fallen by about 4 per cent in each of the last two years. The banks may experience greater problems in disposing of their London office properties, in a market that is suffering from severe over-supply and poor demand. Both Lloyds and Midland own 19 City properties, according to Applied Property Research, an independent research group. 'In the oversupplied central London market, a rationalisation programme involving the administrative and headquarters office buildings could prove to be problematical, at least in the short term,' said Mr Peacock. 'However the well located branch offices in established retail pitches will attract considerable interest.' 'This will be a further test of the banks' ingenuity in coping with surplus space at a time when they have already found extreme difficulty in disposing of such buildings,' said Mr Geoff Marsh of APR.</p>

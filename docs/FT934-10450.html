			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Doubt on London bus deregulation THE CABINET yesterday agreed an outline legislative programme for the next parliamentary session starting in two weeks' time without deciding whether to proceed with the deregulation of London buses. Ministers settled on a moderately heavy programme focusing as expected on law and order and deregulation. But they have still not made up their minds whether to remove legislation to implement bus deregulation from the wide-ranging deregulation bill. The reason for withdrawing the plans would be the desire of some ministers - believed to include Mr John Major - to excise controversial issues from a programme that is supposed to unite the Conservative party.</p>

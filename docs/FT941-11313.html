			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: ITT in line with expectations ITT, the US conglomerate with operations spanning financial services, hotels and manufacturing, met market expectations with a steady advance in operating results in all its main business areas in the final quarter of 1993. After-tax profits for the period were Dollars 219m, or Dollars 1.67 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 617m a year before, when the company took a variety of charges on its consumer finance and paper businesses. The figures do not include figures for the forest products business, which ITT said in December will be spun off to shareholders. ITT Hartford, the group's insurance company, recorded a 26 per cent rise in operating income, excluding portfolio gains, largely as a result of improved underwriting experience in the casualty business. Insurance earnings were Dollars 719m, while earnings in the consumer finance business rose to Dollars 271m from Dollars 175m. Manufactured products, which saw a rise in operating earnings to Dollars 310m from Dollars 103m, benefited from higher anti-lock break sales in the US and cost reductions. These pushed up earnings at ITT Automotives by 40 per cent year-on-year. ITT Sheraton saw a 40 per cent improvement in earnings in its US operations from a year before, lifting operating earnings in the hotels business to Dollars 78m from a loss of Dollars 26m the year before. For the year as a whole, ITT reported net income of Dollars 913m, compared with a loss of Dollars 885m the year before. On Wall Street, the company's shares rose Dollars 1 1/2 to close at Dollars 100 7/8.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 24 Feb (TANJUG) -- Colonel Mark Wood,  special envoy of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] commander  for the former Yugoslavia, Jean Cot, today talked in Knin to  representatives of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] about the  problem of the Okucani bridge.    Citing unofficial sources, SRNA [news agancy] says that the  bridge near Okucani linking RSK and the Srpska republic will be  discussed tomorrow in Belgrade by Yasushi Akashi, special envoy  of Butrus-Ghali, and RSK President Milan Martic.    This morning at about 0530 UNPROFOR units completely blocked  all roads between western Slavonia and this bridge. The "blue  helmets" denied access even to trucks carrying bread.    Several hundred citizens gathered at about 1100 near the  bridge to protest against this blockade.    As we have unofficially learned in Knin, the members of the  RSK ministry for internal affairs, who control the bridge, have  no intention of abandoning it. At today's talks Colonel Wood  received an offer whereby members of UNPROFOR may control the  bridge along with Krajina's police, SRNA says.</p>

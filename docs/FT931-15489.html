			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris weakens on poor LVMH results THE continent was mixed yesterday as tension in the Gulf generally kept activity subdued, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was disappointed by the unscheduled 1992 earnings report from LVMH, which was prompted by a bearish statement from Guinness, the UK drinks group with which LVMH has a cross-shareholding. The CAC-40 index fell 21.05 to 1,793.53 in steady turnover of FFr2.1bn. Shares in LVMH and its affiliated companies, Christian Dior, Au Bon Marche, Agache and Arnault et Associes were suspended pending the statement. They are due to be re-quoted today. LVMH later said that 1992 net group profit would fall 20 per cent to FFr3bn from FFr3.74bn the previous year, due in part to the restructuring costs at Guinness. The UK company disclosed that it would take a Pounds 125m exceptional charge in its 1992 accounts to fund a three-year re-organisation. TF1, the television station, rose FFr18.60 to FFr405.50 amid reports of a change in its programming structure which should lead to lower costs. FRANKFURT continued to play a waiting game, moving Volkswagen and and Siemens ahead of meetings today and tomorrow as the DAX index ended 1.77 lower at 1,530.19. Turnover rose from DM3.7bn to DM4.2bn. VW recovered another DM6.40 to DM262.90 ahead of today's extraordinary board meeting, on a report that it plans to cut 30,000 jobs by the end of 1994. Siemens, which led the market down late last week, rose DM5.10 to DM577.80. Analysts expect the electronics group to report a slight fall in first-quarter profits at its annual news conference tomorrow. Commerzbank ended DM1.90 lower at DM241.10 and, after the close, announced a one-for-11 rights issue at DM200 a share. AMSTERDAM advanced on selective buying, with the CBS Tendency index rising 0.4 to 96.4. Nedlloyd, which saw a day's high of Fl 29.40 as buyers returned after Monday's 10 per cent fall, closed 20 cents ahead at Fl 27.60. Publishers showed activity with Elsevier up 80 cents at Fl 123.90 and VNU rising Fl 1.10 to Fl 92.60 on recent positive brokers' forecasts. MILAN staged a late recovery from earlier lows thanks to gains in Generali and Credito Italiano, and the Comit index rose 1.9 to 451.11 in turnover estimated at not more than Monday's L196bn. The launch of the Republic of Italy's DM5bn Eurobond also boosted sentiment. Generali rose L5 to settle at L30,000 lire but then gained a further L800 after hours. Credito Italiano rose L142 or 4.8 per cent to L3,117 on a newspaper report that its privatisation was well under way. The state-controlled food group Sme, another privatisation candidate, rose L63 to L5,883. ZURICH recovered from Monday's decline, the SMI index closing 29.8 higher at 2,079.3. Lower interest rates lifted financials, UBS bearers rising SFr15 to SFr875. Adia bearers rose SFr19 to SFr220 and certificates by SFr3 to SFr27.50 on rumours that the temporary employment group planned to swap its certificates into bearer stock. MADRID featured a 5.5 per cent gain in Ebro, up Pta75 to Pta1,425, on news earlier in the week that Grupo Torras, the Spanish investment division of the KIO, is putting its 36 per cent stake up for sale. The general index lost 0.26 to 219.11. BRUSSELS saw continued interest in Delhaize which fell BFr12 to BFr1,266 on profit-taking after recent strong gains. The Bel-20 index closed 1.90 higher at 1,146.01 in turnover of BFr933m. STOCKHOLM closed lower in a continued reaction to the presentation of the government's budget proposal for the fiscal year 1993/94 on Monday. The downgrading of six Swedish banks and financial institutions by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, also weighed on sentiment, with the banking sector slipping 3.1 per cent. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 7.9 to 935.2 in turnover of SKr708m. HELSINKI closed lower for a third straight session as government plans to lower the nominal value of bank shares in compensation for state support sent the sector's shares lower. The bank and finance index fell a further 6.7 per cent while the HEX index lost 10.0 to 878.20. OSLO was encouraged by rises in Norsk Hydro and Hafslund as the all-share index gained 6.14 or 1.6 per cent to 392.0 in turnover of NKr185m. Hafslund's B-shares advanced NKr7 to NKr159 on news that the US Food and Drug Administration had granted approval for the marketing there of Omniscan which is used in magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Norsk Hydro gained NKr2.5 to NKr165.5. VIENNA fell back after data showed unemployment at its highest level in 39 years. The ATX index lost 5.12 to 716.23 with OMV falling Sch7 to Sch587.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 12                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1070.82    1069.55    1070.00    1070.44 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1154.79    1152.97    1154.00    1155.39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1072.12    1072.08    1072.15    1071.43 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1155.38    1153.95    1151.22    1152.84  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jan 11     Jan 8     Jan 7     Jan 6     Jan 5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1069.87   1080.25   1081.92   1091.68   1090.07 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1155.95   1167.34   1171.90   1179.18   1180.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1073.33 ; 200 - 1156.98 Low/day: 100 - 1069.10  200 - 1151.12.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 22 for 2 </F> February 1994; by Andrey Pershin, Andrey Petrovskiy, and  Vladimir Shishlin, edited by Boris Grishchenko]    [Text] President Yeltsin has called on deputies of the  Federal Assembly to bring the temporary rules of the Federation  Council and the State Duma in line with the Russian  Constitution. In compliance with the Constitution, the houses  of the Federal Assembly pass decisions by a majority vote from  the total number of members of the Federation Council and  deputies to the State Duma correspondingly in all cases except  where the Constitution says otherwise, reads the president's  address spread on Tuesday in the Russian parliament.    When the houses passed the temporary rules, the notion "the  total number of deputies" was interpreted as the number of  effectively elected of each of the houses. In line with the  Constitution, the total number of deputies in the Duma is 450  and in the Federation Council-- 178, while elected were 444 and  171 respectively.    The interpretation of the notion "total number of deputies"  as the number of the elected deputies suggests the recognition  that the houses consist of a different number of deputies than  that envisaged by the Russian Constitution. Thus the decisions  of the houses cannot be considered constitutional, believes the  Russian president. It follows that when the houses adopted their  provisional rules, deputies violated provisions of Articles 95,  102 and 103 of the Russian Constitution, said Yeltsin.    The presidential message says that the loose interpretation  of the constitutional norms enables both houses of the Federal  Assembly in the future to adopt laws and other decisions  contrary to the requirements of the Russian Constitution.    IF Note: In connection with the president's message,  parliamentary observers note that the speaker of the State Duma  Ivan Rybkin had received 223 votes in his favor to become  speaker. This means he was elected by a one vote majority out  of the number of the elected deputies. The points made by  Yeltsin virtually call into question the fact that Rybkin was  elected constitutionally, which, some experts believe, could  lead to a deterioration in the relationships between the  president and the Duma.    Meanwhile, at the Federation Council session Wednesday,  deputies turned down the presidential amendments which proposed  to count votes out of the total number of the Federation Council  members, not from among those elected. If passed, such a  decision would have meant the relieving of the chairman of the  Federation Council and his deputies and the election of members  of Federation Council committees.</p>

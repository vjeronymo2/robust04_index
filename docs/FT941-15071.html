			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Jordanian death sentences Three Moslem fundamentalists in Jordan have been sentenced to death for plotting to assassinate King Hussein at a university ceremony last June, writes James Whittington in Amman. All are members of the banned Islamic Liberation party which seeks to establish an Islamic state in Jordan. Two of the men were sentenced in absentia while seven others were given 15 years' hard labour. The sentences will now, for the first time, be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. Previously only King Hussein could commute military sentences.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET WATCH: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> FUND CHOICES GROW -- AS DO ADVISORY SERVICES;  </P> <P> INVESTMENT: THERE IS AN ARRAY OF NEWSLETTERS TO FIGURE OUT WHICH FUNDS ARE  BEST. BUT IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT THE NEWSLETTERS.  </P> <P> Have trouble picking stocks? Try looking for a mutual fund. The choices are  dizzying.  </P> <P> There's stock, bond, growth, global, flexible, balanced, convertible and mixed  funds -- to name a few. There are loads, no loads, high fees and low fees. In  fact, there are twice as many mutual funds as companies listed on the New York  Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Not surprising, there is also a wide variety of measures to gauge mutual fund  performance. And a plethora of publications trying to help investors sort it  all out.  </P> <P> "With the proliferation of mutual funds, we've seen a proliferation of  newsletters and services that purport to follow the funds and advise investors  as to which funds they should consider," said Patricia Harden, spokeswoman for  Fidelity Investments, one of the nation's largest mutual fund companies. Do  they work? "Yes and no," Harden said.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, investors have been barraged with several more -- from  Business Week's two-part series to Forbes' expansive tome, as well as rankings  by Lipper Analytical Services, which are published quarterly in The Times.  </P> <P> But these rankings and ratings may just add to the confusion because few  consider the same funds to be top-notch.  </P> <P> "In general, most of the services are quite accurate," said A. Michael Lipper,  president of Lipper Analytical Services in New York, which tracks mutual fund  performance. "The differences are not mistakes but different measurement  techniques."  </P> <P> Business Week tries to account for risk, while Forbes looks at performance in  down markets. And The Times simply publishes rankings of total return over  specific periods of time. Other services weigh in a wide variety of measures,  including fund size and liquidity.  </P> <P> But even when rankings do agree, experts say it is not always advisable to pick  last quarter's or last year's top performer.  </P> <P> "It is probably wrong to pick the short-term top performer, because they rarely  repeat over a short period of time." said Ken Waggoner, spokesman for T. Rowe  Price Associates in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> So how does one choose?  </P> <P> First, investors must answer a raft of personal questions, starting with their  age, affluence and willingness to take risks, said William E. Donoghue,  publisher of Donoghue's Moneyletter, a newsletter on choosing mutual funds.  They also have to decide whether they want to make investment decisions  themselves -- and possibly save commissions and fees by buying into a no-load  fund -- or whether they are willing to pay more for the counsel of a financial  planner or broker. Finally, they must determine whether this is a short-term or  a long-term investment, and whether they plan to watch it closely.  </P> <P> Watching long-term investments on a day-to-day basis is a big mistake because  sometimes investors panic and sell at the wrong time, "turning what might be a  brilliant long-term decision into a disastrous short-term investment," Lipper  said.  </P> <P> Then it's time to look at the rankings and ratings. The two differ because the  first simply reports yields, while the other tries to factor in additional  information, such as risks, liquidity, investment objectives and the like.  </P> <P> The rankings are helpful because they provide a simple, objective measure of a  fund's return over specific periods of time. Firms such as Lipper report these  yields over periods as short as a week and as long as 30 years.  </P> <P> Others try to qualify the numbers by looking at additional measures to  determine overall performance.  </P> <P> The recent Business Week rating, for example, assesses risks by weighing in the  volatility of the funds' investments. Business Week, consequently, recommends  some lower-yielding funds because they are considered low risk.  </P> <P> Still, experts acknowledge that the risk formula is flawed in that it can only  track volatility as a proxy for risk. It cannot weigh the less quantifiable  dangers in the underlying portfolio. Consequently, junk bond funds may come out  as "low-risk" ventures because their returns were relatively stable until  recently.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Forbes ranks funds by total annual yields, but it also grades them  on their performance during good times and bad. Some of the top-yielding funds  -- such as the US Gold Shares fund -- got "D" ratings during both good and bad  market cycles, Forbes reported.  </P> <P> Others, such as the Mexico Fund, did spectacularly well during up markets but  relatively poorly when the market soured. And the Strategic Investments Fund  got an "F" for its performance during good markets and a "D" for bad. How it  become one of the top yielders on Forbes' Feb. 5 listing is unclear.  </P> <P> RATING THE MUTUAL FUNDS  </P> <P> The top-performing funds and their rate of return according to three recent  surveys.  </P> <P> Lipper and Forbes returns are for 1989. Business Week lists average.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.21IN:3.32IN:3.10IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Lipper Analytical  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Forbes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Business Week  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Alger Small  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mexico Fund (67.3)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fidelity  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Capital (65.08)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Overseas  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> US Gold Shares  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> US Gold Shares  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Merrill Lynch  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (64.73)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (64.7)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pacific (33.7)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Strategic  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> One Hundred  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Japan (32.0)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Investments (61.21)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fund (64.3)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> GT Global Growth:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Strategic  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Trustees-Comm  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Japan (60.73)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Investments (61.3)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Intl Eq (30.7)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Financial Port:  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Van Eck  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kleinwort-Benson  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Health (59.72)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> International (51.2)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Intl Eq (30.7)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Vanguard Wld-  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Intl Growth (30.70  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *formerly Drexel Burnham Fund  </P></p>

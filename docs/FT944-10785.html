			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Deal within guidelines Sir, To set the record straight, the Royal Mail's pay deal with the executive of the Union of Communication Workers ('Royal Mail flouts pay freeze with 3.4 per cent offer', November 5) does not breach government pay guidelines. The deal consists of an increase in basic pay of 2.5 per cent plus a further 0.3 per cent in respect of current unrewarded productivity improvements. Its effect on the annual pay bill is a net reduction of about 0.2 per cent provided by a fall in headcount. The 'supplement' of Pounds 1.50 does not add a further 0.6 per cent to earnings as stated by you. It is, in fact, a straight transfer from non-pensionable pay to pensionable pay of that amount, and it will lead to a small reduction in take-home pay because of the employees' contribution to the pension scheme. Mark Callanan, national head of remuneration and employment, Royal Mail, 148 Old Street, London EC1V 9HQ</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Yang Yung-nian (2799 3057 1628) </F> stationed in Southwest China: "Tibet Further Stabilizes  Situation, Determined To Deal With Separatists According to Law"]    [Text] Lhasa, 26 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- In an exclusive  interview with this reporter in Lhasa a few days ago, Gyaincain  Norbu, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's  Government, pointed out: "The situation in Tibet has been  further stabilized, national unity has been further solidified,  and public security has further improved."    While expressing profound confidence in the struggle against  Tibetan separatists, Gyaincain Norbu emphatically pointed out  the necessity of maintaining vigilance amid the atmosphere of  optimism. He said: "The struggle between separatists and  antiseparatists in the region is a protracted, acute, and  complicated one." The regional government leader went on to  explain: "With the support of the international anti-Chinese  forces, the Dalai clique took advantage of some social hot spots  in the hinterland, such as the problems of commodity prices and  taxation, to try its utmost to disrupt unity and stability and  obstruct reform and development in Tibet." He added:  "Certainly, we maintain a high degree of vigilance. Whether  the separatists, particularly the plotters behind the scenes,  take advantage of the hot spots in society or directly flaunt  the banner of `Tibet independence,' we will adopt resolute and  decisive measures to deal with them according to the law."    Recently, when interviewed by this reporter on another  occasion, Tudeng, head of the Public Health Department of the  Tibet Autonomous Region, said that the period between 1997 and  2000 will see a baby boom in Tibet, so it is anticipated that  the population of Tibet will exceed 2.5 million by the year  2000. The birth rate in Tibet last year was 23.4 per thousand,  and allowing for the number of deaths, the natural growth rate  was 15.6 per thousand, while the natural growth rate across the  country during the same period was approximately 11 per  thousand. By the end of last year, there were some 2.2 million  people in the entire region, a net increase of 36,000 people  over 1992, and more than double as compared with the population  in the 1950's. The average life-span of Tibetans has also  increased to 65 from 36 in the 1950's.</p>

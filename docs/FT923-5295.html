			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Accountants link in challenge to US litigation THE six leading accountancy firms in the US have united in a campaign to change the liability system, to try to reduce their exposure to litigation. The current US liability system is 'out of control' and 'seriously lacking in logic, fairness and balance', the firms say in a statement to partners and clients being circulated this week. Their campaign reflects concern in the industry about the escalation in litigation, mainly against auditors to companies which have collapsed or been subject to sharp falls in their share prices. The groups are launching an intensive lobbying drive to persuade legislators in federal and local government to introduce a process of litigation which would assess claims against defendants in proportion to their degree of responsibility. Under the existing system of 'joint and several liability' every defendant is liable for up to 100 per cent of the value of a claim, no matter how limited its role. Accountants are often taken to court because they are perceived to have 'deep pockets', according to the firms. The campaign is an unusual collaboration between the so-called 'big six' firms, the largest accountancy organisations by fee income and staff both in North America and around the world which compete fiercely against each other. The firms - Arthur Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG Peat Marwick and Price Waterhouse - are collaborating with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and other professional and trade bodies to bring about reform. They also criticise the fact that there is no provision in the US legal system for the recovery of legal costs by defendants, regardless of the merit of the case brought against them. This encourages firms to settle cases rather than risk larger costs by fighting. The statement says the total costs of settling and defending lawsuits among the six groups was Dollars 477m (Pounds 239.6m) last year, representing 9 per cent of auditing and accounting revenues, up from 7.7 per cent in 1990. It says the cost of litigation is a serious threat to the financial reporting system, the strength of US capital markets and the competitiveness of the economy. It estimates that there are now about 4,000 outstanding lawsuits facing the US accountancy profession as a whole, with a value of Dollars 30bn in claims. A survey among the six groups last year showed the average claim was for Dollars 85m, the average settlement was Dollars 2.7m and the average legal cost per claim Dollars 3.5m. The larger firms complain that their insurance premiums are far higher than for smaller counterparts, with sharp reductions in policy limits and a rapid increase in deductibles to more than Dollars 25m.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Dutch rescue keeps Daf on the road: Government intervention is unlikely to cause political controversy State ownership of industry in the Netherlands has never been widespread. So this weekend's Fl 195m (Pounds 73.50m) government rescue of Daf, the troubled Dutch truckmaker that was plunged into receivership three weeks ago, puts the authorities in the novel position of controlling almost half of one of the country's best-known companies. The government's intervention reflects deep concern over the state of domestic industry. Recently, a string of 'crown jewels' ranging from Philips, the electronics group, to Fokker, the aircraft maker, have either fallen on hard times or have had to turn to foreign companies for assistance. Unlike Britain, where privatisation has had strong ideological overtones, the instrument of state intervention is a highly pragmatic one in the Netherlands; it is designed to provide sufficient breathing space for a company to put its house back in order. The government's investment in the new slimmed-down Daf Trucks NV which will be set up this week, will make it the biggest single shareholder with a stake of more than 42 per cent in the successor venture. But the government is a reluctant participant; it does not see itself as a long-term investor. A similar approach was taken with Fokker in the late-1980s: the state acquired 32 per cent of the aircraft maker's shares in a bail-out in 1987 but made clear from the outset that the company would eventually have to find a strong partner if it wanted to develop new generations of aeroplanes. In drawing up a rescue package for Daf, both the Dutch and the Flemish region of Belgium - where Daf's axle and cab plant in based - were driven by a keen sense of pragmatism: both wanted to safeguard only those jobs in their territories. The Dutch wanted to preserve 2,750 of the 7,000 jobs at Daf's home base in Eindhoven, while the Belgians were keen to safeguard 750 of the 1,500 jobs in Westerlo. The fate of Daf's UK subsidiary, Leyland Daf, which employed 5,500 people until the present crisis arose, is seen as a matter for the UK government. The British government has refused to inject capital in the same way as the Dutch and the Belgians. The links between the Dutch and the UK plants, however, mean that UK receivers have been able to secure potential supply agreements for the British factories. This will help the factories to find the market solution to their problems desired by the UK government. The reluctance of Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade and industry secretary, to intervene is not just because of the government's espousal of free-market principles; his reluctance is also attributable to past support by successive governments (Labour and Tory) for Leyland when it was part of the wider British Leyland car, bus and truck group. British Leyland still failed to find its feet despite millions of pounds of state aid, Mr Heseltine said. No such political controversy is likely to be stirred in the Netherlands over the Dutch government's financial support for Daf. On the contrary, public opinion has been skilfully mobilised in support of the company. Last week, unions and Daf's works council ran a successful campaign under the motto 'Keep Daf on the road' to persuade more than 70,000 people and companies to pledge Fl 12.5m towards a special Daf bond. Among the telephone subscribers to the bonds were the Dutch prime minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers, and all the members of the PSV football club, which is based in Daf's home town of Eindhoven. The government's decisive support of Daf does not, however, mean that it has entered into an open-ended commitment. The rescue package - the first undertaken by the government so far in the 1990s - differs from the interventions of the 1960s and 1970s, when billions of guilders in the form of state aid, grants and subsidies were poured into the shipbuilding and textile industries. These state injections were designed to save jobs at all costs in declining industries. But the policy failed, giving state intervention a bad name during the late-1980s. Under Mr Koos Andriessen, the economic affairs minister, the Netherlands has moved to a policy of promoting high-skilled jobs rather than simply seeking to preserve employment in declining sectors. Mr Andriessen believes Daf is a company worth saving - at least in the Netherlands - because of its high-tech base, its links with Dutch research institutes, and its importance to smaller local suppliers. Mr Heseltine has the same belief in the UK Daf operations. But he insists that if they are to be bailed out then it should be by the market - not the government. The new Daf Trucks NV is, in effect, retreating to the heavy and medium-truck base which characterised its activities before its takeover of Leyland in 1987. It is for this reason that the new company has indicated that it may be able to accommodate distribution of the Birmingham-made 45 series light van. The rescue of Daf, however, is a risky venture that could yet cause political embarrassment in the Netherlands if the company goes down a second time, this time with government money. As it is, shareholders who participated in Daf's flotation in 1989 have lost their investment, and subscribers to this weekend's 'Save Daf' bond appeal run the risk that their loan to the company may prove worthless if things go wrong again. In which case, Mr Lubbers will have lost both the government's money and his own Fl 1,000 contribution to the Daf appeal.</p>

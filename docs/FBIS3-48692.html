			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A preliminary decision has been made on the issue  concerning the government procurement of 11 supercomputers with  the first supplementary budget for fiscal 1993. At this point,  the decision has been nearly made on which makers will supply 10  supercomputers: five will be procured from domestic makers while  the other five will be from American makers. It appears to be a  well-balanced decision, considering the fact that the government  procurement issue is regarded as a major sector at the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. However, in addition to  the fact that Cray Research Inc., the largest U.S. maker, has  been asking for revamping of the procurement procedures,  Japanese research institutes that will purchase these  supercomputers have voiced their dissatisfaction with the stiff  attitude of the United States. Since it is believed that  another five or more computers will be procured in the next  fiscal year, this decision may arouse future problems.    With the original budget for fiscal 1993, the government has  procured four computers: two from NEC and one each from Hitachi  Ltd. and Fujitsu. Then, in the bidding for procurement with the  supplementary budget, what was noteworthy was the bidding of a  "Japan-U.S. alliance," with Japanese companies providing  American supercomputers. This alliance came into being because  many research institutes asked for parallel-processing  computers, which are equipped with a large number of  microprocessing units (MPU) that are capable of data processing.    So far, in the bidding for the so-called "vector-type"  conventional supercomputers, the competition was limited to four  companies: Cray, Fujitsu, NEC, and Hitachi. However, in the  bidding for parallel-type computers, Intel Corp. of the United  States, the largest maker of MPUs used for personal computers,  and another U.S. maker, Thinking Machines [name as published],  have also strengthened their competitive power. And those  Japanese makers or system designers that do not possess their  own powerful products have one after another started to rely on  U.S. products. Thus, it has been voiced in the computer  industry that "Japan-U.S. friction can no longer be regarded as  a simple issue."    On 28 January, the Science and Technology Agency and the  Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Cooperation will  decide on which maker they provide the 10th supercomputer that  will be purchased with the supplementary budget funds. However,  it is expected that the lone bidder, Cray, will get the order  without any competition after the checking of its price and  technological specifications. Moreover, when the Ministry of  Health and Welfare's National Cancer Center holds its bidding  for the last supercomputer in February, it is believed that the  bidding will be favorable to American makers.    However, Cray will certainly be dissatisfied with the  results  because it will end up winning orders for only two computers  despite its objective of four or five. Cray's failure was  caused by Fujitsu's "overwhelming" success in winning orders for  four units. In its competition with Cray, Fujitsu gained high  marks in its products' performance. Moreover, its price was  lower by a large margin. In this connection, other companies,  such as NEC and Hitachi, are determined to "make a comeback in  the next fiscal year."    Kazuyoshi Hori, president of Cray Research in Japan,  maintained: "Under the current system of checking technological  features, examiners generally swallow all the data supplied by  makers. A third-party organ should be set up for conducting  more strict examinations." He also suggested: "To put a brake  on the price war, there should be a minimum price in the  bidding." He also pointed out that if the price should fall far  below the fund set aside in the budget, it will virtually become  the criteria in working out the budget for the next procurement,  and "this will bring about trouble for concerned research  institutes."    Concerning this opinion, some research institute sources  have stated: "Generally speaking, what he has pointed out makes  good sense." However, when it comes to concrete measures, many  have said: "How will the minimum price be decided? Moreover,  makers' efforts to cut costs should not be ignored."  Furthermore, they have long been dissatisfied with the fact  that aside from issues connected with research work, priority  has to be given to such problems as the Japan-U.S. friction.  Reportedly, U.S. officials paid visits, under the pretext of  hearings, to every Japanese research institution on separate  occasions before the biddings. There is also a growing  opposition to such a practice.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The Russian Foreign Ministry  has accused the United Nations of overstepping its mandate by  asking NATO if it would launch air strikes against Serb  positions in Bosnia. These air strikes are also at the center  of debate in Belgium. Defense Minister Leo Delcroix expressed  reservations yesterday evening despite the fact that Foreign  Minister Willy Claes was clearly in favor. Jean-Pierre  Jacquemin interviewed the foreign minister:    [Begin recording] [Claes] I had several phone conversations  during the weekend with the prime minister as well as with my  colleague the defense minister.    [Jacquemin] Leo Delcroix has in fact expressed reservations  regarding these air strikes. He justified his position by the  presence in Bosnia of Belgian troops, who would be threatened if  air strikes were launched.    [Claes] I understand that the defense minister is worried  about the security of the peacekeeping troops. He is only doing  his duty. But I am a bit puzzled by the warning given by some  military experts. These air strikes were agreed upon by the UN  Security Council more than a year ago. I suppose the military  experts were asked to give their opinion at that time.    [Jacquemin] Are there any differences between you and Leo  Delcroix within the government?    [Claes] No, I don't think so. The politician should  sometimes make risky decisions. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: New trust from the Kleinwort Benson stable Kleinwort Benson Investment Trust Management announced yesterday that it had placed Pounds 22.5m of shares for the launch of its new investment trust. The placing was made with institutions, stockbrokers and intermediaries, and Kleinwort Benson is now seeking another Pounds 7.5m via a public offer. Kleinwort Endowment Policy Trust will be the first investment trust to invest solely in unmatured life assurance endowment policies which have been surrendered by their original holders. Levels of surrender for these policies have been very high in the last three years, as they are often taken out as repayment vehicles for mortgages. Several companies have started making a market in them - aiming usually at small investors. There has also been strong demand for them from continental Europe. The KEPT aims to spend the first year of its life buying endowments - the trust will have a fixed life span of 11 years. The offer for subscription will close on July 21, with dealings expected to start on July 27. Smith New Court has organised both the placement and the offer.</p>

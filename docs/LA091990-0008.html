			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDEMNED TO REPEAT HISTORY;  </P> <P> PERSIAN GULF: CALLS FOR JAPAN TO RELAX ITS CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON OFFENSIVE ARMS  COULD INVITE A RETURN TO MILITARY BELLIGERENCE.  </P> <P> Fulminations from Congress and President George Bush for a muscular Japanese  presence in the Middle East conjures up George Santayana's aphorism: "Those who  cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." By tacitly rebuking  Japan's constitutional ban on offensive arms or deployments as a mere pretext  for evading its international Middle East responsibilities, the United States  is encouraging a reprise of Japanese belligerence.  </P> <P> On Sept. 12, the House of Representatives voted 370 to 53 to commence  withdrawing 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan unless that nation funds  their full $7.4-billion annual cost. The vote expressed congressional  resentment against the diminutive Japanese contribution to enforcing  international sanctions against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.  </P> <P> The vote prompted Japan to boost its Middle East financial assistance from $2  billion to $4 billion, and to send medical personnel there. But Japan has  resisted any direct military nexus with the cordon sanitaire around Iraq. It  points to Article 9 of its 1947 Constitution, engineered by Gen. Douglas  MacArthur, that renounces "the threat or use of force as a means of settling  international disputes" and the maintenance of "land, sea, and air forces, as  well as other war potential."  </P> <P> A strict administration of Article 9 is indispensable to peace and stability in  Asia and the Pacific. The United States is foolishly currying a menacing  Japanese military juggernaut in these areas by urging a sweeping construction  for short-sighted domestic political benefits.  </P> <P> Japanese traditions celebrate a sense of superiority over other peoples and  international assertiveness. The 1894-95 Sino-Japanese War, the suzerainty over  Korea from 1910 to 1945, the 1931 invasion of Manchuria and Pearl Harbor are  illustrative. The Japanese have also eschewed a World War II peace treaty with  the Soviet Union because of the former's territorial claims to the Kurile  Islands.  </P> <P> Japan generally treats its Korean population with disdain. Japanese textbooks  repeatedly seek to gloss over the "Rape of Nanking" and mistreatment of Koreans  during Japan's prolonged occupation.  </P> <P> Japanese culture has resisted acceptance of war guilt for World War II; Japan  declined vigorous prosecution of officials implicated in World War II  atrocities in domestic tribunals, and, it did not exorcise from public life all  collaborators with World War II militarists to strengthen attachment to  democratic norms. In sharp contrast, post-World War II West Germany undertook  steps to reinforce unequivocal renunciation of Nazism.  </P> <P> During the next decade, the United States will dramatically reduce or end its  military presence in Japan, the Philippines and South Korea. The United States  has already begun phasing out its 16,000 troop presence at Subic Bay Naval Base  and Clark Air Base, and parallel reductions are scheduled in South Korea.  Domestic demands in the United States for a balanced budget, coupled with the  end of U.S.-Soviet military antagonisms, make such shrinking politically  inevitable.  </P> <P> Simultaneously, Japanese self-defense forces, permitted under Article 9, will  expand to counteract the U.S. shortfall. At present, Japan has the  third-largest defense budget in the world, and possesses the technical  sophistication and economic sinews to transform its forces into an offensive  monster instantaneously. The Japanese political incentives for offensive  armament are threefold: the recapture of the Kurile Islands, the domination of  foreign nations holding resources vital to Japan's economic colossus and  military parity with its foremost and nuclear-armed Asian rivals -- China and  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Article 9 stands as a bulwark against worrisome global influences that are  pushing Japan toward military boldness. It is penny-wise but pound-foolish for  the United States to urge a relaxation of it to combat the short-term gulf  crisis. Any glib evasion around the article would threaten a precedent that  might haunt posterity and amity throughout Asia and the Pacific.  </P></p>

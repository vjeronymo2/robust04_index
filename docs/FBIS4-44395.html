			<p>CSO     [Summary] The planned cotton area in Liaoning Province  this year is 1 million mu, as of the middle of March only  800,000 mu had been planted. Farmers do not want to plant  cotton because profits from grain and cash crops are higher.  Cotton degeneration is severe, thus it is difficult to raise  quality and output. There is a shortage of funds to support  cotton planting, which affects farmer enthusiasm to plant cotton.</p>

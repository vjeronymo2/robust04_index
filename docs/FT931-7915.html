			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Scheme to buy empty dwellings likely to beat 20,000 target A Pounds 750m government programme to buy 20,000 empty properties to provide housing for the needy will almost certainly beat its target, according to figures to be presented to officials this week. The scheme to help the depressed British housing market, announced in the Autumn Statement in November, is due to finish at the end of next month. Just over half the 16,500 empty properties acquired so far have been bought from recession-hit housebuilders, according to the Housing Corporation, responsible for administering three-quarters of the money. Another two fifths of the homes have been bought on the open market from members of the public. Less than a tenth have been repossessed homes. The findings will disappoint building societies and banks, which have been struggling to reduce their estimated 65,000 stock of unsold repossessed properties. A total of 200,000 empty homes is estimated to be on the market. The corporation says many of the repossessed homes offered to housing associations have been in poor condition. Properties must be suitable for immediate occupation if the programme is to be completed in time. English housing associations under the scheme are to receive Pounds 577m. The rest of the money is to be spread between right-to-buy schemes, local authorities and housing action groups in Wales and Scotland. Almost three quarters of the English budget is to be spent on properties in the south-east, which has been targeted by the government as the housing market worst hit by the recession. English associations so far have agreed to 16,500 purchases involving Pounds 530m of grants. They have already exceeded their target of 16,000 homes by the end of March. The final total is likely to be between 17,000 and 17,500 according to the Corporation. It says associations have been able to take advantage of falling house prices. Builders offered special deals to reduce the amount of unsold stock on their books. Public sector grants under the scheme are expected to provide 60 per cent of the sale price. The rest of the money is expected to be provided from private investors. In total associations have spent nearly Pounds 1bn. Almost 5,000 families and individuals have already been housed under the scheme, says the Corporation.</p>

Alevras is cited as saying that "socialism is not only an  ideology but a lifestyle as well." Those who govern, he added,  must live within the "most transparent of walls." He criticized  the government for forgetting the "still existing  underprivileged" Greeks and for its "continuing unstable  course," accusing it of being concerned solely with the economic  crisis and its diplomatic efforts on Macedonia. Alevras blamed  the party leadership for organizing the congress with "unseemly  haste" and for "hunting votes." The article notes the attack  was a "first" for Alevras, who declared he is not a candidate  for any position. An editorial in the 16 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA  noted that the much-applauded Alevras "told many truths," which  are subscribed to by all concerned about the crisis of  confidence that prevails in Greek political life. The editorial  also noted that government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, whose  reply to Alevras' statements was "rather ironical," did not show  Alevras the respect he deserves.  <H5>  Simitas on Solution of Country's Problems </H5>   The same article in the 16 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA reported  Minister of Industry and Commerce Kostas Simitis as indirectly  criticizing the government during the congress. Simitis  declared that the country will solve its problems by achieving a  competitive economy through interaction with the international  environment, ending the tendency to make "subjects" out of  "citizens," redistributing income and wealth by taxing large  economic interests, becoming more sensitive on tax evasion  matters, and no longer allowing party members to become "mere  professional politicians." He added that "unity" must become the  PASOK password.  <H5>  Liani Against `Religious Lobbies' </H5>   In the same article, the prime minister's wife, Dhimitra  Liani, is reported to have sent the congress a written "proposal  for consideration" focusing on the "protection of Hellenism and  Orthodoxy" and the attention to be paid to the plight of Pondian  Greeks. She warned against the "religious lobbies that exert  pressure and even achieve the goal of military intervention," as  well as against the "economic interests using religion as a  disguise that are changing the balance in the Balkans."  <H5>  Yennimatas, Vaso Papandreou Statements </H5>   The same article reported that ailing Minister of National  Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas' written message to the congress  counseling unity and the preservation of a united front on  Greece's national issues of Cyprus, Thraki, the Aegean, the  Balkans, Skopje, and Ipiros met with enthusiastic applause. The  article also reports that former Eurodeputy and present PASOK  deputy Vaso Papandreou declared that during the government's  first five months mistakes were made concerning certain policies  and choices of people. Such errors must not be repeated, she  said, if the Greek people are not to be disappointed in the  PASOK government. Papandreou charged that internal democracy is  not functioning and that transparency and meritocracy are  lacking. She also denounced, as she had done in the past, the  "brotherly knifings" that are increasingly occurring "under the  table." While not putting into question Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou's role and contribution, the former Eurodeputy said  "this does not mean that party organs must be downgraded."  According to an article in the 16 April Athens daily TA NEA,  Vaso Papandreou's statements provoked the anger of PASOK central  committee member Kostas Paipoutlidhis, who followed her on the  podium. Paipoutlidhis attacked Vaso Papandreou and others like  her who "monopolize publicity" by being mentioned daily in the  news. He also accused her of being absent from the PASOK  struggle in 1989, "ensconced as she was in the comfortable  salons of Brussels." Paipoutlidhis's reaction was greeted by  "pandemonium," the article reports, and split the congress  between those who applauded him and a majority who criticized  him.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (19): Government plans a sea change - The country's ports are due for a transformation FOR A country bordering on the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, Mexico's ports play a surprisingly small part in the nation's economy. Mexico's three largest cities - Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey - are all land-locked, and almost all internal trade goes by road or train. The US ports at Los Angeles and Long Beach handle more of Mexico's trade with Asia than any Mexican competitor, and that at Houston handles most of the trade between the industrial north-east of Mexico and Europe. The Mexican government now hopes to change this. It is in the process of privatising the 22 principal ports, and is confident private capital and better management will transform the ports' fortunes. This would not only boost Mexico's exports and its ability to compete in the world economy, but would take some off the strain off Mexico's over-burdened roads and railways. The port privatisation is part of a co-ordinated effort by the Mexican government to bring private capital into public infrastructure, and improve communications across the country. Poor communications is considered by the government and the private sector as one of the critical constraints on economic growth, especially for the underdeveloped southern part of the country. The government has already built more than 4,000km of toll roads at a cost to private investors of more than Dollars 10bn. It is planning later this year to pass new laws that would allow privately-run airports and trains. It is keen to have foreigners investing in new projects, either directly or by buying bonds that are backed by future revenues from them. The toll road programme has now run into trouble, and no new road concessions are being awarded, mainly because of insufficient domestic capital, and high tolls on existing roads that have deterred users. The lack of new road construction could hurt the port privatisation, since investors may be unwilling to bid for a port if it is not well-connected to Mexico's main cities. Under the new port law, the government envisages three separate groups of private companies taking part in each port. One group will be akin to a US port authority and acts as a sort of port landlord, charging ships and terminal operators rent for use of the port space; a second will build and operate private terminals and other physical facilities; and a third manage general port services (such as moving cargo or towing ships). Mr Jaime Corredor, the top government port official, believes the first port authority concessions will be sold by the end of this year in competitive auctions, and the remainder by next. Under the law foreigners can earn up to 49 per cent of a port authority. Meanwhile, the government is awarding concessions to the private sector to build new terminals and run basic services, and will sell off concessions to existing terminals later in the year. There are no foreign limitations on investments in terminals. The law would mark a sharp break with present practice. Mexico's principal ports have been run out of Mexico City by a single centralised state authority. That meant there was no competition between the ports, and plenty of cross-subsidies between the profitable and loss-making ones. Given the shortage of public money, port equipment was often out of date, and inadequate. 'The new regime will allow competition both between and within ports, significantly increasing productivity,' says Mr Corredor. While private companies have for a while been able to build their own terminals within a port, and manage some port operations, such companies were often effectively controlled by port unions, notorious in Mexico for corruption and restrictive practices. In the first tentative step to privatisation, the government took over the Veracruz port some two years ago in a midnight raid, broke up the corrupt union, and handed over most operations to three competing private companies. Since then productivity has surged ahead, and the port handled about 6.4m tonnes of the cargo last year, 23 per cent more than 1991, according to Angel Gonzalez Rul, the delegate at Veracruz port. The new law expects to draw from the Veracruz success, since it removes exclusivity contracts enjoyed by unions, says Mr Corredor. The law gives investors in terminals freedom to manage their operations and hire their own workers. Unlike the past, several companies will compete with each other when offering basic port services, reducing the power of any group of workers. In mid-August the government awarded 27 concessions to the private sector to build cement, grain and car terminals in ports around the country. The companies included the German chemicals giant BASF, Nissan of Mexico, and Apasco, the Mexican arm of the Swiss cement company Holderbank. Such investment is badly needed, but may not affect one of the greatest constraints on Mexico's ports - poor communications with the rest of the country. At Veracruz, cargo at the port often waits for days because there are not enough trains to take the goods to Mexico City, says Jaime Sanchez Diez, head of Operadora Portuaria del Golfo, one of the private operating companies in Veracruz. Mexico's railways remain in public hands, and have suffered from government cuts in public investment over the past decade. In apparent recognition that improving ports without touching railways may not take Mexico very far, the government is expected to change the constitution later this year that would permit some form of railway privatisation. The improvement in Mexico's ports will have to involve reforms of the custom clearances if they are to be competitive, says an executive at Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM), Mexico's largest shipping company. He says that while 'while the privatisation measure is very good as it is, it is not sufficient. Mexico's customs clearance is overly complicated and discriminates against shipping.' TMM complains that while trains coming from the US frequently do not have to stop for clearance until they reach their final destination in Mexico, ships are checked immediately and laboriously. This can hold up shipped cargo, and given the long and complicated Mexican custom procedures, add significantly to costs. The TMM executive says it can take 18 days for cargo to reach Mexico City by port from the north-west port of Manzanillo, and just 13 days by train from the north-west border.</p>

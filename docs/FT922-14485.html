			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Farewell to all that A WEEK from today we will have a new government, or a set of negotiations leading to one; and this column will have changed its address. Lex will resume its traditional Monday thoughts while this weekly dose will be found in the financial pages, with a somewhat narrower focus. It seems a good moment for a look back at the 16 months which made this column seem so gloomy. The markets in London looked quite strong, and the financial authorities were still keeping up a complacent front. Distance sometimes lends clarity to the view, though: the signs of strain and debt were visible enough to anyone who had seen a property disaster close up in Texas, or examined in the American savings banks the mud-strewn wreckage which comes to view when a financial tidal wave recedes. But not in the UK, I was told. British banks were thought to have kept clear of the worst excesses of property lending. Sterling was safely pegged into a low inflation system, and interest rates were coming down. Even now, one can argue that the UK suffered as much from bad luck as from bad official judgment. It was hard to foresee what a financial mess the Germans were going to make of reunification, and that real interest rates would therefore remain stranded at such a punishing height. The supervisory disasters - mainly, of course, BCCI - are the exceptions to a reasonable record. Ordinary savers and investors still trust British markets and institutions, which is much more than can be said in the US or in Tokyo, to name but two. It is no good, however, getting the details right if you get the big picture wrong. Both the authorities and the markets took ridiculously long to realise that debt deflation is not just an ordinary recession. Official forecasts of recovery were regarded simply as premature rather than wrong. But they damaged everyone who believed them - especially the ministers (who are now scarcely on speaking terms with their advisers). Yet the truth was being proclaimed not just by a handful of possibly eccentric columnists and letter-writers to The Times. It was grasped early on by the US Federal Reserve. The endless warnings of its chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, about a private sector credit crunch must surely have been heard in Basle as well as on Capitol Hill. The Fed has also shown that in the right circumstances, this problem can be addressed through sufficiently determined easing of monetary policy. These include a hyper-competitive exchange rate, and help from regions and close trade partners which have reached the far side of financial disaster. The British authorities cannot look for similar help. A really stimulative exchange rate is not available within the ERM, even with a realignment, should that come. The main depression is around London, but no British region is in any condition to play the role of Texas and its neighbours in leading the US recovery. Britain's potential east European partners are barely at the beginning of the road Mexico and Argentina have travelled to reach economic break-out. British policy has had one triumph, though at a dreadful, unforeseen cost. Inflation, above all cost inflation, really does seem to be under control at last. Joseph Schumpeter, who argued that the destruction wrought by economic depressions is a creative process, would have felt vindicated. He might have found further confirmation among the more successful survivors in the British corporate sector, which is still achieving efficiency through creative destruction. (Not enough, though, to support the ridiculous profit forecasts which were holding up the market not so long ago.) However, the markets, which ignored the bad news for so long, now ignore the good. They have at length understood that inflation is being checked at the expense of profits, rather than to their benefit; but they still worry that the usual suspects - wage pressure, excessive public borrowing, or interest rates which are 'too low' - are lurking in the scrub, waiting to ignite inflation again. That is the message of the long bond markets. Yet the US offers living proof that, when financial confidence is low, not even a combination of currency depreciation, permissive monetary policy and uncontrolled government borrowing can prevent inflation subsiding. The danger to the economy and to profits lies rather in falling prices - obviously in the property market, less obviously in commodities and many goods and services. It is deflation which is undermining bank balance sheets, raising the cost of financial intermediation when demand is weak and eroding government revenues. This process means that most new borrowing - whether by governments, companies or consumers - is really distress borrowing. All these borrowers are therefore driven to cut their spending further. It is time, in short, to brush up on your Keynes. The Maastricht treaty will probably prevent the UK for some time from joining the revived fashion for Keynesian anti-recession policies; that is the penalty of joining the country's fortunes with a group of economies that have avoided the disasters of Anglo-Saxon lending excess. So Britain is likely to wait for some time yet for recovery, and not just because of the need for the other Europeans to focus their thoughts on recession. Growth may still be difficult to arrange until the markets stop worrying about the troubles of the 1980s. The Japanese market is being rather more logical than the UK's. The realisation that growth will be at best sluggish has destroyed the rationale of traditional Japanese yields. The adjustment may look panicky, but makes more sense than the many circulars I still read arguing that British equities are cheap because high payouts are still being contrived - for the time being. But even in bad times, there are always opportunities for the wise investor. For the immediate future, and perhaps quite a long future, these are likely to be found only in exceptional equities, but widely in the vast supply of bonds which will be issued in the next few years. These raffishly volatile markets will demand all the usual arts of timing and selection. These are some of the problems I will try to explore in the bond pages.</p>

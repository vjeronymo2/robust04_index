			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIGNS OF THE TIMES LOOK BAD FOR FANS  </P> <P> Last night, my 7-year-old son came home from the baseball game bursting with  pride because he witnessed Jose Canseco's back-to-back home runs. However, this  morning I had to explain to him that we could not go to the autograph signing  of Jose and other sports figures because of the exorbitant sums of money being  charged.  </P> <P> No, the money does not go to charity or to help any worthy organizations. It  goes into the pockets of Jose Canseco, Rickey Henderson and Steve Garvey.  </P> <P> It used to be that an autograph was an act of kindness, a social responsibility  toward kids who worshiped them. Now it is a commodity and might as well be  listed with pork bellies on the exchange.  </P> <P> SARA HAZLEWOOD  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

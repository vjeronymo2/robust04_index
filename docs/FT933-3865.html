			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Competitiveness helps to narrow trade gap THE IMPROVED competitiveness of UK goods, following the devaluation of sterling a year ago, helped narrow the trade gap in the second quarter. World trade figures show that in the three months to June the UK imported Pounds 3.3bn more than it exported, a slightly narrower deficit than in the previous quarter when the gap was Pounds 3.5bn, revised from Pounds 4.5bn. Although the quarterly deficit remains high, the latest figures contain encouraging trends. Measured by volume, imports have fallen sharply since the start of the year, while export volumes remained about flat. This raises the possibility that the UK is substituting goods made domestically for foreign imports. It also reflects the continued weakness of domestic demand which has limited import penetration. The news is encouraging because it suggests the economic recovery will be able to progress without a sharp deterioration in the balance of payments. The volume of total imports excluding oil and erratic items - defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver - fell by 3 per cent in the latest quarter, compared with a 5 per cent fall in the first quarter. On the same basis, exports rose by 1 per cent in the second quarter, following a 3 per cent decline in the first. The Central Statistical Office has yet to provide a breakdown of imports and exports by commodity, so it is not clear where import substitution is taking place. While the figures are encouraging, the improvement in UK trade has been confined to countries outside the European Community, which account for less than half of total UK trade. The visible trade deficit with the EC doubled from Pounds 400m in the first three months of the year to Pounds 800m in the second quarter, reflecting the economic sluggishness afflicting the UK's European trading partners. By contrast, the deficit with non-EC countries narrowed. It was Pounds 2.36bn in the second quarter compared with Pounds 3.1bn in the first. The figures showed a sharp fall in the terms of trade in the second quarter, resulting from a 2.5 per cent fall in export prices and a 0.5 per cent increase in import prices. Non-oil export prices were 7.25 per cent higher compared with a year ago, while comparable import prices rose by 13.25 per cent. The CSO warned that the introduction of a new method of data collection for intra-EC trade meant that the latest figures were more than usually liable to revision. The latest figures refer only to visible, or merchandise, trade. Estimates for invisible trade flows - services, government transfer payments and earnings on overseas investments - appear later this month.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to statistics compiled by the provincial  statistical bureau, our province's industrial production further  increased in April. Total industrial production output value at  the township level and above was 3.0478 billion yuan, an  increase of 7.6 percent over the same period last year. At  present, industrial development trends in our province have the  following features:    1. Heavy industry still occupies an important position in  the overall industrial production, and in particular, the  production of non-ferrous metals smelting industry and the iron  smelting industry have increased further. In April, the total  production output value of heavy industry reached 2.167 billion  yuan, 11.7 percent more than that of the same period last year.  Heavy industry's sales volume was 2.021 billion yuan, up 6  percent over the corresponding period last year. Its production  and marketing rate was 93.2 percent.    2. The production of summer beverages, like beer and  alcohol-free soft drinks, has developed more rapidly. The  production of energy products also has maintained a better  momentum. In April, generated energy was 1.37 billion kwh, an  increase of 36.3 over the same period last year. Production  output of raw coal was 4.09 million tons, 17.4 percent more than  that of the same period last year. Production output of natural  gas was 26.36 million cubic meter, up 400 percent over the  corresponding period last year.    3. Production costs have increased by a wide margin, and the  deficit situation remains serious. According to the results of  investigations made in 201 large and medium-sized industrial  enterprises, there were 123 deficit-making enterprises,  accounting for 61 percent of the total. The newly increased  deficits occurred mainly in the machinery, chemical, and light  industrial sectors. Therefore, they face a very strenuous task  of turning from deficits to profits.</p>

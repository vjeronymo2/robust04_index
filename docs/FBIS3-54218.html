			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nuri Najm al-Marsumi, first under secretary of </F> the Culture and Information Ministry: "Beware of the Patient  Man's Rage"]    [Text] The UN Security Council issued a routine statement  on 18 January in which it renewed the unjust blockade for 60  days. As in the previous statements, the majority of the  Security Council could not justify the continuation of the  blockade.    This time, however, the ambassadors of some member states of  the Security Council expressed strong protests. The Chinese  ambassador called strongly for the lifting the blockade, while  the ambassadors of Spain, Brazil, and Nigeria reiterated this  stand. The French ambassador, as well as the British  ambassador, noted the positive stands adopted by Iraq. Despite  this, the Security Council issued a statement, without  introducing any amendments, because of the U.S. ambassador's  insistence on this. The U.S. ambassador expressed her  government's concern over the security of Iraq's neighbors.    We, in Iraq, realize that the blockade no longer has any  justification, and our friends realize this, as well. Now, the  camp of the enemies has begun to collapse and some of its  members have become aware of the dangerous political game played  by the managers of U.S. interests and their agents in the  region, who are besieging Iraq at the expense of their people  and at the expense of the interests of other nations and  countries.    We also are aware that the Americans want us to guarantee  the  security of the bandits, the rulers of the Kuwait governorate  and Saudi Arabia. They want us to relinquish the rights of our  people and nation in Palestine, imagining that the wisdom and  necessity of implementing the Security Council resolutions --  despite their injustice -- will make Iraq accept whatever it is  asked for.    The Iraqis will not say more than what leader Saddam Husayn  said on the third anniversary of the aggression: They will not  turn wisdom into a prelude for weakness and despair. The Iraqis  will not remain silent at the continuation of the blockade and  the violation of Iraqi airspace. We will never abandon our  people in northern Iraq. If we become certain -- despite our  patience and the good offices exerted by our friends to end the  abnormal situation resulting from the blockade and the  violations of Iraqi sovereignty in the north and south -- we are  capable of bringing the game back to the beginning. [sentence  as published] We are the original people in this region and we  are the ones who own everything on our land. We will not allow  the agents, lowly people, or coveters to encroach on what we  own, on our rights, and on our dignity. As the leader said, the  punishment of the criminals will be an eye for an eye and a  tooth for a tooth. The Arabs say: "Beware of the patient man's  rage."</p>

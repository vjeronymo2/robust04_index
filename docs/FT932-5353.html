			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Tory right in fresh sniping at cabinet THE GOVERNMENT faced renewed sniping from Tory right-wingers yesterday as ministers prepared for a tough time when MPs return from the Whitsun recess next week. As Mr John Major, the prime minister, struggled to assert his authority over the party, Mr Edward Leigh, sacked as a trade and industry minister in last week's reshuffle, called on the right of the party to organise more effectively and exercise its political muscle. The news that German chancellor Helmut Kohl was planning to convene a special EC summit this autumn to relaunch the drive to political and monetary union sparked a fresh outburst from Tory Euro-sceptics. Other right-wingers warned of a possible battle over the government's moves to narrow the budget deficit. Any move to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement by raising direct taxation would spark 'an unholy revolt', one senior MP warned. Further high-profile clashes on Europe and public spending are in prospect when parliament reconvenes next week.</p>

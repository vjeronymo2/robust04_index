			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Princess without a realm - A princess by birth, Olga of Greece is as comfortable leading the life of an art student as being a member of the cosmopolitan circle of royalty. Jane Mulvagh talks to her about how she reconciles these different worlds When Princess Olga de Grece says her name in America, people think she is a perfume. 'Attitudes to royalty depend on where you are,' she says. 'In America no one really gives a jot. In Europe, on the other hand, which has a history, of royalty. People give you more of their time because they're curious about you.' In her own land, her rank would be unrecognised because in 1974 a referendum was passed stripping all the royals of their titles. However, even if she wished - and she does not wish it Olga could not escape the lustre of royal birth. So how does a girl who is handsome, clever and rich conduct herself in the two very different worlds of being a student and a princess? She knows that sometimes she is invited to a party 'just because of my name. This gives me the chance to meet interesting people whom I wouldn't otherwise come across'. The duality of her different lives amuses her. 'Obviously I am the same person and don't change when moving from one world to another. I look at any experience from a distance, taking a step back from it.' She admits to exploiting her title on occasion to help a charity. But she is glad that 'unlike the English royals, I don't have duties and obligations and I haven't had to live a courtly life. I get the best of both worlds. On the one hand, I live like a student in a studio in New York, and on the other, I go to royal parties and interesting events.' As the daughter of Prince Michael and Princess Marina and cousin of the exiled King Constantine, Olga has enjoyed a privileged youth, spending her first six years in her homeland. In 1977 her father's interests - he is a historical novelist and her mother is a sculptor - took the family to Paris, which has become their main home. 'I feel totaly Greek but since I have not lived here for years, except for spending summers on Patmos, I somehow feel out of touch with contemporary Greece.' Being the product of a morganatic marriage, Olga believes that her upbringing has been 'a nice balance between the artistic world of my mother and the traditional royal values of my father'. She had a cosmopolitan and multilingual education in England, France and America and went on to study history at Princeton, then industrial design at Parsons School of Design in New York and now she is about to start a post-graduate course in architecture. Olga takes care to behave like a modern royal, modern in the sense that she carries her background with aplomb into her contemporary life. At the same time she does not hide her heritage, 'though an older friend of the family did explain that in the 1970s it was much more uncool to be a princess than it is right now, in the 1990s'. Apart from being a princess, Olga's beauty must help to keep the invitations flowing. Some profiles cry out to be immortalised on canvas or in marble; hers is so precise in line, her ivory complexion so faultless, that artists and photographers alike are struck by her presence. Like a peregrine falcon, her black-eyed and sharp-beaked features and unflinching directness of her gaze suggest a triumph of composure over youthful anxiety. At 22, she has the still beauty of a Sumerian sculpture or - a princess. How does she feel about using this exiled rank to gain advantage in the modern world? She concedes that her name helped her get her summer job at Ettore Sottsass's architectural practice in Milan. 'But after that you have to work twice as hard for people to take you seriously. Both my parents had a hard time winning respect in the professional world.' Olga is indebted to Sottsass because 'in his huge open-plan office I saw all the elements of design - architecture, graphics, industrial design - and I reaised I wanted to create in 3D.' Now, in her spare time she sculpts brightly coloured clay objects, such as teapots, candlesticks and vases, which are reminiscent of the pneumatic figures that Nikki de Saint-Phalle used to do in the 1970s. Family friends started ordering them and so she set up a small production line. Apart from art and design, 'the other thing I absolutely love with a huge passion is space' not terrestrial acres but the stars and the moon. When she applied to Princeton she wrote that she wanted to major in 'a course that does not exist - Lunar Architecture. Amazingly enough they accepted me, which gives them some credit for imagination] You look up into the stars and realise how small you and the earth really are and how vast this subject is.' After graduating she applied to National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration (NASA) to work on The Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence Project. 'It was a new Project started two or three years ago. Sadly, they only needed qualified scientists and there were no odd jobs going. 'My love of space is not necessarly a physical thing. I would think twice before zipping into a space shuttle and going to the moon but, one day, I hope to be able to contribute to space research. As a designer and architect there's not much one can do yet but, in time, they'll need architects on the moon.' She may not be going to the moon but Olga does travel a great deal and every Christmas her father takes the family on a cultural journey to India, Bali or Russia to familiarise them all with other cultures. But Olga confesses that she finds constant travel unnerving. 'I am not one of those people who likes to keep travelling all their lives without settling.' Instead she feels great sympathy with the Russian novelist Goncharov's character Oblomov, 'because he just lies in bed all day. It's so wonderful. You can't do that any more, that belongs to a bygone era. His whole life was passed away in bed - it's something I'd love to do. Nor can you behave with the decadence of Huysmans's hero in Against Nature.' In her dress, Olga says she always strives for simplicity which she enlivens with a sense of drama. At five foot, nine inches tall, Olga's womanly figure would overpower frills and folderols, while her sense of visual drama prevents her from taking refuge in the safe option of a little black dress. 'I simply don't want a little black dress. My wardrobe isn't composed of things that are useful for all occasions. It would probably make my life easier but I'm never tempted to buy such things.' Instead, her high-impact taste favours clean lines, Zurbaran's (the Spanish devotional painter) colours - vermilion, terracotta, pewter, Prussian blue, lemon yellow - and real jewels. I asked her what she would like to have in her wardrobe and she did not hesitate. 'A huge pearl necklace - real, of course; a huge embroidered dress, not something you would wear ever day - perhaps like one of those Medici women in a Bronzino portrait; and generally things that you can't find in shops.' When she does shop, she favours Jil Sander's Germanic minimalism and Prada's simplicity and shoes by Chrstian Louboutin, who recently named a pair of Louis-heeled satin mules after her. Evening gowns are made by her friend Maria Synder in New York. By day she creates a counterpoint to her femininity with white shirts, buff suede jeans from Joseph and black polo-necks. By night, think Old Master paintings in rich dramatic shapes and Florentine richness and you've got the picture. Feminist-motivated androgyny is anathema to Olga. 'I'm definitely for enhancing your femininity; there's no reason to hide it. You might as well use it.' As to political feminism, she is somewhat ambivalent. 'I am so used to living in New York where being a feminist can often imply that you're rather militant about it. But I'm of a new generation. I'm happy with the advancement and, thankfully, I'm a beneficiary of all those doors that have been opened by others - but I'm definitely not a militant.' Olga is a pragmatist and carries herself with composure and a maturity beyond her years. Her composure is rooted in her affection for the Orthodox church and her belief in God, combined with worldly realism. Her charm, which wins invitations as much as her royal blood and arresting beauty, is her teasing mirth and her ability to enliven any group of people she is with. Olga has an attractive serenity, a quality I noticed when I first met her aged 18. It lends her the aura of a modern and playful caryatid.</p>

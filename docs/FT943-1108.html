			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Waiting for the Fed The need for a rise in US interest rates is becoming increasingly apparent. The bond market's continuing anxiety about inflation appears justified by the most recent data on capacity utilisation and industrial production. While inventory adjustments may slow the economy during the current quarter, growth is likely to rebound to above 4 per cent in the fourth quarter. That is well above the Fed's 2.5 per cent target. The only factor that might delay an interest rate rise immediately after the Federal open market committee's meeting this week is November's Congressional elections. An increase soon after these would then be inevitable. The more important questions are how high interest rates need to go to slow the economy down to the 2.5 per cent growth rate favoured by the Fed and how much damage such an increase will wreak on the corporate earnings and the equity market. Economists are divided. Some argue for no increase. Others believe rates will need to go as high as 7 per cent. This lack of consensus has been a primary factor in the markets' instability. The bond market would be more likely to calm down if the Fed decided on a full percentage point rise. A half point rise would simply leave the market waiting for more during the spring. As for equities, this year's earnings would not be affected, but the high levels of corporate and private debt in the US would undoubtedly lead next year's profits to undershoot expectations. The price of knocking inflation on the head could be a sharp correction on Wall Street.</p>

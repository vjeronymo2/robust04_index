Eduard Amvrosiyevich [Shevardnadze] and myself have a good  tradition of meeting each other as often as possible. We take  every opportunity to maintain a constant working spirit. We  took this opportunity in Ashgabat before meeting each other here.    Naturally, we discussed practical problems relating to cargo  deliveries, the progress of the implementation of trade and  economic agreements, and we addressed regional problems, such as  the settlement of the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and  Abkhazia. We concluded that there is no alternative to a  peaceful solution of these conflicts. To solve these conflicts,  we should use the good offices of international organizations --  the CSCE and the United Nations, as well as Russia's special  initiative. We reaffirmed the intention expressed at the  meeting between Eduard Amvrosiyevich with Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin [on 3 February in Tbilisi] to organize a regional  meeting that will bring together the leaders of Russia, Georgia,  Armenia, and Azerbaijan.    These, in fact, are all the problems that we discussed  today,  during our private meeting and during the meeting between the  delegations.    We reaffirmed our intention to organize a summit among  Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.    [Shevardnadze] I confirm that there are internal needs that  prompt us to meet. The current situation in our countries  prompts us to meet more often and promote relations between the  two neighboring states, which have a centuries-old tradition of  friendship, cooperation, and fraternity. I think that every  such meeting is another step toward the strengthening of our  contacts and cooperation. This is what has happened just now.  It seems to me that on all problems which are of interest and  concern to our countries, we managed to work out a common  approach and common principles.    The main thing is to achieve, as soon as possible, the  completion of the conflict settlement process. Levon Akopovich  and myself became convinced that, despite some individual  peculiarities, there are common laws regarding conflict  settlement. We are convinced that the leadership of Armenia, in  particular, Levon Akopovich and his colleagues, can do something  considerable to settle the conflict in Abkhazia. And, perhaps,  we could also be useful regarding the settlement of the  Nagorno-Karabakh issue.    An agreement in principle was reached today that we both  deem  useful the development of Caucasian dialogue, as we said. This  problem was discussed at the meeting with Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin. I am aware of the opinion of President of Azerbaijan  Geydar Aliyevich Aliyev. It seems that we, the leaders of the  four states, consider very important and useful to hold such a  dialogue on a regular basis. In the beginning, it will probably  be held at the summit level. But later, these contacts will  include ministries, and there will be meetings between the prime  ministers and foreign ministers. You were surprised why the  security [sentence as received]. The security and interior  ministers will also meet. If we cooperate as neighbors,  everything will be possible. All issues should be settled.    Therefore, the main result of our meeting is perhaps the  fact  that we decided to work on this idea until it is implemented.    [Correspondent] What is the position of the CIS member  states  leaders regarding the decision to launch air strikes in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ter-Petrosyan] This is a difficult question. I think that  now the world has to pay for its failure to react adequately in  order to solve this problem. This is my point of view.    It is an extreme measure, the most unwelcome one out of  everything that could have been chosen. I am still hoping that  things will not go that far. There is still time. Perhaps, the  international community will use all its efforts to avoid an air  strike.    [Shevardnadze] I agree with what Levon Akopovich says.    I will say that, in principle, I am in favor of the  implementation of decisions adopted by international  organizations. However painful and difficult they may be, I am  in favor of decisive measures, because any indecisiveness and  uncertainty leads to even more serious consequences. This  happened to us in Abkhazia, as it did in other conflicts.    Of course, there is some time, but not too much.</p>

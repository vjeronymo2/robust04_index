			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Board sackings raise doubts over Nigerian LNG project THE NIGERIAN government yesterday sacked its representatives on the board of the country's liquefied natural gas joint venture, two months ahead of a financing deadline for the Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) project. The unexpected decision raised concern about the completion timetable of a venture which dates back over two decades and which has suffered setbacks in the past. Nigeria LNG is 60 per cent owned by Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, 20 per cent by Royal Dutch/Shell and 10 per cent each by Italy's Agip and Elf Aquitaine of France. The plant would draw on Nigeria's proven natural gas reserves of 2,600bn cubic metres, and would be able to produce up to 4.5m tonnes a year of liquefied gas. The decision comes two weeks after the board discussed bids by international consortia for the Dollars 2.6bn main contract at Bonny, 540km from Lagos, project officials said. Bids will become invalid if at least tentative financing, including some Dollars 2bn in guaranteed loans, is not in place by December 22, they said. The officials said there were doubts over prospects for financing by the deadline. One consortium bidding for the main contract includes Kellogg of the US and France's Technip. The other is led by Bechtel of the US and Japan's Chiyoda. The news was greeted with astonishment by western bankers and donors, anxious about the future of a project. But industry officials were cautious in their assessment of the impact on the project. 'The Nigerians have three competent international partners,' said one last night. He went on to warn, however, that 'if momentum is lost because of political or other uncertainties, the project will unravel. And if they don't make this one they can forget it.' Mr Chu Onkongwu, the petroleum minister, said that the government representatives on the board of Nigeria LNG had been 'unable to share government objectives'. These were to ensure the project incorporated best available technology, the most favourable investment terms and the maximum possible transfer of technology to Nigeria.</p>

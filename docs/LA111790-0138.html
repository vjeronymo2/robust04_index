			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FBI SEARCHES SEN. ROBBINS' ENCINO HOME  </P> <P> Federal agents armed with a search warrant raided the Encino home of Sen. Alan  Robbins on Friday in the latest phase of a continuing investigation of  corruption in the state Capitol.  </P> <P> The search, which was conducted by the FBI, is the strongest indication to date  that the U.S. attorney's office in Sacramento is pressing ahead with a possible  case against Robbins, a veteran Democrat whose business deals have come under  investigators' scrutiny.  </P> <P> Agents at Robbins' house refused to describe the nature of their search to a  Times reporter. But among those present was Jim Wedick, a Sacramento-based  agent who has played a central role in the FBI's political corruption probe  since it began more than five years ago. Wedick said he could not comment.  </P> <P> Contacted by phone after the search, Robbins said, "I have been advised that  it's not appropriate to comment on it (the investigation)."  </P> <P> An aide to the lawmaker acknowledged that Robbins was home at the time of the  raid, which began in the morning and lasted for a matter of hours.  </P> <P> Several agents were at the lawmaker's large, Tudor-style home, which has a  commanding view of the San Fernando Valley below. One of them held a hand-drawn  map and a flashlight, apparently to guide him on his search of the residence.  </P> <P> As reported earlier in The Times, a federal grand jury in Sacramento has been  investigating almost every aspect of Robbins' extensive business dealings and  political activities to determine if the state senator abused his office for  personal financial gain.  </P> <P> One of the allegations made before a grand jury is that Robbins and California  Coastal Commissioner Mark L. Nathanson were part of an elaborate scheme to  extort $250,000 from a San Diego hotel developer. Attorneys for both men have  denied the allegation.  </P> <P> The search of Robbins' home required that a judge be persuaded that it would  turn up evidence linked to the commission of a crime. The warrant and  supporting documents with details of the allegations and the nature of the  search have not yet been made public.  </P> <P> A source familiar with the probe said that authorities were looking for  financial records, at least some of which involved the San Diego hotel  developer, Jack Naiman. Naiman has told investigators that he was put in "a  squeeze" after he asked Robbins to help him fight a rival hotel project.  </P> <P> The 47-year-old politician, who has served in the Senate for 17 years, has a  long history of being caught up in controversy, only to emerge unscathed.  </P> <P> There is even a long-running dispute over whether he actually lives in the 20th  Senate District, where he was handily reelected earlier this month with 59% of  the vote. Robbins makes no secret that the house where he lives -- the one  raided by the FBI -- is outside his district. But he is registered to vote at a  second residence, the North Hollywood home of his former father-in-law, which  is inside the district boundaries.  </P> <P> State law requires that legislators be residents of their districts at the time  they run for office, but Robbins has long contended that he is entitled to pick  his own residence for voting purposes.  </P> <P> Robbins' name first came to light as a possible subject of the federal  corruption probe in August, 1988, when federal agents searched the Capitol  offices of four lawmakers. Although they did not search Robbins' office at the  time of that raid, the FBI did interview Robbins at his Sacramento-area home.  </P> <P> The Capitol search was the first public sign of an FBI sting operation,  code-named Brispec (for bribery-special interest), in which agents posing as  businessmen tried to win support for bills that would supposedly help them  start up a shrimp-processing plant near Sacramento.  </P> <P> As a result of the sting, two former Democratic state senators, Joseph B.  Montoya of Whittier and Paul Carpenter of Norwalk, were convicted on political  corruption charges earlier this year.  </P> <P> At the time of the Capitol raid, Robbins insisted that he was not a target of  the FBI probe. And several sources familiar with the investigation indicated  initially that it was unlikely that Robbins would ever be prosecuted.  </P> <P> But tapes released during the Montoya and Carpenter trials showed that Robbins  had played a role in passage of the special-interest bills to benefit the FBI's  phony companies.  </P> <P> And according to sources familiar with the probe, the FBI's investigators  received a number of allegations about Robbins' personal business transactions  and, as a result, reopened their files on Robbins.  </P> <P> Jacobs reported from Sacramento and Berger from Encino. Times staff writer Mark  Gladstone also contributed to this story.  </P> <P> State Sen. Alan Robbins  </P></p>

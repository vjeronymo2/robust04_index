			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ewald Koenig: "Hail of Tomatoes and Eggs for </F> Joerg Haider"]    [Text] Bonn -- Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] Chairman  Joerg Haider and Manfred Brunner, chairman of the League of Free  Citizens (BFB), spoke to hundreds of nonlisteners in Bonn on  Tuesday evening [31 May]. Shrill whistles and choruses ("Nazis  out" and "Piss off!") prevented the anti-Europe speeches of the  two politicians on Muensterplatz in Bonn. There were no  excesses.    A hail of eggs and tomatoes rained on the rostrum (and on  the  journalists) from time to time. Policemen protected the  speakers with shields. Banners saying "We do not want a second  H. from Austria" or "One Austrian was enough" were shown to the  election campaigners. At a news conference afterward, Haider  said this was "a sign of xenophobia."    Only a few fragments of the speeches came out of the  loudspeakers. Brunner: "If there is not a European people,  there cannot be a European Parliament either." Haider warned  against Jacques Delors and the goal of a "socialist central  state of Europe." Anyone who does not vote for Brunner's Ticket  13 at the European election on 12 June will initiate "the end of  democracy in Germany."    After 25 minutes of a turbulent rally, Haider and Brunner  were led to a police bus. When they spoke to journalists a  little later, Brunner and Haider agreed: It was a "very  important event," the "highlight of a power struggle of the  German left." Haider announced that, after his return, he will  "ask the Austrians during the final stage before the European  elections and in view of these pictures from Germany: `Do you  want to have that in Austria?'"    Brunner then said: "It would be good for the European Union  if Austria gave it a shock." In addition, he regretted that  Bonn "abolished Article 23 (article on accession) in advance  obedience." Not that Germany should become active by itself, he  stated seriously and with Haider's approval: "But why have the  neighboring countries been deprived of the opportunity to apply  for acceding?"</p>

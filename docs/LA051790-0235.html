			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW RESUMES ITS RALLY, GAINS ANOTHER 12.03  </P> <P> The stock market pushed ahead to new highs today, resuming its recent rally.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had slipped 2.77 on Wednesday,  rose 12.03 to 2,831.71.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 825 up, 658 down and 490 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 164.77 million shares, against 159.81 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index gained .35 to 193.49.  </P> <P> Most of the gains came early in the session, encouraged by a brief drop in  open-market interest rates.  </P> <P> As the day passed, however, rates turned higher. Yields on long-term government  bonds climbed to the 8.65%-8.69% range.  </P> <P> In the economic news, the Commere Department reported that the nation's trade  deficit increased to $8.45 billion in March from a 6 1/2-year low of $6.10  billion the month before.  </P> <P> Brokers said the latest figure, although larger than expected, didn't  significantly discourage the belief that the United States has been gradually  improving its competitive position of late in world markets.  </P> <P> U.S. Treasury bond prices firmed slightly today in moderate early trading  despite a government report showing a larger-than-expected March trade deficit.  </P> <P> The bellwether 30-year bond was up around 1/8 point by midday, or $1.25 per  $1,000 face amount, after losing around $1.50 on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, slipped to 8.61% from 8.63% late  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Market analysts said bond traders generally shrugged off today's Commerce  Department report on the March trade shortfall.  </P> <P> Although most economists had been predicting a March deficit of around $7.5  billion, "it didn't seem the numbers were that negative," said Elizabeth  Reiners, a vice president and economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New  York.  </P> <P> She said the market sentiment is that the trade gap will eventually improve  this quarter because of the dollar's recent decline in foreign exchange.  </P> <P> Bond traders are concerned about the trade figures because they can often  influence the dollar. When the trade gap widens, the dollar sometimes falls,  thereby hurting the value of dollar-denominated securities like bonds.  </P> <P> Adding an early boost to bond prices today was speculation that the Federal  Reserve might be easing its credit stance a bit, but when the Fed failed to  take any action today, prices retreated slightly, Reiners said.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  rose between 1/16 point and 1/8 point, intermediate maturities rose around 3/16  point and long-term issues were up around 1/8 point, according to the Telerate  financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer,  rose 1.87 to 1,150.85.  </P></p>

The European  microelectronics industry is not getting off its crawling start.  While Japanese and Taiwanese manufacturers are further enhancing  the top position the Far East holds in memory chips and American  electronics giants such as the Intel Corporation are reaping  billions in profits with their microprocessors, the barometer  readings for this industry on the old continent have again  fallen to the the bottom. "Europe has only half-heartedly  responded to the drastic reconstruction process taking place in  the semiconductor industry worldwide" soberly states Hans  Weinerth, former manager of Philips and today chief of Sican  GmbH (GmbH = Ltd) in Hannover which produces special custom-made  chips.    "Whoever wants to catch up here must not nibble at but take  a  whack at it" believes Jens Uwe Fuhrmann of the German Machine  and Plant Construction Society (VDMA). Yet the European chip  industry has suffered for years from a frightening lack of  motivation. Only Siemens, jointly with the IBM Deutschland GmbH  (German IBM Ltd), still bearably holds on to the mass market for  memory chips. The twosome recently delivered their first 64 Mbit  chips to selected customers.    The European Research Initiative JESSI (Joint European  Submicron Silicon), although established for the purpose of  developing this particular chip as closely as possible alongside  the Japanese, has since changed its orientation. "Memory  technology was virtually stricken from the European agenda"  admits Heinz Hagmeister, just recently appointed JESSI chairman.    A general breakdown of the domestic microelectronics  industry, however, Hagmeister refuses to concede: "We are still  holding some trump cards." It is slowly dawning on the JESSI  board members in charge that the billions of research money  squandered in laboratories on unmarketable projects actually  help countries like Japan, Korea, and the U.S.A. to remain  leaders in electronics.    The situation is, indeed, becoming more and more critical.  The European chip users are becoming more and more dependent on  non-European chip producers. "Japan has assumed the leading role  all the way from making semiconductor materials through  fabrication of chips to manufacture of electronic products"  complains Michael Pero, director of Microelectronics in the  Technology-Strategy and Innovation Projects (TES) division of  the Daimler-Benz AG (AG = Corporation).    There is absolutely no shortage of new places where to  start.  Professional market watchers are raising Europe's expectations  in this field by their discovery of a demand for microelectronic  components called ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrated Circuits)  designed to meet user's special requirements.    These components can be used in washing machines, mobile  telephones, machine tools, automobiles, and in practically all  electronic circuits, each component as a rule in only a very  specific kind of electronic device. They often replace an entire  series of mass-produced chips and thus remain each suitable for  only a particular device targeted for miniaturization. They  furthermore perform their specific task most often faster and  more reliably than an electronic circuit built with  mass-produced chips.    "The success of European products hinges neither on the  degree of integration nor on the storage density of chips"  acknowledges Max Syrbe, since a few weeks ago president of the  Fraunhofer Society. Extremely fine structures striven for in  mass-produced chips are not needed in an ASIC. Inasmuch as only  the functions needed for performance of its specific task are  built into it, an ASIC is by far not as crowded as a 64 Mbit  chip.    The chances are good that, by pursuing the ASIC line,  Europe's semiconductor industry will again catch up with the  leading manufactures of semiconductor devices and especially so  since the Fraunhofer Institute of Silicon Technology has focused  its attention on precisely this particular concept. A  comfortable new Institute building is currently being  constructed in Itzehoe with Europe's largest contamination-free  space for research and development. Two thousand square meters  of floor area will be made available to the Institute's  researchers and collaborating experts from industry. Relocation  from the present site in Berlin is scheduled to take place in  the second half of 1995. The Institute will provide the  technical prerequisites for a quantum jump in ASIC development.  The equipment on hand for this purpose is designed to produce  chip structures of sizes smaller than half a micrometer. This  will lead to an actual manufacture of ASIC's and thus to further  progress in the miniaturization of devices.    According to Weinerth, chief of Sican, there are still  openings for entry into competition with other semiconductor  manufacturers for share of the world market. "Our ambition must  not be to gain a few percentage points on the world market with  standard products", admonishes the former JESSI man, "but rather  to offer specialty products."    Despite the favorable position for a good start, marketable  products are still scarce. Exceptions include the world's  highest-speed silicon chip developed at the Ruhr University in  Bochum. The know-how for this device has been acquired by the  Daimler-Benz Corporation. Then the Institute of Discrete  Mathematics (IDM) at the Bonn University has developed layouts  for new chips which the IBM Deutschland (German IBM) GmbH now  uses. But on the whole, says IDM chief Bernhard Korte, the  European semiconductor industry is fast asleep.    The greatest weakness lies in transmitting the know-how from  the laboratory to the industry. A man who wants to correct this  is Prof. Dieter Seitzer in Nuremberg. His efforts should benefit  most of all middle-class consumers. This incumbent Chair of  Engineering Electronics professor at the Erlangen-Nuremberg  University, who is also director of the Fraunhofer Institute of  Integrated Circuits, knows what the trouble is with the group of  people he will confront: "Researchers and potential users are  still too timid to communicate with one another properly."    The agile professor visualizes covering West Europe with a  hundred competence centers which will assist every prospective  user in the design of ASIC's. The laboratory facilities of the  Fraunhofer Institute in Erlangen are today almost ready to  handle telephone orders. Meanwhile, however, the JESSI project  is still in its infancy. Besides the Erlangen Institute, only  the Braunschweig Institute of Applied Microelectronic has a  so-called chip shop available for custom design of ASIC's.    Seitzer is not the only one promoting such services. The  Thuringia Microelectronics Application Center (MAZeT)Ltd, in  which the city of Erfurt and also the Weinerth-Sican enterprise  and the Jena Optics Ltd participate, offers assistance not only  in ASIC development but also in almost all areas of  microelectronics. Because of this capability, the Center  occupies a unique position in Germany, having competence in  advance microelectronics also at its disposal.</p>

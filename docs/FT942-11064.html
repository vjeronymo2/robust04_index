			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Mandela delights whites and investors Mr Nelson Mandela does not miss a trick. Despite opposition from within his own African National Congress, he yesterday delighted investors, businessmen and white South Africans by retaining Mr Derek Keys as the finance minister. Nothing else would have persuaded the outside world - not to mention sceptical South Africans - of his commitment to free market economics and political moderation. Again and again, Mr Mandela has stressed the need to restore business confidence and attract foreign investment. Yesterday he took the most concrete step possible toward achieving those goals. In the two years since he was appointed finance minister by outgoing President F W de Klerk, Mr Keys has proved a tough fiscal disciplinarian. He has halted the rise in government spending, and reined in the budget deficit. And best of all, he has amply demonstrated that he is his own man, and no politician's fool. He would not have accepted the post of finance minister in an ANC-led government without assurances from Mr Mandela that economic discipline would be maintained. He realises the importance of leaving the department, the portfolio, of finance as it is - without interference,' said the pragmatic Mr Mandela in Cape Town, flanked by his two new deputy presidents, Mr Thabo Mbeki of the ANC and Mr De Klerk. The other central economic post, governor of the Reserve Bank or central bank, will also be unchanged: monetary disciplinarian Mr Chris Stals will remain as governor when his term ends in July. The moderate tone established with the re-appointment of Mr Keys will be further strengthened by the news that Mr Thabo Mbeki is to be first deputy president, effectively Mr Mandela's prime minister and probably his political heir. Mr Mbeki has long represented the acceptable face of the ANC to the business community, at home and abroad; he has served as unofficial ambassador to white South Africa since the early 1980s, when secret contacts began between the ANC and liberal Afrikaners. Whites know and like him; articulate, well educated, urbane and charming, he soothes their fears. Few other candidates could have put such a conciliatory stamp on the cabinet. Mr Mbeki's chief rival for the post of deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is a brilliant strategist and fearsome political negotiator. He would have been tougher, but perhaps not better. Mr Ramaphosa has opted to remain outside the cabinet, working to strengthen the ANC as party secretary general. This is exactly the post he always said he wanted; but no one believed him, suspecting he had higher political ambitions. Apart from these certainties, some posts remain unfilled. The ANC has said there will be six National Party ministers, but has named only one (Mr Keys); and it has not named the three Inkatha Freedom Party ministers due to be appointed to the government of national unity. Somehow, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi must be accommodated in a post which acknowledges his surprisingly strong electoral showing: 10.5 per cent of the national vote. Easily offended, his pride must be assuaged; this will not be an easy task. There are also some wildcards, and some weaknesses, in the remaining ANC appointments. Mr Jay Naidoo, appointed minister without portfolio, is expected to oversee the ANC's reconstruction and development programme, though it is not clear how much power he will have over finance minister Mr Keys. Mr Mandela has made abundantly clear that he will brook no opposition from anyone on implementing the programme - apparently including Mr Keys. There could yet be conflict, when the programme's goal of black uplift inevitably clashes with the need for fiscal discipline. One notable weakness is foreign minister Alfred Nzo, former ANC secretary general, who was replaced three years ago, partly because of poor performance. He will do little to raise South Africa's international profile. Both police and defence have gone to the ANC, leaving the National Party with no important security portfolio, although Mr Mandela has said he is prepared to amend the cabinet list after consultation with Mr De Klerk.

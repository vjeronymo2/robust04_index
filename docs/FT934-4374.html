			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Zurich set record highs Germany and Switzerland were in record territory, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT slipped back after the Bundesbank announced that it was not making a cut in the discount rate but, supported by other factors including the stronger dollar, ended the day at a record high. The DAX index closed 20.66 higher at 2,110.53 after a high of 2,115.64 and a low of 2,104.05. Turnover was strong at DM11.5bn. Mr Patrick Shields at NatWest Securities commented that the Bundesbank had signalled, by setting the repo rate at 6 per cent until January, that there would be no further move on interest rates until the new year. In the market he noted activity in RWE, the shares adding DM11 to DM488, with some institutions taking positions ahead of the group's dividend payment next week. The strength of the dollar helped Daimler make DM9.50 to DM743.50, together with rumours that Airbus might be in the running to win a US contract. The banking sector continued to make ground with Dresdner showing a 16 per cent increase in 10 month profits, the shares gaining DM1 to DM445; but Hypobank, which also announced good figures, slipped 30 pfg to DM480.50. Commerzbank added DM2.50 to DM370.50. ZURICH remained firm, although off its best levels, and the SMI index added 12.9 to a second consecutive record high of 2,787.2, with Wednesday's better than expected economic data continuing to provide support. CS Holding, the most expansive of the Swiss banks, shed SFr65 to SFr3,600 as it declined comment on market rumours that it planned to take a stake in Commerzbank. Analysts were divided over the logic of such a move: they were cautious about dismissing such a market rumour, but one commented that it would be a move away from the Swiss bank's core business. Elektrowatt, part of the CS Holding group, rose SFr25 to SFr3,775, befiting from analysts' recommendations. Drug issues put in a strong performance. Ciba-Geigy advanced SFr10 to SFr837 and Sandoz put on SFr40 to SFr3,910. Roche certificates firmed SFr70 to SFr6,140 after the recent consolidation. Jelmoli, the retail group, added SFr20 to SFr910 for a two day rise of 7.9 per cent. The shares have found favour after Wednesday's GDP figures indicated a pick-up in domestic consumption. PARIS ended modestly firmer, with the CAC-40 index picking up 6.47 to 2,160.45, after a day's high of 2,170.49 and a low of 2,146.92. Turnover was estimated at some FFr4bn. Carrefour shot ahead FFr32 to FFr3,882 on news that it had sold its 30 per cent stake in But, a furniture retailer, under terms worth about FFr536m. Canal Plus took an opposite direction, shedding FFr46 to FFr1,250, on news that a decision on its licence renewal had been put back: a decision was expected to have been made early next week. Further disappointing car sales news knocked FFr6 off Peugeot's shares, closing at FFr715. AMSTERDAM added 0.1 in the CBS Tendency index to close at 138.3. Better than expected results from ING helped the insurer gain 50 cents to Fl 85.90, while elsewhere in the sector Aegon lost Fl 1.60 to Fl 101.20. ABN Amro added 50 cents to Fl 71.00. MILAN was higher, the Comit index adding 4.28 to 548.94, with volume inflated by Fiat switching its savings and privileged shares to a wholly owned subsidiary. The savings stock rose L22 to L2,020 in volume of 43m shares while the ordinary shares were L37 higher at L3,953. Credito Italiano advanced L18 to L2,319: the privatisation price is scheduled to be announced tomorrow ahead of the start of the sale next week. MADRID saw further solid gains before some late sell orders took prices off their best levels. The general index aded 2.27 to 300.81 in heavy turnover of Pta32.5bn. Banks continued their recovery with BBV Pta100 higher at Pta3,200 and Santander Pta190 ahead at Pta6,580. Among electricals, Iberdrola put on Pta14 to Pta950 in volume of 3.7m.

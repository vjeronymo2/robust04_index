			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Methodology Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In today's final rule, the Agency is establishing treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for newly identified and listed wastes, as well as any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soils and debris which are contaminated with such wastes. (The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency plans to develop alternative standards for hazardous soils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a part of the Hazardous Wastes Identification Rule (HWIR).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The newly identified wastes covered under today's rule include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes displaying the organic toxicity characteristic (TC), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pesticide wastes that were not previously hazardous by the EP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leaching procedure. The newly listed wastes are Coke By-product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes and Chlorotoluene wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the newly regulated hazardous soil in today's rule, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only existing volumes are soils contaminated with TC wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Any volumes of soil contaminated with F037 and F038 listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes which exist are not covered in today's rule, but are being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered in a future Agency rulemaking.) Finally, the Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgating new testing and recordkeeping requirements, as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as reducing other recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, today's final rule proposes Universal Treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards (UTS) for wastes already regulated under the LDRs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency's analysis includes an analysis of the volumes affected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this change in treatment levels. (In the switch to UTS levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are cases where the new UTS level is less stringent than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existing listing levels, as well as cases where the UTS is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more stringent than existing levels. Either of these cases would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the potential to change the costs associated with treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these wastes.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> a. Methodology for Estimating the Affected Universe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In determining the costs, economic impacts, and benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with today's rule, the Agency estimated the volumes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TC nonwastewaters, Coke By-Product wastes, and Chlorotoluene  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes affected by today's rule. For the TC wastes, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employed the 1995 volume estimates presented for each affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste in the Agency's 1992 TC Census Database (hereafter referred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to as the ``TC Survey''). (There are several ways in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volumes employed for the capacity determinations differ from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those used in the RIA.) The capacity determinations section of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preamble describes the methods used there to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volumes. The scope of the RIA differs from that of the capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination in the ``time window'' analyzed. The RIA examines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the short- and long-term impacts from the rule. Capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations, on the other hand, are made for a two year time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frame beginning at the promulgation of today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency employed the volumes of Coke By-Products and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chlorotoluene wastes estimated in their respective listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses. For Coke By-Products, current management practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggest that no volumes will be land disposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> b. Cost Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->  The cost analysis estimates the national level incremental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs which will be incurred as a result of today's rule. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost estimates for both the baseline and post-regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenarios are calculated employing: (i) The facility wastestream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume, (ii) the management practice (baseline or post- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory) assigned to that wastestream, and (iii) the unit cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with that practice. Summing the costs for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities produces the total costs for the given waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario. Subtracting the baseline cost from the post-regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost produces the national incremental cost associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule for the given waste. The unit costs include costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Subtitle D and Subtitle C disposal (as appropriate), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation costs where necessary; all dollar estimates are in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993 dollars (unless otherwise noted.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each section below summarizes the baseline and post- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory management practices assignments for each waste. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit costs employed for the management practices are summarized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the RIA background document for today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cost methodology section includes three sub-sections:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) TC organic wastes, (ii) Other newly identified wastes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Testing, record-keeping, and permit modification costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> i. Organic Toxicity Characteristic Wastes (D018&hyph;D043)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The standards established in today's rule for the organic TC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes require the treatment of all underlying hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents. The affected TC wastes can be divided into three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups: TC nonwastewaters, TC soils, and TC debris. While TC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters which are not managed in CWA or CWA-equivalent units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are being regulated in today's rule, the current management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices for these volumes do not trigger land disposal (RCRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt tanks, etc.), and therefore are not subject to the LDRs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Below, EPA describes the method of estimating the costs incurred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in complying with the TC standards in today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In establishing a baseline for the TC nonwastewaters, TC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous soils, and TC hazardous debris affected by today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, the Agency assumed Subtitle C landfilling as the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management practice. The Agency believes that there are TC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes which are not affected by today's rule because they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already being treated to comply with the standards established in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule (e.g.: wastes with high BTU value which are being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used as fuel, etc.). The Agency assumed that landfilling was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurring on-site for noncommercial (company captive) facilities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and off-site for commercial facilities. Employing today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement of treating for all underlying constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably expected to be present, the Agency developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology assignments for the wastes at each facility. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assignments include a treatment technology (or treatment train  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where required), and subsequent Subtitle D disposal. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assignments were based on waste characterization and constituent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration data. Where little or no such data were available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a wastestream, the weighted average unit cost was assigned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the weighted average unit cost was calculated separately for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonwastewaters, soils, and debris).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency allows a generator of hazardous soil to apply for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a treatability variance. The Agency, however, has not analyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential short-term savings which could be realized in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management of hazardous soil, and therefore may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overestimated the cost impacts of the rule in the short-term.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is also some uncertainty where certain technologies will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to treat TC nonwastewaters. The Agency performed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity analysis to characterize this uncertainty, which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the RIA Background Document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

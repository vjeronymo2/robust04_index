			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Japan should be able to use  Self-Defense Forces (SDF) ships in addition to government  aircraft and SDF transport planes to evacuate Japanese nationals  abroad in the event of hostilities, a senior Foreign Ministry  official said Wednesday [6 April]. The official made the  comment in connection with the problems involving North Korea's  alleged development of nuclear weapons.    The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Japan  would be unable to evacuate an estimated 8,000 Japanese  nationals living in South Korea if hostilities broke out there,  unless SDF ships were made available in addition to government  planes. Private planes or ships will not go to places where  hostilities are occurring, he said.    The official called for early revision of the SDF Law which  would enable SDF planes to be dispatched abroad to evacuate  Japanese nationals. Offering his personal view, the official  added Japan should also be able to evacuate South Koreans who  have permanent resident status in Japan.</p>

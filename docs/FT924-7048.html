			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Maori consortium wins battle for Sealord SEALORD Products, New Zealand's biggest deep-sea fishing company, was yesterday sold to a consortium of Maori people and Brierley Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment holding company, for NZDollars 350m (USDollars 182m). They beat off a bid from a group led by Royal Greenland, a Danish group. Sealord has been a subsidiary of Carter Holt Harvey since 1978 and has become the leading holder of deep-sea fishing quotas in New Zealand, with 26 per cent of the allowable catch. The controversial deal involving the Maori people is designed to settle permanently fishery claims dating from the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, the peace pact signed by the British colonial powers and the Maori. The New Zealand government has lent the Maori people NZDollars 150m to help fund their part of the deal. While a majority of Maori tribes supported the proposal, a minority, including a tribe on the Chatham Islands, objected and unsuccessfully took the issue to the Court of Appeal. They argued it was unjust for the government to seek to settle their grievances for all time. Last night this group vowed to continue to fight it. Sealord's quota includes two valuable deep-sea species of whitefish: orange roughy, most of which is sold to the US, and hoki, for which there is a growing international market. The company is also involved in processing squid and ling, scallops and mussels. In the year to last March it employed 1,400 people and had sales of NZDollars 250m. Sealord estimates profits of NZDollars 40m for the year to March 31 1993. Mr David Oskin, Carter Holt Harvey managing director, yesterday said the company was trading ahead of budget for this year, and the new owners might be able to extract further value from Sealord's resources. Brierley Investments, on behalf of the joint venture company to be known as Te Ika Paewai, said the consideration was NZDollars 337m. However after adjustments for profit, working capital and capital expenditure for the two-month period from September 1 to October 31, the total consideration would be NZDollars 350m.</p>

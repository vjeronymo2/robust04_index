			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Pounds 460m needed to pay pension fund deficiency MGN WILL have to pay Pounds 460m before tax into its pension fund over the next 14 years in order to meet the deficiency left by the theft of assets from the scheme, according to the company's annual report. The accounts include a Pounds 193m provision for the cost of so-called past-service liabilities of those who work or had worked for MGN before Robert Maxwell's death. The report details for the first time the cost of MGN's commitment to meet all pension obligations after the theft of more than Pounds 200m from the fund. The report notes that contributions to the scheme will be 'at a significantly reduced rate' for the first three years, but concludes that contributions over a 14-year period represent a rate of payment demonstrating 'a fair balance between the competing interests of the company's shareholders, creditors, employees and pensioners'. The cost of meeting pensions liabilities in respect of past service may take longer than 14 years, the report says, largely because of new laws requiring companies to increase pensions in line with inflation. MGN had earlier announced revisions to its pensions schemes intended to allow it to meet all obligations to present and former employees. The first Pounds 20m of any of the missing money recovered will be used to meet past-service liabilities. The government has confirmed its legal obligation to meet guaranteed minimum payments to current pensioners. An MGN executive said yesterday that the next Pounds 50m of assets recovered by receivers are required to be refunded to the US in exchange for its promise to meet guaranteed minimum payments for current employees and former employees now working elsewhere. So far, the government has pledged Pounds 2.5m above its legal obligations to aid Maxwell pensioners who have lost all or part of their pensions. The chairman's report says MGN's duty to 'ensure the future viability of the company' has forced it to remove some 4,000 members of its pension scheme from a safety net for scheme members. Those affected are mostly employees and pensioners of up to 80 companies acquired by Robert Maxwell's British Printing &amp; Communication Corporation who never worked for MGN but were transferred into the MGN scheme. The accounts record a payment of Pounds 3.4m to cover the cost of providing payments in full for those individuals until June 30, 1992. From July 1, those people will have their pensions cut by 70 per cent. Separately it has emerged that MGN has been asked to relinquish its control of the pensions covering those individuals because of its refusal to guarantee their pensions. Half the trustees including the chairman of the Maxwell Communications Works Pension Scheme, whose members were transferred to the MGN scheme, are executives of Mirror Group Newspapers, while half are scheme members.</p>

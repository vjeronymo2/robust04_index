			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Transport union urges stricter sea safety law THE RMT transport union yesterday urged the government to break ranks with the world community and introduce tougher legislation on sea safety. Mr Tony McGregor, RMT assistant general secretary with responsibility for shipping, said: 'British seafarers should not have to wait for the world to agree safety standards. Our members' lives are at risk while other countries prevaricate.' The statement follows remarks made at a meeting in London of the International Maritime Organisation, the UN agency that draws up sea safety standards. The organisation emphasises the need for states to act unanimously and warns of chaos resulting from different national standards. The procedure is slow. Safety standards for new roll-on roll-off ships, of the same type of the Herald of Free Enterprise, came into force three years years after the 1987 disaster which claimed almost 200 lives. Mr William O'Neil, secretary-general of the organisation, said: 'Despite the efforts of some states, the number of sub-standard ships sailing the ocean is too high and the loss of life is unacceptable.' Mr O'Neil said world shipping was facing enormous challenges in ageing fleets, higher replacement costs, poor safety standards and a shortage of manpower. All sections of the industry had to work to ensure that high safety standards were achieved, he said. Any compromise 'must provide a level of safety that is acceptable to the entire shipping world.' Earlier in the week he said: 'Unilateral action on the part of any government gives us all cause for concern. However, it would be wrong for this organisation to express such concern if it does not at the same time make a concerted effort to adopt standards which are both realistic and highly regarded.' He said human error was the principal cause of shipping casualties. Action on training and certification standards for seafarers were a high priority.</p>

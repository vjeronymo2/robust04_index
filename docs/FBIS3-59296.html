As for the  "great contract" in the rural organization system, along with  popularization of the responsibility system of production, rural  political power since 1984 has taken the road of standardization  marked by establishment of town governments and village  committees. This development in China's rural economic pattern  and organization system has brought with it some obvious changes  in township revenues and expenditures, which can be summarized  as:    1. The implementation of contracted revenue system for all  levels started in 1990 with the "separated responsibility" of  revenue and government which linked local revenue income and  expenditures bringing clearly practical benefits to all levels  of local government, and initiated an economic development model  which has a special plane in the history of world economic  development -- one which is centered on the local government.    2. The traditional rural revenue and expenditure system in  China consists of internal budget revenue and external budget  revenue; at the end of 1982, although there were 20,000 people's  communes in China which had established a commune level revenue  and expenditure system, it was a revenue and expenditure  administration system which relied chiefly on "unified  collection and distribution." As development of the market  economy provided the chief impetus to the continuous development  of local economies, all sorts of contradictions which had built  up under the traditional revenue and expenditure system grew  increasingly acute, and produced a new type of revenue and  expenditure -- extra revenue and expenditures for dealing these  contradictions, and, as soon as this one was born, it spread  rapidly and wildly catalyzed all manner of contradictions.    We define revenue and expenditure here as the collection and  application by the authorities of capital to support government  activities, using their legal enforcement powers, in accordance  with the practical situation of current local revenue and  expenditure operations in China. All free capital collected by  the enforcement powers of authorities by township governments  are revenue income of this level of government, while all costs  for all kinds of activities of township governments are  expenditures of this level government. According to this broad  meaning of revenue and expenditure, we divide revenue and  expenditures into internal system revenue and external system  revenue. The former refers to the internal and external budget  revenue under the current financial administration system. The  latter refers to self collected capital by township governments  through all kinds and forms and to governmental expenditures  caused by these.    Along with continuous reform of the revenue and expenditure  system and the constant development of the rural economy, the  extra revenue and expenditure of rural township governments has  extended rapidly, increasing at a pace which has surpassed that  of internal revenue and expenditure. In 1990, the gross income  of township revenue nationwide was 48.5 billion RMB, a 1.1-fold  increase over 1986, with an annual average 20 percent rate of  increase. Included in this was 36.1 billion RMB internal budget  income, and 3.1 billion RMB external budget income, and 9.2  billion RMB in towns' self-collected capital income, increases  of 86 percent, 181 percent, and 241 percent respectively from  1986.(Footnote)(Xiang Cai: "Strategic Study of China's Rural  Revenue and Expenditure Development," CAIZHENG No.5, 1992). From  1990 to the present we taken representative samples in areas  which had different levels of development. The evidence showed  that external revenue and expenditure has occupied a decisive  position in the overall township revenue and expenditure. For  instance, in 1989, in a town in suburban Beijing which has well  developed township enterprises, out of a total of 61.25 million  RMB gross yearly revenue and enterprises income, extra revenue  and expenditure accounted for 77.4 percent, while budgeted  income only accounted for 21.4 percent. In a town in Zhejiang  Province in the same year, out of a gross yearly revenue income  of 902,000 RMB, extra revenue and expenditure accounted for 72.5  percent, while budgeted revenue and expenditure accounted for  only 27.5 percent.(Footnote)(Sun Tanzhen, Wang Zhaocai, Yaogang,  Sanbenyumei: "China's Economic Development and Agricultural  Revenue and Expenditure," published by the Japanese Institute of  Asian Economy, as No.92 in the Special Overseas Joint Research  Report Series, 1991. This report's analysis showed that these  towns' extra revenue and expenditure amounted to very little at  all.) In 1991, in a town in suburban Guangzhou, out of a gross  yearly revenue and expenditure of 4.3 million RMB, extra income  accounted for 91.6 percent, while budgeted income for only 8.4  percent; of the gross yearly expenditures of 4.026 million RMB,  extra expenditure accounted for 91.2 percent. In a town of  Dalian in the same year, the budgeted revenue income was over 17  million RMB, while extra expenditure was over 50 million RMB. In  a suburban town of Shanghai, the gross revenue income was 4.06  million in 1991, of which 67 percent came from extra revenue,  while 59 percent of the gross expenditure of 4.49 million RMB  came from extra expenditure. Even in areas in which the  agricultural economy is the dominant factor, extra revenue and  expenditure still occupied a considerable portion. According to  our representative sample, a town in Hunan provides a good  example: of its 1991 gross revenue income of 1.077 million RMB,  41.3 percent came from extra revenue; of the gross expenditure  of 1.012 million RMB, extra expenditure accounted for 41.7  percent. In one town in Zhejiang, out of a gross revenue income  of 808,000 RMB in 1989, extra revenue income accounted for 49.8  percent.    Because extra revenue and expenditure have played an  increasingly important role in developing township local  economies and in bringing township government into full play,  therefore analyzing the causes and the operating system of  township extra revenue and enterprises will aid in correctly  grasping the current township revenue and expenditure system in  China's rural areas, and in adopting correct policies to make  township revenue and expenditure play a bigger role in rural  economic and social development.  <H5>  1. The Causes of Extra Revenue and Expenditure </H5>   The rapid expansion of rural township extra revenue and  expenditure in China was produced by an increasingly acute  contradiction between financial system reform which was lagging  and rural economic development which was increasingly focused on  a market economy. It can be analyzed from the two aspects of  supply and demand. We will look at supply first:    A) The currently operating financial administration system  creates supply insufficiencies. The rural financial  administration system has taken four basic forms in China: (1)  the system of "united collection and distribution"; (2) the  system of "fixing income and expenditures, handing over revenues  to higher authority, partially sharing income according to a  certain rate, allocating expenditures, not re-supplying those in  deficit, and reserving surpluses"; (3) the system of "checking  and ratifying revenues and expenditures, linking up revenues and  expenditures, sharing the gross amount at a certain rate, and  sharing part of excessive revenues at a certain rate"; (4) the  system of "dividing revenues and expenditures, checking and  ratifying cardinal numbers, contracting revenues and  expenditures." Looking at development, towns which operated  under the "united collection and distribution" two line system  of revenue and expenditures showed a steady decline, while those  towns which carried out linkage of revenues and expenditures  showed a progressive increase. By the end of 1990, there were  32,700 towns which had operated under the latter two systems,  and this was more than 60 percent of all township financial  offices.(Footnote)("Accelerate Development of Township Revenue  and Expenditure to a New Level," CAIZHENG YANJIU ZILIAO No.32,  1991) These two systems expanded the jurisdiction of township  revenues and expenditures, aroused the enthusiasm of township  governments to organize financial income and reduce  expenditures. However, because most township economies are still  focused on agriculture, and with a few exceptions are at a lower  development level in the rural areas of China, so the gross  amount of budgeted revenue income which is focused on industrial  and commercial taxes is low, and the tax resources unstable.  Relevant documents show that in 1990, there were about 25,000  towns with budgeted revenue income between 800,000 and 1 million  RMB, 21,800 towns with budgeted revenue income between 100,000  and 800,000 RMB, and about 10 percent of the total number of  towns were below 100,000 RMB. (Footnote)(Meng Chun: "Strategic  Studies on China's Township Development" in: Collected  Essays on Township Revenue and Expenditure in Jiangsu, Zhejiang,  and Anhui, 1992) Because most of the township governments  have lower budgeted internal revenue income, according to the  rules of the current revenue system their revenue income is  severely limited.    Meanwhile, although many towns have now implemented a  financial management system in which the towns themselves  control that part of the excess profits above a base figure  which is handed up after contract completion, still, it is also  true that implementation of "handing up all revenue income to  higher authority, allocating expenditures by checked and  ratified amounts," etc., is obviously off the track of "united  collection and allocation." In addition, most towns did not fix  a state reserve, and therefore, indeed, the budgeted revenue  income which can be supply to towns for their own use will be  discounted for a variety of reasons. Meanwhile, it is extremely  inconvenient to use township level financial capital, while at  present, the means and the rate at which capital is shared has  not been systematically or legally stabilized, so is affected by  such things as changes in policy, town leaders' negotiating  ability and the attention paid to their personal careers as  officials, etc. This is highly unstable, and has led to a  situation wherein controllable revenue income of township  revenue and expenditures has not changed regularly along with  changes in tax collections, etc., so that the surplus funds are  often insufficient, while revenue income shortages continue to  exceed the base. So the imperfection of the budgeted revenue  management system presents a serious obstacle to building and  developing township revenue and expenditures, which leads  township governments to try creating other financial resources  to break out of the limitations of the budgeted financial system.    2. The imperfections in the tax collection administration  system currently in operation induces local governments to  expand extra revenue income. China's local revenue chiefly  depends on taxes collected from local enterprises. These are the  three types of industrial and commercial taxes, that is,  products tax, business tax, and value added tax. These three  taxes constitute the largest proportion, and divided into  central and local taxes; meanwhile, current policy provides that  local governments share certain tax deduction rights, which  leads local governments to convert this kind of revenue sharing  into a benefits system for local revenue. With this motive,  local governments take full advantage of tax deduction rights,  and put tax resources into the principal taxable economic  entity. Township governments of each locality use every possible  means in the attempt to get favorable tax deductions for  township enterprises, especially for collective township  enterprises, so that enterprises pay less taxes or none at all.  They then use other means to turn tax resources into township  self collected capital income; an example of this is turning  over township enterprises benefits and administration fees, fund  raising, apportion, strong financial support, etc.    3. The development of local economy has expanded sources of  extra revenue and expenditure. Since 1978, the development of  local economy as represented by township enterprises has been  the most vigorous and distinct. In 1991, the gross output of  township enterprises reached 1,162.17 billion yuan, an increase  of 20 times that of 1979, and with a 29 percent average annual  rate of increase. The rapid development of rural economy  represented by township enterprises created wide financial  resources for township extra revenue. This has especially been  the case in some township enterprises developed areas, where  township governments have directly gained considerable extra  revenue from profits turned over to them by enterprises.    In addition, from the standpoint of needs, what is required  for development of the local economy and society's self  development, population growth, inflation, and new types of  consumption which have appeared along with the development of  the economy, etc., have all caused expenditures to increase  rapidly. Especially rapid has been the development of local  economies and expenditures related to the supply of public  products and the need to deal promptly with external economic  influences. Because the nature of public products is manifested  in "nonexclusivity" (meaning it is impossible to collect usage  fees or ask excessive costs) and "noncompetitiveness" in  consumption, so, under market economy conditions, the supply of  public products can only be resolved by governmental means  through financial expenditures. As for dealing with external  influences under market economy conditions, when there are  inconsistencies between the societal cost of a product or  service and the individual cost, and between societal usage and  individual usage, it demands that government do something to  deal with those external influences.    In the current situation, the following are the reasons for  requiring that township revenue and expenditures increase in  rural China:    (1) The population tends to be urban. With development of  township enterprises and the rural economy, the development  level of townships and market trends in the countryside have  improved greatly. The developing tendency of township and market  has led to an increased demand for social capital-type products;  for example, the demand for telecommunications facilities,  sewers, park constructions, etc., has been vigorous. (2) The  educational level has improved. With the income level of the  peasants improved, their educational needs are increasing daily.  Meanwhile, because society's usage of education is far bigger  than individual usage, so, in addition to farm families bearing  part of the educational costs, the government has to bear a  substantial part of educational costs as well. (3) With  deepening reform and the progressive establishment of a market  economic system, there has been a constant need to maintain the  basic framework and order of socio-economic life; for instance,  legislation, law enforcement, public security, statistics,  resource management and general executive affairs, etc. (4) The  short supply and dispersal of private capital, the peasants'  love of consumption and savings combined with their weak  knowledge of risk investment, forms pressures on the conduct of  direct investment and expansion of township economy development  by government revenue and expenditure. (5) Township leaders have  an affinity for pursuing short term profits, official  achievements, and all sorts of "reaching standard" activities,  etc., cause increases in every kind of nonconstructive costs.  (6) The scale and standard of expenditure for every type of cost  which is fixed in the revenue and expenditure regulations  currently in operation are far lower than the practical needs of  each locality; for some projects, higher authority promised to  increase such revenue allocations, as the wage subsidy, grain  price subsidy, transport subsidy, etc., but did not do so, which  required that the townships add expenditures. All these pushed  townships to look for sources of extra revenue and expenditure.    2. Sources and characteristics of township extra  revenue and expenditure.    At present, township extra revenue in rural China comes  chiefly from the following several sources:    1) Profits and administrative fees handed over by township  enterprises. In 1991, the net after-tax profits of the two  levels of town and village from collective enterprises had  reached 28.47 billion RMB. (Footnote)(China Statistical  Yearbook 1992 China Statistics Publishing House) A guess at  the gross income ratio of town-run to village-run enterprises  would be that half of the net after-tax profits must come from  town-run enterprises. Meanwhile, because of such factors as  untruthful reporting, the actual profits are far more than the  statistical figure. Profits and administrative fees which are  handed over to township governments by town-run enterprises  constitute the main body of extra revenue and expenditure. In  addition, enterprises run by villages, associated families, and  individual industrial and commercial families, etc. should all  hand over a fixed amount of administrative fees to township  governments. 2) Capital uniformly collected by townships,  including revenue collected by township governments according to  state regulations. Up to 1990, there were as many as 149  projects which were authorized in documents of every state  ministry and commission to collect funds from peasants. These  included chiefly: educational fees, family planning fees, fees  to provide special care to family members of revolutionary  martyrs and servicemen, training fees for militiamen, subsidy  fees to rural cadres, construction fees for social public  affairs, etc. 3) All types of fund raising and monetary  contributions. This includes enterprise and personal fund  raising and monetary contributions on the township scale, as  well as from overseas people and organs, e.g., contributions of  money from countrymen residing abroad, etc., This type of  revenue has recently been on the increase in many localities. 4)  Incomes from various kinds of fines and confiscations. During  the period of establishing, maintaining, and implementing a new  economic system and social life, this type of income will tend  to increase.    Through analyses to actual surveys in some localities, we  know that the extra township revenue and expenditure in rural  China differs in nature from budgeted revenue and expenditure.    1. In areas with differing levels of economic development,  the extra revenue and expenditure structure differs as well.  Generally speaking, in economically developed areas, those with  stronger collective economic power, not only is the extra  revenue and expenditure at a high level, the resources are also  relatively concentrated. Revenue is reliant chiefly on profits  handed over by collective township enterprises, administrative  fees, and united capital collection by townships. For instance,  in 1989, the extra revenue from a town in Beijing was 47.425  million RMB, including 30.093 million RMB which was handed over  by township enterprises, 63.5 percent of the total. In 1991, the  extra revenue from a town in Guangzhou totalled 3.936 million  RMB; included in this was 2.282 million RMB from enterprises,  which was 58 percent of the gross revenue, and 1.43 million RMB  united capital collection by townships, which was 36.4 percent,  and these two revenues together constituted 94.4 percent of the  gross income. In 1991, the extra revenue from a town in Dalian  was 2.96 million RMB, including 1.65 million RMB from  enterprises, which was 55.7 percent of gross revenue, and  920,000 RMB in united capital collection by townships, which was  31.1 percent, these two incomes in total constituting 86.8  percent of total revenue. Indeed, in many areas where the  collective economy developed to a higher level, the townships'  united capital collection came chiefly from collective economic  profits handed over by village-run enterprises, and this  extended the extra revenue from enterprise profits, both in  amount and rate.    In areas where the economy is undeveloped, extra revenue and  expenditure are at a low level, chiefly reliant on direct  resources from townships' united collection of capital which  comes from budget income of farm families and land contract  administrative fees and other temporary fund raising, monetary  contributions, etc. Take Yunnan as an example: in 1990, 20  percent of the province's township self-collected capital came  from profits of township enterprises and institutes, which was  concentrated in a few areas where the level of economic  development was higher; all items of united capital collection  usually constituted about 75 percent.(Footnote)(Chen Yingxuan:  "Gradually Perfect Construction of Township Revenue and  Expenditure to Promote Comprehensive Development of Rural  Economy," YUNNAN CAIZHENG YANJIU, No 10, 1991) Take Hunan as  another example: in 1991, the extra revenue totalled 445,000  RMB, and of this, 130,000 RMB was from enterprise profits, which  was only 29.9 percent, far lower than the rate for the same type  of revenue in economically developed areas; the townships'  united capital collection was 106,000 RMB, which was only 23.8  percent of the total. Fund raising of various kinds and  contributions of money came to 80,000 RMB, which was 10 percent  of the total; penalties of all kinds and confiscated income came  to 80,000 RMB, which was 18 percent. The extra revenue structure  in this town was very representative of the current situation in  the undeveloped areas, that is, a low level of income, highly  scattered resources, and enterprises which find it difficult to  constitute a main revenue and expenditure entity.    2. Prerogative is characterized by the authorities using  their powers to collect capital as they choose. But, a township  government operates at one level of governmental power, and this  kind of enforcement power of the authorities is often executed  through direct or attached relationships, and is usually  characterized by prerogative and subjectivity. As for township  enterprises, because of a lot of these enterprises are run by  collective investment, their property rights are very unclear,  so that the township government then truly become the owner of  enterprises, and leaders of the enterprises are appointed by  government. Township governments take advantage of this special  status and executive privilege, so they not only can establish  the rate and standard of profits and administrative fees for  enterprises to hand over as the governments will, the can also  assign quotas and fund raising to enterprises. This also was the  major reason why at present township extra revenue is the  easiest to collect from township enterprises. Speaking of  township united capital collections, township governments have  collected this capital through village cooperative economic  organs. Although the state has already fixed a certain rate and  standard for this capital to prevent adding to the peasants'  burden, it has been hard to restrain the actions of some  township governments, while peasants have such strong dependence  on township executive organs, which makes it hard to restrain  either. Based on a nationwide rough estimate of rural economy  supervision departments of the Ministry of Agriculture, the  average peasant's cost for executive fees, all kinds of  penalties, fund raising and quotas, etc., which are countable,  amounted to 13.8 RMB in 1991, which was 2.5 percent of the  average peasant's income. Reserves of directly assumed  collections and united collective fees by peasants came to 29.2  RMB per peasant, which was 5.3 percent of last year's average  per peasant income.(Footnote)(Cooperative Agricultural Economics  Guidance Office of the Ministry of Agriculture: "Comprehensive  Analysis of the Burden on China's Peasants" in: NONCUN HEZUO  JINGJI, Supplementary Issue, 12 June 1992) Among the burdens  listed above, in addition to those parts which were withdrawn,  reserved by higher level departments or village committee, quite  a substantial share became township extra revenue and  expenditure.    3. Lack of continuity and stability in yearly and specific  revenue projects. The reasons are: first, extra revenue is  determined to a large degree by the profit situation of township  enterprises. As the state cancels all kinds of favorable  policies to develop township enterprises, enterprise development  is facing increasingly fierce market competition, their  advantages are steadily disappearing, so that within the scope  of a township, enterprise profits are always unstable, which  causes yearly fluctuations in extra revenue. Second, because  extra revenue is often collected according to the demands of  temporary expenditure, so there is a lack of continuity in  specific income.    3. Functions and Uses of Township Revenue and  Expenditure    In the process of building a socialist market economic  system, the rural township government is the basic authority  organ of the state, and plays an absolutely essential role in  developing the rural socialist market economy. International  experience has proven that under market economy conditions, the  following several functions must be assumed by government which  represents public benefits.    1. The function of supplying public products and dealing  with  external effects. This function of government revenue and  expenditure acts to rationally allocate resources between  practical benefits and future benefits, individual benefits and  societal benefits, in order to satisfy the greatest need for  public benefits by the whole of society's members.    2. The distribution function. This function serves chiefly  to  guarantee fairness in income distribution to those members of  society who are at the lowest living standard, especially under  the conditions of a market economy operations system, to resolve  the problem of unbalanced income distribution that is caused by  this, reducing the gap between rich and poor; it also includes  implementing protective policies for special industries such as  agriculture, carrying out regional redistribution to reduce  regional variations.    3. The function of stability. In this, the government  maintains the employment level and price stability through its  macroeconomic management of gross supply and demand, for  example, such adjustments as the currency supply, interest  rates, foreign exchange rates, and tax rates, etc. to bring  about stability in macroeconomic activity and social life.    4. The function of promoting economic growth. In developing  countries, it directly drives economic development in developing  areas by means of the government's investment action to  compensate for the restrictions of such factors as a lack of  essential capital and weak risk knowledge among the  microeconomic main body.    But, there are definite divisions of labor and emphasis  placed on the aforementioned governmental functions by the  central and local governments, and the various levels of local  governments. Generally speaking, the stability function plays a  lesser role in rural township government public revenue and  expenditure. Speaking of the distribution function, in  economically developed areas the peasant standard of living has  improved considerably due to development of township  enterprises. Although there certainly are income differences  among farm families, the phenomenon of absolute poverty has been  basically eradicated, and governments need to provide only a  part of transferred expenditure for a few households which enjoy  the five guarantees. In some towns where the collective economy  is at a higher level of development, governments limit expansion  of the gap between rich and poor through the united distribution  policy inside the collective economy. The distribution function  of township revenue and expenditure in areas of this sort is  enacted chiefly through the policy of subsidizing agriculture by  industry, to level the income gap inside the collective. In  economically undeveloped areas, it relies chiefly on various  kinds of relief money and poverty assistance funds from the  state and higher levels of government to resolve the poverty of  peasants. Township governments need not do this, nor do they  have the ability to supply more transferred expenditure.  Speaking of the stability function, only the central government  can make adjustments in currency issuance, interest rates,  foreign exchange rates, tax rates, etc.; it is impossible for  local governments to be involved with these matters.    But looking at the functions of supplying public products,  dealing with external effects, and promoting economic growth, we  see that local governments can grasp various kinds of  information better, because residents in society's different  regions place differing stresses on different public products,  and make different selections as to type of economic and social  development. Therefore, local governments can better supply  public products and deal with external effects, so township  government's effect in this regard especially has potential.  Investigation of the current operational situation for China's  rural township revenue and expenditure shows that extra revenue  and expenditure play a very important role in supplying public  products, dealing with external effect and promoting economic  growth.    At present, there are three major types of rural revenue  expenditure: 1) expenditure for development, which chiefly  includes investment in fundamental facilities, expenditures on  investment to township enterprises, and on support for  agricultural production; 2) expenditures on administrative  matters, which mainly consists of operational and administrative  fees for each department of township government; 3) expenditure  on societal affairs, which chiefly include culture, education,  health fees, social welfare, etc. In the scope of the above  listed expenditures, extra revenue obviously differs in nature  from budget revenue, so it shows its positive effect in township  economic and social development.    1. In many towns, the distinct, constructive character of  extra revenue and expenditure in supplying public products and  dealing with external effects, makes it the main body of public  investment. At present, among the first class township budget  expenditures in rural China, fees for cultural, educational, and  health affairs predominate, reaching more than 70 percent in  many towns. But these expenditures are totally consumable, of  consumption, going chiefly for population fees and daily costs,  so it is necessary to use surplus capital on constructive  investment. The situation is different for extra revenue and  expenditure, where the rate of use on such capital construction  as public facilities, etc., is higher. For example, in a certain  town in Hunan Province, several million RMB were expended on  establishment and enlargement of the township people's  hospital's clinic building, bridges, etc. Other than a part of  these projects which were aided by higher level departments,  this was handled for the most part by township extra revenue. In  1988, a certain town in Dalian put ten million RMB into  construction of a middle school, and most of its capital was  provided by the township's own fund raising. At present, major  public expenditures of township extra revenue include social  service type investments such as school buildings, hospitals,  etc., and construction of infrastructural facilities such as  roads, bridges, telecommunications, etc.    2. Expenditure on productive construction. No matter whether  in towns which are economically developed or undeveloped, budget  revenue is rarely expended on township enterprises and  agricultural production, but extra revenue has had a distinctly  positive effect on promoting economic growth through its  investment activities. This is effect is even more prominent in  economically developed towns. For example, in 1991, among the  extra expenditure of a Dalian suburb, direct investment on  agriculture and industry was up 1.69 million RMB, which was 37.1  percent of the total extra expenditures; in 1991, a Guangzhou  suburban town's invested 1.208 million RMB on township  enterprises, which was 32.9 percent of the total extra  expenditure. In many Chinese towns, because of the severe  shortage and scattered nature of private capital, the peasants'  strong emphasis on consumption and slight knowledge of risk  investment, plus their being in a lower income situation, kept  financial organs undeveloped and caused a serious shortage of  productive investment in rural areas, which restricts economic  development. Therefore, township government concentration on  extra revenue for investment must play a role in strongly  pushing local economic development, and this has already been  proven by practice in some economically developed areas in China.    3. It plays an important role in supply public products  concerned with establishing, maintaining and operating a new  order. Since 1978, the state has added or strengthened organs  related to economic activities, such as statistics, law  enforcement, public security, technical quality supervision and  service, township enterprises administration and resources  management, etc. Among all these new organs and their increased  staffing, a part of them were obviously consistent with the  functions and work assignments of government bestowed on it by  the new economic system. Among expenditure of this sort, extra  revenue took on quite a bit. In 1991, in a certain town in  Shaanxi Province, our investigation of organs and employees  added since 1978 showed that among these newly added organs and  employees, those employees who worked in the public products  listed above and whose sphere was concerned with economic  activities constituted 94 percent of the total of new employees.  Newly added employees inside the state's budget occupied only 40  percent, 30 percent were budgeted by county revenue and  expenditure, and the remaining 30 percent were borne by extra  revenue and expenditure of township. In 1991's investigation of  a town in a Guangzhou suburb showed that among organs newly  added since 1978, except for the township party school and the  township office of the national congress, all organs were  related to economic administration, legal services, urban  residents' life services, and administration functions. In this  town, employees newly added since 1978 constituted 69 percent of  all township cadres, and of these, cadres who were employed by  township self collected capital occupied 44 percent of the total  of newly added employees. Practical investigations in other,  different type, areas (such as Dalian, Shandong, Beijing,  Zhejiang and Shanghai, etc.) had similar results.    4. Conclusion    1. At present, there now are a great deal of problems with  extra revenue and expenditures, including the common criticism  that there is a lack of an efficient system of supervision and  administration. This makes it easy to form a "small treasury" of  township leaders, and produce a "breeding bed" of regulation  violations. According to our understanding of relevant  documents, since three major investigations were launched in  1985, analysis of the volume of money involved showed that 90  percent of the problems were related to this part of the  capital. (Footnote)(Li Jinwen, et al.: "Reflections on Several  Problems Related to Township Revenue and Expenditure," CAIZHENG  YANJIU ZILIAO No 31, 1991). However, the aforementioned analysis  showed that extra revenue and expenditure was the product of a  contradiction between development of the market economy and the  regressiveness of financial system reform. It has the  characteristics of being productive, supplying public products  and dealing with external effects, and plays an important role  which cannot not be ignored in the process of developing local  economic and social development; thus, we cannot simply add  denials and restrictions to it.    2. As for the expenditure type of extra revenue, it is an  important part of supplying external public products and dealing  with external effects. Theoretically, local governments in  different localities can determine their expenditure actions  according to demand for public products in their own local  areas, whatever is best for meeting the demand to deal with  external effects, for meeting the people's needs, and for  maximizing the public welfare of the residents of that local  society. Especially if the concern is only with a relatively  small area of towns, it is easier to do it. But, due to various  shortcomings in the current Chinese administrative system, the  short term actions of local grassroots level leaders, and some  other factors, this has often led to governmental actions  deviating from what is favorable to the members of their local  society, twisting resources allocation, and adding to the  peasants' burden. This, then, is a problem demanding  conscientious study and resolution: how to supply public  products and collect capital for dealing with external effects  according to what is favorable to and capable of dealing with  the burden on societal members.    3. Because most rural township enterprises have strong  attachments to the rural community executive organs in China,  they lack the power to restrict government activities, which  causes extra revenue and expenditure to be quite unstable and  subject to whim. Under the conditions of limited rural domestic  income and average income level, if re-allocation to enterprises  and peasants after they have handed over taxes to the state is  done at will, it must have unfavorable effects on the economic  activities of enterprises and peasants, and ultimately lead to a  reduction in revenue a weakening of the revenue function. One  of the options for improving this situation is to convert a part  of the extra revenue and expenditure projects into local taxes,  regulate it through legal means, and allow it to be budgeted by  local governments.</p>

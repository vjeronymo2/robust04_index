			<p>BFN     [Text] Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, member of the  Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, and his  delegation today left for Amman on a visit of several days to  Jordan at the invitation of Jordanian political forces and  organizations.    Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur told an Iraqi News  Agency correspondent that the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party  delegation will hold meetings with political parties and forces  in fraternal Jordan to activate the joint pan-Arab action in an  effort to employ all means to lift the unjust blockade imposed  on Iraq, which fulfilled all of its obligations toward the UN  Security Council resolutions despite the injustice and  unfairness it had to endure.    He said the serious departure from the biased U.S. stand by  some UN Security Council permanent members and other members  during the previous two reviews in March and May puts on the  political parties and forces, the Arab nation's masses, and the  virtuous people of the world a responsibility to continue the  work to lift the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq through party  and parliamentary activities before the next UN Security Council  review in July.    The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party delegation includes comrades  'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, head of the Foreign Relations Bureau,  and Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, member of the Foreign Relations Bureau.</p>

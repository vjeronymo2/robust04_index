			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / World Trade News: US accused of 'foul play' in Gatt EUROPE's three leading aerospace companies - British Aerospace (BAe), Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) - yesterday accused the US of foul play by attempting to use current international trade negotiations to undermine the Gatt subsidies agreement for large civil aircraft. The European manufacturers, all partners in the Airbus consortium, said they had become increasingly concerned by US efforts to include civil aircraft subsidies into the broader subsidies code to be adopted in the Gatt Uruguay Round trade package. 'By attempting to lump the existing sectoral agreement for aircraft subsidies into the Uruguay Round, the US is attempting to get the issue lost amid all the debate on subsidies to other industrial and agricultural sectors,' said Mr Syd Gillibrand, BAe deputy chairman and president of the European aerospace industry trade association. European companies fear the EC may be prepared to trade off the interests of the aerospace industry for a compromise with the US on farm subsidies. 'Important as agriculture is, you are also talking about the survival of European high-technology and aerospace capabilities,' Mr Gillibrand said. The three companies said in a joint statement that the European aircraft industry currently employed directly 400,000 people and provided work indirectly for more than 1m. European manufacturers also claimed the US was 'back-peddling' on last year's Gatt civil aircraft agreement between the US and the EC reached after more than five years of negotiations. Under the pact, the EC agreed on a 33 per cent ceiling on direct subsidies for new aircraft development programmes in return for a limit on indirect government support for civil aerospace projects based on 3 per cent of an individual company's annual sales or 4 per cent of the country's civil aerospace industry turnover. European companies accused the US of seeking to impose even tougher limits on direct subsidies while maintaining indirect support through government agencies for civil aircraft programmes. EC companies have traditionally relied on direct supports while US rivals Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have relied essentially on indirect support mechanisms. There was evidence the US government was planning a sharp increase in support for aeronautical research and development. Nasa's aeronautics budget would increase by about 60 per cent over two years and already exceeded Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) a year, the three companies said. 'All the evidence is the US is showing bad faith on the non implementation of the indirect subsidies part of the Gatt aircraft agreement,' Mr Gillibrand said. By attempting to move the current aircraft sectoral trade agreement into the general Gatt subsidies code, the US was seeking to tighten the ceiling on direct subsidies from 33 per cent to 20 per cent for new aircraft programmes without facing similar restrictions on indirect supports.</p>

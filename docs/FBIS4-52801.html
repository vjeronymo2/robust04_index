			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor agreed  Friday night that the two countries should seek to resume the  failed trade framework talks before the summit meeting of Group  of Seven (G-7) major industrialized powers in Naples in July,  Foreign Ministry officials said.    Meanwhile, a senior Trade Ministry official indicated that  subcabinet-level trade talks will resume next week.    In a 15-minute telephone call, Kantor agreed with Kakizawa  that Japan and the U.S. should create a basis for the resumption  of the framework talks before the G-7 summit meeting in July,  the officials said.    The two also agreed that Tokyo and Washington should hold  unofficial contacts on the matter as early as possible, they  said.    Kakizawa, who made the phone call to have his first  conversation with Kantor since assuming the post in late April,  told Kantor he thinks it important to establish a relationship  of personal trust between them, they said. He also pointed out  the importance of Japan-U.S. ties, especially in the economic  field, they said.    Kantor was quoted as saying he agrees that personal trust is  important.    Japan and the U.S. failed to reach agreement on the trade  framework talk in February when then Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa met U.S. President Bill Clinton, failing to narrow  differences over the definition of the previously agreed  "objective criteria" to be used to gauge progress in the opening  of Japan's markets.    The senior official at the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry said earlier on condition of anonymity that Japan  and the U.S. will resume subcabinet-level framework talks next  week if a new proposal to break the deadlock wins the approval  of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    The Japanese trade negotiators to be sent to Washington are  Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international  affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for  economic affairs.    Trade Minister Eijiro Hata told a morning press conference  that the top-level officials will not carry with them any  specific answers to three new U.S. proposals made as conditions  for resuming the framework talks.    Washington has asked Japan to clarify its position on  macroeconomic policy, the overall goal of the framework talks  and the "objective criteria" sought by the U.S. to assess  progress in Japanese efforts for opening its markets.</p>

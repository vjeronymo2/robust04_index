The static investment in Fengcheng is 4.2  billion yuan. The power plant will have four 300MW generator  units for a total installed capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts,  representing both the largest generator units and the largest  plant (in terms of installed capacity) in Jiangxi Province.  Plans call for the No. 1 unit to join the grid in 1996 while  the three remaining units should be operational before 1999.  The plant could generate up to 6.78 billion kilowatt-hours of  electricity a year.</p>

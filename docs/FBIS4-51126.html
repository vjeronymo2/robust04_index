			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese side is  looking forward to Russian Prime Minister V.S. Chernomyrdin's  visit to China and hopes the visit will deepen bilateral  relations, according to Chinese diplomats and trade officials in  recent interviews with XINHUA.    The Russian prime minister is scheduled to arrive here on  May  26 for a four-day official visit at the invitation of his  Chinese counterpart Li Peng.    "China attaches much importance to the first visit here by  the Russian head of government," a Chinese Foreign Ministry  official in charge of Russian affairs said, adding that the  visit is expected to be a complete success.    Noting the 4,000 km-long Sino-Russian border, the official  said the maintenance of long-term, stable and good-neighborly  ties of friendship and mutual benefit between the two countries  is in the fundamental interests of the two peoples and conducive  to the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and the  world as a whole.    Sino-Russian relations in various fields have recorded rapid  development since the establishment of diplomatic ties between  the two countries, he said.    Since Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit here in late  1992, the mutually beneficial cooperation in politics, economy,  culture, science and technology, and other fields has developed  in a "healthy and sustained" fashion, he said.    The two countries have also maintained normal consultations  and cooperation on major international issues, he said.    This year, Sino-Russian relations are marked by the increase  of high-level contacts between the two countries, he said. The  high-level contacts, no doubt, play a positive role in  propelling bilateral relations forward.    During the forthcoming visit of the Russian prime minister,  leaders of the two countries will exchange views on the  enhancement of bilateral relations, especially of mutually  beneficial economic and trade cooperation.    A number of documents for cooperation are expected to be  signed, sources here said.    An official of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic  Cooperation said that since the two countries signed an economic  and trade cooperation agreement at the beginning of 1992,  bilateral trade ties have been developing rapidly.    He said the bilateral trade figure was 5.8 billion U.S.  dollars in 1992, which was higher than the highest one between  China and the former Soviet Union, adding that the figure in  1993 was 7.7 billion U.S. dollars, representing an increase of  31 percent.    In addition, means of bilateral economic and trade  cooperation were diversifying with the development of barter  trade, cash trade, compensation trade, leasing and mutual  investment, he said.    The official noted that the two economies are highly  mutually  complementary and there is a broad prospect for bilateral  economic and trade cooperation, as well as scientific and  technological cooperation.    In general trade, using its main foreign trade channels such  as large trade corporations, China will seize the opportunity to  press for a gradual shift from the dominant barter trade to cash  trade with involvement of all foreign trade means, he said.    He said that China will continue to stress the role of  border  and regional economic and trade cooperation, strengthening  administration over border trade and the standardization of  commodities inspection, in a bid to facilitate the development  of such cooperation and two-way investment.    He expressed the hope that the two countries will make full  use of land transport, along with more development of sea  transport for developing bilateral trade.</p>

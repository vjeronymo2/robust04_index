			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] As soon as a possible date for a new tour by U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the region was  announced, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin rushed to hint  that this tour will fail just like previous tours in the region  by the U.S. secretary of state. Israel seems to be deliberately  seeking to keep the peace process at a standstill and uses its  methods, which oppose the achievement of the just and  comprehensive peace, to bring the peace process to a dead end  and foil the U.S. and world efforts to boost this process.    Of course, these Israeli methods are not new. They are as  old as the peace process itself. They date back to the time of  the Madrid Conference more than two and a half years ago and to  the time when Israel found itself in a political crisis, which  it is trying to escape by placing obstacles and hurdles on the  path of the peace process, by avoiding the dues of the just and  comprehensive peace, by deviating from the Madrid formula, and  by not abiding by the principle of returning land in exchange  for peace.    The Israeli political crisis stems from the fact that the  just and comprehensive peace imposes upon it full withdrawal  from the Golan Heights, southern Lebanon, and the other occupied  Arab territories. Because Israel is not interested in  withdrawal or in activating the peace process, it is trying to  blame others for the failure to achieve positive progress. At  the same time, it increases its allegations, falsehoods, and  justifications to avoid the dues of the just and honorable  peace. This can be clearly seen in the Israeli position that  contradicts in form and substance the just and comprehensive  peace, and by Israel's adherence to everything except the  ingredients and principles of that peace. Accordingly, Israel  sticks to the proposals of partial solutions and separate  settlements. It also sticks to the slogan "Peace in Return for  Peace" because it does not want to implement the resolutions of  international legitimacy and does not want to completely  withdraw from the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. It wants  to see weak Arab parties on which it can impose its conditions  and ideas and push them into further surrender and  relinquishment of Arab rights, and who will accept its  occupation, and the continuation of that occupation of Arab  territories.    The Syrian position is totally different. That position  responded favorably to the principles of the peace process and  its true ingredients. That position also placed Israel in a  real dilemma. Syria, which opened the road toward peace by  accepting the U.S. initiative, adheres to the principles of the  just and comprehensive peace and the objectives of the peace  process.    Syria, as everybody knows, has announced its clear  commitment  to implement the UN resolutions, on which the peace process and  the U.S. initiative were based. Syria also responded favorably  to all requirements of the just and comprehensive peace. On  more than one occasion, Syria helped rescue the peace process  from Israel's conspiracies and plans to torpedo and sabotage it.    Israel continues to place obstacles and hurdles on the path  of the just, comprehensive, genuine peace. It publicly advocates  replacing the Washington talks and the principles of the Madrid  Conference with separate, secret talks. Moreover, Israel  exercised an aggressive policy and did not stop the series of  bombardment and its crimes, suppression, and terrorism in  Lebanon and the occupied Arab territories. Israel is now taking  strict measures to tighten its grip, entrench its occupation,  and expand its suppression in the occupied Arab territories.    This Israeli arrogance would not have taken such a serious  turn if the world community had assumed its responsibility and  defended its principles, resolutions, and charters; and if the  United States had adopted a decisive position against Israel's  vandalism against its peace initiative. It is now clear that in  the light of the Israeli practices and positions, which run  counter to peace, that it is impossible to arrive at a just and  comprehensive peace and stability and tranquility in the region  without an effective U.S. and world intervention to pressure  Israel. Consequently, commitments and obligations must be  translated into a reality on the ground. As much as it is  interested in achieving peace, Syria sticks to the return of the  entire Golan Heights, South Lebanon, and the occupied Arab  territories. Syria will not relinquish a grain of its national  and pan-Arab soil. Every one knows that there can never be  peace without Syria and without its positive and constructive  role in making genuine peace.</p>

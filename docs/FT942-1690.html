			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Political Notebook: Shattered dreams of job security Politicians always take time to catch up with the real world. So we should not be surprised that they are only now beginning to grasp the political implications of the revolution in Britain's employment market. Rapid technological advance, deregulation and below-trend economic growth have created an unnerving new force in society that will shape politics into the next century. It is called job insecurity. Its advance into the ranks of the affluent working and the middle classes marks the end of the post-war life plan: the reassuring assumption that the employed could rely on an uninterrupted and steadily rising stream of income throughout their working lives. Mortgage repayments, comfortable retirement pensions and school fees can no longer be taken for granted. Long-term employment prospects have replaced house prices as the favourite topic of conversation around the dining tables of the tortured middle classes. The economics have been obvious for some time. As the former chancellor reminded us in a lecture this week, employment market flexibility was at the heart of Lord Lawson's supply-side revolution during the 1980s. The erosion of trade union powers, decentralisation of pay bargaining and globalisation of markets all pulled in the same direction. So too did the shifts in business organisation, led by the explosion of information technology. Government policy and market outcomes have been mutually reinforcing. The low paid were the first to be hit. For unskilled workers the hope, let alone the expectation, of a job for life evaporated in the 1980s. Wages have been driven down to levels that worry even the most fervent apostles of the market. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, acknowledged this week the disturbing impact of low pay on family life. Lord Lawson floated the idea of a large-scale extension of income support payments. But it is the impact higher up the income scale that has real political implications. The aspirant classes are discovering that the obverse of flexibility is insecurity. The economy's emergence from recession has confirmed the change as structural rather than cyclical. Short-term employment contracts, part-time working and early redundancy have become permanent features of the labour market. They no longer affect only the poor. The computer manager is as likely as the contract cleaner to discover his or her job is guaranteed only for the next two or three years. The trend is irreversible. A return to fuller employment in the recovery stage of the economic cycle will not bring with it the security that post-war generations have taken for granted. Politicians on left and right have begun to explore the implications. Mr Kenneth Clarke devoted his recent Mais lecture to the subject. Mr Tony Blair has made it a theme of his leadership campaign. Both men set out their goal as full employment. They defined it in terms of the 1944 white paper: a commitment to a high and stable level of employment. But politicians have been more comfortable describing what is happening than offering analysis or prescription. The Conservatives have the most to lose. The party's political success in southern England has been based largely on meeting the aspirations of skilled blue-collar and white-collar workers. Now the market will no longer deliver. British workers are about to learn the lesson faced by their US counterparts during the 1980s: there is no longer a guarantee that their children will have a better standard of living than they have had. In the US, President George Bush paid the price when Mr Bill Clinton promised 'managed change'. In Britain the Tories face the same threat. A cut of 1p in the basic rate of income tax does not have quite the same resonance for a family wondering how long it can rely on a stable income. Mr Clarke recognised the danger with a strong defence in his Mais lecture of the welfare state. He offered a commitment to 'active' labour market intervention: the education and skills training essential to frequent career changes. Mr Blair, though, has the advantage. He will not find solutions in re-regulation of the employment market or in old-fashioned industrial interventionism. But the language of individualism has lost its appeal in the uncertain 1990s.</p>

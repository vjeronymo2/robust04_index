			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Economics: UK retail price index may show significant inflation increase VARIOUS WAYS of measuring inflation in Britain will come under the spotlight this week as economists pore over data relating to the pace of the hesitant recovery that seems to be under way. Much attention will be focused on the retail prices index for April, to be released by the Central Statistical Office on Friday. Many economists believe the index rose by about 4.4 per cent in the 12 months to April. This would mark a significant increase in so-called headline inflation, which registered 4 per cent in the year to March. Although various technical factors are likely to account for any rise of this sort, signs that inflationary pressures have not disappeared worry many in the economics profession who feel Britain has not done enough to erase the psychology of rising prices. Average earnings On Tuesday the CSO publishes other figures for inflation as measured by the prices of factory goods for UK consumption at the wholesale level,while on Thursday the Employment Department is due to give its estimate of the underlying rise in average earnings for the year to March. Economists interested in clues as to the strength of the US upturn will eagerly await details to be issued on Friday of US industrial production last month.

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAVY STANDS DOWN TO STUDY ITS ACCIDENTS  </P> <P> The U.S. Navy has decided to sharply curtail aircraft flights and warship  movements for 48 hours to study safety procedures after a recent series of  accidents around the world, defense officials said today.  </P> <P> "It is a safety stand-down. They will look at their procedures to see if  something more can be done for safety," said one of the officials, who asked  not to be identified.  </P> <P> In the latest in a string of incidents, at least 13 sailors and shipyard  workers were injured in Norfolk, Va., today in a fire aboard the helicopter  landing ship Inchon, the seventh accident involving a U.S. warship since Oct.  11.  </P> <P> Both Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Navy officials said earlier that the  accidents, which included U.S. ships and aircraft firing at or bombing one  another, showed no pattern.  </P> <P> But some experts have called for a close look at safety procedures as the  random accidents have mounted.  </P> <P> One sailor was in serious condition and another in guarded condition at  hospitals in Norfolk after the brief morning fire aboard the Inchon, which was  docked at a shipyard for routine maintenance, according to Navy Lt. Cmdr. Steve  Burnett.  </P> <P> "It was apparently an electrical fire. As far as we can determine, there were  no other serious injuries," Burnett said. He said the fire in a power  distribution room on the hangar deck of the Inchon was quelled shortly after it  broke out at 9:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Seven people have been killed or lost at sea and 16 injured in the string of  accidents, which included a collision between a destroyer and a merchant ship  off Malaysia on Sunday and the crash of a jet on a carrier Oct. 29.  </P></p>

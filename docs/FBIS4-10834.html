			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 13 Apr (PL) -- Basic Industry Minister  Marcos Portal reported that two-thirds of Cuba's electricity  plants are out of service due to damage.    Portal held a news conference during which he referred to  the  causes for the abrupt increase in the number of power outages in  Havana, where electricity was available for only four hours in  most neighborhoods this Tuesday.    The situation is even worse in the countryside, especially  because the available electricity is used for harvesting sugar  cane (from December to April) on a priority basis. According to  Vice President Carlos Lage, this activity will continue until  May of this year.    Portal explained that a lack of foreign financing and  technological dependency on the former Socialist bloc -- most of  the country's electric plants came from the former Soviet Union  and Czechoslovakia -- have led to a serious delay in the  national electricity network's maintenance schedule.    As of 1989, the plants were able to generate power at  80-percent efficiency with the remaining 20 percent out of  service due to damage or for technical maintenance, which is  normal compared to international practices, the minister stated.    The minister added that the country used to work with  reserve  stations, but that option is no longer available to us.    Up to May 1993, the industry was able to maintain a certain  level of response to growing demand, Portal said, adding that  the mechanical condition of the plants deteriorated during July  and August.    On the positive side, Marcos Portal announced that 900,000  tons of the 2.6 million tons of oil required to generate  electricity the previous year was national crude oil, which  allowed the country to save its meager convertible foreign  exchange.    Due in part to greater availability of domestic crude oil  and  the foreign credits that have been obtained, Cuba will be able  to allocate resources for the repair of thermonuclear plants and  reach the second half of 1994 operating at 50 to 60 percent of  capacity, the basic industry minister stated.    This would allow us, Portal said, to significantly reduce  power outages during the day, but we would have to continue them  at night, when the most electricity is used.</p>

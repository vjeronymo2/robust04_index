			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Moscow's racecourse bets on the private sector 'HORSE RACING is for poor people,' declared the young Russian businessman. 'What's the point in betting if you can only win roubles? What can you buy here with roubles? We just came for a laugh.' And off he strode with his friends, cutting through the crowd of middle-aged men, engrossed in their race programmes at the Moscow racetrack. But he had missed the point. Muscovites do not come to the city's only race track to make money. They attend because betting is about the only thing in their lives which is inflation-free. And they come because they are fanatics. Igor and his friends, all pensioners, spend every Sunday perched high above the course at the back of the grandstand. On winter evenings they watch by floodlight as the horses trot around the snow-bound track, their hooves studded for extra grip. Now the summer trotting season is in full swing, and flat racing too, which started in June. Four races gone, and Igor's first vodka bottle already lies empty. 'We come here to escape. Not just from our wives, but from the reality and hardships of life in Moscow,' he says, before wandering off to one of the cavernous halls beneath the grandstand to place a small bet - 'No more than twenty roubles.' Instead of bookies, rows of elderly women sit in glass booths tapping each bet into a system of antiquated computers. Vladimir Butenko, the man in charge of the house tote, says the current economic crisis has changed very little. 'Under the Tzars people bet their whole fortune. The psychology of the gamblers hasn't changed, just their financial ability.' Most of the regular crowd of some 10,000 became hooked just after the Second World War, when horse racing enjoyed a brief spring of official tolerance, not seen since pre-revolutionary days. Stalin's son, Vassily, was a regular at the luxurious Begat (Races) restaurant attached to the grandstand. His patronage helped to keep the sport alive. But since then the races, and particularly the bourgeois compulsion to bet, have been frowned on. The hippodrome became the only place in the Soviet Union where gambling was still tolerated, and then only because the state took 25 per cent. In spite of official disapproval, it is easy to see how Moscow's course has remained popular. Built in 1835, it is the oldest track in Europe - a calm oasis in a city of grime and hassle. The classical grandstand, with its ornate ceilings, has burned down three times and been rebuilt, unaltered, after every fire. Advertising hoardings, which cover most racecourses like wallpaper, are nowhere to be seen. On the far side of the three-lane track more than 1,000 horses live in a small town of meandering, rickety stables. However, an old-world feel and a dedicated following are no longer enough to keep the hippodrome alive, even if betting is now politically correct. On a good day the track may take more than 500,000 roubles, but even so, soaring inflation means the that cost of straw, salaries and sugar lumps is beginning to get out of hand. For the last few years the hippodrome has been surviving on little else but enthusiasm. Trainers, grooms and drivers alike all receive a meagre state salary of less than 1500 roubles (about Pounds 8) a month. But riding to the rescue is a creature that has not been seen in Russia for almost 75 years, a bourgeois relic from pre-revolutionary days: the private horse owner. Timur Oumerov started, or rather restarted, it all. Two years ago he bought Seriose, a Russian trotter, for 150,000 roubles. Since then he has bought another two, and next month he is going to the US to pick up a couple more. It is, he admits, a financial gamble. But then, for one of Russia's first private businessmen, the risk of being Russia's first private horse-owner is hardly a novelty. Nor is it simply a question of profit and publicity, for in spite of a life-long allergy to them, Oumerov is a fanatical horse lover. He has plenty of schemes to drag Russian racing back to its 19th century heyday - needless to say, most of them begin with the word 'privatise.' While the hippodrome management drags its heels with talk of 'preserving the status quo,' Oumerov is making plans to buy his own stable, his own stud farm, even a share in the track if the state will let him. He also wants the hippodrome to set up a hard currency tote, alongside the rouble one, to lure the sort of people who shun the track in favour of the opulent Casino, which has taken over Vassily Stalin's favourite restaurant. Oumerov's hobby is catching on, albeit slowly. His fellow horse-owners might be pushed to fill an executive box at the moment, but in a country trying to reinvent the concept of social prestige (without a Communist Party card), one's own horse is not a bad status symbol. On the other hand, any nouveau riche businessman thinking he can turn the hippodrome into a playboy's plaything is on the wrong track. Alla Polsunova will take care of that - she has already turned down a handful of offers to buy her stable from people who, she decided, 'loved money more than horses.' A broad, boisterous woman, adored by all at the racetrack, Alla is one of the leading experts on trotters in Russia. She is also a champion driver, a trainer, and vice-president of the new Russian Trotting Association. Sitting in her stable kitchen, surrounded by her grooms, stableboys and drivers, she talks about the need to promote Russian racing abroad, to return to the days when Moscow was considered part of Europe. From the kitchen, which presently doubles as the Trotting Association's office, she phones and faxes the praises of Russian horses, and horsemen and women, to anyone who will listen. One team from her stable has recently competed in the Netherlands. This month the hippodrome holds an international trotting competition, sponsored by Oumerov's firm, and (more surprisingly) by a Ukrainian sugar factory. At the stables next door to Alla, Anton Taraboyev is planning his move to the private sector with almost childish enthusiasm. He wants to charge people to drive round the track in his troika - the old Russian carriage pulled by three trotters. For Dollars 6,000 (Pounds 3,140) he will even sell the carriage. He also wants to set up a small business selling horses' milk, Koumis, which is a traditional anti-tuberculosis remedy. In its hurry to erase all traces of the last 70 years, Russia sometimes appears to be losing its own identity in a flood of Western culture. Among the MacDonalds, Pizza Huts and Coke, the Moscow hippodrome is a rare example of a Russian industry looking for salvation in its own history.</p>

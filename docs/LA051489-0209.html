			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TESLA: LOW-KEY MAGNETIC METAL;  </P> <P> SUCCESS IS BORN OF SOUND, NOT FLASH  </P> <P> While making a point about fame, Brian Wheat, bassist of the hard-rock/metal  band Tesla, told a story about having dinner with Axl Rose, the notorious  leader of Guns N' Roses, at an infamous hangout on the Sunset Strip.  </P> <P> Wheat, who hates to fly, had driven into town from Sacramento the previous day.  On his first night in town, he was dining with Rose, whose band is a label-mate  of Tesla at Geffen Records.  </P> <P> "The poor guy couldn't eat," Wheat said about Rose. "People kept coming up to  him asking for his autograph -- shoving pieces of paper at him, hounding him.  That got me to thinking -- is that what I want? I can sit here and nobody knows  me. I like success, But I don't know if I want to be that famous, where I  couldn't eat a meal without being bothered."  </P> <P> At that moment, nobody was bothering Wheat, who was lunching in another Sunset  Strip restaurant the day after the dinner with Rose. The only thing that was  bothering Wheat was a bland Caesar salad he wished he'd never ordered.  </P> <P> A low-key, casual sort, Wheat, 26, was trying to imagine himself a big star.  That's not a pipe dream. After two albums, this band is one of metal's new  shining lights. Its first, "Mechanical Resonance," has sold more than 800,000  copies. The follow-up, "The Great Radio Controversy," is over the 500,000 mark.  </P> <P> "Part of this fame business is OK, but I don't think all of it is really for  me," said Wheat. "I'm not like Axl. I'm not Hollywood or glitter. I'm a  Sacramento guy. I prefer that quiet, simple life style."  </P> <P> Wheat's hardly your typical hard-rocker, despite his long hair and those ripped  jeans. At least, he certainly doesn't sound like one.  </P> <P> In this interview he didn't brag; he didn't tell how many "chicks" he'd scored  with on tour. And though he boasted about how great Tesla is in every other  sentence, when it came to talking about himself, he seemed intent on stressing  how grand he isn't.  </P> <P> "I'm sort of nondescript -- not a pretty boy, not the kind of guy who sticks  out," he said.  </P> <P> Tesla is made up of five guys like that. The others are singer Jeff Keith, who  writes all the lyrics; guitarists Frank Hannon and Tommy Skeoch, and drummer  Troy Luccketta.  </P> <P> Humility, honesty and a down-to-earth attitude are admirable in real life, but  they can be liabilities in the glossy, macho world of metal.  </P> <P> Who is Tesla anyway? Hard-core metal and hard-rock fans know of them but don't  know much about them. They're not on the cover of every metal magazine. You  don't read about their bad-boy exploits in the music columns because they  probably don't have any bad-boy exploits. Hanging out with the notorious Axl  Rose is as notorious as Wheat gets.  </P> <P> The big story about Tesla is its lack of image. "We hear about that all the  time," Wheat pointed out. "People wonder how we survive in this hard-rock  business with no image when all the other bands are blinding you with flash.  Can normal guys do that in this day and age? I think so.  </P> <P> "We're five guys from Sacramento, ages 22 to 30. We do it with music. The front  man in these kinds of bands is usually the guy who gets all the media. Our  front man (Keith) isn't flashy. He's not pretentious. He's a good citizen -- a  concerned, caring kind of guy."  </P> <P> Essentially, Wheat is saying there's room in the sordid, image-conscious world  of hard rock for a band of Boy Scouts from Sacramento. Musically, though, these  guys aren't wimps. Fans love their ferociously rocking, blues-based music that  echoes Humble Pie, Led Zeppelin and AC/DC. Those two lead guitarists generate a  lot of thunder, blasting head-bangers into a state of ecstasy.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of bands around with flashy images that can't play as well as  Tesla," Wheat said.  </P> <P> That's as boastful as he got.  </P> <P> Tesla will begin a headlining tour in July. Meanwhile, the band is opening for  Poison -- one of the strangest touring match-ups of the year. Why would Tesla,  which has no real image, hook up with Poison -- flashy, heavily made-up pretty  boys who have been following that glittery trail blazed by Kiss and Motley  Crue?  </P> <P> "I was kind of surprised too when I heard about us touring with Poison," Wheat  explained. "We're at the opposite extremes. They're all flash. We're not like  them. We don't wear makeup or rat our hair or wear Spandex trousers."  </P> <P> Apparently the reason for this weird pairing is that each band wants exposure  to the other's audience. Tesla attracts an older, blue-collar crowd -- the  opposite of Poison's.  </P> <P> "Poison draws a young crowd, lots of pretty young girls," Wheat said. "It's  that real wild crowd. It's nothing to see 12-year-old kids smoking in their  audience. Our audience comes for the music, not the flash."  </P> <P> Tesla was originally formed by Wheat -- whose reverence for Paul McCartney  inspired him to take up the bass -- and guitarist Hannon in 1981. But the band  went through a series of personnel changes before settling on the current  lineup in 1984. Tesla's first album, "Mechanical Resonance" came out on Geffen  in 1986. The album was progressing slowly -- just 20,000 sales -- when the band  got its big break in January, 1987.  </P> <P> "David Lee Roth added us to his tour," Wheat recalled. "Cinderella had dropped  out and he needed a band. He liked our video and hired us. We owe him  everything. But we haven't even spoken to him since that tour."  </P> <P> Following a stint as Alice Cooper's opening act, Tesla got an even bigger break  -- touring for nine months with Def Leppard. "That was a good match-up," Wheat  said. "People always told us we sound like Leppard. That tour gave us great  exposure and really boosted our career."  </P> <P> It also boosted sales of the second album. "A lot of fans who saw us on the  Leppard tour last year bought our new album when it came out," said Wheat,  explaining why "The Great Radio Controversy" rocketed up the Billboard pop  chart. The Poison tour exposure has helped sales too.  </P> <P> "For a new band, it's important to get on the right tour," Wheat said. "That  helps more than an image. Right now, because of all this great tour exposure,  we're the most popular no-image band around."  </P></p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Letter: Sheehy view on police 'patent nonsense' Sir, Sir Patrick Sheehy's defence of his Report into Police Responsibilities and Rewards (Personal View, July 26) is so full of holes that he ought to be embarrassed. To take just one point - the introduction of 10-year, fixed-term appointments, then subsequently five-year terms. That this would not undermine the attraction of the police service as a vocation is patent nonsense. Sir Patrick reveals that the expiry of the fixed terms would be used to get rid of officers only on the grounds of medical unfitness, gross misconduct, manifest incompetence or severance on structural grounds. He is not in a position to give such a guarantee and why should every single officer in the police service be placed under the psychological duress that a renewable fixed term appointment must bring? It is not beyond any commercial or public sector organisation to devise procedures and systems which dispense with unsatisfactory employees on these grounds, but without having to wave the threat of failure to renew a fixed-term appointment. What Sir Patrick proposes does not apply in the rest of industry and is a carte blanche for management to control officers by fear and nepotism. This is no way to motivate or inspire officers. I also have to make the point that even where contracts apply in other industries, terminated employees at least have the chance of re-employment with other firms and industries. There is only one police service, with its unique training skills and experience. After 10 years or more, officers are simply not equipped or young enough to be trained for alternative employment. That is why the police federations are logically (as well as emotionally) appalled at Sir Patrick's failure to understand the police service.

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Gillette advances to Dollars 120.5m GILLETTE, the US toiletries and shaving products company, saw after-tax profits rise by almost one fifth in the second quarter of 1992, to Dollars 120.5m. A year earlier, the company had reported Dollars 101.8m, writes Nikki Tait. The net profits total was scored on sales of Dollars 1.2bn, against Dollars 1.09bn last time, with operating profits up at Dollars 226.5m from Dollars 201.3m. Gillette's after-tax profits for the first half of the year stand at Dollars 249.9m, compared with Dollars 209m. Gillette said its main blades and razors business made significant sales and profits gains year-on-year, largely due to the success of the company's Sensor shaving system. In toiletries and cosmetics, second-quarter sales increased slightly, but profits were well below last year's levels.</p>

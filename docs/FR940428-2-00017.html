Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Department recovered $585,000 from the SEA in response to claims arising from a special investigative audit conducted by the Office of the Arizona Auditor General of the SEA's discretionary funding programs for the period January 1979 through June 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The claims primarily involved the SEA's administration and supervision of funds under Chapter 2 of the ECIA. Specifically, the final audit determination of the Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education (Assistant Secretary) found that official records, such as sole source procurement authorizations, vendor invoices, and receiving reports, were falsified to circumvent internal control procedures. As a result of collusion between a former Deputy Superintendent of the SEA and two vendors, Chapter 2 funds paid for consulting services that were never performed, educational materials that did not exist, and other fraudulent schemes. Therefore, the Assistant Secretary demanded repayment of $777,745.46 to the Department for misspent funds. The SEA appealed the determination of the Assistant Secretary to the Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) on February 20, 1991. Subsequently, on July 23, 1993, while the case was pending, the Department and the SEA executed a settlement agreement, wherein the SEA would repay $585,000 to the Department in full settlement of the appeal. On October 22, 1993, the SEA repaid the full amount of $585,000 to the Department for misspent funds under Chapter 2 of the ECIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> B. Authority for Awarding a Grantback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 459(a) of GEPA, 20 U.S.C. 1234h(a), provides that, whenever the Secretary has recovered funds following a final audit determination with respect to an applicable program, the Secretary may consider those funds to be additional funds available for the program and may arrange to repay to the SEA or local educational agency (LEA) affected by that determination an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the recovered funds. The Secretary may enter into this ``grantback'' arrangement if the Secretary determines that_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The practices and procedures of the SEA or LEA that resulted in the audit determination have been corrected, and the SEA or LEA is, in all other respects, in compliance with the requirements of the applicable program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The SEA has submitted to the Secretary a plan for the use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement that meets the requirements of the program and, to the extent possible, benefits the population that was affected by the failure to comply or by the misexpenditures that resulted in the audit exception; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Use of funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement in accordance with the SEA's plan would serve to achieve the purposes of the program under which the funds were originally granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=2 --> C. Plan for Use of Funds Awarded Under a Grantback Arrangement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Pursuant to section 459(a)(2) of GEPA, the SEA has submitted a plan for use of the $438,750 in grantback funds under Chapter 2 of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SEA proposes to use the grantback funds to supplement a portion of its Chapter 2 effective schools program, specifically the Arizona Student Assessment Program (ASAP), by developing performance-based assessments tailored to the State's Spanish-speaking pupils_many of whom are at risk and whose education entails higher costs. The grantback plan also includes teacher and parent training related to the new assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of ASAP's components prescribes a comprehensive performance-based assessment system with broad capabilities for reporting test results. The SEA has designed performance assessments that effectively test student mastery of the Arizona Essential Skills, Statewide academic standards, at grades 3, 8, and 12 in the areas of reading, writing, and mathematics. These tests, known as ``Form A,'' are administered in both English and Spanish. However, the Riverside Publishing Company has developed a ``Form B'' for testing one to two grade levels preceding ``Form A,'' and a ``Form C'' that will test two to three grade levels preceding ``Form A.'' Presently, there are no Spanish versions of ``Form B'' or ``Form C.'' Spanish versions are greatly needed because approximately one quarter of Arizona's student population is from native Spanish-speaking backgrounds and nearly 9 percent are enrolled in bilingual education classes. Currently, no legislative or State board mandate exists to obtain Spanish versions nor has a funding source to develop them been identified. Under the grantback plan, Arizona would use the grantback funds to pay the Riverside Publishing Company to produce Spanish editions of the tests called ``Forms B and C'' that would reflect appropriate cultural content. Teachers would receive training in the use of ``Forms B and C'' and parent and community workshops would be held to inform the public at large about ASAP initiatives and to invite participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

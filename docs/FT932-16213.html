			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Unions may still be able to breach industrial peace: David Goodhart reports on signs that employers have not used three years of recession to win greater flexibility AS BRITAIN crawls out of recession, industrial relations present a picture of almost unprecedented passivity. But some employers are warning that beneath the surface lies a spirit of sullen acquiescence rather than co-operation, which does not bode well for pay bargaining come the upturn. In spite of recent one-day strikes, a small spate of high-profile disputes in Scotland and the threat of action by firefighters, the Department of Employment recorded only 22 strikes in progress in January, less than the year before, itself a record low. The number of pay freezes continues to grow and average settlements are still falling to around 3 per cent. Behind the huffing and puffing from public-sector unions the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit looks like being accepted with little resistance. The once militant Civil Service unions NUCPS and CPSA have even recommended acceptance of a 1 per cent increase and there is little evidence of the return of the 'fringe benefit' to by-pass the pay limit. Nalgo, the local government union which yesterday had its 5 per cent claim firmly rejected by the employers, may still be capable of some disruption and the Fire Brigades Union might successfully flex industrial muscle over its pay formula. There may even be a slight upturn in industrial action, as there was right at the end of the early 1980s recession, as companies finally take the tough decisions on redundancies or benefit cuts they have been trying to avoid. But a return to significant labour militancy is not expected. Yet, in spite of passive unions, earnings have been rising - last year average earnings rose 6.1 per cent, well above the inflation rate of 3.7 per cent. And even three years into recession some companies have been paying very generous bonuses for changes in working practices - 14.5 per cent rises at ICI and several deals of 5 per cent plus at the privatised utilities. There are signs that employers have made little use of the recession to change bargaining arrangements. A senior official at one employer's organisation said: 'Employers have missed a golden opportunity. Things like annualised hours and individual contracts are still the exception.' A recent report found that less than 100,000 employees had been affected by union derecognition over the last five years. Mr Robbie Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the Confederation of British Industry, also points to employer passivity. He says that a recent survey found managers in less than one-in-four private-sector workplaces believed there were significant restrictions on their freedom to organise work. He adds: 'But the willingness to take advantage of this new freedom turns out to be much more patchy. Over 60 per cent of private-sector managers reported no actual increase in job flexibility or reductions in job demarcation over the previous three years.' There are other signs that the power of unions remains considerable where they are still well organised. Manual and white collar workers at Ford UK recently resisted the company's attempt to impose compulsory redundancies. The continuing decline of industry-wide pay agreements may increase upward pressures on pay in unionised companies as recovery begins. After the GPMU print union refused a 1.7 per cent offer from the British Printing Industry Federation the employers abandoned national negotiations for this year. The GPMU is now pressing its claim company by company and, according to pay analysts Incomes Data Services, has agreed a 3.9 per cent deal at the Lawson Mardon Group. There have been similar developments at the National Bed Federation and in the lock, latch and key industry. IDS concludes: 'Decisions made in recession may have awkward consequences in the future, for employers and unions alike.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Larina G. Perez] </F>   [Text] Officials who met to discuss an economic growth plan  for the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth  Area (BIMP-EAGA), have agreed to establish an air service system  that will promote, develop, and enhance trade and investments in  the area.    As a step closer toward the realization of a common air  service system within the area, the officials have agreed that  Brunei will become the focal point of air linkages in the region.    "Because of Brunei's strategic location (it is practically  smack at the middle of the growth area), it will be positioning  as the focal gateway to the EAGA (East ASEAN Growth Area, now  known as BIMP-EAGA)," Department of Tourism (DoT) Undersecretary  Ramona Lopez-Ty said.    Ms. Ty, who was with the Philippine delegation when the  ministers of the BIMP-EAGA met in Davao last Saturday, said:  "Royal Brunei has offered to take the initiative to add to the  frequencies. With their wealth and economic resources, it will  not be too difficult for them to expand their (air service)  capacities."    She reported that Brunei's national carrier, Royal Brunei,  had already bought two 50-seater Fokker planes primarily for the  purpose of servicing the area.    Apart from the existing bilateral air agreements between the  BIMP-EAGA member countries, officials are still working for more  air linkages, Ms. Ty said.  <H5>  Increased Access </H5>   She, however, qualified: "We're not talking of open skies  here. There are certain rights that our national carriers have  that you just don't give away. We're talking of increased  accessibility."    Ms. Ty reports that the idea of establishing a regional  airline jointly owned by the four countries has been shelved.  Instead, they are more inclined toward establishing "common  operations and increasing air links and capacity."</p>

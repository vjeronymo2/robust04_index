			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System The French franc was the star performer of the system last week. It leapt from bottom to sixth in the EMS grid, nudging its central rate of Ffr3.539 against the D-Mark. Sterling also remained strong, though it is a little further away from its central rate of DM2.95 than the franc. Analysts said both sterling and the franc had profited from a weaker dollar. Last year, dollar weakness tended to result in EMS tensions, as funds floated from the US currency into the D-Mark. Now, with Germany in the thick of economic difficulties, those funds are flowing into the British and French currencies. Currencies, Page 29 The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent fluctuation band. Currencies in the EMS narrow band cannot rise more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the system. Sterling, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo operate with 6 per cent fluctuation bands.</p>

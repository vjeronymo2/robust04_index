			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADING PLACES;  </P> <P> PERESTROIKA: A SOVIET INTELLECTUAL SAYS THE U. S. MUST TURN ITS ATTENTION FROM  EVENTS IN THE SOVIET UNION AND DO A LITTLE SOUL-SEARCHING OF ITS OWN.  </P> <P> For Sergey Plekhanov, 1969 was his introduction to a freer form of enterprise  on the dingier side of capitalism.  </P> <P> Five Brooklyn teen-agers tried to mug him for his watch.  </P> <P> Functioning more on naivete than nerve, Plekhanov told them it was a Russian  watch. It was the only one of its kind in New York, he added, and therefore of  little value to any fence.  </P> <P> Impressed by his grasp of the economics of their trade, the Prospect Park  roughs tossed a few rocks at Plekhanov and left man and watch intact.  </P> <P> Plekhanov continues to impress others with his logic.  </P> <P> Only these days, nobody throws rocks at Sergey Plekhanov -- deputy director of  the Institute of U. S. and Canadian Studies at the U.S.S.R. Academy of  Sciences, a television analyst and eloquent spokesman for the democratization  of the Soviet Union. Not even when he suggests that, with the Soviet Union in  freer, more peaceful order, it might be time for the United States to exercise  a little perestroika.  </P> <P> "Whenever I look at statistics of American society, I see a lot of problems  which are not solved, and a lot of needs that are not being met," he said.  </P> <P> Plekhanov, 43, knows the essential arithmetic: $295 billion spent by the U.S.  military in 1989; drug abuse that costs Ameri can taxpayers $200 billion a  year; an embarrassing illiteracy rate; estimates of more than 1 million  homeless Americans; and "crime . . . at a much higher level than it is in the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "I've been observing America for 20 years now, and I do not see much progress  toward solution of those problems. In 1970, when I first came to America, it  seemed a better and more human place. Although I understand there have been  some progressive changes, there has also been a regression in the way people  think about the future of America."  </P> <P> Interviewed after a 14-hour parade of cafeteria meetings with students and  dinner presentations Tuesday to faculty and guests at UC Irvine, Plekhanov  acknowledged that the history of the Soviet Union hasn't exactly been a bowl of  caviar either.  </P> <P> There was Stalin's corruption of Leninism and a dictatorship since proved  murderous. Chernobyl has become an icon to nuclear negligence, and Plekhanov's  debit list grows longer: "Persecution of dissidents . . . sending troops to  Czechoslovakia, sending troops to Afghanistan . . . constraints on immigration,  and not only Jewish immigration."  </P> <P> But on the other side of the ruble, the U. S. traditionally spends more on  public health than does the Soviet Union; the Soviet Union doesn't have the  legacy of Vietnam; the United States has a better record on civil rights.  </P> <P> "Having spent more than a year in New York, I recognize that maybe the United  States has gone further in coming to grips with a multiracial society than any  other country," Plekhanov said. "The prejudice is still there. But look at the  practical experience of living side by side and actually overcoming that  prejudice, squeezing it out of yourself.  </P> <P> "For that, you need the right kind of a climate, and the civil rights movement,  I think, was a powerful, liberating thing for the American psychology, for the  American consciousness."  </P> <P> Now, he believes, that consciousness could be redirected toward an American  reformation. The nation, he feels, has lost much of its "very healthy . . .  self-critical attitude" of the late '60s and early '70s. Priorities in federal  funding remain heavily rooted in "artificial fears, . . . yesterday's agendas."  </P> <P> "But we (in the Soviet Union) are having our perestroika," he continued. "We  have started attacking the postulates of the old order in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "To some people, it is terrible. . . . They say: 'Oh, this is the end of  everything because this is radical critique.' But radical critique is like  surgery, which is necessary when you know that the roots of your disease  require such a surgery."  </P> <P> When Plekhanov, a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations,  first came to the United States, it was as an intern for the Soviet delegation  to the United Nations.  </P> <P> His stay produced a thesis on the birth and growth of American right-wing  politics. It also saw development of a passion for the folk music of Pete  Seeger, playing jazz piano in pursuit of Fats Waller and guitar after Wes  Montgomery.  </P> <P> In the two decades since -- and after his knowledge of Seeger was considered  credential enough for a junior research post with the Institute of U.S. and  Canadian Studies -- only Stolichnaya vodka has visited more corners of America.  </P> <P> Plekhanov was hired by CBS for last year's Malta Summit, playing analyst to Dan  Rather's anchor. He was on Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's team of  Soviet-American experts at the Geneva Summit. He goes back to CBS in June, when  Gorbachev meets President George Bush in Washington.  </P> <P> The lighter Plekhanov wears Hungarian sport coats, Italian shirts, American  silk neckties and Spanish slacks. "But the underwear is from the Soviet Union,"  he says. "It is very comfortable."  </P> <P> He knows all the lyrics of Phil Ochs' "Talking Birmingham Jam" and interrupted  this week's trip to San Diego for two hours of personal pleasure -- prowling  the tall ship "Star of India."  </P> <P> And his English is so American, so correct to vernacular, buzzwords and mild  blasphemies, that his boss, Georgy Arbatov, once joked that institute workers  suspect Plekhanov might be a CIA plant.  </P> <P> Yet, these days, there is little time for fun, even less for a wife and two  children in Moscow, as Plekhanov is courted heavily and internationally by  those seeking his rare intellect for focusing a path through entangled  superpowers.  </P> <P> But even Plekhanov must rush to keep up. Tuesday's news of Gorbachev's proposal  for a Western-style presidency had passed the Supreme Soviet and was a lunch  question from his audience before Plekhanov had even heard details of the vote.  </P> <P> Five years ago, he said, democratization was a topic that the wise dared not  whisper in Moscow. On Sunday, the head of his institute was openly condemning  Soviet defense expenditures and the futility of attempting political ends by  military means in an article appearing in the Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> Reduced military spending, Plekhanov believes, is key to future progress in  both countries. "It is obscene for the United States and for the Soviet Union  to spend so much and to continue to spend so much on defense against each  other.  </P> <P> "I think this is a great contradiction of world politics. The Cold War is over,  but the military budgets are still swollen and we are far too slow in bringing  them down."  </P> <P> So if there were a perestroika in the United States, he said, it would also  mean "changing your foreign policy and the way you look at the outside world."  </P> <P> Plekhanov also sees the United States on the cusp of a crisis. There was one in  the Depression of the '20s and '30s, "but then came Roosevelt and the  nationwide movement for change." The '70s produced the deep division of Vietnam  and "a terrible racial problem, a problem of dissent and coping with dissent .  . . not spending enough on social problems and spending too much on the war in  Vietnam.  </P> <P> "But you pulled out of that."  </P> <P> The '80s and the Reagan era, he believes, created "the illusion . . . that just  unshackling private initiative" would produce security and prosperity.  </P> <P> "But you've woken up and the world is not as beautiful as it seemed. It turns  out that many problems have not been solved and many new problems have been  created, and suddenly the heroes of the Reagan boom are winding up in jail or  in bankruptcy court."  </P> <P> Concurrently, domestic industry is being crippled by economic competition from  overseas. The need now, he said, is for the United States to break loose from  "a tremendous under-investment in human capital.  </P> <P> "If you want to become competitive, you have to invest much more in human  beings in order to retrain the labor force, in order to find new incentives to  improve productivity."  </P> <P> Then, he said, the United States will be better equipped to join the world  against a new threat of extinction from global deterioration of the  environment.  </P> <P> Whether nuclear testing in the Pacific in 1946 or malathion spraying in Los  Angeles in 1990, Plekhanov said, "scientists have led us down the garden path"  into a "sacred belief in progress and that they are so smart."  </P> <P> Also to blame are "a lot of people who think that producing wealth, producing  goods and services, becoming powerful in terms of economic power, is the most  important thing."  </P> <P> His own children, he noted, have developed allergies never suffered by their  parents. Could it be that in conception, he asked, mother and father  transferred "some poisons . . . because we drank the wrong kind of water, we  breathed the wrong kind of air or ate the wrong kind of fruits and meats?"  </P> <P> "The best brains, the most committed people and a great sense of outrage" will  be required to cease, much less resolve such problems, he said, adding that his  personal proposal is to divert money from the Soviet-American arms race and  invest them "into ecology-saving technologies, into joint actions to stop this  murder of the planet.  </P> <P> "I would like to see us Russians become leaders in a worldwide green movement,  if only because the ecological crisis is very severe in the Soviet Union. The  greening of the Soviet Union. That's what we need."  </P> <P> But his concern about modern foods, the environment and humanity would not  extend to a ban on Moscow's newest attraction -- a McDonalds restaurant.  </P> <P> Plekhanov does not see Beeg Mak Gamburgers as an intrusion of capitalism.  </P> <P> "Fast food for the masses," he said. "Pure Leninism. McDonalds should have been  there in 1920."  </P></p>

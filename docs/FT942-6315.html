			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Life companies likely to use derivatives more The use of derivatives by life insurance companies is set to increase significantly, according to a study by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants, published today. The KPMG survey found that only half a sample of 50 UK life companies are currently using derivatives - instruments such as swaps, futures and options whose value is 'derived' from more conventional financial assets - for either portfolio management or product design. However, virtually all these companies are preparing to increase their use of derivatives and four out of every five intend to use the instruments in the future. Mr Rupert Yardley, the author of the report, suggests that the relaxation of regulations in July is one of the reasons. 'Life offices have been inhibited in the past from using derivatives by the restrictive valuation rules applied by the Department of Trade and Industry in measuring solvency and by the virtual prohibition on holding derivatives in unit-linked funds,' explained Mr Yardley. 'However, most of these restrictions will be removed.' Mr Yardley said the disparity between the largest offices and the rest was 'striking' and reflected the fact that larger offices could devote more resources to considering tax and regulatory implications. The larger life offices have long been using derivatives for hedging and asset allocation purposes and, more recently, to match FT-SE linked products. A large majority of the companies believed there was a significant opportunity to design new products and derivatives could be the key to offering products with guarantees. The survey also found that life companies have been very conservative in the extent to which they have used derivatives for tactical asset allocation purposes and may be missing out on opportunities for more efficient portfolio management. Life companies make most use of equity options and futures, with 40 per cent of the companies in the survey - mainly with-profits offices and mutuals - currently using equity options. 'This probably reflects the use of call options to pre-invest cash flows and the need for such offices to protect their equity portfolios against sharp falls in value,' said the report. The survey said few companies had considered the use of derivatives from an explicit tax perspective. 'This appears to be an area where there may be opportunities for the use of derivatives which are not being taken advantage of at present,' it said.</p>

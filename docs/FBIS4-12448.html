			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to the Chamber </F> of Deputies in Tunis following his taking the constitutional  oath on his reelection as president of the republic -- live]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate and the  merciful. Mr. Speaker; deputies; the holding of the first  session of your respected house, which coincides with the 9  April anniversary, has more than one significance. [passage  omitted]    As a gesture of a pledge to those pure martyrs, those brave  people, those militants and those who fought for the goals of  the country; and as the best greetings and honor that one can  give them, we should all be at the level of national  responsibility, and at the level of the trust that the people  placed in us by electing us. We should place the people's  interests above all other considerations, and we should work  continuously to realise their ambitions and aspirations within  the framework of justice, dignity, solidarity and stability,  within the principles and the visions laid down in the 7  November Declaration, which we have been implementing gradually,  a policy that has resulted in a number of achievements and gains  for our people. [passage omitted]    Your duties, which you will carry out in this chamber, will  enable you to closely view all things concerned with the  political, economic and social course of this country.    Your participation in the regional assemblies will enable  you  to be absolutely informed about the realities of your areas and  the expectations of the people. In both cases, it will help you  to follow up the government's activities in all fields and to  enrich the contents of plans and proposed budgets with your  contributions and clarifications. [passage omitted]    Ladies and gentlemen, because of the differences in your  party affiliations, the multiparty system -- for the first time  -- has materialized in the Chamber of Deputies. It was a  fundamental choice made available by the policies we followed  since the move for change to establish democracy and pluralism.  We stressed in the 7 November declaration that our people are  worthy of a developed political life, truely based on  multiparties and popular organizations.    From this context, we developed laws and institutions in  line  with the society's development. Your election took place in the  shadow of democracy, transparency, civilized behavior and under  the administration's total neutrality. And so, pluralism has  found its way into this chamber. [passage omitted]    In the new stage we will work on consolidating the  foundations of a civil society, entrenching democracy,  strengthening human rights by disseminating its values and  spreading it, assuring legal guarantees for everyone so that  they may practise their freedoms in the widest scope given to  them by law, respond to the requisites of justice, and ensure  balance and cohesiveness of society.    Today, after the people have had their say and have chosen  their representatives, the influence of every person in the  political sphere has become apparent to all. There is no scope,  outside these institutions and organizations, for anyone to  speak in the name of the people except those who have the right  to represent them or sectors of society. They, alone, are the  ones qualified to do this.    The state of law, whose foundations we established and  strengthened, does not solely mean the state's respect for the  law, but also means respect for it by everyone -- individuals,  groups, organizations, institutions. We will also stand firm in  the face of any outlaw employing any slogan. We will also not  allow anyone who finds excuses in the name of freedom and human  rights to cause damage to the homeland, distort its reputation  or harm its relations with brothers and friends.    Each citizen has the right to defend his freedom and rights,  and we will be the first to listen to him, to remove the  grievances which could be imposed on him, and to enable him to  obtain his rights in full and preserve his dignity, because we  consider guaranteeing rights and protecting values to be a duty  and a responsibility.    Our country is organized; it has its own institutions and  bodies which have the capacity to guarantee all freedoms and  rights, be it political, civil or humanitarian.    It is the responsibility of each quarter, body or  individual,  including human rights societies, to work toward respecting the  law, implement it in all cases and to protect the rights of the  group and its interests, and not to demand the suspension of the  laws and search for reasons for infringements, or restrict  oneself for defending whoever makes vocational errors and  deliberately breaks the law for a selfish interest or personal  purpose which he would make an issue for the people and the  country.    Among the practices which simply indicate a feeling of  inferiority and self-hate, is the initiative of some who issue  statements directly to the foreign media as though they are  seeking support against their country or appeal for assistance  against it.    Honorable deputies, ladies and gentlemen. International  institutions and agencies have praised our success and have  renewed their readiness to cooperate with us. We have managed  to clinch the confidence of private monetary institutions, which  forge no deals except on the basis of the productivity and  effectiveness of a partner. They have no other considerations.  These monetary bodies would not do this if they had not found  credibility and guarantees, seriousness and stability in our  country, which encouraged them to make such deals.    All objective foreign media, for its part, also did not  hesitate to praise our country's achievements in all fields,  accomplished day after day. When it does this it balances  between the positive and negative aspects. We welcome it and  follow what it writes with interest.    We do not care what some foreign media has persisted in  pursuing in an attempt to harm Tunisia's honor and undermine its  sovereignty by publishing biased reports containing insults and  slanders. It has opened its pages to some people who claim they  belong to the world of journalism, or to some journalists whose  nostalgia for the colonialist period has not abated and whose  feelings of animosity and domination have not dwindled.    Such newspapers have no place in Tunisia, and doing away  with  them is very easy because of the spread of objective newspapers  and other means of communication. The same is true of some  nongovernmental organizations which have also not ceased  claiming that they are mandated -- in the name of human rights  or freedom of the press -- to discuss our laws, investigate how  far we have implemented them. Others want to carry out  referendums and opinion polls, and to publish only what pleases  them, which is restricted in mentioning the shortcomings, or  making up these shortcomings if they cannot find any.    Our country is not a laboratory or a test field, and is not  in the custody of anyone. [applause]    Some countries deliberately shelter some Tunisian terrorists  and do not hesitate to enable them to obtain asylum despite the  decisive evidence and the firm rulings which we presented to  those countries against those people. Some of these countries  open their official media channels for thee terrorists and  present them as victims of human rights and wasted freedoms.  Those responsible for these actions would only be convinced by  either of two ways: Either we embark on preplanned courses and  enter ready made models in which they want to squeeze us and  become like excellent pupils, with all the belittling aspects  implied in this formula, or we admit to them that we are  underdeveloped and our laws are confined and become subject  matter for their pens and clubs.    Every successful person is envied. Were it not that our  country was distinct, nobody would pay attention to it. Some  quarters are offended by our success and envy us for it. They  do not understand how we can carry out the necessary reforms,  achieve distinguished gains and live in security and stability,  and how we can succeed and be safe in matters where others have  not succeeded and become safe despite the differences in the  conditions and capabilities.    What essentially concerns us is our people's trust and their  rallying around their system, their choices, and our trust in  ourselves. We derive all this from the purity of our intention,  the sincerity of our determination, the soundness of the accord  program we are following, the importance of the gains we are  achieving and from the prospects which unite between reality and  the aspirations which we open before our country and people.  [passage omitted: recalls election campaign and says current  parliament will work toward achieving the pledges made]</p>

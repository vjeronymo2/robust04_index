			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BANE RETURNS GIFT TO AVERT TAX RISK TO CITY OF HOPE  </P> <P> Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) has returned a 1986 campaign contribution of  $1,000 to the City of Hope National Medical Center because it may have  jeopardized the hospital's tax-free status, worth millions of dollars a year.  </P> <P> Bane, who serves on the Duarte institution's volunteer board of trustees and  heads a foundation that supports research at the City of Hope, returned the  money late last month after The Times inquired about the contribution. Bane's  campaign committee had listed it on a March, 1986, campaign report filed with  the state.  </P> <P> The episode occurred amid controversy over the aggressive political  fund-raising tactics of Bane and his wife, Marlene, who handles fund-raising  for Bane and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) in Southern  California. Both lawmakers have raised millions of dollars in recent years,  much of which has been used to support Democratic Assembly candidates who back  Brown.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Valentine's Day Dinner  </P> <P> City of Hope President Sanford M. Shapero was solicited to buy tickets to  Bane's annual $500-a-person Valentine's Day dinner in 1986 shortly after  Shapero joined the hospital, said Richard Ziman, chairman of the hospital's  executive council.  </P> <P> "Sandy Shapero didn't know what the rules were," Ziman said. "He didn't know it  was inappropriate for the City of Hope to make a contribution."  </P> <P> As a nonprofit organization, the City of Hope is prohibited from making  campaign contributions and, by doing so, could risk losing its tax-exempt  status, said Robert Giannangelico, spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service  in Los Angeles. This could cost the hospital millions of dollars annually.  </P> <P> "It's their mistake, not mine," Bane said. He maintained that his solicitors  invite individuals, not institutions, to the dinner. He noted that Shapero  attended the 1986 dinner. Shapero was out of town and could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Known for Funding  </P> <P> Ziman said that when Shapero made the contribution, which was recorded as  coming from the hospital's corporate headquarters, he was "aware that Bane and  the state of California had been very effective in funding institutions like  the City of Hope."  </P> <P> Bane has been instrumental in obtaining state funds for a three-person state  Lupus Appropriations Board, which awards grants to universities and hospitals  for basic research on lupus, an incurable and potentially fatal disease of the  autoimmune system. His wife has headed the board since its inception in 1977.  </P> <P> The board has given nearly $1.2 million, or 19% of its $6.2 million in total  grants, to the City of Hope since 1978, records show.  </P> <P> The Banes have been criticized by some grant applicants, who said they were  pushed to buy tickets to fund-raisers for Bane and Brown after seeking money  from the lupus board. These scientists, most of whom are not politically  active, said this raised questions about whether the quality of their proposals  was the sole criterion on which they were judged.  </P> <P> Bane responded that the proposals were evaluated on their merits alone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> National Lupus Group  </P> <P> In addition to sitting on the City of Hope's board of trustees, which raises  money but does not make policy, Bane is head of the National Lupus  Erythematosus Foundation. The private, nonprofit foundation, which operates out  of Bane's legislative office, raises money for research at the City of Hope. It  is not affiliated with the better-known Lupus Foundation of America, an  international self-help organization.  </P> <P> The national lupus foundation has raised $343,362 since 1977, much of it from  special interests regulated by the state, according to its annual reports filed  with the state. The largest contributor has been the H. F. Ahmanson Co., which  gave $135,000 between 1978 and 1984, the last year for which the foundation  listed contributors.  </P> <P> Ahmanson's principal subsidiary is Home Savings of America. Bane, a longtime  member of the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee, is the legislative  champion of California's savings and loan industry. The industry generously  bankrolls his campaign committee.  </P></p>

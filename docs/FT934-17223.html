			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Copenhagen's climb runs into resistance  -Danish equities have had a flat month after a boost in August The Danish equities market received a short-lived boost from the disintegration of the EMS in August, which weakened the krone against the D-Mark. The all-share index put on 6 per cent, but the improvement did not last. In September the index has barely moved. The krone has slipped by about four per cent against the D-Mark since the end of July, but the government's aim is to prevent a significant depreciation and Denmark's domestic currency has strengthened slightly against the Ecu since the end of July. An encouraging factor is that two cuts since August in the official discount rate, which moved down by 0.5 per cent to 8.25 per cent on Monday, left the krone undamaged, generating expectations of further interest rate reductions to come. On the assumption of lower short-term interest and easier money, brokers in Copenhagen expect a moderate improvement in share prices over coming months. So far this year the share price index has increased by 29 per cent, which is better than the European average, with confidence improved by the referendum vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty in May. Sector indices show a jump of 47 per cent for banks since the end of last year, with shipping shares increasing by 45 per cent. Industrials, up by only 14 per cent, have lagged badly, suffering from difficult conditions in all of their main export markets, Britain, Sweden and Germany, and a disappointing domestic market where first half GDP declined by about 1.3 per cent from the same period last year. The banks were returned to first-half profits by big gains in the value of their bond and share portfolios, gains which under Danish accounting practice go into the profit and loss account almost in their entirety. Dankse Bank has moved from a low of DKr189 to DKr385 this year, and Unidanmark from DKr99 to DKr209. Shares in the big AP Moller shipping and oil group's quoted companies, D/S 1912 and D/S Svendborg, have increased in value by over 50 per cent this year. Moller's Maersk Line became the world leader in container-carrying capacity earlier this year when it acquired the liner operations of its erstwhile Danish rival, the East Asiatic Company. The group's oil and gas production in the Danish sector of the North Sea has been adversely affected by lower oil and gas prices, but the volume of gas sales will increase by about 50 per cent in 1997 as the result of a new agreement with the state's oil and gas distribution company. Other shares which have performed well are EAC, up from a low of DKr60 to DKr144, and GN Great Northern, up from DKr253 to DKr537. EAC, once regarded as the Rolls Royce of the Danish corporate world, came close to total collapse last year, but a programme of divestments under a new management has put the group, which has major and profitable trading interests in the Far East, on a sounder footing. GN made its name a century ago by laying telephone cables across Russia and from there to Japan. Its fortunes have revived with the opening up of East Europe, where it has participated in establishing optical fibre cable links between Denmark and Poland, and south through Poland to the Czech border, and between Denmark and St Petersburg. This year GN signed a contract for cables to link Russia to Japan and South Korea. Meanwhile, the domestic economic outlook may be about to improve. There will be a big boost to demand through fiscal policy in 1994. The government predicts a growth in real private consumption by four per cent and in GDP by 2.9 per cent. Non-official forecasters tend to think that the forecasts are too high, but the minister of finance, Mr Mogens Lykketoft, told the FT this week that real household disposable incomes in 1994 will rise by at least 4-5 per cent, so he considers the forecast fully realistic.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Right set for record win in French elections FRANCE was last night on the road to election of a record conservative parliamentary majority, threatening a clash with Mr Francois Mitterrand, who remains president despite the defeat of his Socialist government. An exit poll released at 8pm local time (7pm GMT) as the last voting booths closed, gave the conservative Gaullist RPR and the centre-right UDF parties, fighting under the banner of Union pour la France (UPF), as many as 484 seats in the 577-member National Assembly with 40.5 per cent of the vote. The poll, by the polling organisation Sofres, predicted that the Socialists would win only 57 seats with 19 per cent of the vote. Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialist party, said 'the left risks being crushed in parliament' and called on electors to give their support in the second voting round next Sunday to those Socialists and ecologists who were best placed in yesterday's vote. He estimated that rightwing candidates had already won nearly 100 seats yesterday, while the left had won not a single victory. The extreme right National Front was projected to win up to 13 per cent of the vote. Mr Fabius attributed the Socialists' crushing defeat to 'the wear and tear of time, unemployment, and disappointment'. Even so, he said, 'this is a harsh penalty'. The Socialists fought their campaign against a background of recession, a 10.5 per cent jobless rate and a series of scandals. To win in the first round, candidates needed to get an absolute majority of 50 per cent of votes. A second ballot will be held in most seats on March 28, when the candidate who simply gets more votes than the others wins. But the surprising development of last night - the relative success of all parties on the broad right over all those on the broad left - leaves the UPF parties well placed for their widely predicted landslide victory. Despite the often fraught relations between the two groups, it had been expected that the Socialists and the environmentalists would pass their support to each other next Sunday in order to try to block the conservatives. But the Sofres poll gave the joint environmental group, composed of the Verts and Generation Ecologie a combined vote of just 8.5 per cent, far too little to gain them any seats in the parliament and to give Socialist candidates much effective support in the second round of voting. Mr Mitterrand will choose the next prime minister. But his choice will be largely determined by the relative showing of the two components of the coalition. Full report, Page 5</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Arts: A poet much misunderstood - One hundred years after his death Michael Glover defends Tennyson 'NOTHING could have been more striking than the scene during the last hours. On the bed a figure of breathing marble, flooded and bathed in the light of the full moon streaming through the oriel window; his hand clasping the Shakespeare which he had asked for but recently, and which he had kept by him to the end; the moonlight, the majestic figure as he lay there, 'drawing thicker breath', irresistibly brought to minds his own Passing of Arthur.' This extract from the authorised biography of Alfred Lord Tennyson, who died 100 years ago next week, was written by his son Hallam. 1,The style is treacly, unctuous, and the details more than a little improbable - but this was the way in which the Victorian age wanted to regard its pre-eminent poet. It is difficult for a sceptical, unpoetical age such as ours to grasp, intellectually or emotionally, the measure of Tennyson's fame, influence and wealth during his lifetime, but let one small, practical detail suffice: by the early 1860s, Tennyson was sufficiently prosperous to be able to refuse the offer of a reading tour of America which would have guaranteed him a stipend of Pounds 20,000. It had not always been so, of course. One of 12 children, he grew up in a Lincolnshire rectory and his childhood and early manhood were blighted by family illness. His father was a choleric, embittered man who had never forgiven his own father for settling the greater part of the family's inheritance upon his brother Charles, and almost every one of Alfred's eleven siblings suffered from one disabling disease or another - insanity, opium addiction, alcoholism, epilepsy or severe mental breakdown. Tennyson, a sensitive, bookish, reclusive child, suffered profoundly as a result. As the poet WH Auden once said, 'there was little about melancholia that he didn't know.' Freedom of a kind came with his arrival at Trinity, Cambridge in 1827. His contemporaries included Thackeray and Edward Fitzgerald, but it was the son of a great Whig historian, Arthur Henry Hallam, with whom he was to develop the most intense friendship of his life, cut short, tragically, by Hallam's death of a cerebral haemorrhage in 1832 at the age of 22. Hallam, muse and shade, appears and reappears in Tennyson's poetry throughout his life. Tennyson's contemporaries at university recognised immediately that they had a poet in their midst - by gait, manner and distinctive dress; he recognised his vocation from the start and stuck to it. He wrote prose of any description with great reluctance - his surviving letters are almost all short and to the point; he never wrote a preface, an essay, a review, a diary, a memoir or even a fragment of autobiography. And he published his own poems with great reluctance. The first collection, Poems, Chiefly Lyrical, appeared in 1830, and its mood is that of the emburdened soul, self-absorbed and thoroughly miserable in the concentrated way that only youthful poets can be. It is also verbally luscious - a weakness that his poetry would always tend to suffer from. For the next two decades he lived a somewhat aimless life. Carlyle beautifully captures him in 1840: 'A fine, large-featured, dim-eyed, bronze-coloured, shaggy-headed man . . . who swims, outwardly and inwardly, with great composure in an inarticulate element of tranquil chaos and tobacco smoke; great now and then when he does emerge.' It was the poems of 1842, which included such pieces as The Lady of Shalott, Ulysses and Godiva, that established him as the outstanding poet of his generation. But critics were soon to condemn him for failing to respond to the issues of the day: a the hungry 1840s, the age of Chartism and what Carlyle piquantly described as 'the Condition-of-England question'. Tennyson, deeply sensitive to criticism of every kind, listened to these critics and his later poems do indeed address many of the great public themes of the Victorian age, starting perhaps with The Princess of 1847, which tackles the burning issue of female education. In spite of his gathering fame, Tennyson suffered a prolonged physical collapse during the 1840s. His financial difficulties were eased by the gift of a Civil List pension in 1845, but it was not until 1850 that the clouds finally dispersed. This was the year of In Memoriam, a secretive marriage to Emily Sellwood which brought stability into his life, and his award of the Poet Laureateship. Thereafter, and in spite of the occasional critical lambasting - Maud was generally regarded as disgusting or 'unintelligible' (Gladstone), though in our day it has seemed more appropriate to regard it as a forerunner of Eliot's mood of urban desolation: 'And I loathe the squares and streets,/And the faces that one meets .,/and my heart is a handful of dust,' - his fame and influence were universal. He became firm friends with Queen Victoria, who informed him that, after the Bible, In Memoriam was her greatest source of comfort; his public poems  - especially the 'Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington', were the anthems of the nation; and his acceptance of the peerage in 1883 seemed to crown a lifetime of achievements, His funeral in Wstminster Abbey was a gloriously pompous occasion, though Thomas Hardy thought it a bit overdone and 'less penetrating than a plain country internment would have been.' Then, soon after his virtual apotheosis, the chilly winds of the 20th century began to blow, and he was effectively knocked off his pedestal. Auden described him as the stupidest of all English poets. Yet, in more recent times, we have come to admire aspects of his work - both late and early - that the creation of a massively imposing public man caused to be concealed for far too long: a poet, often glimpsed in the shorter lyrics, who was both introspective and self absorbed. In fact, the very anxious boy that he had once been. Two new biographies are published this month to coincide with the centenary  -one, Tennyson, a short, admirably lucid and beautifully illustrated account by Norman Page (Allison &amp; Busby Pounds 16.99, 190 pages), is an excellent introduction to the complexities of Tennyson's life and work; the other, a longer and more searching enquiry of the same title that bears comparison with Robert Bernard Martin's excellent biography of 1980, is by Michael Thorn (Little, Brown Pounds 20, 566 pages), The definitve edition of his poetry remains the Poems (3 vols., Longman), edited by Christopher Ricks.</p>

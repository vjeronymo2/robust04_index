			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> INTEGRATED TO SELL KEY FINANCIAL BUSINESSES TO BROAD INC. OF L.A.  </P> <P> Integrated Resources Inc. today agreed to sell its key businesses to a Los  Angeles financial services concern for up to $225 million, but the deal faces  opposition from state regulators.  </P> <P> The sale to Broad Inc., whose $7 billion in assets include the SunAmerica  insurance groups, is subject to price adjustments at the time of closing. The  deal would be worth $170 million if completed today.  </P> <P> The sale would cap Integrated's months of attempts to sell its core businesses  to raise money to help meet payments on about $1.75 billion in debt and avoid a  bankruptcy court filing.  </P> <P> Integrated said insurance commissioners in Iowa and Colorado had placed under  supervision two of the struggling firm's life insurance companies, Integrated  Life Insurance Co. and Capitol Life Insurance Co., included in the sale.  </P> <P> The sale is far below the $450 million Integrated had hoped to obtain several  months ago for its core financial businesses.  </P></p>

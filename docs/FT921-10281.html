			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Brazil blocks Eletrobras accounts THE Brazilian economy ministry has frozen all the accounts of Eletrobras, the state electricity company, for not honouring its foreign debts and has warned that it will do the same to any other state company which fails to make payments. The crackdown comes after repeated failure by Eletrobras to meet payments due to the World Bank and other international creditors. Eletrosul (the southern electricity company) and CHESF (the Sao Francisco hydro-electricity company) have also had their accounts blocked. Over the last year the three companies ran up Dollars 300m in arrears. Last month the Treasury paid a Dollars 45m instalment due from Eletrobras to the World Bank when the company again failed to deposit the money and economy ministry officials say the accounts will remain frozen until this is repaid. The electricity companies' failure to meet payments is an embarrassment to the Brazilian government, which is in the midst of an offensive to renegotiate its foreign debt. Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, is in Europe meeting members of the Paris Club group of official creditors to whom Brazil owes Dollars 22bn. He will present an official proposal which will then be discussed at a meeting on February 24.</p>

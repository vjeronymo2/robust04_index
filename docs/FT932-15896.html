			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Sketchley shares fall on trading warning SKETCHLEY, the cleaning and textile rental company, yesterday said trading conditions for its dry cleaning division deteriorated during the second half of its financial year. Previous market estimates for profits to the end of March, which had already been downgraded, were still too high, the company said. The shares fell 14p to 96p on the warning. Mr Tony Bloom, who joined as deputy chairman in 1991 after Sketchley came close to collapse after a period of rapid expansion, said dry cleaning sales had been poor but the company was still operating at a profit. 'The high street has not turned round in a significant fashion,' he said. Full year profits are expected to fall from Pounds 6m to about Pounds 4.5m. The company is expected to maintain its final dividend. Sketchley also announced it is paying Pounds 4.3m plus Pounds 2m goodwill for Supasnaps, the film processing chain owned by Dixons. In addition , Sketchley will repay inter-group indebtedness estimated at Pounds 1.7m. The chain operates from about 350 outlets, all of which are leased. It has about 8 per cent of the processing market, compared to market leader Boots with 23 per cent. Sketchley plans to install new Supasnaps outlets in its dry cleaning outlets as a way to boost revenues. This would also allow Supasnaps to expand cheaply. Supasnaps is expected to make operating profits of about Pounds 700,000 in the year to April 30 from Pounds 45m turnover. The company has net assets of about Pounds 2.3m. Mr Bloom said he expected the acquisition to contribute to Sketchley profits from this year. Sketchley was due to release preliminary results for the year to end-March in mid-May. Because of the acquisition, the company will probably release a profits estimate with its circular to shareholders on the Supasnaps deal, expected in the next couple of weeks.</p>

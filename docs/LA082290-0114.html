			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FORMER STATE S&amp;L CHIEF TO TAKE OVER FAILED MERCURY  </P> <P> William J. Crawford, who retired in April as state S&amp;L commissioner, will  be placed in charge of insolvent Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn. today, an  official with the federal regulators said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Kevin Shields, a spokesman for the Resolution Trust Corp.'s regional office in  Denver, said Crawford will be named managing agent of Mercury, which was seized  by federal regulators in February. The S&amp;L currently has about $2 billion  in assets.  </P> <P> The RTC is the government agency charged with liquidating the assets of  insolvent S&amp;Ls. Shields said the managing agent's job is to run the  day-to-day operations of ailing thrifts, sprucing them up as much as possible  before selling them for the best price.  </P> <P> Crawford, 70, owned and sold two different S&amp;Ls before being named to the  top state regulatory post in 1985. The Newport Beach resident, who cited his  age and a desire to travel with his wife as the reason for his resignation from  the state post, declined comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> In his 5 years as state S&amp;L commissioner, Crawford developed a reputation  as a blunt-spoken, tough regulator. His small staff identified severe abuses at  several S&amp;Ls in the state, and for a time Crawford's department was running  ahead of federal regulators as it moved against the offenders.  </P> <P> The state agency acted in advance of federal regulators in seizing North  American S&amp;L in Santa Ana -- an institution that Crawford said represented  the worst case of insider fraud in state history. Crawford also cracked down on  the defunct Ramona S&amp;L in Orange months before federal regulators filed  criminal fraud and conspiracy charges against owner John L. Molinaro and former  co-owner Donald C. Mangano. The two received stiff prison sentences earlier  this year.  </P> <P> Shields said Crawford has been training at Mercury S&amp;L since July 2. He  said Crawford originally was slated to take over insolvent Southwest Federal  Savings Assn. in Los Angeles, but those plans were changed Monday. Crawford  will replace another RTC official at Mercury.  </P> <P> Mercury Savings was founded in 1964 by a group of local investors headed by  Leonard Shane.  </P> <P> Shane, who served as Mercury's chairman from the beginning, rode the housing  boom into prominence, building Mercury into a nearly $5-billion institution in  the mid-1980s and becoming chairman of the national thrift industry trade  group, the once-powerful U.S. League of Savings.  </P> <P> For years, the S&amp;L was held up nationally as a shining example of a  well-run, conservative S&amp;L. But accounting rules allowed Mercury and other  thrifts to count as current income certain profits expected to come in from the  collection of mortgage payments for investors who bought the loans it  originated.  </P> <P> When dropping interest rates in the late 1980s enabled a large number of  borrowers to refinance and pay off those loans early, Mercury had to write off  the profits it had already booked and sustained huge losses that helped drive  it into insolvency.  </P></p>

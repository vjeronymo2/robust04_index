			<p>BFN     [Text] Albania has chosen to stir up its relations with  Athens. Despite the calm position of Athens, it [words  indistinct]. Albanian President Sali Berisha's government today  tried to worsen Greek-Albanian relations claiming that shots  were fired between Greek and Albanian soldiers at the Episkopi  guardpost near the Greek-Albanian border.    Defense Ministry sources believe the minor incident is  another Albanian provocation that aims to intensify tension in  bilateral relations. Defense Ministry officials stressed that  Greece is following the situation on the Greek-Albanian border  coolly and carefully. The groups of the 8th Corps are highly  vigilant, according to the measures that are in effect.    Tirana yesterday announced the deportation of Greek Consul  in  Gjirokaster Khristos Iakovou, forcing the Greek Government to  expel the Albanian Embassy's first secretary in Athens.    A Foreign Ministry statement stresses that the Greek  Government regrets these developments for which the Albanian  side is entirely responsible, adding that Albania is trying to  use the recent incident on its territory involving unidentified  elements to create tension on an international level. A short  time ago, the Albanian Foreign Ministry announced that it is  recalling Albanian Ambassador in Athens Hysen Cabej for  consultations.    Lieutenant Colonel Kalantzandonakis, the Armed Forces  General  Staff press spokesman, today said there is a high level of  vigilance on the Greek-Albanian border. He added that this is  not because of the recent incidents but the problem of illegal  immigrants.    Asked to comment on the escalating tension in Greek-Albanian  relations, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the  Greek Government is following, coolly and carefully, the  escalating tension in relations with Albania. Our country's  firm policy is to improve Greek-Albanian relations, Albania's  development, and its securing an economic, institutionalized,  and cultural atmosphere. The spokesman said that in a letter  from Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias to his Albanian  counterpart, the Greek Government says it wants the tension to  be reduced. Venizelos said there was no reply to the letter.    Foreign Ministry Secretary General Khristos Zakharakis will  send a letter to the United Nations replying to Albanian Foreign  Minister Alfred Serreqi's claims. Foreign Ministry Permanent  Secretary Pavlos Apostolidhis summoned the ambassadors of the UN  Security Council permanent members and briefed them. The heads  of Greek Embassies abroad will brief the governments of the  countries to which they are accredited.    Referring to the latest incident on the Greek-Albanian  border, Venizelos said the government only has press reports on  it. He noted that the Greek Government has no evidence or  information to support that a Greek group left Greek territory  to cause incidents. The spokesman concluded by saying that for  reasons of goodwill, the government suggested to the Albanian  Government that the Greek and Albanian authorities cooperate.</p>

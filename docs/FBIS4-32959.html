			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments carried on Havana  radio and television in Spanish between 23 and 29 May:    Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 23 May reports that Noel  Adrian,  general director of the Cuban-French enterprise Havana Club  Internacional, has announced in Santiago de Cuba that Havana  Club rum will be officially launched in France, Belgium,  England, and other European countries in July.    Radio Reloj at 1933 GMT on 23 May reports that the Antonio  Maceo power plant in Santiago de Cuba is resuming operations  after being off-line for two days because of weather conditions.    Radio Reloj at 1942 GMT on 23 May reports that the Mercado  S.A. tourism group, which promotes scientific tourism in Cuba,  brought more than 7,000 tourists to Cuba and grossed $2 million  during 1993.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 24 May  report that after successfully completing their six-month goal,  Ciego de Avila oil workers are determined to recover first place  in the Black Gold program. Oil workers have extracted 34,000  tons from the province's four oil deposits.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 25 May  report that members of the German Communist Party presented a  donation of $14,000 to a medical center in Cerro Municipality,  Havana City Province.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 25 May reports that the 1993-94  tobacco harvest has virtually concluded in Pinar del Rio  Province following the harvesting of 24.2 million poles of  tobacco -- 450,000 more than in the previous harvest although  121 fewer caballerias had been planted. The harvest should  result in 300,000 quintals of tobacco -- 39,000 more than last  year. The tobacco crop accrues $100 million annually for the  Cuban economy. Pinar del Rio Province is the source of 70  percent of the national tobacco crop.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 26 May reports that a Ciego de  Avila work group is close to reaching its goal in the recovery  of spare parts used in the national energy program. Each piece  of equipment that is rebuilt constitutes a savings of  approximately $1,000. This 10-man work group is also outstanding  for its efficient use of electromagnets, nuts and bolts, and  resistors and for recycling lubricants for electric devices.    The radio also reports that innovators from the Ministry of  Construction's Enterprise No. 1 in Pinar del Rio Province have  developed a cement-hardener made from molasses and other  materials available locally. This guarantees a 10 percent  savings in cement and makes the cement much easier to use. This  saves Cuba from having to buy a chemical substance on the  international market to use for that purpose.    Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 26 May reports that Interior  Ministry troops on the Isle of Youth work 107 caballerias of  land with a view to food self-sufficiency. This unit has become  self-sufficient in food used for workers cafeterias and the  building of homes. The unit has built 23 houses so far.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 26 May reports on the  development of the techno-tour exhibit at (Pavexpo) in Havana.  A restaurant company has agreed to open a restaurant called  Pizza Nova at the Hemingway Marina. The firms foresees  establishing similar restaurants throughout Cuba, which should  constitute a source of substantial income for Cuban tourism  organizations. The Czech Republic is also participating for the  first time at the fair.    Radio Reloj at 1954 GMT on 26 May reports that the factories  in the municipalities of Camajuani and Placetas that make cigars  for export and for local consumption fell behind by more than  800,000 units due to power outages, causing losses exceeding $1  million. Tobacco factories have produced 1.1 million units so  far this month. They hope to solve the problems with a generator  that was purchased abroad, which has not yet arrived.    Radio Progresso at 1100 GMT on 27 May reports that  preliminary estimates put the damages caused by the recent  intense rainfall in Guantanamo Province at over 90 million pesos.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> 3 KILLED IN SEPARATE N.Y. SUBWAY ATTACKS  </P> <P> In what authorities called the worst night of subway violence in memory,  altercations in three New York City stations left three men dead in less than  four hours. A Brooklyn man on his way home was stabbed several times in a  station there and died in a hospital within an hour. Police said he apparently  had been robbed. Later, in another Brooklyn station, two men argued on a  platform and one shot the other to death. In Manhattan, one of two would-be  robbers in a Times Square station was stabbed to death, allegedly by the  intended victim. "This was really a mind-boggling night," Al O'Leary of the  Transit Authority said.  </P></p>

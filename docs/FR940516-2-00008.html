The project area is located within portions of T.19N., R.14, 15, 16, &amp; 17E., T.20N., R.14, 15, 16, &amp; 17E., and T.21N., R.15, 16, and 17E., MDB&amp;M. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency invites comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis.

Most of the area is in the Feather River Watershed, with a small portion in the Truckee River Watershed. It is located two miles south of Sierraville, southwest to Webber Lake, east to the crest of the Bald Mountain Range, and north to approximately 4 miles south of Loyalton. The area is dominated by eastside pine stands with catastrophic insect-induced mortality resulting from several years of severe drought. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The extensive mortality and overstocked timber stands have resulted in poor forest health and an extreme fire hazard. There are opportunities to treat these stands in order to improve forest health and reduce the fire hazard, while concurrently accomplishing watershed restoration and wildlife habitat improvement goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In preparing the environmental impact statement, the Forest Service will identify and analyze a range of alternatives that address the issues developed for this area. One of the alternatives will be no treatment. Other alternatives will consider differing levels of implementation of California spotted owl standards and guidelines, salvage and sanitation treatments, group selection harvests, plantation thinning, thinnings from below, fuelbreak construction, plantation protection from fire, watershed restoration, road obliteration, wildlife habitat improvement, and new road construction and reconstruction. An ecological approach will be used to achieve multiple-use management of the Eastside area. It also means that the needs of people and environmental values will be blended in such a way that this area would represent a diverse, healthy, productive, and sustainable ecosystems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public participation will be important during the analysis, especially during the review of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. The Forest Service is seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. This input will be used in preparation of the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS). The scoping process includes: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Identifying potential issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Identifying issues to be analyzed in depth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Exploring additional alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect, and cumulative effects and connected actions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following list of issues has been identified through initial scoping: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To what extent will future options for the management of California spotted owls be maintained? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

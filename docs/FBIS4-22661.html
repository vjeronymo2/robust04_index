			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Ukrainian Government Considers </F> That Canada Has Begun an Antidumping Investigation Against the  Azovstal AT Without Any Grounds for Doing So"]    Four Canadian producers of carbon steel--Algoma Steel, Inc.,  Steelco, Inc., Ipso, Inc., and CNT Steel--have begun a "hunting  season" on the exporters of steel to Canada. Over the period of  the first eight months of last year 40 percent of the imports of  this metal to the country of the maple leaf were designated as  dumping. Toward the end of last year Ukraine was added to the  list of the other three "violators"--Spain, Italy, and Korea. On  18 October Canada's Department of National Profits instituted an  antidumping suit against the Azovstal AT [Joint-Stock Company],  which is located in Mariopol. According to this department's  data, the average price of Ukrainian steel is set at only 76.1  percent of its true value (the dumping mark ranged from 69.5 to  83.3 percent).    Despite the fact that during the period since 1991 the  states  of the EC [European Communities] and America have instituted  nine antidumping suits against Ukraine, this latest instance  cannot have the best influence on mutual relations between  Ukraine and Canada. On Ukraine's part, this case is being  handled by the intersector and interministerial commssions which  have been set up under the Ukeainian Council of Ministers. As is  known, the Ukrainian side has the intention of striving to close  this case because of the lack of direct proofs that the Azovstal  AT has engaged in any antidumping operations in the Canadia  market. It is also known that--in the case at hand--Ukraine is  allowing for the possibility of appealing to higher  international juridical institutions.    The fact of the matter is that last year Azovstal delivered  14,000 tonnes of steel (FOB at the Ukrainian port) to the German  firm of Klopner at a price between 258,000 and 259,000 U.S.  dollars. The Germans re-exported 7,800 tonnes of this amount to  Canada. It was specifically the steel re-exported by Klopner  that became the occasion for the antidumping investigation. But  according to the contract between Azovstal and Klopner, the  former bears no responsibility for any further profits made on  the steel sold to the German firm. Moreover, officials in Kiev  have asserted that the export price of this steel from the  Mariopol AT corresponds to the upper limit indicated (260 U.S  dollars), as well as to the average level of world prices.    In elucidating the pluses and minuses for Ukraine in this  case, far from the last-place role will be played by yet another  global factor. In the case at hand, according to all  international standards, the responsibility for the actions of  the accused Azovstal AT shall be borne by the state as a whole,  inasmuch as--at present--the Ukrainian economy has the status of  a nonmarket economy. Proceeding on the grounds that Ukraine did  not give Canada sufficient information about its exporters, the  Canadian side was compelled to apply with regard to Ukraine the  same conditions under which Belgium, Denmark, Spain, and Great  Britain operate in Canada. And Great Britain was designated as  the analogous country (it has been asserted that--on this  occasion--even the Canadians felt sorry for Ukraine); and, as a  result of this, the benchmark price was set at 500 U.S. dollars  per tonne.    It is interesting that almost immediately after this  conflict-type situation arose, the Ukrainian office of the  Canadian firm Smith, Lyons, Torrance, Stevenson, and Mayer  offered to defend the Ukrainian interests in this case. In the  words of Mark Kovalskyy, a lawyer from this firm, the offer  would have legal force only on condition that the Ukrainian  government make an official request with regard to a defense of  its rights. At the same time Klopner would have to provide its  own lega defense in cooperation with Azovstal. However, a  contractual agreement had been signed with the Trakon law firm  at the very end of last year--that is, after the case had  already been instituted. And, therefore, Trakon has remained on  the sidelines of this investigation. Thus Azovstal could take a  retroactive court action against Klopner in connection with the  nonperformance on that article in the contract which concerns a  legal defense.    The recent visit by a Ukrainian delegation to Canada did not  produce the anticipated results. Official Kiev intends to place  the examination of this case before the Canadian Trade Tribunal  because it considers that it would be significantly better to  defend its own interests there. At least its chances would look  more realistic with the absence of tricks by Canadian industry.  According to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),  dumping is not subject to condemnation, provided that it does  not cause harm to the enconomy of that country in which the  goods are sold. And the percentage of Ukrainian steel within the  total amount of this metal on the Canadian market is less than 1  percent. The Canadian side, in turn, does not dispute this  point, but instead bases its argument on the position  that--after an analysis had been conducted--it was discovered  that 100 percent of the total amount of the Ukrainian steel had  been sold on the Ukrainian market at dumping prices.    Yet another possible relief for Ukraine (even prior to  appealing the case) could be the negotiations which are now  going on between Klopner and Algoma Steel with regard to the  delivery of Azovstal's steel ingots. By the way, it is an  interesting situation. The guilty party in these  Ukrainian-Canadia misunderstandings--the German firm of  Klopner--has, for some reason retreated to the background, and  for some reason nobody is saying much about its role in this  matter.    ...If the Ukrainian government believes that it will prevail  in the above-mentioned Trade Tribunal, knows that the law is on  its side, and that such accusations are without any grounds, it  must make sure that--after this case-- nobody will treat us like  a little boy to be beaten--one who can be infringed against and  who will then only whine and whimper.</p>

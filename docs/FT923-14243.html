			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: 'Green' pledges fail to please ENVIRONMENTALISTS yesterday accused G7 leaders of failing to keep their promises, Reuter reports. The final summit communique said last month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro had heightened awareness of global environmental problems. 'Rapid and concrete action is required to follow through on our commitments on climate change, to protect forests and oceans, to preserve marine resources and to maintain bio-diversity.' It listed nine action points which were almost identical to a proposal agreed by EC leaders in Lisbon last month. Environmentalist groups were not impressed. 'The G7 leaders reveal an inability or unwillingness to think through the environmental implications of the major issues that occupied them,' said Mr Scott Hajost, of the US Environmental Defence Fund. Mr Andrew Dilworth, of Britain's Friends of the Earth, said the leaders were like actors who had dried up and could only repeat the same old lines. 'After the Earth Summit, the G7 should be setting an example by announcing detailed plans to reduce their emissions of the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.' Mr John Major, UK prime minister, was heckled at a news conference by a man shouting that the summit was nothing but empty words and 'something must be done' to save the forests. In their statement, the G7 also: Reaffirmed their commitment to supporting reforms in eastern Europe. They backed reallocation of a Dollars 1bn fund for Polish foreign currency stabilisation, which has not been drawn upon, to strengthen companies' competitiveness. Accepted Japan's invitation to a summit in Tokyo next July.</p>

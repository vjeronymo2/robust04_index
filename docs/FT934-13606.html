			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Checks on Bank governor urged CHANGES would have to be made to the top management structure of the Bank of England if it gained more autonomy to ensure that its governor did not have too much power over interest rate changes, a former senior bank official said yesterday, Peter Norman writes. Sir George Blunden, the deputy governor of the Bank between 1986 and 1990, told the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee that, if the Bank were given more autonomy over interest rates, there would be a narrower range of advice ahead of decisions to change monetary policy. The governor of a more autonomous Bank would also have more power than his counterparts in the US or Germany so that an extra check would have to be introduced to limit the Governor's power. Sir George's testimony against greater independence for the Bank clearly surprised the all-party committee of MPs.</p>

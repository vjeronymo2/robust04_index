			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We already reported in our previous newscasts today  that the situation on our borders has remained relatively calm  since yesterday noon. The Armenian Defense Ministry press  service just reported that the relative calm was still  prevailing at 1600.    The relative calm established over the last few days is  still  being maintained on most of the Karabakh war fronts. However,  Karabakh's positions are still coming under fire in a number of  sectors. But no casualties are being reported. Thus, Karabakh  forces' positions north of Martuninskiy came under shelling from  various guns this morning. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  Defense Army headquarters said that there was no retaliatory  fire. A concentration of Azerbaijani troops and equipment is  being observed along most of the war front, in particular on the  eastern and southeastern sectors.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Drop in car sales slows WEST European new car sales have posted their smallest monthly decline this year, slipping only 1.5 per cent in August to an estimated 1.03m. However, the European new car market is distorted in August by the UK, where 20 to 25 per cent of annual new car registrations take place in the period. The UK is also the only market in west Europe where sales have been growing this year, albeit from a depressed level. UK new car sales in the month were 17.8 per cent higher than a year ago at 440,000, and accounted for 43 per cent of the west European market. Excluding the UK, new car sales in west Europe were still 12.2 per cent lower than a year ago. The rate of decline moderated in some markets, notably in Germany and Spain, while sales were higher in the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Austria. New car sales in August were lower than a year ago in 12 of 17 markets across west Europe, while in the first eight months sales were lower than a year ago in 16 of 17 markets, with only the UK achieving any growth with an increase of 11.8 per cent. Overall, in the first eight months sales fell by 15.9 per cent to 8.03m from 9.55m in the corresponding period a year ago, according to industry estimates. August sales in Germany fell year-on-year by 10.3 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                            January-August 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Volume      Volume      Share (%)   Share (%)                          (Units)     Change (%)  Jan-Aug 93  Jan-Aug 92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET            8,035,000     -15.9        100.0        100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen* (incl       1,303,000     -21.3         16.2         17.3 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) General Motors          1,041,000     -11.5         13.0         12.3 (Opel/Vauxhall, US**** &amp; Saab)  -Opel/Vauxhall         1,004,000     -10.7         12.5         11.8  -Saab**                   27,000     -27.6          0.3          0.4 PSA Peugeot               975,000     -15.3         12.1         12.1 Citroen Renault-Volvo *****       964,000     -16.1         12.0        12.0  -Renault                 847,000     -15.5         10.5        10.5  -Volvo                   117,000     -20.4          1.5         1.5 Ford (Europe,             952,000     -15.1         11.8        11.7 US**** &amp; Jaguar)  -Ford Europe             943,000     -15.2         11.7        11.6  -Jaguar                    8,000      +0.1          0.1         0.1 Fiat (incl Lancia,        893,000     -22.3         11.1        12.0 Alfa Romeo, Ferrari Innocenti, Maserati) Nissan                    286,000      -7.6          3.6         3.2 BMW                       262,000     -17.3          3.3         3.3 Rover***                  250,000     +12.8          3.1         2.3 Toyota                    226,000      -1.0          2.8         2.4 Mercedes-Benz             226,000     -23.2          2.8         3.1 Mazda                     143,000     -26.9          1.8         2.0 Honda***                  113,000     -12.4          1.4         1.3 Mitsubishi                102,000     -12.0          1.3         1.2 Total Japanese          1,002,000     -11.2         12.5        11.8 MARKETS: Germany                 2,223,000     -19.8         27.7        29.0 Italy                   1,317,000     -23.1         16.4        17.9 United Kingdom          1,315,000     +11.8         16.4        12.3 France                  1,131,000     -17.3         14.1        14.3 Spain                     515,000     -26.0          6.4         7.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ****  Cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. *     VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. **    GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. ***   Honda holds a 20 per cent stake in Rover vehicle operations. ***** Renault and Volvo to merge in January 1994.

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Gore to rescue of ethanol policy Vice President Al Gore has been forced to rescue a key administration environmental policy advocating the use of grain alcohol as a cleaner burning petrol additive. Mr Gore cast his tie-breaking vote in the Senate on Wednesday to defeat a bill that would have stopped the US Environmental Protection Agency requiring that one-third of petrol sold in big cities contain ethanol - a grain alcohol - or other renewable additives. The bill produced a tumultuous five-hour debate between farm-state senators, backed by the agricultural lobby, and senators from oil-producing states and the north-east, supported by the oil industry. President Bill Clinton personally lobbied members to defeat the bill, but in the end the Senate deadlocked 50-50, requiring Mr Gore's rare action. Mr J. Bennet Johnston, the Louisiana Democrat who proposed the bill, claimed ethanol was not efficient and the EPA policy amounted to a hand-out to the corn industry and 'gigantic flim-flam to the American people'. Mr Bob Kerry, a Nebraska Democrat, responded that requiring ethanol additives would 'create American jobs' and boost the economy. The debate over ethanol has been raging for years as the EPA sought to determine which oxygenates - oxygen-bearing additives that burn cleaner - should be used in petrol to improve air quality in big cities. Two of the most common oxygenates are ethanol, produced from corn, and methanol, a wood alcohol most commonly extracted from natural gas. Mr Clinton, siding with the farm lobby, said during his election campaign that he favoured the use of ethanol and the EPA's ruling in June sought to make good on Mr Clinton's promise. EPA officials have been forced to admit ethanol may not reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term, because producing ethanol from corn requires large amounts of energy and releases greenhouse gases.</p>

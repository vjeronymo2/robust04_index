			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UAE clampdown clears shops of pirate videos Shops in the United Arab Emirates pulled pirated videos and cassettes off the shelves to abide by the UAE's first copyright law which took effect yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai. Merchants selling fake cassette tapes, videos and software had until yesterday to abide by the law which says they must sell or rent only copyrighted products. Goods which do not have proper copyright certificates must be destroyed. 'From the first (of the month) onwards we can send out inspectors to look for these kinds of irregularities. . . for copyright violations,' a Dubai Department of Economy official said. Penalties include confiscation of goods, jail terms and fines of up to 10,000 dirhams (Dollars 2,700). One Ministry of Information official said inspectors had been sent out to check that shops were not selling pirated goods but he did not say how many were visited. The UAE in March became a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has provisions to prevent the sale and trade of counterfeit goods. It has also came under pressure from its western trading partners to protect trademarks and patents. The US estimates lost revenue of Dollars 156m a year in the UAE due to copyright violations. One video shop worker, Ali Haider, said ministry inspectors visited the shop with a warning when the law was promulgated in March. Shops were given a grace period until Thursday. 'Unfortunately we removed all the English films from the racks and are selling only Hindi films,' he said, adding they were stored in a back room but they might be re-exported. One worker at a major supermarket in Abu Dhabi said the store re-exported more than 100,000 tapes for which it did not own copyrights. He said they were currently displaying only seven original titles but more were expected next week. 'This is the last day you can buy the fake ones. . . at 15 dirhams (Dollars 4). The originals are 50 dirhams (Dollars 14),' he said. At another branch of the same supermarket a supervisor said officials cleared the shop of 50,000 dirhams worth of videos on Wednesday in preparation for the new law. It is intended to prevent unauthorised reproduction of works of literature, art, films, video and audio tapes and software. Juma Nabooda, Dubai's Chamber of Commerce president, said in a statement on Wednesday that the UAE would start implementing Gatt articles yesterday to coincide with the copyright law.</p>

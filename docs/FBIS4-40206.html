			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Yemelyanov report in the "Visit" column: </F> "Zhirinovskiy in Volgograd. The LDPR Leader Moved in a Fast  Track"]    [Text] On Sunday Vladimir Zhirinovskiy arrived in  Volgograd from Krasnodar and, after rushing along in an armored  Zil limousine under the protection of several police Opel cars,  plunged into the friendly atmosphere of a banquet at the  Oktyabrskaya hotel, where from 2200 to midnight he discussed how  to set things going in Russia with the governor and the chief of  the internal affairs administration. An official meeting next  morning was held behind closed doors. The participants declined  any comment. After taking a tour around the city and laying  wreaths at several historical sites, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  proceeded to the central part of his visit: meeting with the  Volgograd electorate.    Some 5,000 to 6,000 people turned up to marvel at the  principal Liberal Democrat. Judging by their mood, many were  disappointed after a two-hour mono-rally: There was none of the  former criticism of present state rulers, with the main critical  focus shifted to heads of ethnic provinces.    The LDPR leader's presentation on oblast TV proved to be  richer in concept. On a highly topical issue Vladimir  Zhirinovsky announced that Russian peacekeeping forces should  not be introduced into Abkhazia and Karabakh but withdrawn from  there as a matter of urgency and that weapons should be sold to  those countries, "leaving them to straighten things out among  themselves."    The next meeting with voters heard statements that it was  only thanks to unflagging activity by the LDPR faction in the  State Duma that six unamenable ministers had left the government  and that it was only Zhirinovskiy's trip to Serbia that had  helped Yeltsin and Kozyrev correctly to assess the situation and  prompted the West to take a more cautious line with respect to  former Yugoslavia. The LDPR leader spoke in sharp terms about  the State Duma speaker, the president of Kazakhstan, and the  communist leaders, and then jumped into the black Zil and rushed  off.    Before his departure he expressed his confidence that not 25  percent but 50 percent of the Volgograd electorate will vote for  him in the upcoming elections.</p>

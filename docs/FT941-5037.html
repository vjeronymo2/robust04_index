			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (10): Better ride for the 'little guy' - Reasons for the collapse of the Bell Atlantic-TCI merger The unexpected collapse of the planned merger of Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications, two of the largest and most aggressive companies in the US telephone and cable TV industries, has poured cold water on the frenzy of industry excitement surrounding the development of 'information superhighways'. The merger, announced last October and initially valued at between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 30bn, had been touted as forming the 'model communications company for the information age'. Bell Atlantic, one of the most innovative of the US regional telephone companies, planned to acquire TCI, the largest US cable television company serving about 20 per cent of US homes. Bell Atlantic had planned to establish interactive cable television services within its region of operations, while adding telephony services to TCI's cable operations in other parts of the country. The result would eventually have been a massive interactive multi-media communications network spanning more than 40 states. By calling off their merger, Bell Atlantic and TCI have at least postponed the emergence of the first multi-media communications company with national reach. What is not yet clear, however, is how much influence the 'regulatory and market uncertainties' which Bell Atlantic and TCI say forced them to abandon their plans, will have on deployment of the much-touted 'information superhighways'. On the regulatory side, both Bell Atlantic and TCI blamed the Federal Communications Commission's recent decision to mandate a 7 per cent reduction in cable television service prices for the collapse of their deal. TCI strongly criticised the FCC's action as 'unwarranted, excessively severe, and harmful both to the national telecommunications objectives promoted by the Clinton administration and, ultimately, to the interests of consumers'. The price rollback will reduce TCI's cash flow by about Dollars 144m annually, said John Malone, TCI president. This significantly reduced the valuation put on the cable TV company in the merger talks, which had been calculated as a multiple of cash flow, he explained. 'The FCC does not seem to appreciate the impact that its action will have on the ability of the cable industry to raise capital,' Mr Malone charged. The industry will be hampered in its ability to upgrading networks to carry interactive multimedia signals, he said. 'I hope that the FCC will come back with some very strong inducements for upgrades and expansions.' Analysts noted, however, that the FCC's action will effectively reduce the price that cable companies command, encouraging acquisitions of the numerous smaller companies in the cable TV business. For the many towns and cities throughout the US served by these smaller cable companies, this could hasten rather than retard the arrival of interactive multimedia services. Moreover, the FCC cannot be given all the blame for the wreckage of the Bell-TCI plans. It appears that the companies faced a series of difficulties in consumating their merger. While TCI's value may have been diminished by the FCC action, Bell Atlantic's share price had already been driven down over the past four months, by Wall Street's nervous reaction to the deal. This significantly reduced the value of the shares that Bell was offering for TCI, putting the deal in jeopardy. Wall Street's concerns about the huge investments required to create information superhighways and the potential returns on those investments, together with uncertainties about the regulatory environment, have also driven down the share prices of other US telephone companies. US West, for example, has seen its share price decline by almost 20 per cent since mid-October, while BellSouth, another big investor in 'information superhighways' has fallen 10 per cent. Nonetheless, the lure of huge new markets for network traffic and services together with the unrelenting pace of technology development are driving rapid changes in the US communications industry. Other US telephone and cable television companies have vowed to push ahead with their plans to build interactive multi-media networks. US West, which last year acquired a 23 per cent stake in Time Warner's cable business for Dollars 2.5bn, said that it still plans to invest Dollars 1bn to convert Time Warner cable systems into advanced communications networks. The companies are about to begin a field trial offering about 4,000 homes in Orlando, Florida, video-on-demand services. Cox Cable, which has teamed up with Southwestern Bell in a Dollars 4.9bn venture to build advanced networks, will also continue to push forward, the company said. 'The decision of regulators or corporations may change the participants, but not the deployment of superhighway technology or the timing very much,' said a spokesman for BellSouth, which is involved in a joint venture with Prime Cable Management to upgrade cable systems in Las Vegas. The telephone company, 'remains committed to becoming a key participant'. Ameritech is spending Dollars 4.4bn to convert its telephone network to carry video services over the next 15 years. 'We intend to stay the course we have set,' said Richard Notebaert, Ameritech president. 'Customers, not the industry or other forces, will set the pace for development of interactive programming.' Even Bell Atlantic is determined to press on, in spite of the merger collapse. The company will seek mergers or alliances with other companies. 'This would have been the alliance on a grand scale,' said James Cullen, Bell Atlantic president. 'We're going to have to look for opportunities on a smaller scale.' Bell Atlantic still expects to have a broadband, fibre-optic network in place to reach more than 1m homes by the end of 1995, and 8.75m homes by 2000. Initially, the network is expected to carry basic cable services and video-on-demand. Later, other services such as home shopping, home banking, remote education and video games may be added. Some even see the collapse of the Bell Atlantic-TCI deal as a positive development because it might have deterred competition in the emerging market for advanced multi-media communications. 'The end of this merger is not the end of the information superhighway, but the beginning of a superhighway we can all afford to ride,' said Senator Howard Metzenbaum, who had opposed the merger. 'Without these giants hogging the road, the little guy is less likely to get squeezed.'</p>

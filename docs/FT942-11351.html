			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Hata tries to defuserow over Nanking gaffe China and South Korea yesterday reacted angrily to claims by Mr Shigeto Nagano, the new justice minister, that one of Japan's worst wartime atrocities was a 'hoax.' In an effort to defuse the row, Japan's prime minister Tsutomu Hata, condemned Mr Nagano's claim that the 1937 massacre of Nanking was a fiction as 'not appropriate.' Mr Nagano is expected to issue a public apology today, according to reports in the Japanese press. Mr Hata said Japan's wartime actions 'including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people; thus it is essential ..to face the history squarely and share the determination not to repeat them.' China, Japan's second largest trade partner after the US, was 'shocked and indignant,' said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman. He urged the Tokyo government earnestly and seriously to treat the issue with a view to safeguarding bilateral relations,' an implied demand for Mr Nagano's dismissal. Japan last year stepped up a gradual campaign to improve relations with Asian neighbours when former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa issued a series of apologies, admitting that the war was aggressive and wrong. Officially, the new government wishes to continue that process, though a right-wing minority supports Mr Nagano's stance, as reported in the Mainichi newspaper. Mr Nagano's gaffe has far more impact today than it might have had a few years ago and damages Japan's current attempts at a reconciliation with former colonies at a time when Tokyo is seeking to increase trade and investment with them. It also provides ammunition for the minority government's numerous opponents, only a week after the Hata administration took office. According to a post-war tribunal, Japanese troops killed 155,000 people in the six weeks after taking Nanking, though Chinese accounts put the figure at 300,000. Mr Hata, on a European tour until the weekend, said he would ask Mr Nagano what he meant by his remarks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["In Broad Daylight" column by Rajih al-Khuri: "The </F> Massacre"]    [Text] Israel has brought together the necessary elements  and created the right possibilities for the "Palestinian  massacre."    It is not possible to explain in any other way the order the  Israeli Army received to prepare for speedy withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho.    Despite the progress the negotiations are making between the  Palestinian and Israeli committees, even if on the "basis of  crumbs" which constitutes a prominent element in the strategy of  Israeli negotiation, the rush to evacuate Gaza and Jericho  before the set date of 13 April is nothing less than a time-bomb  the Israelis are planting under the feet of the PLO and Hamas.    Before discussing the reasons behind this upcoming massacre,  we need to recall the many Israeli voices that during the past  two years have not stopped demanding that the ball of fire be  thrown in the lap of the Palestinians and the occasional  official calls for evacuating the terrorist mire in reference to  the Gaza Strip, where the stone revolution has not abated.    This was before reaching the autonomy agreement on 13 April  1993, and before the agreement and the detailed talks it  stipulates between the two sides reached the point of no return,  as Shim'on Peres says.    And now, there is no escape from moving forward, even if the  road is a field of knives, at least for Yasir 'Arafat who cannot  go backwards even though he is shaking politically every time he  makes progress.    He is a prisoner of this iron wager that is imposed by the  talks. It has led not only to denuding him of all the slogans,  papers, and maneuvers, but also of his own skin, not to mention  his head.    What does he have in hand other than the "autonomy"  agreement  which can barely be seen with the naked eye, especially since  the area of Gaza and Jericho that will come under the autonomy  is no bigger than the Fatah-land 'Arafat reigned over in  Lebanon, and especially since his authority in that area, which  constitutes an amplified form of the Ansar detention camp, is no  more than the authority of a taxi driver from Sabra during the  days of "the Palestinian mandate" over Sabra camp.    It is autonomy on paper only. In practice, a reading of the  agreement's articles regarding the crossings for example, is  enough for a person entering Gaza and Jericho to realize that  the Hebrew stamps have been imprinted not only on his passport,  but on his forehead, and perhaps even his brain.    Therefore, what can 'Arafat offer the Hamas people, the  rejectionists, the extremists, and those calling for jihad?  What can he tell them? What can he promise them for the  future, when he has nothing but this present? How will he keep  the peace, with whom, and on what basis?    It is clear that it is too early for Rabin's government to  call on 'Arafat to bear his responsibilities in combating  terrorism as soon as possible. The day before yesterday,  Israeli radio said that "Palestinian policemen" should be  deployed in the Gaza Strip as a vanguard force at the end of  this week.    We need to remember that pistols have taken the place of  batons in the hands of the autonomy police as the result of a  strong request from Shim'on Peres, since clubs are not enough to  confront the Islamic resistance movement.    While the PLO is paying attention to training and preparing  its policemen, Israel was setting the bloody stage with great  care. Yasir 'Arafat himself a few days ago protested "that a  terrible trade in arms is taking place under the supervision of  Israeli forces in Gaza and Jericho. I believe that this has  been seriously planned. They know that these weapons will not  be used against them after they withdraw. So, who will they be  used against? It is a very dangerous game if they are planning  to create a new Afghanistan among the Palestinians."    The issue does not need 'Arafat's testimony, nor does it  need  the publicly declared fears that were expressed by Abu-'Ali  Shahin, the official responsible for the Gaza Strip, who said  that the pro-Likud Shin Bet is drowning the people with weapons  and plotting to start a civil war among the Palestinians.    The issue does not need all these testimonies. It needs sane  and careful thinking, not because the Palestinians do not have  anything but this single chance to prove their competence, even  within the framework of the autonomy and under the Israeli  microscope, but because the Palestinian massacre will return  Gaza and Jericho to Israeli rule upon a request from the  Palestinians themselves. At this point, there are many lessons  the residents of Gaza and Jericho need to learn.    They need to learn first for their own sakes, and maybe for  the sake of others. This is because negotiations on the Syrian  and Lebanese tracks could turn a full and empty circle waiting  for what will happen to the Palestinians.    If things continue this way, the "full partner" in the peace  process will naturally be the good successor of President Bill  Clinton.    And may God help everyone.</p>

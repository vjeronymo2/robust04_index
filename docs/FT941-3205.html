			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Local councils to demand more parishes The government will today be urged to create more parishes as part of its review of local government. The National Association of Local Councils, which represents community, parish and town councils, says that about 13m people in rural England effectively have a 'three-tier' local government system of counties, districts and parishes. Parish and equivalent councils are served by 75,000 councillors. Merging counties and districts would mean that in 'unparished' areas (without a parish, town or community council) local government would become more distant, they say. Residents would have only one tier to complain to if they faced problems. Parish councils celebrate their centenary this year, and will attempt to use the anniversary, coupled with the review, to raise the profile of their tier of government. Several counties, including Oxfordshire and Surrey, are also exploring ways of devolving power to local councils, thereby doing away with the district-level tier. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has urged that local government reform work on the 'subsidiarity' principle, whereby all powers are devolved to the lowest practical level. However, the legislation that started the review does not allow transfers of functions and responsibilities between the tiers. Mr Martin Harvey, the NALC's deputy secretary, said that if subsidiarity was to be implemented properly, counties or districts should make agency agreements with parishes to deliver specific services  - such as local libraries  - which are currently a county responsibility. He also said that subsidiarity would require separate entries for parish councils in government grants. At present, parishes gain all their funding from the grant paid to district councils, which are then expected to hand funds on parishes. At present, the association claims, local councillors do not draw expenses for work inside parishes or communities, and many council clerks work part-time. According to its estimates, parishes now only account for 0.3 per cent of total local government spending.</p>

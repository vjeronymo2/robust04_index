			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Shadow cabinet braced for a radical shake-up Mr Tony Blair's dramatic conference promise to deliver rapid change has fuelled hopes among supporters that he is planning a wide-ranging shadow cabinet shake-up. Mr Blair is believed to be unhappy with the composition of the shadow cabinet - elected by Labour MPs at the start of each parliamentary year - and is said to be keen to keep up the momentum of change. He has made no changes since succeeding John Smith as party leader in July and is said to regard the elections as an opportunity to speed up the pace of party modernisation. Friends point out that he has already moved to replace Mr Larry Whitty, the traditionalist general secretary, who will take up a new job as European co-ordinator later this year. Nominations for the job closed on Tuesday. Mr Tom Sawyer, a close union ally of Mr Blair, is regarded as certain to be appointed. Mr Blair's freedom to reshape the shadow cabinet will depend on the election results, to be announced later this month. Mr Blair and Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, will sit on the shadow cabinet as of right, creating two election vacancies. Some members, notably Mr Derek Foster, the chief whip, believe that they have secured sufficient nominations to be certain of survival. Senior shadow ministers say that several members are at risk, however, opening the way for fresh These include Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, and Mr Tom Clarke, shadow overseas development minister, who are thought to have made insufficient impact. Some MPs say that the two men are threatened by the breakdown of an informal electoral pact between Scottish and north-eastern MPs which has previously increased the prospects of candidates from those regions. Mr Blair is expected to demote Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, who is regarded as uninspiring. He is thought likely to promote Mr Chris Smith, the environment spokesman, and Ms Marjorie Mowlam, a close ally who failed this week to achieve election to the ruling national executive committee. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, is regarded as a strong candidate to replace Mr Cunningham and Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, is tipped to replace Mr Prescott at employment. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the former deputy leader, is certain to be elected and will be offered a senior role such as the home office, employment or trade and industry. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary, is expected to do well after performing more strongly this year. Ms Harman lost her place last year after failing to dent Mr Michael Portillo, the then chief secretary to the Treasury. Several newcomers are also expected to do well, including Ms Hilary Armstrong, who was Mr Smith's parliamentary private secretary. MPs said that Mr Kevin McNamara, a co-opted member who serves as shadow Northern Ireland secretary, was likely to survive, in spite of speculation that he would lose his job, after backing Mr Blair's shift away from Labour's commitment to campaigning for a united Ireland. Others regarded as good outside bets include Mr Brian Wilson, a junior transport spokesman, and Mr Alastair Darling, the City spokesman. Ms Joyce Quin, who speaks on European affairs, may also win substantial support.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Chiefs, Indians and Rabuka go to polls in Fiji: Bullets or ballots, this time Fiji's military ruler wants to take power in an election MAJOR General Sitiveni Rabuka has taken power in Fiji twice since 1987, each time at the point of a gun. This week, he hopes to take power again, through the more unpredictable mechanism of the ballot box. Almost exactly five years after Mr Rabuka's first armed intervention, Fijians are voting in a general election organised by an interim civilian government. The election will almost certainly return the ethnic Fijian Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party, led by Mr Rabuka, as the largest parliamentary group. But it seems unlikely to resolve the underlying tensions among Fiji's 345,000 ethnic Fijians, 340,000 Indians and 35,000 Europeans, Chinese, Polynesians and other races. The army took power in May 1987 in the name of ethnic Fijian nationalism, claiming that a coalition government dominated by Indians was making Fijians second-class citizens in their own country. It was a message which made Mr Rabuka a hero to many ethnic Fijians, especially when the army intervened a second time to torpedo a compromise agreement which would have given the coalition a continued role in government. But by focusing on a single cause of tension, the nationalist rhetoric obscured the underlying reasons for the coup, which had at least as much to do with regional and class conflicts as with race. The election of the coalition gave Indians a leading role in Fijian government for the first time since their forebears arrived to work on sugar plantations during British colonial rule. But the coalition also contained a number of ethnic Fijians representing the trade-union based Fiji Labour party, which wanted to reduce the influence of the chiefs, the traditional leaders of ethnic Fijian society. Furthermore, many of the Labour MPs came from the west of Viti Levu, Fiji's main island, which has long resented the influence of the eastern-based chiefly establishment. The constitution drawn up by the interim government seeks to entrench ethnic Fijian political domination by reserving 37 of the 70 seats in the lower house of parliament. Indians have been allocated 27 seats, and other races five; one is reserved for the Polynesian island of Rotuma. In addition, the prime minister must be an ethnic Fijian, and veto power on many issues has been given to a senate composed entirely of ethnic Fijians selected by the Great Council of Chiefs, a traditional advisory body. The constitution also seeks to entrench village values by over-representing rural ethnic Fijians at the expense of urban voters who are more likely to oppose chiefly influence. In effect, the system is a compromise between Mr Rabuka and Fiji's elder statesmen, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, the former governor-general who is now president, and Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the interim prime minister. Both chiefs are believed to have argued for a less confrontational approach to the Indian community, while supporting the objective of buttressing chiefly influence. However, the voting system means the SVT can only govern alone if it wins almost all the ethnic Fijian seats. That is unlikely to happen, mainly because of growing support for the more extreme Fijian Nationalist United Front (FNUF), which has called for the expulsion of Indians. The SVT could also lose some seats to the multiracial All National Congress, which would probably line up with Indian opponents of the constitution. The arithmetic is complicated by the Labour party's promise that its MPs will boycott parliament, which would lower the threshold for a working majority. But the most likely outcome is a hung parliament in which the FNUF holds the balance of power. If that happens, Ratu Sir Penaia will almost certainly have to appoint Mr Rabuka head of an SVT/FNUF coalition government, which would be a frightening prospect for many Indians. Indian business leaders say such an outcome could lead to a further wave of emigration as better-off Indians follow the example of the 23,000 largely professional workers who left after the coups of 1987. However, most Indians appear willing to stay provided there is no repetition of the inter-racial violence which followed the first coup in 1987. Many have extensive business interests which they would be reluctant to abandon. In the longer term, both ethnic Fijians and Indians say the country has a bright future if it can achieve stable government and maintain the strong growth in tourism and manufacturing it has enjoyed under the interim government. On present trends, that is likely to happen in the early years of the next century. Meanwhile, voters must wait until Sunday to learn the result of the week-long election, which is taking place on more than 300 islands scattered over more than 700,000 square kilometres of the South Pacific. This time, Mr Rabuka must wait too.</p>

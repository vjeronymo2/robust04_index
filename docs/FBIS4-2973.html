			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "China Firm on Its Own Agenda"] </F>   [Text] Those who believe Hong Kong to be the centre of the  universe will still be cheering the British Parliament's Foreign  Affairs Committee (FAC) report long after others have forgotten  it.    The down-to-earth majority will merely find confirmation  that  a handful of people in London, as in Hong Kong, remain mired in  Tiananmen, long after the world and events have moved on.    Or are they using Tiananmen to inflate their own egos and  one  of several justifications for unstinting support of Governor  Chris Patten's brand of political reforms for Hong Kong.    They also seem to be doing it in a most provocative fashion:  urging self-determination for Tibet, strengthening diplomatic  ties with Taiwan, calling for amendment to the Basic Law, as  well as the internationalisation of Hong Kong.    It is unlikely that China will be provoked. Having decided  to go its own way with the British abandonment of "convergence"  and the "through train", Beijing will be inclined to ignore this  toothless tiger and carry out its own plans for Hong Kong in  1997.    The non-reaction cannot be unexpected to members of the FAC.  Nor indeed, the British government. Sir Percy Cradock told  them as much.    To quote the sinologist and architect on the British side of  the Joint Declaration: "We have no legal obligation to put  forward the Patten reforms... we have a moral and a political  responsibility to push democracy as far as we can in Hong Kong  in special circumstances.    "But that certainly does not cover pushing democracy to the  point where the Chinese carry out a vicious backlash and undo  much of what you have done before... It is of little benefit  and of great damage to set up disputed arrangements which are  merely going to be torn down in 1997 when the Chinese take over."    As sure as the sun rises that will now come to pass. And  Beijing will do it without further discussion.    China's ambassador Mr Ma Yuzhen put it even more succinctly  to the FAC: "You may be aware of a prevalent view expressed by  some senior British officials that they do not believe China  will re- establish Hong Kong's three-tier councils for fear of  international pressure.    "May I say they are grossly mistaken if they really think  so.  In the absence of an agreement between China and Britain, China  will definitely disband and re-establish Hong Kong's three-tier  councils on 1 July 1997.    "As a matter of course, China will re-establish Hong Kong's  three-tier councils in accordance with the provisions of the  Basic Law. To say otherwise... is irresponsible and misleading  to the British public and the people of Hong Kong."    Sir Percy thinks Hong Kong people will pay a price for this.  The down-to-earth will find little solace in agreeing with him.</p>

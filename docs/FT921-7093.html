			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Terrorism law THE CASE for Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act, debated by the Commons yesterday, has always been difficult to make. It needs to be made with more conviction if the act is to remain. Without question, the act seriously curtails civil liberties. It gives the police the power to carry out security checks on people entering or leaving the UK; to exclude suspected terrorists from the UK, Northern Ireland or Great Britain without charge; and to detain them for 48 hours without charge, with the possibility of another five days' detention with the authority of the Home Secretary. These are significant departures from the rules on the arrest and detention of ordinary criminal suspects. Terrorism is not to be fought with kid gloves, but the suspension of fundamental human rights needs to be justified by measurable results. Yet the number charged with a terrorist offence after detention under the act has fallen from 26 in 1981 to just four last year. The number detained under the act has also declined sharply in recent years, but the proportion of detainees neither excluded nor charged has remained at about 80 per cent. The government repeatedly seeks to make political capital out of the Labour party's commitment to repeal the PTA. Yet when the act - first introduced by a Labour government - was made permanent in 1989, ministers stated that the necessity for it would be monitored regularly. The last thoroughgoing independent review was conducted in 1987. If the government wins the election, it will be time for a further such review. Without one, the suspicion can only grow that its continuance has more to do with party politics than with fighting terrorism.</p>

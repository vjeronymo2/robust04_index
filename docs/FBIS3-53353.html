			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Jawad 'Ali] </F>   [Text] The People's Assembly Committee entrusted with  preparing the response to the government's policy statement  continued its meetings yesterday under the chairmanship of  deputy speaker Ahmad Hammadi. Most of the members launched a  strong attack against the government, accusing it of failure in  its domestic policies to serve the citizens and alleviate the  burdens they shoulder as a result of rising prices and lack of  services. This, they claimed, has led to an increase in  negative attitudes and unwillingness to cooperate with state  policy, and has given terrorists the chance to carry out  activities to destroy the national economy.    Sa'd al-Shirbini, chairman of the People's Assembly Local  Administration Committee, emphasized that terrorism is the fruit  of indifference and negative attitudes among the people, who  complain about prices and services and the spread of corruption  in all state sectors. This is the reason for the rift between  the people and the government. He called for administrative  reform together with economic reform and for the removal of all  reasons that have led to a negative attitude among the people.  He also called for the genuine exercise of democracy involving  all the parties, political forces, and the people without  restrictions or prior conditions. He demanded that the  retirement age must not be extended to give a chance to the  young people to assume responsibility, prevent disappointment  and despair, and have more effective participation in the  process of development.    Faruq Mutawalli (independent) called for the formulation of  a  foreign policy to confront the results from the establishment of  a Middle Eastern market, the implementation of the GATT  agreement on international free trade, and Sudan's plan to  establish a new dam on the Nile, which could affect Egypt's  share of the water.    'Abd-al-Fattah Diyab, from the National Democratic Party,  noted that the development of the village has become a mere  slogan, as there is no development in the villages. This is  despite the fact that villages are the basis of development and  production. The government should have given villages more  importance but this failure has led to despair among the  peasants, who are more committed to paying taxes and  contributing to the increase in production. He also noted that  telephone services in the villages are very bad. What the  government did was to install old and dilapidated telephone  exchanges and cables just to claim that it had introduced  telephones to the villages. They would have been better without  it!    Diya'-al-Din Dawud (representative of the Nasirite Party)  said: If no serious attempt is made to allow parties to exercise  their activity among the people, there will be no political  enlightenment and terrorism and extremism will always find a  suitable climate to spread their subversive ideas among the  youth. This is the responsibility of the government, because  the security forces always restrict the activity of parties and  prevent them from holding public meetings, forcing them to hold  such meetings behind closed doors.    He called on the government to work for Arab unity. I call  on President Mubarak to exert personal efforts to convene an  Arab summit to discuss the dangers facing the Arab world, he  said. He asked: What has happened to Egypt's unifying role in  the Arab world?</p>

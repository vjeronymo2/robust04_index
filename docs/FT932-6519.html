			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Five killed in car bomb attack on historic Florence art gallery THE ITALIAN authorities yesterday blamed the Mafia for the huge car bomb explosion which killed five people, injured more than 50 and damaged a wing of the Uffizi gallery in Florence. Prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi vowed to defeat what he described as a terrorist offensive, widely seen as a reaction to the recent arrests of some leading Mafia figures and to moves to clean up Italian politics. 'It is without doubt a Mafia terrorist attack,' interior minister Mr Nicola Mancino said after an emergency meeting of Italian security chiefs. Italy's main union groups said they would hold a two-hour general strike today to protest at the blast, which came less than two weeks after a similar bombing in Rome. The Florence explosion damaged more than 30 paintings, three irreparably, and caused damage within a radius of 300 metres of the gallery. Florentine police found traces of explosive and the shattered remains of a Fiat Regata in a street adjoining the Uffizi Gallery. Standing in front of what is Italy's most famous art gallery, Mr Alberto Ronchey, the culture minister, said: 'This is a vile act and for the first time people have sought to attack right at the heart of our cultural heritage. 'The Uffizi in the historic centre of Florence is regarded world-wide as a symbol of western culture.' He said the gallery would be closed indefinitely, but added: 'We will seek to open at least part as soon as possible because it is vital that we show we are undeterred and can carry on as normal, especially at the height of the tourist season.' According to Ms Annamaria Petrioli Tofani, director of the Uffizi, the paintings damaged beyond repair were in the Caravagesque Gallery, in the part of the Uffizi nearest the river Arno. A painting by Giotto, the Madonna alla Costa, dating from 1300, was among the other damaged works. Many paintings were saved by their anti-vandal plexiglass shields. Haig Simonian adds from Milan: Mr Luciano Violante, chairman of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, attributed the incident to either the Mafia or the Camorra, its Neapolitan equivalent. They were the only powerful criminal organisations able to mount such an attack and to gain some advantage from the diversion of police resources it would create, he argued.

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Shares likely to dance to Wall St tune - New York After the blitzing it received in the wake of the Thanksgiving week massacre on Wall Street, the UK equity market is in desperate need of a tonic. This could come tomorrow when Mr Kenneth Clarke delivers his second Budget to the House of Commons. Only those fortunate (or in the current climate, unfortunate) enough to sit around the Cabinet table in 10 Downing Street, plus a handful of Mr Clarke's most trusted lieutenants, know the dark secrets of his red box. However, if the FT-SE 100 is to make any worthwhile progress for the rest of the year, there needs to be some good news in the budget. Indications to date offer little comfort to the market. But the improving trend in public finances could enable Mr Clarke to offer some good news on the public sector borrowing requirement for 1995, which has recently been estimated at Pounds 23bn to Pounds 24bn. One thing that would certainly upset the market would be any further reduction in the tax credit on dividends paid to non-taxpayers such as pension funds. As UBS, the securities house, pointed out recently, a shift from the current 20 per cent to 15 per cent, for example, would lead to a fall in the FT-SE of around 2 1/2 per cent. But UBS says changes in this area are much less likely than a year ago and gives them only a 20 per cent chance of occurring. Given that most market strategists and economists are expecting a broadly neutral Budget, it seems likely that the UK equity market will again dance to Wall Street's tune. After recent experience that could spell danger, Goldman Sachs strategist Sushil Wadhwani points out that the recent weakness in global equity markets largely derives from fears that the US economy may have a 'hard landing'. He says the Fed is 'likely to remain aggressive' and expects a further tightening of at least another 100 basis points between now and March, warning also of the 'potential threat of mutual fund outflows'. Mr John Reynolds, global strategist at NatWest Securities, warns that 'should the (US) rate rises currently implied in the futures markets become reality, the outlook for global financial markets would look decidedly uncomfortable'. He says the futures market is already discounting a further 200 basis points rise, but takes the view that the US economy 'is much closer to slower growth than many believe'. Let us hope he is right. The week brings a batch of important company results. A prop to a faltering equity market recently has been the dividend flow. Dividends announced recently mostly continue to surprise on the upside. One of the UK's biggest water companies, Severn Trent reports this week and should easily achieve a double-digit dividend increase.</p>

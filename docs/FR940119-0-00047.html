			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the control date was to discourage speculative entry into the fishery while development of Amendment 4 progressed. In deciding to add the requirement that a vessel must have landed more than 400 pounds of scallops on at least one trip in 1988&hyph;1989 in order to be eligible to participate in the fishery, the Council was addressing the factor of historical fishing practices and dependence on the fishery. Later in its deliberations, the Council recognized that not all participants may have received timely notice of the control date and, therefore, allowed a limited exception for vessels purchased after the control date if the vessels had any participation in the fishery between 1982 and 1990. With respect to determining allocations of DAS, the Council expanded historical participation to include 1985&hyph;1990 in order to recognize longstanding historical dependence on the fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule also adopts a Council recommendation to establish an exemption to the limited access fishery for vessels that land less than 400 pounds of scallops per day, in order to provide some opportunity for small-scale operations and new entrants to participate in the scallop fishery. Therefore, the Council's and NMFS's decision to rely on the criteria contained in the final rule represents a balancing of present and historical participation in the fishery with the need to reduce fishing mortality by limiting the number of full-time participants in the fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One individual was opposed to the minimum ring size of 31/4 inches and another individual stated that the ring size must remain at 31/4 inches. Both individuals were opposed to further increases to 31/2 inches under &sect;650.21.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This requirement is necessary to provide protection for small scallops and to help control the amount of fishing mortality associated with a DAS. This measure is designed to help mitigate the impact of removal of the meat count which provides age-at-entry controls. It is not expected, however, to afford age-at-entry protection equal to the current meat count system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three industry associations and three individuals commented about a currently ongoing ring size experimental study being done under a Saltonstall/Kennedy grant and what impact it would have on Amendment 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS contacted William D. DuPaul, Ph.D., of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, principal investigator on the experimental study, regarding the comments received. He commented that the first fishing trip of the experiment had recently been completed by a commercial vessel out of the port of New Bedford and that the larger rings allowed for significantly more escapement than the 3-inch rings currently in use by the industry. DuPaul also commented that the study is ongoing and that it is too early to draw any conclusions from the one trip taken. Final results on the experiment are not expected until work is completed in late winter of 1994. Therefore, NMFS has not considered the preliminary results of the ongoing experiment for the purposes of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the best scientific information available at this time, however, there seems to be a correlation between ring size and size of scallops retained by scallop dredges. Because removing the meat count measure effectively removes all age-at-entry controls, the Council and NMFS have determined that implementation of minimum ring size requirements simultaneously with removal of the meat count measure is critical to the achievement of the amendment's objectives. Failure to provide some age-at-entry limitations could seriously jeopardize the ability of the management measures to achieve plan objectives in the time required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two individuals commented that vessel owners should be allowed to combine limited access scallop permits and DAS allocations on one vessel and that ownership interest should not be limited to 5 percent of the total number of scallop vessels qualifying under the moratorium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  National Standard 5, 16 U.S.C. 1851(a)(5), states that conservation and management measures, where practicable, should promote efficiency. This standard also provides, however, that the goals of efficiency may be balanced against other factors such as social and biologic. In its deliberations, the Council explicitly considered possible gains in efficiency in allowing DAS to be combined, but ultimately rejected such a measure because of socioeconomic concerns of preserving current fishing practices and traditions at the outset of the management program. The Council was concerned that allowing combination or transfer of DAS allocations, at this time, may precipitously lead to aggregation of fishing rights in the hands of a few, thereby challenging the current type of fishing operations associated with the northeast region. Moreover, it would be impracticable to allow such fishing rights to be transferred, at this time, before the effectiveness of the management measures could be assessed. The Council did provide, however, that measures that may enhance efficiency can be considered and adopted through the framework procedure specified in the rule. NMFS concurs in the Council's deliberations and conclusions concerning these measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two industry associations were opposed to allowing changes to the moratorium under the framework provisions of the regulations if fishing mortality declines faster than anticipated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The rule does not pre-determine whether the moratorium will be lifted. The rule provides only that the Council may consider such a measure. If and when the Council considers such a measure, the plan requires that it be subject to public comment and that commenters have adequate opportunity to respond. If the Council decides to address this subject under the framework specifications all interested parties will be contacted and will have the opportunity to comment. The Council could adopt such measures only if it can be demonstrated that they are necessary to meet the goals and objectives of the FMP, including socioeconomic goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An industry association was opposed to allowing changes to the management measures through the framework specifications without considering appropriate analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

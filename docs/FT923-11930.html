			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: SecPac charges hit Bank of America BANK OF America has blamed special charges related to its recent takeover of Security Pacific for an 11.8 per cent decline in second-quarter net earnings. The bank is now the second largest in the US, with Dollars 188.6bn of assets. The results - the first since the merger was completed on April 22 - were hit by a net Dollars 181m of non-recurring items, including Dollars 395m of merger-related restructuring write-offs and a Dollars 157m gain on an asset sale. Because of the charges, Bank of America's net profit in the quarter was Dollars 240m, compared with Dollars 272m a year ago. Earnings per share were 63 cents, against Dollars 1.16. The bank said earnings per share would have been Dollars 1.19 but for the one-time charges, while its net income would have been Dollars 421m. The bank stressed that the results were not comparable with results in the same period of last year. However Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman, said he was pleased with the progress in integrating Bank of America and the former Security Pacific. Bad debt provisions in the second quarter amounted to Dollars 240m against Dollars 175m a year ago. For the first six months of 1992, these provisions totalled Dollars 470m, compared with Dollars 320m in the first half of 1991. Non-performing assets were Dollars 4.56bn at the end of last month, reflecting the problems among combined assets of both banks; the same measure for Bank of America alone was Dollars 3.08bn a year ago. Net loan losses amounted to Dollars 194m, up from Dollars 169m a year ago. The second-quarter 1992 losses consisted of Dollars 402m of write-offs and Dollars 208m of recoveries. The write-offs were related mainly to credit card and other consumer loans, and the recoveries mainly to the sale of sovereign debt and recoveries on previous write-offs. Net income for the first six months of 1992 was Dollars 543m, down from Dollars 554m last year. Net interest income after bad debt provisions was Dollars 1.44bn, compared with Dollars 916m a year ago for Bank of America alone.</p>

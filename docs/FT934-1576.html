			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / World News in Brief: Patten rebuffed on secret HK talks A special report in today's FT tells the story of the attempt by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to win China's agreement to faster democracy in the colony, based on interviews with Mr Patten and with Chinese and British officials. It reveals that before arriving in Hong Kong last year Mr Patten was rebuffed in an attempt to open a secret channel of communication to Beijing. Failure of the talks has left in doubt Hong Kong's smooth transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Sino-British impasse, Page 6; Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

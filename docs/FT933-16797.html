			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Goldsmith to sell further slice of Newmont holding SIR JAMES Goldsmith, the semi-retired international financier, is for the second time taking advantage of the recovery in the gold price he helped to stimulate. He is selling another substantial part of his shareholding in Newmont Mining, North America's biggest gold producer. The planned public offering of a 12.5 per cent Newmont stake would bring in Dollars 440m at yesterday's price. This follows his sale of 9.5 per cent of Newmont to a banking consortium for about Dollars 290m on May 11, and the disposal on April 23 of a 10 per cent Newmont stake to Mr George Soros, another high-profile financier, in the deal which sparked the present gold price surge. Sir James used some of the proceeds from Mr Soros's funds to buy call options in the gold market. This helped push the gold price, which languished at a seven-year low of Dollars 327 a troy ounce in January, to Dollars 378.25 at the close in London yesterday, a rise of nearly 16 per cent. Gold share prices have also risen sharply as many other funds followed Mr Soros's lead. Mr Soros paid Dollars 39.50 for each Newmont share; the banking consortium re-sold its stake at Dollars 45.50 and yesterday the price was above Dollars 52. Sir James paid Dollars 1.1bn in cash, or Dollars 39 a share, when he and his friend Lord (Jacob) Rothschild swapped timber assets for the Hanson conglomerate's 49 per cent shareholding in Newmont in October, 1990. When the public offering is completed, Sir James's investment vehicle, General Oriental, will retain 5 per cent of Newmont and Lord Rothschild's RIT Capital Partners, which is to contribute 1.16m Newmont shares to the offering, will have 1.5 per cent. Analysts suggest the Newmont purchase has not proved a particularly wonderful investment. It returned about Dollars 50m in dividends during two and a half years, an annual yield of 1.5 per cent. It is unlikely the financiers will net much more than Dollars 1.2bn from share sales so far. Sir James, who says gold will have its day again because the world's banking system is in such a mess, said GO would invest most of the proceeds of the public offering in physical gold and hold more gold than cash in its treasury. Analysts suggested that if Sir James used even half the proceeds to buy more call options the gold price would probably be driven above Dollars 400 an ounce. Salomon Brothers, Lazard Freres and Smith Barney Harris Upham are managing the underwriting of the public offering. Some 7.65m Newmont shares will be sold in the US and 2m offered internationally.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Modified approach to cyclicals mooted As investors began counting the costs of their commitments at the end of the second quarter, there were more murmurings in favour of bond markets yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. In equities, there were arguments for a modified approach to cyclicals, already voiced by Merrill Lynch in London. Mr Bert Jansen, European strategist at Paribas Capital Markets, said that of 56 major cyclicals, 32 were overvalued and 24 undervalued; and that implied prices for Thyssen, Pechiney, Acerinox, Peugeot and Preussag, based on peak earnings forecasts, and peak p/e ratios, were almost double their present level. FRANKFURT, according to some reports, mounted a cynical exercise to lift the Dax index before the end of June. Traders noted that an illiquid Dax stock, Lufthasa, rose DM8.50, or 4.6 per cent, to DM192.50, while Deutsche Bank gained only DM1.70, or 0.25 per cent, at DM679.50 as the Dax itself closed 28.04 higher at 2,046.30. Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok, head of research at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, could not see the sense of this. 'I strongly doubt whether the banks have been active,' he said, 'since they have been losing significant money on the bond market.' Foreigners continued to be net sellers, so insurance companies, by deduction, were the most likely buyers - and insurance funds would not worry about the level of stocks at the end of a given quarter. Mr Wodniok noted that good quality German cyclicals had outperformed over the past two weeks. Among them, Preussag rose another DM10 to DM447. Turnover increased from DM7.1bn to DM7.25bn. PARIS rallied further after Tuesday's promising performance, helped by additional firmness in the bond market. The CAC-40 index put on 10.57 at 1,936.33 but turnover was below FFr3bn. Hopes were raised that the Bank of France might be encouraged to lower interest rates today following an easing in the German repo, but most analysts considered this unlikely. Merrill Lynch joined other brokers which have underweighted the French equity market, although it said that it expected the CAC-40 index to target the 2,250 to 2,350 range over the next six months. It favoured cyclicals and was particularly interested in those stocks which had 'consumer exposure'. AMSTERDAM finished moderately higher after moving in a narrow range. The AEX index closed 1.08 up at 382.30. High volume was seen in Philips once again, the shares adding 40 cents at Fl 51.00, while switching was noted in the chemicals sector, DSM rising Fl 2.40 to Fl 127.00 at the expense of Akzo, down Fl 2.00 at Fl 188.80. KLM continued to benefit, climbing 50 cents to Fl 48.40, bringing its gain on the week so far to 7 per cent, as the group reaped the benefits of a number of positive analysts' notes in recent days. ZURICH moved ahead in active trade, the SMI index rising 26.8 to 2,631.2, with the market's resilience over the last difficult week adding to the improved sentiment. Banks remained firm, CS Holding appreciating SFr12 to SFr559, while insurers succumbed to profit-taking. Chemicals put aside worries about the weak dollar. Ciba bounced SFr25, or 3.2 per cent, higher to SFr805, while Roche certificates also gained SFr25, at SFr6,410. Holderbank fell SFr14 to SFr875 on a large sell order from one domestic institution. The fall wiped out Tuesday's gain which followed news that the cement group planned a FFr842m offer for a French group. MILAN continued to play a waiting game in the absence of decisive government action on the budget deficit, and the Comit index lost 2.94 at 698.03 in low turnover. Hopes that the successful privatisation of Ina would provide a spur to trading proved unfounded: the offer closed three days early on Tuesday night. Montedison gave up an early advance to finish a net L8 lower at L1,495 in spite of its announcement that it had boosted operating profits by 33 per cent in the first five months of the year and expected to cut debt to L9,500bn by the end of the year. Against the trend, Ferruzzi, the holding company, appreciated L25 to L2,050 ahead of today's shareholder assembly. Some analysts suggested that the company could be poised for a turnround, but others remained doubtful. COPENHAGEN featured a number of positive corporate stories as turnover climbed from DKr481m to DKr697m, and the KFX index moved up 1.51 to 102.88. Danske Bank finished DKr10 higher at DKr338, partly on news of an option on a 23 per cent stake in Baltica Forsikring, the insurer, which might open a way to the sale of Danke's existing shareholding. Danisco was up DKr20 at DKr920 ahead of a progress report due today, and FLS Industries by DKr20 at DKr530 on news of a Polish order worth DKr700m.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun 29                                       THE EUROPEAN SERIES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1331.26    1329.84    1330.77    1331.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1359.48    1358.37    1360.25    1360.75  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1332.64    1332.73    1330.75    1331.90 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1363.35    1362.47    1361.28    1362.43  --------------------------------------------------------------------                       Jun 28    Jun 27    Jun 24    Jun 23    Jun 22  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1327.83   1313.43   1328.34   1336.98   1323.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1354.56   1342.95   1354.15   1366.22   1357.37  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90); High/day: 100 - 1334.10 ; 200 - 1364.05 Low/day: 100 - 1329.25  200 - 1357.94  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane, John Pitt and Michael Morgan</p>

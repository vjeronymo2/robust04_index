			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["General Agreement on Human Rights" -- PRENSA LIBRE </F> headline]    [Text] Preamble    Taking into account existing constitutional provisions,  treaties, conventions, and other international instruments on  human rights to which Guatemala subscribes;    Taking into account the will of the Guatemalan Government  and  the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] to ensure  that the agreement on human rights and international  verification is implemented in keeping with said constitutional  provisions and international treaties;    Taking into account the Guatemalan Government's commitment  to  respect and promote human rights, in keeping with the  constitutional mandate;    Taking into account the URNG assumed the commitment to  respect the inherent attributes of human beings and to ensure  that they actually enjoy their human rights;    The government of the Republic of Guatemala and the URNG,  which will be subsequently referred to as "the parties," agree  to:    1. General agreement on human rights    1.1 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala reaffirms  its adherence to principles and rules seeking to guarantee and  protect full observance of human rights and its political will  to ensure they are respected.    1.2 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala will  continue to promote all measures designed to promote and improve  rules and mechanisms designed to protect human rights.    2. Strengthening institutions charged with protecting  human rights    2.1 The parties believe that any behavior that limits,  restricts, or jeopardizes duties pertaining to human rights  assigned to the judicial branch, Ombudsman for Human Rights, and  the Public Prosecutor's Office undermines basic principles of a  law-abiding state. Thus, the efforts of such institutions to  fulfill such duties must be supported and strengthened.    2.2 As for the judicial branch and the Public  Prosecutor's Office, the Government of the Republic of Guatemala  reaffirms its willingness to respect their autonomy and to  protect the freedom of action for both of them against pressure  of any sort or origin to ensure that they fully enjoy the  guarantees and instruments that they need to operate efficiently.    2.3 As for the Ombudsman for Human Rights, the Government  of the Republic of Guatemala will continue to support his work,  strengthening his position by supporting his actions and  promoting reforms that might be needed to ensure that he will be  able to better fulfill his duties and responsibilities. The  Government of the Republic of Guatemala will support initiatives  aimed at improving the technical and material conditions that  the Ombudsman for Human Rights might have at his disposal to  fulfill his tasks of investigating, overseeing, and following up  on the full observance of human rights in Guatemala.    3. Commitment against impunity    3.1 The parties agree that firm action must be adopted  against impunity. The government will not promote the adoption  of legislative measures or of any sort to prevent the trial and  punishment of those found responsible for human rights  violations.    3.2 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala will  promote, via the legislative branch, necessary legal  modifications to the penal code to classify and punish,  especially with regard to serious crimes, forceful or  involuntary disappearances and summary or extrajudicial  executions. The government will also promote, via the  international community, the recognition of crimes against  humanity, forced and involuntary disappearances, and summary or  extrajudicial executions.    No special laws [fuero] or exclusive jurisdiction  [jurisdiccion privativa] may be used to provide impunity for  human rights violations.    4. Commitment to eliminate illegal security groups  and clandestine organizations and regulate the bearing of  arms    4.1 In order to maintain absolute respect for human  rights, illegal groups or clandestine organizations should be  dissolved. The Government of the Republic acknowledges its  responsibility in fighting any such groups.    4.2 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala  reiterates its commitment to continue purging and  professionalizing security organizations. It also acknowledges  the need to continue drafting and adopting effective measures to  accurately regulate the ownership, bearing, and use of firearms  by individuals in accordance with the law.    5. Guarantees of freedom of association and  movement    5.1 Both parties agree that the right to free  association, movement, and locomotion are human rights  recognized internationally and constitutionally which must be  exercised in accordance with the law and given full validity in  Guatemala.    5.2 The Ombudsman for Human Rights, in the exercise of  his duties, will be in charge of verifying if members of the  Volunteer Committees for Civil Defense have been forced to join  these groups against their will and if they have committed human  rights violations.    5.3 The Ombudsman for Human Rights will immediately  conduct the necessary investigation of complaints submitted to  him. In order to do this, after informing the public that  membership in such committees be voluntary and respectful of the  law and human rights, consultations will be held with the  population to ensure that the will of committee members is  expressed freely and without any pressures.    5.4 If transgressions against the volunteer nature of  these organizations or the legal order are confirmed, the  Ombudsman for Human Rights will adopt those decisions he deems  appropriate and will promote the pertinent legal or  administrative actions to punish human rights violations.    5.5 The Government of the Republic unilaterally declares  that it will not support the organization nor will it arm new  Volunteer Committees for Civil Defense nationwide so long as  there are no circumstances to motivate these actions. The URNG  considers the government's statement as a positive expression of  its will to achieve peace and facilitate the objectives of the  statement.    5.6 Those affected will approach the municipal mayor, who  will convene a public meeting and call on the Ombudsman for  Human Rights to verify, through all available means, the  volunteer nature as well as the decision of the residents.    5.7 Both parties agree that other aspects of the  Volunteer Committees for Civil Defense will be dealt with later,  once other points of the general agenda are discussed.    5.8 The parties recognize the educational and informative  work carried out by the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office and  request that it include information on the content and  significance of the current agreement.    6. Military conscription    6.1 Conscription for obligatory military service must not  be forced or become an occasion for violation of human rights.  Therefore, in keeping with its nature as a civic duty and right,  it must be just and nondiscriminatory.    6.2 Toward this end, the Guatemalan Government will  continue making the necessary administrative decisions and will  promote, as soon as possible and in the spirit of this  agreement, a new law on military service.    7. Guarantees and protection of people and groups  working to protect human rights    7.1 The parties agree that all actions that might  threaten the security of those people or groups that work to  promote and protect human rights must be condemned.    7.2 To this end, the Government of the Republic of  Guatemala will take special measures to protect the people or  organizations that work on human rights. Furthermore, it will  opportunely and exhaustively investigate charges surrounding  actions or threats that could negatively affect them.    7.3 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala  reiterates its commitment to guarantee and effectively protect  the work to defend human rights carried out by individuals and  organizations.    8 Compensation and/or assistance to victims of  human rights violations    8.1 The parties admit it is their humane duty to  compensate and/or assist victims of human rights violations.  This compensation and/or assistance will be embodied in  government measures and civic and socioeconomic programs. Such  actions will be accorded priority status and will be addressed  to those who social and economic conditions are the most needy.    9 Human rights and the internal armed  confrontation    9.1 Until the agreement for a firm and lasting peace is  signed, both parties will acknowledge the need to end the  suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human  rights of the injured, captured, and those who are not part of  the fighting.    9.2 These statements by the parties do not constitute a  special agreement in regard to Article 8 (common), Point 2,  Paragraph 2, of the 1949 Geneva Convention.    International verification by the United Nations    1. The parties reaffirm their decision, included in the  10 January 1994 Framework Agreement, to have all agreements be  accompanied by appropriate national and international  verification mechanisms. Also, the United Nations will be in  charge of the international verification.    2. In this context, the parties agree to ask the UN  secretary general to organize a mission to verify the human  rights situation and compliance with commitments established in  the agreement. The mission will form part of the global  verification of the agreement for firm and lasting peace which  the parties have agreed to sign as soon as possible this year.    3. The parties acknowledge the importance of national  institutions, such as the judicial branch, the Attorney  General's Office, and the Ombudsman for Human Rights, which are  responsible for the validity, observance, and guarantee of human  rights in the country. They especially emphasize the importance  of the role of the Ombudsman for Human Rights.    4. The parties agree to ask the UN secretary general to  establish a Verification Commission, taking the following into  account:    Functions:    5. The mission will be assigned the following duties in  verifying the human rights situation:    i. It will receive, assess, and follow up on charges of  possible human rights violations.    ii. It will check that corresponding national  organizations conduct the necessary investigations autonomously  and effectively and in accordance to the Constitution of the  Republic of Guatemala and international human rights norms.    iii. It will issue statements on the existence or  nonexistence of human rights violations based on the evidence it  can obtain in exercising its responsibilities as expressed in  Article 10, Subparagraphs i), ii), iii), and iv), and will take  into account investigations by the corresponding constitutional  institutions.    6. The mission will verify other commitments in the  current agreement and will determine the correct compliance of  the parties.    7. According to the results of their verification  activities, the mission will make recommendations to the  parties, especially regarding measures necessary to promoting  full observance of human rights and strict compliance with all  points in the current agreement.    8. The mission will establish commissions for bilateral  dialogue with each of the parties so as to allow comment on the  mission's recommendations and thus speed the implementation of  the preceding measures.    9. The mission will regularly send reports to the UN  secretary general, who will brief this organization's  responsible officials. Copies of the reports will be sent to  the parties.    10. The mission is authorized to:    i) Settle and freely move about the national territory.    ii) Freely and privately meet with any person or group of  persons for the appropriate fulfillment of its functions.    iii) Freely visit, without prior notification and  whenever it is considered necessary for the fulfillment of its  functions, state agencies as well as URNG camps.    iv) Gather the information needed to fulfill its mandate.    11. The mission may address the public through the media  to disseminate information in connection with its functions and  activities.    12. Within the verification of compliance with human  rights, the mission will give special attention to the right to  live, personal integrity and safety, individual freedom, the  right to a fair trial, freedom of expression, freedom of  movement, freedom to organize, and political rights.    13. When carrying out its functions, the mission will  bear in mind the situation of the most vulnerable social groups  in society and the people most directly affected by the military  conflict (including displaced people, refugees, and returning  refugees).    14. The mission's activities will address events and  situations that occur after its installation.    15. To implement the general pledge on human rights  (Chapter I of this agreement), the parties recognize as human  rights those defined by the Guatemalan legal system, including  treaties, conventions, and other international instruments on  the subject to which Guatemala is a signatory.    Cooperation with and support for national human  rights organizations    16. The parties agree on the need for international  verification to help strengthen permanent constitutional  organizations, and other government and nongovernment agencies,  for the protection of human rights. In support of them, the  verification mission will have the means to:    i) Cooperate with national organizations and agencies in  all that is necessary for the effective protection and promotion  of human rights. It will specifically advocate technical  cooperation programs and carry out activities to strengthen  government agencies.    ii) Offer its support to the judicial branch and  auxiliary organizations, the Attorney General's Office, the  Ombudsman for Human Rights, and the presidential human rights  commission to help perfect and consolidate national  organizations for the defense of human rights and an appropriate  legal process.    iii) Sponsor international technical and financial  cooperation required to strengthen the capability of the  Ombudsman for Human Rights, and other national institutions and  agencies, so that they may execute their functions in the human  rights sector.    iv) Help develop a culture of respect for human rights in  cooperation with the state and the different groups of which  society is comprised.    Duration and structure of the mission    17. The mission will initially be established for one  year; its mandate may be renewed.    18. The verification mission will be led by a chief,  appointed by the UN Secretary General. He will have at his  disposal international and national officials and experts in  various specialties who are necessary to carry out the mission's  duties. The Government of the Republic of Guatemala and the  mission will sign the corresponding agreement concerning its  headquarters, in accordance with the 1946 Vienna convention on  diplomatic privileges and immunities.    Putting the international verification mission into  operation    19. Taking into consideration their willingness to  sponsor human rights in the country and the fact that the  current agreement's provisions reflect constitutional rights  already included in Guatemalan laws; and considering the  international mission's task of strengthening national agencies  and entities for the protection of human rights, particularly  the Ombudsman for Human Rights, the parties recognize that it is  advisable to begin verification of the human rights agreement,  on an exceptional basis, before the agreement for a firm and  durable peace is signed.    20. Given that the verification mission will begin its  operations before the military conflict ends, and given that  military operations continue, the mission will coordinate the  necessary security measures.    21. The parties agree to immediately ask the UN secretary  general to send a preliminary mission as soon as possible so  that it may prepare the establishment of a mission within the  shortest time possible and in coordination with the parties and  to evaluate the financial and technical requirements essential  to the verification of the human rights agreement.    Cooperation of the parties with the verification  commission    22. The parties pledge to offer their fullest support to  the mission and, in this regard, are dutybound to provide all  the cooperation required to fulfill its functions, particularly  in guaranteeing the safety of mission members or people who  submit reports or who testify.    23. The international verification carried out by the  mission will be done within the framework of this agreement's  provisions. Any situation which arises in connection with the  scope of this agreement will be settled through talks, as  foreseen in Number 8.    Final provisions    First: This agreement will become effective on the date  it is signed by the two parties.    Second: This agreement will be part of the agreement for  a firm and durable peace.    Third: A copy of this agreement will be sent by the  parties to the UN secretary general and the Ombudsman for Human  Rights.    Fourth: This agreement will be fully publicized at  national level, both in Spanish and in the Indian languages.  The Ombudsman for Human Rights and the pertinent government  offices will be in charge of this.    Mexico City, 29 March, 1994.

Sources close to Rafsanjani yesterday revealed that the  president was "deeply resentful" of the repeated discovery of  corruption cases in all government ministries and establishments.    A total of 106 cases of corruption were uncovered in the  past  six months including sums exceeding $1.5 billion in 13  government departments, nine state banks, two government-owned  insurance companies, and seven universities and research  centers. The corruption cases even reached the establishments  created by the mullas supposedly for charity. Two such  establishments have been accused of involvement in the black  market, smuggling, and extortion of funds from independent  businessmen.    The discovery of these cases has resulted in the arrest of  80  people including 22 senior banking officials. In the case of  one bank, almost all its senior officials have been jailed.    In a speech at Tehran University yesterday, Rafsanjani  admitted that his government is facing "serious difficulties"  because of the drop in oil revenues. He said his government  intends to cut expenditures considerably and launch a campaign  against extravagance and corruption.    According to a source close to Rafsanjani, the Iranian  president will not be able to carry out the required "purge"  operation because of the restrictions on his powers under the  Constitution.    Khamene'i, whose powers are unlimited under the  Constitution,  is the only person who can authorize Rafsanjani to launch such a  campaign which could "touch some important figures including  prominent mullas."</p>

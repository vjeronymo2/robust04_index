Kolotusha, said in a statement  issued Sunday that "efforts to settle the hostage issue have been essentially  pushed forward."  </P> <P> "In response to a request by the United States, the Soviet Union has been  conducting contacts with regional parties to help reach a political settlement  to the hostages matter," the statement said.  </P> <P> The Soviet envoy appeared to be hinting that Syria, Moscow's main regional  ally, and Iran, which has been seeking better Soviet relations, are being asked  by the Kremlin to exert pressure on their Lebanese Shiite allies.  </P></p>

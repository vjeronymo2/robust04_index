			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Tensions between Hungary's two main  liberal parliamentary parties, the Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ) and the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz), have  greatly reduced the liberals' chances in the 8 May elections,  according to two articles in the 31 March issue of the Budapest  weekly BESZELO. The journal, although edited by Ferenc Koszeg  and other prominent SZDSZ politicians, treated the two parties  even-handedly and urged both of them to resolve their  differences before it is too late. In the first article,  political commentator Peter Kende said that the conflict between  the two parties discourages voters from seeing the liberals as a  viable alternative either to the present right-of-center  government--led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF)--or to  the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), whose popularity has been  growing "like an avalanche." Although "in principle" Hungarian  popular opinion favors the "liberal center," liberal infighting  has created a political climate in which most voters think that  their only real choice is between the left and the right, Kende  said.    The SZDSZ and Fidesz are going into the campaign with an  agreement not to attack each other, but in Kende's view this is  "not enough to give their campaign momentum." Voters have  gotten the impression that "the two main forces in the liberal  camp are in a cold-blooded competition with each other and are  in fact pulling in two different directions." Kende indicated  that this perception is essentially valid. Because it considers  the right "the greatest evil," the SZDSZ formed a "united front"  with significant "intellectual" elements of the leftist MSZP  when it became alarmed by the emergence of an extreme right  faction from the ranks of the government parties in 1992;  Fidesz, in contrast, "true to its pragmatic profile," did not  want to "overdramatize the right-wing danger" and considered it  a "mistake" to put too much stock in the purported democratic  transformation of the MSZP, the successor of the previously  ruling communist party. In fact, in Fidesz's view, Kende said,  by agreeing to a rapprochement with the MSZP, the SZDSZ fell  into a "trap" set by right-wing extremist Istvan Csurka.    In any case, according to Kende, the break between the two  liberal parties has put both their futures in jeopardy. "The  two most probable outcomes of the May elections could both be  fatal to the liberals. If the left wins, the SZDSZ will be  forced to play second fiddle in a government dominated by the  MSZP, while if the right wins, Fidesz will have to play second  fiddle in a government dominated by the MDF--unless they choose  the thankless task of forcing new elections by completely  refusing to participate" in the government.    The two liberal parties "can only reverse" these downward  developments if they "radically" change their approach in the  weeks remaining before the elections, Kende said. They must do  three things, he argued: first, produce a "joint program" for  the voters; second, stress in their campaign, even when their  nominees are campaigning against each other, that any candidate  within the "liberal bloc" is "preferable" to any candidate of  the right or left; and third, announce that "neither of them is  willing to take part without the other in any kind of government  coalition" after the election. This would make clear to the  voters, Kende said, that the liberals are not willing to join a  government in a subordinate position. "The voter then could  decide, on the basis of this knowledge, whom he should vote for."    The author of the second BESZELO article, Attila Weber,  agreed with Kende that the liberals are in a weak position  because of interparty tensions, which he suggested were  partially the responsibility of both sides. Like Kende, he  wrote that the central problem is disagreement over Fidesz's  conviction that the left is a greater threat than the far right.  "Even if the party did not move to the right, in any case it  became more open toward the right-leaning or national Christian  parties," which Fidesz--unlike the SZDSZ--considered to be  essentially different from the extreme right. A scandal  involving the MDF and Fidesz, both of which were accused of  irregularities in selling a building assigned to them as part of  a postelection agreement on the allocation of party property,  also helped "sweep Fidesz into the Democratic Forum camp," along  with Fidesz's decision to emphasize its "commitment to national  values"--as opposed to the internationalist orientation of the  SZDSZ. It was a "significant consequence" of these  developments, Weber said, that Fidesz's relations with Budapest  intellectuals, especially those "who dominate the [print] media,  turned ugly." Hinting that the print media were instrumental in  clouding the image of Fidesz--which has "steadily lost  popularity" since November 1992--Weber wrote that the popular  perception of Fidesz was "embellished with new lines" during  published "polemics with the intellectuals."    Weber held out even less hope than Kende that these tensions  can be resolved in time to have a positive effect on the  election chances of the SZDSZ and Fidesz. In recent months "the  conflict between the liberal parties has increased" so much that  during the election campaign "there can be only limited  cooperation" between them. Consequently, he said, the liberals'  ability to attract votes has drastically decreased, creating a  situation that can "easily lead to the polarization of the  political system" between the left and right, with no  significant liberal camp to bridge the gap dividing them.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Credit Lyonnais recruits Nikko research team Credit Lyonnais Securities has recruited a five-strong convertible bond and warrant sales team from Nikko Securities Europe as part of its effort to expand its active quantitative research facility. Mr Michael Kerr-Dineen, chief executive of Credit Lyonnais Securities, said the company was seeking to distinguish itself in the highly competitive stockbroking market by developing unique quantitative products. 'Institutions are becoming much more selective in their use of research.' Credit Lyonnais, which recently lost the creators of its key Value and Momentum stock selection model to Robert Fleming Group, said it had already filled those vacancies internally and was continuing on schedule. Mr Kerr-Dineen has warned Fleming that he will take legal action if the team attempts to re-create the Value and Momentum model.</p>

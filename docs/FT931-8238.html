			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Timex sacks and replaces its Dundee workforce ANGRY PICKETS were last night besieging the Dundee plant of Timex Electronics, the US-owned multinational, in protest at the company's decision to sack all its production workers and replace them with a new labour force. This is the largest case of a mass dismissal of workers by a company in Britain since News International fired its print workers before moving production facilities to Wapping in east London in January 1986. Yesterday the first 12 recruits walked into the Dundee plant, which makes printed circuit boards, through a picket line of former Timex employees. With more than 10.2 per cent of Dundee's workers jobless, the company has been inundated with job applications from the unemployed. 'We have had an enormous response to our call for new workers,' said Mr Peter Hall, the Timex president, last night. Two senior union officials face jail or fines in the High Court next week for alleged breach of an injunction to keep pickets down to only six outside Timex. Mr Hall said the company had decided to replace its 320-strong manual workforce after a 20-day dispute over provisions for a series of lay-offs and two months of negotiation with the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. Senior executives flew from Connecticut last week to hammer out a peace plan with the union. This involved asking the workers to accept a rotation of lay-offs among the whole workforce for six months with access to independent arbitration, a pay freeze for 1993, a 10 per cent cut in benefits and introduction of a profit-sharing scheme. Mr Hall said the company intended to increase production in the second half of the year and recruit a further 300 workers. He said the staff had refused to accept the peace plan at meetings last Sunday and again on Wednesday. Mr Gordon Samson, the AEEU's district secretary in Dundee, said staff had agreed to return to work 'under protest' and the company had fired them. Mr Hall agreed that 'technically' the union was correct, but he added the company had no alternative but to dismiss all its production workers (including 17 who worked through the strike) because they could each individually, with the union's backing, take Timex to court. The company could face heavy fines over breach of contract if it changed pension and other benefit provisions without the agreement of the workforce. The trouble began when Timex warned the AEEU that the Dundee plant faced closure, or compulsory redundancies, if the workforce did not accept lay-offs and a reduction in the value of their present lay-off agreement. In response the workers said that they would share what work was available so all of them would have periods in and out of work with the promise from the company of increased production in the second half of this year and an expansion in the labour force.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY AT AFI FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are The Times' recommendations for today's schedule of the American  Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival (AFIFEST), with  commentary by the film reviewing staff. Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213)  520-2000.  </P> <P> Highly recommended:  </P> <P> "FUNNY FACE"(U.S.; Director: Stanley Donen; Cineplex Century Plaza 3, 8 p.m.).  A restored print of the 1957 musical classic, a satire on fashion photography  and Americans in Paris. The script is weak, but there are great songs by the  Gershwin brothers, matchless hoofing by Fred Astaire, gamin smiles by Audrey  Hepburn, photographs by Richard Avedon, deft, limber mise-en-scene by Stanley  Donen. Through it all: the seemingly effortless elegance of the near-past,  something we ought to try to recapture.  </P> <P> (Michael Wilmington)  </P> <P> "VIENNA IS DIFFERENT"(U.S.; D: Susan Korda, David Leitner. AFI Mark Goodson, 7  p.m.) Vienna celebrates 50 years of the Anschluss, simultaneously with the  Waldheim controversy. Many-layered, mesmerizing, terrific stuff.(Sheila Benson)  </P> <P> Recommended:  </P> <P> "ISLAND"(Australia; D: Paul Cox. Century Plaza 2, 7 p.m.) A beautifully shot  but sometimes enervated drama about three women whose paths cross on a Greek  isle; enlivened by Cox' painterly landscapes and Irene Papas' fiery  performance. Critic's Choice with the L. A. Weekly's Ella Taylor. (M. W.)  </P></p>

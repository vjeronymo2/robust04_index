			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / People: Barry Maiden moves over to Queens Moat Andrew Coppel, who last week took over as chief executive of Queens Moat Houses, has made his first important appointment. Barry Maiden is to become finance director of the UK hotel division. The appointment comes after Coppel decided that the UK part of the business should be run as a separate company, rather than directed from group headquarters. The UK business, whose shares were suspended last March, is in urgent need of new financial and management controls, Coppel says. Maiden, 43, was finance director of Hilton UK for three years and before that finance director at Threshers, the drinks retailer.</p>

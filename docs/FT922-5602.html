			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Manweb launches gas unit MANWEB, the regional elec-tricity company, is creating a marketing company to sell gas bought from Alliance, the supplier that aims to be a main competitor to British Gas. Alliance, a joint venture between BP, the oil and petrochemicals group, Statoil, the Norwegian state-owned oil and gas company, and Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian energy and chemicals group, was launched earlier this month. It already has a marketing deal with East Midlands Electricity. Manweb Gas will sell gas within and outside the Manweb region and will provide energy packages of electricity and gas to industrial and commercial customers of all sizes. It aims to compete with British Gas on price, and hopes to provide 'added-value' services similar to those it offers electricity customers, such as price forecasting to allow users to plan consumption. Mr Colin Leonard, director of power marketing, said Manweb would consider supply-ing household customers if the tariff market was de-regulated. He said: 'If competition moves downward in terms of size of user, then if it is profitable we would be interested in moving down with it.' The announcement brings to seven the regional electricity companies that have links with gas suppliers - evidence of a growing trend to combined gas and electricity marketing. Five have joint ventures with United Gas, an offshoot of Utilicorp, the second-largest US gas marketing company. Two have deals with Alliance, which said it was in talks with other regional electricity companies and hoped to conclude at least one more similar deal.</p>

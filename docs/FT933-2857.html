			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: US chemicals group to take Dollars 420m charge AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, will take a Dollars 420m after-tax charge in the third quarter to reflect the completion of a plan to shed its chemicals businesses and Dollars 100m of environmental clean-up costs. The company said yesterday that its chemicals business, Cytec Industries, would be spun-off as a separate company on the New York Stock Exchange shortly, with all outstanding Cytec ordinary shares being distributed to Cyanamid shareholders as a taxable dividend. Cyanamid will retain preferred stock convertible into 30 per cent of Cytec's ordinary shares. The move, along with the closure of chemicals operations not taken on by Cytec, completes a two-year plan to retreat from chemicals and focus instead on pharmaceuticals and products for the agricultural industry. After-tax costs linked to the disposal and closures will be Dollars 320m in the third quarter. The chemicals business accounted for around Dollars 1bn of Cyanamid's Dollars 5.3bn of sales last year, but only Dollars 34m of its Dollars 564m operating income. Cytec had assets at June 30 1993 of Dollars 1.1bn, and will have 6,700 employees. The company will take on Dollars 225m of environmental liabilities and Dollars 400m of liabilities for its employees' post-retirement health and life insurance benefits. Also yesterday, Cyanamid said it had reviewed its environmental position and had decided to take an after-tax charge of Dollars 100m to reflect likely clean-up costs. The company said it will remain responsible for the environmental position of Cytec's plant at Bound Brook, New Jersey after the spin-off is complete.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> PICKING THEIR BRAINS ABOUT THE MYSTERIES OF THE MIND  </P> <P> Neuro-: Life on the Frontlines of Brain Surgery and Neurological Medicine by  David Noonan (Simon and Schuster: $19.95; 233 pages)  </P> <P> The human brain is the most distinguishing part of our body, the most  fascinating, and probably the least understood. Unlike the other organs, the  brain's product -- mind -- cannot be directly observed. The pancreas secretes  insulin; does the brain secrete thoughts? If so, where are they?  </P> <P> The link between brain and mind is very poorly understood. Yet doctors who  treat the brain organically -- neurologists and neurosurgeons -- are frequently  able to help their patients. "Neuro-" by David Noonan is the story of who they  are and how they do it.  </P> <P> Noonan, a Los Angeles writer, approaches his subject from the doctors' point of  view and from the patients'. The chapters on brain surgery and brain surgeons  are the best. To do research for them, he interviewed the surgeons and observed  them at work. He writes:  </P> <P> "The brain exposed. Light falls on its gleaming surface for the first time. It  beats lightly, steadily. It is pink and gray, the brain, and covered with tiny  blood vessels, in a web. In some openings you can see the curve of the brain,  its roundness. It does not look strong, it looks very soft, soft enough for you  to push your finger through. When you see it for the first time, you almost  expect sparks arcing across the surface of the cortex, blinking lights, the  crackle of an idea. You stare down at it, and it gives nothing back, reveals  nothing, gives no hint of how it works."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confident Practitioners  </P> <P> The reader learns that practitioners in this field are supremely confident of  their knowledge and their skills and their ability to make the right decisions  in difficult situations. "Brain surgeons cut people's heads open," Noonan  writes. A simple but startling statement.  </P> <P> He has great affection and admiration for these doctors who do this work, and  that comes through loud and clear. He is also aware of the difficult and  unusual position that doctors -- particularly surgeons -- are in. Noonan is  very perceptive about this.  </P> <P> Surgeons must care about their patients, but they cannot become emotionally  involved with them. The patient's condition is part of the job, and it must  always remain part of the job:  </P> <P> "What is all new and strange to the patients and his family is old and familiar  to the surgeon," Noonan writes. "The patient rightly considers his brain tumor  to be the most important brain tumor that ever existed, while the doctor knows  that the patient's brain tumor is one of many a doctor will have to confront  over the course of his career."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neurological Problems  </P> <P> While the first half of the book deals with doctors and patients and the  relationship between the two, the second half deals in detail with three  serious neurological problems: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's  disease), which affects movement; aphasia, which affects speech, and  schizophrenia, which affects thought.  </P> <P> This part of the book is less successful than the first. It has a padded  feeling. The chapter on Lou Gehrig's disease, for example, contains an extended  discussion of Lou Gehrig's baseball career. The chapter on schizophrenia  includes a seemingly endless diatribe against frontal lobotomies, which were  extensively performed in this country from 1935 to 1960 as a treatment for  mental illness. These chapters are more descriptions of diseases than "life on  the frontlines of brain surgery and neurological medicine," which, after all,  is the subtitle of the book.  </P> <P> But they do have some value. The chapter on Lou Gehrig's disease includes a  profile of Lance Meagher, a physician who has lived with ALS for 13 years and,  though virtually paralyzed, continues in limited practice and is making plans  to fly solo around the world. Meagher is probably the most interesting person  Noonan presents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Missing the Soul  </P> <P> At the very end of the book, in a short chapter appropriately titled  "Conclusion," Noonan voices his only reservations about the doctors who work on  the brain. By restricting their activity to the flesh, he says, they are  missing the soul. Doctors treat the body but not the mind. Emotions are more  than the sum total of complicated electrochemical firings in the brain.  </P> <P> "Yes," Noonan says, "love is a chemical reaction, but there is more to it than  that. There is, I believe, something beyond biology, and it is a factor,  somehow, in the function of every living human cell and in every human thought  and deed. In a sense, the human nervous system is a complex set of conditions  necessary for the existence of the soul."  </P> <P> This assertion, on the book's penultimate page, comes out of the blue. It does  not follow from what has come before, and Noonan has hardly raised the  question, much less prepared the reader for his conclusion.  </P></p>

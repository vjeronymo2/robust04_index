			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead and zinc growth slower than expected DEMAND GROWTH for lead and zinc this year will be much slower than previously expected, according to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group, the UK-based intergovernmental organisation. Last October the group forecast demand for both metals would jump 4 per cent this year. It now suggests zinc consumption in 1992 will rise only 1.6 per cent from last year's record 5.34m tonnes and lead by 1.5 per cent, from 4.40m tonnes. The study group says zinc demand should show an 8 per cent increase in the US this year, rising sharply in the second half, and that demand in South East Asia is continuing at a high level. However, conditions in Europe are 'fairly flat' and Japan's consumption is down more than expected. Refined zinc output is forecast to rise by 1.7 per cent, from last year's 5.37m tonnes, with lower output in Belgium balanced by increases in Germany and Spain, but little change in other countries except India. The study group points out both zinc and lead markets will continue to be affected by exports from the former eastern bloc to the west. However, 'if these show some reduction as the year progresses, the anticipated strengthening in consumption in North America and further growth in South East Asia should result in an improvement in the balances between western world supply and demand during the latter part of the year.' Lead metal production in the west is planned to expand by 4 per cent from 4.3m tonnes but the study group suggests 'this will be subject to any interruptions in output or delays in bringing new capacity into operation and in the secondary (scrap) sector to availability of scrap materials'. In January the study group warned that it seemed to have 'lost' about 100,000 tonnes of zinc when drawing up preliminary estimates of consumption for 1991. The consumption figures have now been revised upwards from 5.2m to 5.34m tonnes. Mr David Evans, the study group's chief statistician, said European demand last year was stronger than anticipated and 10,000 tonnes more zinc was consumed in the US than indicated in the preliminary estimates. Demand in South East Asia was also much stronger than previously expected: 'it took us completely by surprise'.</p>

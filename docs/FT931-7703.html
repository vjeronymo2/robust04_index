			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK recession enters 10th quarter: GDP figures better than expected; Long-term jobless figure tops 1m FALLING OUTPUT in manufacturing and services dragged Brit- ain into its tenth quarter of recession at the end of last year, making this the longest period of economic decline since the second world war. Increased oil and gas production led to a slight increase in gross domestic product during the second half of last year, but the Treasury yesterday declined to say the recession had ended. An official pointed to the continuing decline in onshore activity which affects the overwhelming majority of the British people and said figures from the Central Statistical Office showed 'that the economy had been broadly flat since the end of 1991'. The CSO said seasonally ad- justed GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, was 0.2 per cent higher in the last three months of 1992 than the previous quarter, but 0.1 per cent lower than in the final quarter of 1991. Without oil and gas, output showed a small decline. In October, November and December it fell by 0.1 per cent against the previous quarter and by 0.2 per cent against the same period in 1991. The latest quarter was the ninth consecutive quarter in which onshore GDP recorded a fall compared with the previous year. Compared with the previous quarter, GDP excluding oil and gas has fallen in nine out of the past 10 quarters. Output during 1992 as a whole was 0.5 per cent lower than 1991. Excluding oil and gas, GDP was 0.7 per cent below the previous year's level, the CSO said. From its cyclical peak in the second quarter of 1990 to its trough at the middle of last year, overall GDP fell by 4 per cent. GDP excluding oil and gas has fallen by 3.9 per cent in the period to the end of last year. This is still short of the 6.2 per cent drop in non-oil GDP recorded in the 1979-81 recession. Yesterday's GDP figures were slightly better than expected in the City. Nevertheless, Mr Robert Lind, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said he expected 'a further decline in onshore GDP in the first quarter of 1993'. For the whole of this year independent economists predict growth of about 1 per cent, led by manufacturing. However, a report published yesterday by Business Strategies, a consultancy, warned that manufacturing would provide only a modest lift and that high unemployment would be a 'huge burden' into the late 1990s. The employment department is due to reveal today that the number of people out of work for longer than a year has risen over the past nine quarters. The figure for the final quarter of 1992 is expected to top 1m, against 956,000 in the previous quarter. The long-term unemployment total was last over 1m in the summer of 1988. The sharpest output decline in the latest quarter is believed to have occurred in the construction sector. Precise figures are not yet available, but the CSO estimates it fell by about 1 per cent over the previous quarter. Service sector output fell 0.1 per cent compared with the third quarter, and manufacturing dropped 0.2 per cent. This drop was balanced by a 6.3 per cent quarterly growth in oil and gas. Activity in transport and communications, public administration and other energy sectors also rose slightly over the period. Hotel and catering, education and health sector output remained largely flat. Devaluation 'boost', Page 7 Long-term jobless, Page 8</p>

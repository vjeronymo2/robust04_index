			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Serb power struggle leads to coup fears: Milosevic's forces seize control of key building in Belgrade in showdown with federal authorities SERBIAN police yesterday seized control of the Yugoslav federal interior ministry in an apparent attempt by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, to wrest power from the Yugoslav prime minister, Mr Milan Panic. The seizure reflects the intensified power struggle between Mr Milosevic on one side and Mr Panic and Yugoslav President Dobrica Cosic on the other. It also shows that the Yugoslav government has not yet succeeded in gaining control over key federal institutions. Following the break-up of Yugoslavia, Mr Milosevic has tried to usurp the remaining power of the old federation. He controls not only the Serbian interior ministry and Serbian paramilitary groups, but also sections of the federal interior ministry. The new Yugoslav federal leaders have been fighting back in recent months. Mr Cosic has gained the support of top echelons within the army, while Mr Panic has been trying to strengthen the federal institutions legally in order to erode Mr Milosevic's power base, which is anchored in the police. Both Mr Cosic and Mr Panic have urged Mr Milosevic to resign in order to get United Nations sanctions lifted and stop the war in neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina. But in the early hours yesterday Mr Milosevic demonstrated his determination to preserve his power base by ordering scores of Serbian police to enter and then seal off the federal police headquarters, which is inside the Belgrade interior ministry. Federal officials were barred from entering the building. The move prompted speculation that Mr Milosevic was orchestrating a coup against Mr Panic, although under such circumstances it is uncertain what role the federal army would play. In a statement yesterday the federal government strongly condemned the 'violent seizure of the interior ministry', demanding 'immediate restoration' to federal control. The statement warned that the ministry was 'unable to fulfil its constitutional function which gravely threatened state security'. However, Serbian officials attempted to play down the issue, saying that the takeover of the headquarters followed a ruling by a municipal court that the federal interior ministry must abandon the building by October 15. Nevertheless, the seizure also fuelled speculation that the Serbian police were trying to confiscate federal police archives. Following international moves towards setting up a tribunal on war crimes in Bosnia, the archives could incriminate Serb politicians. Mr Cosic and President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia held their first face-to-face meeting yesterday, Reuter reports from Geneva. After long talks in Geneva's Palais des Nations they issued a statement throwing their weight behind the peace process and condemning so-called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.</p>

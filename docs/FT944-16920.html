			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Jones at IPounds 1.7m Jones Group, the Dublin-based shipping, manufacturing and oil distribution company, continued its recovery in the 1994 first half with pre-tax profits of IPounds 1.72m (Pounds 1.7m). The outcome compared with a profit of IPounds 1.18m last time and was struck on turnover up from IPounds 31.7m to IPounds 43.6m. The figure was bolstered by IPounds 7.47m from acquisitions. Earnings came out at 11.7p (7.8p) per share. The interim is maintained at 4p. Mr Denis Magee, chairman, said shipping growth had slowed but there continued to be growth in the remainder of the group's markets. Hardy Craske, purchased in February, had undergone considerable rationalisation. Benefits were expected to come through in 1995, he said. Talks with Koninklijke Pakhoed of the Netherlands, concerning the purchase of Theodora Tankers, were continuing.</p>

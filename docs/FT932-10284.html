			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Tec chiefs call for wider action: The partnership between the employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils and the government is one of the most ambitious forged with the private sector. The performance of the Tecs, which handle Pounds 2.3bn of public money each year, will help determine the private sector's willingness to push ahead with other programmes WHITEHALL should better co-ordinate its activities in training and education, say directors of the 82 Tecs in England and Wales. The finding is one of several in the FT's survey which questioned the working relationships within the government and those between Whitehall and Tecs. These are the bodies contract with a number of government departments, including education, employment and trade and industry, to provide training and enterprise activities. One third of directors want a much more fundamental co-ordination of ministerial responsibilities, suggesting that Tecs should emulate Scotland where their equivalents, Local Economic Councils (Lecs), have strong parent bodies - Scottish Enterprise and the Highlands and Islands Enterprise. These statutory bodies fund the Lecs and devolve activities to them - not only training, but also the economic development powers of the Scottish Development Agency. Going down this route would require radical reform in Whitehall, to include concentrating regional aid under one wing. A recurring theme is the need for a stronger focus by departments on activities that involve Tecs. One businessman says: 'Far too little has been done to unite all the diverse bodies involved in, say, tackling unemployment. The operation is fragmented beyond belief. At the government level there are three departments all coming at the problem from different angles and at the local level there are county councils, district councils, the Employment Service and Tecs, all with different priorities.' When it comes to their own priorities, directors are forthright. Sixty three per per cent rate economic development as their priority, including job creation. Only 17 per cent say training the unemployed is their top priority. A total of 68 per cent of directors believe the amount of money the government spends on training via the Tecs is too low, while only 2 per cent say it is too high. Many are still pessimistic about the government's approach to promoting the training of those in work. Forty nine per cent of directors generally - and 39 per cent of executives - advocate a statutory training levy, rather than leaving it up to the company. Just under half - 46 six per cent - back Workfare, one of the most controversial proposals, which would force specific groups of the unemployed to work or undertake training in return for benefits. On the whole, the directors are generally enthusiastic over government initiatives - more than 80 per cent welcome the pilots for a scheme under which employers are given a subsidy to take on someone who has been without work for a long time. One director says: 'This scheme should be extended nationwide. It just may give companies that extra bit of confidence to employ another person that they could not really afford.'

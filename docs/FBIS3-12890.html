The U.S. attitude toward the atrocity, which has claimed 400  casualties, once more exposes America's open and consistent bias  toward the usurper Zionist entity, as well as underscoring its  abiding willingness to extend political protection to that  entity at the United Nations, not to mention the apologies and  alibis afforded the Zionist entity by U.S. media    Typical of its approach to the savageries the Zionist entity  has committed against the Palestinian Arab people, the United  States has, for the past three days, been bending over backwards  not only to contain and deflect the angry reactions to the crime  and its perpetrators and to underplay the bloodbath and its  consequences, but also to shield the Zionist entity from any  international measures. The Clinton administration has not  limited itself to throwing its full weight behind Tel Aviv; it  stands ready to keep the UN Security Council from passing a  resolution decreeing protection for the Palestinian people in  the occupied territories and demanding that the Zionist entity  take immediate measures to curb the illegal practices of the  Zionist settlers.    It was entirely predictable that the draft resolution  submitted by the nonaligned group at the United Nations should  come up against U.S. opposition. Particularly objectionable to  the United States is the paragraph stipulating international  protection for the Palestinian people. Washington argues that  such a resolution would set back the ongoing peace process.  Another disagreeable paragraph to the Americans is the one  calling on Israel to curb the settlers' scandalous actions  against the Palestinian population. Beyond that, the United  States has come out against disarming these settlers!    At the end of the day, what the Clinton administration  really  wants is for the negotiations to resume. As for stemming the  flow of Palestinian blood, it could not be bothered. Seen  against this backdrop, Clinton's call for the  Palestinian-Israeli talks to resume in Washington is a wretched  and transparent attempt to whitewash the Zionist crime and shift  the attention of the Palestinian, Arab, and world opinion away  from the atrocity. From a U.S. perspective, the progress of the  talks seems to count for more than Palestinian blood.    In any event, this is not the first time that the United  States has acted disgracefully, nor will it be the last. The  U.S. attitude now fits in with a pattern of open U.S. partiality  to the Zionist enemy. Still fresh in our memory is the crime  perpetrated by the Zionists at al-Aqsa Mosque in October, 1990  and how the Bush administration manipulated the Security Council  into passing a weak resolution condemning violence in general  terms. Will the Clinton administration get the Council to issue  a similarly weak resolution with empty expressions of  condemnation that have no value in the face of this  state-sponsored Zionist terror?!    There is an elementary truth that the imperialists and their  allies and agents will not recognize, and that is that the  Palestinian people, who have been engaged in a bloody and  ceaseless struggle for the past 40-odd years and who have  offered huge sacrifices as they stood up to Zionist coercion and  occupation, are not about to relent in the battle against terror  and repression. The Palestinians will carry on with their heroic  fight and make further sacrifices until their right to an  independent state on their national soil is recognized.</p>

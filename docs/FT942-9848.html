			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy While it is a comfort to see the trade deficit narrowing in February, it is still difficult to know how much trust to place in the government's reworked statistics. The apparent discrepancies remain startling. Non-oil imports from the EC, for example, are recorded as falling 3.5 per cent by volume in the quarter to February compared with the same period a year before; those from other countries are shown rising 5 per cent. Despite the lingering effect of sterling's depreciation, the unit value of exports grew by 6.5 per cent while those of imports were up only 4 per cent. Either exporters have used the fall in sterling to claw back margin rather than build sustainable market share, or the figures are wrong and more goods were actually exported but at lower prices. That would have broader significance because it would mean the government has also understated manufacturing output and hence the overall economic growth rate. But it does not mean the trade balance will be less of a constraint in the end, especially since the chances are that import volumes have also been understated. The UK retained a propensity to import throughout the recession. Recovery elsewhere in Europe may prove a palliative by boosting exports, but it may not suffice for long.</p>

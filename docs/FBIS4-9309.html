			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 24 Apr (TANJUG) -- The return of Serbs  expelled from their homes by the Muslims began this afternoon at  the same time as the deployment of UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] troops along the demarcation line between the warring  sides on the Gorazde front. Several hundred Serbian civilians  from Donja Potkozara, Gornja Potkozara, Zupcici, Lug, Visevica,  and other villages have returned to their homes after almost two  years spent as refugees. They decided to return after UN  representatives offered them guarantees that they would be  secure. On their return the Serbian civilians found utter  devastation in their villages because the Muslims had razed and  burned to the ground all houses and other buildings. However,  they hope that they will receive aid in rebuilding their razed  homes and that UNPROFOR representatives will be a true guarantee  that the Muslims will not massacre them in their villages again.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: US accounting cuts Fiat losses The US accounts of Fiat, the Italian automotive and industrial group, show a 1993 net loss almost L1,000bn (Dollars 662m) lower than the loss shown by the group's European results. The disparity is the result of accounting differences. In May, Fiat announced a record consolidated loss of L1,783bn for 1993, after minority interests, extraordinary items and tax. In the US accounts, deposited with the US authorities at the end of last month, the net loss is L794bn. The comparative profits in 1992 were L551bn in the European accounts and L375bn in the US equivalent. At the same time, shareholders' equity is slightly higher in Fiat's US accounts for 1993: L18,724bn, compared with L17,427bn in the European accounts. Mr Carlo Gatto, a senior vice-president in Fiat's administration and audit division, explained that the difference in net results was particularly marked in the 1993 accounts because the group implemented changes to US rules on accounting for deferred tax liabilities and assets. When the cumulative effect of the changed accounting principle was included, Fiat's US profit and loss account was adjusted upwards by L1,308bn, although this figure was offset by other negative items. The adjustment to shareholders' equity was mainly due to differences in accounting for goodwill in acquisitions. Fiat indicated at its shareholder meeting at the end of last month, that it would return to net profit for 1994.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: DANCE / EILEEN SONDAK: DANCER BRINGS BROADWAY TOUCH TO  UCSD STUDENTS  </P> <P> At the height of his success, San Diego-born dancer Barry Bernal turned his  back on Broadway and came home. Since the prodigal's return, however, local  aficionados have seen very little of the former star of "Starlight Express" and  "Cats." Aside from an appearance with Jazz Unlimited last fall, San Diego's  favorite son has kept a low profile.  </P> <P> Consequently, UC San Diego's recent announcement that Bernal has joined the  teaching roster for its dance program this year -- albeit on a part-time basis  -- is cause for celebration among the local dance community.  </P> <P> "We're really excited about him, because of his experience, but even more so  because he is an excellent teacher," said Margaret Marshall, co-coordinator of  UC San Diego's dance program and vice chairwoman of the physical education  department. "We observed him when he taught a master class here, and he was  wonderful.  </P> <P> "Barry's classes just started this month, and they're already packed, and he's  really igniting the students. Hopefully, he'll be around next year, but we  understand he's interested in pursuing his profession as well. He's not ready  to be strictly an academic."  </P> <P> "Part of the reason I left 'Starlight Express' and came home," said Bernal, "is  because I wanted to create a stimulus -- to show that San Diego has potential  as a cultural center. We need to work as a community to nurture programs for  young people, and we're going to see a turnaround. I have about 50 students in  my classes, and I see this relationship with the university as a long-term  association."  </P> <P> Bernal has not abandoned performing, however. He will dance in this year's  Aademy Awards show and perform with Jazz Unlimited as well. But, as Marshall  noted, the department is willing to work around Bernal's schedule, because,  even as a part-timer, Bernal fills an important void at the La Jolla-based  university.  </P> <P> "Right now, we have no other men on the dance faculty, and Barry is such a good  role model for the students," said Marshall. "That helps attract more male  dancers too."  </P> <P> UC San Diego does not offer a degree in dance, which limits its effectiveness  as a magnet for attracting quality dancers to San Diego. Nevertheless, Marshall  believes Bernal's presence on the faculty will act as "a shot in the arm for us  and for our campus."  </P> <P> Patricia Rincon, artistic director of Jazz Unlimited and a long-time dance  faculty member at UC San Diego, is just as gung-ho about Bernal's association.  </P> <P> "The students just love working with Barry," she said. "He'll be teaching our  advanced classes and setting a work on the students for the Spring concert."  </P> <P> Jazz Unlimited is making plans of its own this Spring, as Rincon noted.  </P> <P> "The La Jolla Museum invited us back to do a concert on April 14-15, and we'll  be getting two new dancers soon. We're still awaiting confirmation on Joey  Pentileon, but Terry Lindley is all signed.  </P> <P> "Stacy Scardino is back with us, after a year's absence," she said, "so, even  though the company will remain about the same size as last year, it will look a  little different."  </P> <P> Local choreographer Tom Vannucci gets his creative juices going when he designs  dances for old musicals. But his main goal is to maintain the integrity of the  period, not to show off his own choreographic prowess.  </P> <P> "If we're not careful, people are going to forget about the dances from the  1870s through the 1920s," Vannucci said during work on USIU's production of  "Tintypes." "Rhythm, tap, show tap, ragtime. They need to be preserved."  </P> <P> Vannucci had the blessings of director Andrew Barnicle when he tackled the  project, and between them they beefed up the dancing in the musical revue for  USIU's all-student cast.  </P> <P> " 'Tintypes' is different than other musicals," Vannucci said. "The director  and I worked hand in hand to take the production from the 1870s-1920s. I put in  a lot of dance, but the challenge was not to bore people with it. Historically,  dance really didn't change that much during those 40 years."  </P> <P> Vannucci was determined to be true to the era, without overworking any  individual stylistic elements. That involved painstaking research and  reproduction for a show that ends its brief run at the Old Town Theater on Jan.  29.  </P> <P> In addition to the old standard tap and rhythm routines that pervade most  stagings of "Tintypes," Vannucci added the one-step, the polka, and a  Ziegfeld-style chorus line -- all adapted to the confines of the Old Town stage  -- and to the limitations of his non-dancing cast. To this dedicated dance  maker, creating the right moves for a college-based musical is serious  business.  </P> <P> "I don't need to be on stage. I did 'Hello Dolly' in 1986," he said, "but I  really feel lucky to be able to choreograph as much as I do. I want to keep the  old dance forms alive."  </P> <P> FOOT NOTES: On Jan. 27-28, New York-based dancer Donald Byrd will share Sushi's  downtown studio with Mio Morales in "Fast Changers," a multimedia work Byrd  describes as a "full evening pas de deux." . . . California Ballet members  Calvin Kitten, Patrick Nollet, Sylvia Poolos and Matthew Bean will appear in  the San Diego Opera's production of "Lucia di Lammermoor" this weekend. . . .  Barry Bernal will emcee a movie promotion Tap-A-Thon Saturday at Seaport  Village in Embarcadero Park. Strap-on taps will be provided for unequipped  hoofers, and the open session will be followed by national competition under  way in conjunction with the coming Gregory Hines movie "Tap."  </P></p>

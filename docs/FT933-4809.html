			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden improves to Pounds 17m WILSON BOWDEN, the housebuilder and property development group, is increasing its interim dividend by 6 per cent after reporting higher profits and turnover underpinned by a 28 per cent increase in house sales in the first half, writes Paul Taylor. The Leicester-based group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.8m, including a Pounds 5.5m pension scheme refund, in the six months to June 30, compared to Pounds 10.3m. Turnover increased by 30 per cent to Pounds 81m (Pounds 62.2m) including Pounds 65.1m (Pounds 48.7m) from housebuilding. Earnings jumped to to 14.3p (8.9p) and the group is paying an increased interim dividend of 2.65p (2.5p). During the period the group sold 825 houses at an average price of Pounds 78,000 compared with 643 houses at Pounds 75,700. Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief executive, emphasised that the increase in average selling price reflected the company's policy of selling more larger houses achieved in a market in which house prices, year on year, declined by about 5 per cent. Mr Wilson described the results as superb considering that 'the clouds of economic uncertainty have not entirely disappeared.' Operating profits for housebuilding rose 12 per cent to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 7.8m) while property development contributed Pounds 4m (Pounds 3m). However, Mr Wilson cautioned that profits from property development were uneven and this level of performance would not be repeated in the second half. The group continued to expand its land bank in anticipation of a significant upturn in housebuilding activity. At the end of June the group owned or had control over 10,300 plots, compared with 8,750 at the end of December. At the end of June the group had net debt of Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 18.8m) compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 170.9m. The shares, which almost doubled in price over the past 12 months, closed up 9p at 449p. COMMENT This is a quality stock in an industry ravaged by the recession which should be able to push higher volume through as the recovery gathers pace. The company is already outperforming the market and should continue to steal market share from smaller builders and the housebuilding subsidiaries of some of the large construction companies. Nevertheless, the share price has already moved up sharply. Pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 28m this year producing earnings of 23.8p and a total dividend of perhaps 9.5p. The stock is trading on a lofty prospective p/e of 18.8 and should be held.</p>

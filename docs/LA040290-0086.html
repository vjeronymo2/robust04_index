			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: THE OL' MODEL T STILL REVS UP FANS' ENTHUSIASM  </P> <P> In saying the other day that no man ever forgets his first Model T Ford, I  should also have said no woman ever forgets her husband or boy friend's first  Model T.  </P> <P> On the stationery of the Model T Ford Club of America (San Fernando Valley  Chapter), Clara Jo Ostergren writes that she is so involved with her husband,  Ben, in his love for his 1922 model that she is secretary of the club and  editor of its newsletter.  </P> <P> Like me, Ben bought his 1922 in the late 1930s; he drove his to high school in  St. Paul, Minn. "He remembered it so fondly," Mrs. Ostergren says, "that three  years ago he decided to get another one like it. He finally found one in . . .  Hudson, Ohio, and rushed there with his truck and trailer to bring it home. . .  ."  </P> <P> Lester F. Ziegler of Arcadia encloses a panegyric he wrote for Old Cars Weekly  some years ago about his first T -- a 1913 model that was 7 years old when he  acquired it as a boy. "A lad of 15 yet to know the scrape of a razor, a rural  crossroads town, and for the first time -- a genuine, stem-winding automobile  of my very own. . . . I photographically remember her every contour,  provocation, dent and rewarding exhilaration. . . ."  </P> <P> Debra Wilson insists it was her way with her boyfriend's Model T that caused  him to marry her. When she met him in 1977, he was building a 1924 Model T  roadster from parts. "When it stopped running, the one who didn't know how to  drive it (me!) had to push it to get it going. My husband has always said he  married me because I was the only girl he knew who would push the Model T fast  enough to get it going!" On their wedding day they rode home in the rain in the  open roadster.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, several readers have written to correct Robert Taylor's recollection  of driving a 1918 Model T from Los Angeles to Phoenix in 1926, when he was 16.  Taylor said they drove several miles over a road of railroad ties that  traversed the sand dunes between Yuma and Phoenix. That road, I am told, was  made of planks, not ties, and was between Calexico and Yuma, in California.  </P> <P> Lambert Ford of Yucca Valley says it was called the Board Road, not the Plank  Road, as some have called it. He says it ran between Holtville and Winterhaven,  in California. "It was made up of one-inch boards fastened together with  flexible metal strips."  </P> <P> Ford owned a 1922 Model T touring car he had bought for $4. It had been  hacksawed into a roadster. He used it to deliver papers and finally sold it for  $5. "The buyer drove it off on the rims."  </P> <P> Taylor says he still remembers the road as being made of railroad ties and  running between Yuma and Phoenix. But that was long ago. Dr. Graham Gilmore Jr.  of Orange questions another part of Taylor's saga.  </P> <P> Taylor told of climbing down a ladder of an abandoned mine pit; a rung broke  and he hung by his hands, his feet bicycling in air, until his brother tied one  end of a rope to the Ford's axle and lowered the other end to Bob, who tied it  around his waist and was pulled up.  </P> <P> "Regarding your vivid description of poor Bob Taylor hanging on the last rung  of a ladder in a deserted mine shaft with both hands, his feet both dangling  helplessly. Please, if you will, describe for your faithful followers how he  tied the cord around his waist while in this predicament."  </P> <P> That was Taylor's vivid description, not mine. I forgot to ask him about it  when I phoned him to ask about the road. But the answer is easy. He simply  placed his feet on a higher rung and balanced there while he tied the rope  around his waist. Not easy, but possible.  </P> <P> My own recollection of driving my 1922 T around the Southern California  mountains from one CCC camp to another is questioned by Zane Boychuk of  Carlsbad, who writes that Model Ts couldn't climb.  </P> <P> "The T had big problems in climbing because the gravity-fed gas would not flow  to the carb, and the driver would have to back the hot-rod up the grade. . . ."  </P> <P> Here I hang in air, my feet bicycling . . .  </P></p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / People: Cementing new ties David Lovett is quitting the US operations of Lafarge Coppee, the French company which is the world's second largest cement manufacturer, to join one of its arch rivals, Blue Circle of Britain. As the new president and chief executive of Blue Circle's US operation, Lovett, who is 50, replaces Keith Orrell-Jones. The latter will shortly be returning to London as group managing director of Blue Circle Industries. Blue Circle's US profits have slumped from Pounds 35.9m in 1987 to Pounds 11.5m last year, so Lovett will not be short of a challenge. It was poor performance that prompted the arrival of Orrell-Jones two years ago; the company credits him with introducing a stringent cost-cutting programme which it claims has at least lessened the effects of deep recession. A Canadian, Lovett has spent the last 23 years with Lafarge, mostly in Canada. Three years ago he moved to Lafarge Corporation's headquarters in Reston, Virginia, as president of the construction materials group, one of the two principal divisions, reporting directly to Lafarge's boss, Robert Murdoch. Blue Circle and Lafarge and a small number of other European cement companies have expanded aggressively into the US, and now account for around half of America's cement production. Blue Circle, whose ready-mix concrete and concrete product operations are based mainly along the eastern seaboard, is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. ***** Ian Ramsay has been appointed md of CPC(UK)Ltd. He is currently operations director. ***** Thomas Sneddon becomes a main board director, and general manager of Caldwells Paper Mill, at INVERESK. He joins from Tullis Russell, where he was sales and marketing director. ***** Tony Carss has been appointed group finance director of CAMPBELL &amp; ARMSTRONG, and will take over when Mark Hesketh finishes his secondment and returns to Kingston Oil and Gas where he is group finance director. ***** Alastair Robertson joins SAFEWAY in the newly created position of head of research and development within the quality assurance division. He comes from the Campden Food and Drink Research Association. ***** Roy Fewster is promoted to the new position of operations director at HARVEY PLANT. ***** John Alexander becomes sales director, special markets at HERTZ Europe. ***** Patrick O'Neill and Mark Ross have been appointed directors of H CLARKSON and Company Limited. Mike Ball and Alan Rand are divisional directors. ***** Stephen Gutteridge is the new commercial director of SEEBOARD. He joins in August from Amerada Hess Limited.</p>

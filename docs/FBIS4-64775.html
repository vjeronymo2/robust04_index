			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Eurabic Again Suspected of Banned </F> Trading With Libya"]    [Excerpt] Eurabic International, based in Hoofddorp, has  again been caught possibly engaged in banned trading with Libya.  The U.S. Justice Department suspects the company of supplying  Libya with computer software. This would be an infringement of  the U.S. [as published] trade embargo imposed on Libya.    Eurabic is well-known to Western intelligence services as a  front for the Libyan Government. Netherlands Intelligence  believes that the firm is controlled directly from Tripoli and  attempts to acquire a variety of goods which are no longer  available through normal channels due to the trade embargo.    Eurabic was founded by B. Rhuma, former head of the  Netherlands office of Libyan Arab Airlines, the Libyan state  airline. The U.S. Justice Department has long been interested  in the affairs of Eurabic. In the past, Libya has purchased  items including aircraft components and chemicals from the firm.

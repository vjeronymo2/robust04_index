			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Supermarket worry The food retail sector faced another session of underperformance as investors fretted over the possibility of an MMC inquiry into food price collusion. A weekend press report suggested that the prospect of some sort of official inquiry had increased because some of the leading companies had jointly hired consultants to help fight a probe. However, Tesco managed to climb 2 to 216p, the stock having crept on to a number of brokers buy lists in the past week as some in the market have felt its recent falls overdone. Elsewhere, J Sainsbury slipped 6 to 465p and Argyll Group 4 to 325p. Most food manufacturing stocks also spent another session under a cloud as BZW advised clients to stay underweight. Despite this, Northern Foods managed a rise of 3 to 270p, while Dalgety put on 6 to 481p. The financial sectors of the market continued to power ahead, led by the banks. Standard Chartered maintained its recent outstanding performance, breaching the 900p level for the first time and settling at a record closing level of 899p, a net gain of 15, ahead of Thursday's interim figures. Dealers expect the bank to report exceptionally good results, which will be boosted by the bank's pre-eminent position in trading in so-called 'exotic' currencies, outside of the big D-mark, dollar, Yen and sterling activities. 'There are big profits in trading in exotic currencies, where dealing spreads are much wider and margins higher, ' said one banks specialist. A growing stock shortage drove HSBC shares higher, with the 75p shares closing 11 better at a record 725p. Abbey National raced up 8 to 410p, after 412p, following a split buying order. SG Warburg was the pick of a generally firm merchant banking area, with one leading institution said to have been an aggressive buyer and keen to move to a market weighting in the stock without worrying too much about the price it paid. Warburg shares settled 11 up at a record 793p, also helped by the recent upsurge in stock market activity. Analysts also pointed to the recent spate of 'flabberghastingly good' results from the likes of Midland Global Markets, BZW and NatWest Markets, as well as last week's excellent figures from Kleinwort Benson. The latter rose 3 to 492p. The boardroom shake-up boosted Union Discount 7 to 185p. Persistent market talk of a potential bid for General Accident, with Prudential mentioned as a possible predator, and hopes of an increase in the interim dividend from 9.7p to 10p lifted GenAx shares 5 to 692p. GenAx kicks off the composite insurance sector's interim reporting season this morning. The range of analysts' forecasts is from Pounds 90m to around Pounds 125m, compared with a Pounds 21m loss last year. Commercial Union, scheduled to report interim profits of around Pounds 60m against last times Pounds 18m loss when it reports tomorrow, rose 7 to 660p.

Dealers said Goldman Sachs was positive on the stock. GUS was lifted by the good consumer credit figures. The 'A' shares agined 25 to 2010p.

Bass shares climbed 3 to 479p and Greene King 2 to 367p. Elsewhere, Scottish and Newcastle, which has lagged behind in recent sessions, did some catching up. It closed 9 ahead at 458p. Whitbread was also sought by bargain-hunters, rising 13 to 520p.

Shares in Europa Minerals held steady at 40p, with the market expecting a statement today concerning progress towards the three-way merger planned with Burmine and Austmin, both of Australia. The merger plan has been challenged by Mount Edon which has suggested it may offer 34p for Europa, but the stock market expects Europa to name today the blue chip merchant banker chosen to push through the intended merger with the two Australian companies.

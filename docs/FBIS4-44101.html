			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bank of France Governor: `We Must </F> Keep Cool'"]    [Text] On Wednesday, 22 June, [Bank of France Governor]  Jean-Claude Trichet stated: "We must keep cool (...). Central  bankers are vigilant and have always proved that they are there  and are able to maintain the necessary framework for stability."  Invited by the Europe No. 1 radio station to talk about the  collapse of the dollar against the yen, the Bank of France  governor added that the G-7, the group of the seven most  industrialized countries (which is to meet in Naples at the  beginning of July) is "the place where we can verify whether the  framework for stability is suitable." After noting that the  dollar "is potentially stronger than it appears," Mr. Trichet  expressed the opinion that the current difficulties have  "nothing to do with" the 1987 stock market crash but are due to  an economic recovery that has been "badly interpreted by some  people (...). What counts are the basic and objective figures  for the economies," he stressed, "and these figures are good."    The previous day, Hans Tietmayer, president of the German  central bank, the Bundesbank, had expressed his satisfaction  with how the European Monetary System [EMS] was operating.  Thanks to the widening of its fluctuation bands after the  monetary crisis of August 1993, the EMS has become "flexible."  Mr. Tietmayer told members of Atlantikbruecke, the U.S.-German  friendship society: "Previously, fluctuations in the dollar  would certainly have caused tensions within the system."</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Affable leader short of political vision Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio was an affable, courteous pro-marketeer who rose to prominence under the patronage of Mr Carlos Salinas, Mexico's current president. Former congressman, senator, head of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, social development minister and finally his party's presidential candidate, Mr Colosio began his rise through the ranks of the Mexican bureaucracy in 1979, when he first met Mr Salinas, then deputy budget minister. Mr Salinas took him under his wing and, after working together for many years, picked him to run his presidential campaign in 1988. From then Mr Salinas seemed to groom his quiet and loyal colleague to succeed him. Mr Colosio was put in charge of the PRI, masterminding the party's comfortable victory in the 1991 legislative elections. However, he failed to push through promised democratic reforms that would have required candidates to be selected in open primaries. When made social development minister in 1992, Mr Colosio had become clear favourite for the presidential nomination. He shared Mr Salinas's commitment to pro-market economic policy, was popular within the ruling party, and became closely identified with the government's showcase anti-poverty programme. It was thought his easy-going manner and modest northern roots would go down well with the electorate. Nevertheless, Mr Colosio was criticised by rivals for having no clear vision independent of Mr Salinas, and for being unwilling or unable to defend a point of view in cabinet meetings. They said he had been chosen as presidential candidate because of blind loyalty to Mr Salinas, rather than any special leadership qualities of his own. Such doubts grew after Mr Colosio was nominated presidential candidate. His campaign was quickly overshadowed by the peasant uprising in Chiapas, and the prominent role played in it by Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy to the southern state. In the past few weeks Mr Colosio began the difficult task of distancing himself from Mr Salinas, even criticising the excessive concentration of presidential power. Mr Colosio, still young at 44, was unfailingly polite and courteous in public, and inspired tremendous loyalty from his advisers and friends. By the standards of Mexican politicians, he was modest, driving his own car the city, and occasionally a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. But in unfamiliar situations he often appeared unsure of himself, and seemed happier listening rather than talking to people.</p>

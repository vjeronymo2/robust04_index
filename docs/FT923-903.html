			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho sells Firsteel via buy-out LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, has sold Firsteel Group, a narrow steel strip processor and distributor, to its management. Mr Frank Neale, a partner of Phildrew Ventures, which helped fund the management buy-out, said the price was close to the Pounds 21m net asset value of the company. Over the last year Lonrho has been making a series of disposals to reduce its debt. At the half year to March 31 net debt fell from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 903m. Firsteel last year had sales of more than Pounds 80m. It has financing of Pounds 24.5m, comprising Pounds 11.5m of debt facilities from Midland Bank, Pounds 10.5m raised by Phildrew Ventures and Pounds 2.5m of mezzanine finance organised by Midland Montagu Ventures. The transaction represents the first buy-out for Phildrew's Pounds 108m third fund which owns the majority stake in the West Midlands-based business.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> New Kid in the Hospital: A member of the New Kids on the Block singing group  was listed in stable condition Monday after suffering several injuries when he  fell on stage during the grand finale of the group's concert in Saratoga  Springs, N.Y. Donnie Wahlberg, 20, suffered bruises to his chest and cuts to  his arms and his mouth during Sunday night's concert at Saratoga Raceway. He  was admitted to Saratoga Hospital at 1:10 a.m. Monday and was taken to  intensive care for "his privacy and protection," said Helen Edelman, director  of community relations for the hospital.  </P> <P> He was being guarded by his personal bodyguard, who is only known as "Robo,"  she said. Wahlberg had to have stitches in his lower lip, and was having  trouble talking Monday morning, Edelman said. At least 100 teen-age girls  crowded the lobby of the hospital, and scores of cards and flowers from  well-wishing fans filled the hospital. The concert was the second of the  group's "Summer Magic" tour. Officials said that they did not know when  Wahlberg would be released, or if the injury would affect the group's scheduled  performance tonight in Auburn Hills, Mich. The New Kids' new album, "Step By  Step" is currently No. 1 on the charts. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Eminent call for greener ethics A GATHERING of former prime ministers, presidents and other eminent persons yesterday released a Tokyo Declaration, calling for a 're-evaluation of the thinking which underlies our present society' and the adoption of 'new environmental ethics'. The meeting, a precursor to the UN's Earth summit in June, also asked governments to consider new taxes to protect the environment, to increase financial assistance to developing countries, and to settle quickly the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The meeting, sponsored by the UN Conference on Environment and Development, urged Japan to take a political lead in the coming months to ensure the success of the summit in Rio de Janeiro and to broaden the debate on environmental ethics. Mr Noboru Takeshita, Japan's former prime minister and official host of the three-day meeting, promised that Japan would build 'a society oriented to preserving the environment', though he gave few specific examples of how this would be achieved. The declaration's reference to environment-related taxes was a sensitive point, as Japanese government officials had requested that the text not call directly for the introduction of taxes. Tokyo is now 'informally' discussing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, similar to that introduced in Nordic countries. In the final draft, the declaration's reference to taxes read: 'Countries may also wish to consider special taxes and charges in the context of the global partnership being forged at Rio de Janeiro, keeping in mind the impact on international competitiveness.' 'We appeal to the leaders of all governments to come to the Earth Summit at Rio, prepared to commit themselves to the measures required to give effect to a new global partnership for sustainable development,' the Tokyo Declaration added. The delegates agreed that developing countries need 'increased access to the markets of industrialised countries', and this necessitates 'an immediate and meaningful conclusion of the Uruguay Round'. They also encouraged private companies towards a more important role in making environment policy, and suggested developed countries arrive in Rio with specific proposals for increased technology transfer to developing nations.</p>

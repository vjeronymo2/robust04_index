			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Louis Ng] </F>   [Text] China is to tighten the way it handles applications  from the Hong Kong media, following the jailing last month of  Ming Pao reporter Xi Yang. Officials had adopted a flexible  approach towards applications for reporting on the mainland,  said deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office  Wang Fengchao. But, in future, the rules would have to be  strictly followed "to avoid confusion", Mr Wang told a  delegation from the Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing  yesterday.    "Because the response from Hong Kong was that it was  difficult to understand the system in China when it suddenly  tightened its rules and imposed a 12-year penalty on Xi Yang, Mr  Wang said it was better for China to stick to its rules," said  the federation's Chan Yuen- han after the meeting with Mr Wang.  Xi was jailed for 12 years for "stealing state secrets". He  was accused of publishing details last summer of Beijing's plan  to sell gold and raise interest rates in defence of the exchange  rate. Mr Wang asked other Hong Kong journalists to stick to the  confines of their approved reporting activities while on the  mainland.    China's State Council has seven rules regarding reporting  activities in China. They stipulate that all reporters must  apply in advance to cover any activity in China and that the  coverage should not go beyond the items listed in the  application form. Mr Wang said more than a thousand Hong Kong  reporters had visited China since last year and only Xi had been  arrested, illustrating that most reporters knew and followed the  law.    He said Xi had asked to cover news related to the  Sino-British talks, meetings of the Preliminary Working  Committee and an education project, but had failed to spell out  his intention to cover news related to China's state finances  and economy. Xi had been a reporter on the mainland for more  than eight years and should have known the boundaries  distinguishing normal reporting and spying for state secrets, Mr  Wang said. He said that was why Xi could not be regarded as  unintentionally trespassing in the "restricted areas".    He said Hong Kong and China had different legal systems and  Hong Kong people should not use their legal standards to make  judgments about China's system. Director of the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping has assured that Xi's sentence  "will not affect Hong Kong reporters' normal reporting work".</p>

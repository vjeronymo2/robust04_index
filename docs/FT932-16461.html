			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Leyland Daf receivers to appeal over parts ruling ADMINISTRATIVE receivers of truck and van maker Leyland Daf will urge the Court of Appeal this morning to avert a crisis for management buy-out attempts. If the receivers lose, management buy-out initiatives at the Leyland and Birmingham plants would be in difficulty because of a lack of parts. The court will hear an appeal by Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot, the joint administrative receivers for Leyland Daf, against a High Court decision in London last week not to compel Automotive Products, a subsidiary of the BBA engineering group, to continue supplying components. The components, chiefly brake assemblies and some clutches, are used at both the truck assembly plant at Leyland in Lancashire and the van plant in Birmingham. Automotive Products is refusing to deliver brake and clutch components until it is paid more than Pounds 758,000. It says it is owed this for parts supplied before Leyland Daf went into receivership in February. At the time of the hearing, the receivers warned that production could be halted at the van plant as early as yesterday and that truck assembly could end later this week. However, the receivers said yesterday that a rescheduling of production operations around the Easter holiday meant that the plants were unlikely to be halted before the middle of next week. It is understood that about 15 companies are refusing to supply Leyland Daf, although the Automotive Products case is the most critical. Leamington Spa-based Automotive Products makes components specifically for Leyland Daf vehicles, and both the Leyland and Birmingham plants acknowledge that it would take months to establish an alternative supplier. Managers at the van plant, in particular, had hoped to conclude a buy-out as early as next week. Counsel for the receivers argued unsuccessfully in the chancery division of the High Court that Automotive Products was in breach of European Community trading law by abusing its dominant position as a supplier and holding the company to ransom.</p>

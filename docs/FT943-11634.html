			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Hurd warns against shift to right Mr Douglas Hurd insisted last night that the government would not cede the political centre ground to Mr Tony Blair's Labour party as he set out a 'commonsense' strategy to rebuild Tory self-confidence. In a speech which carried an implicit warning against a lurch to the right, the foreign secretary said the Conservatives alone were able to strike an intelligent balance between the demands of a vibrant free market and the claims of the community. His comments came as cabinet ministers agreed at their last meeting before the summer break to launch a concerted autumn campaign to highlight the clear divisions between the Tory and Labour approaches. Speaking in Newbury, Berkshire - the scene of the disastrous by-election defeat last year which plunged his party into turmoil - Mr Hurd sought to dispel any notion that the new Labour leader could win the battle of ideas. Instead Mr Blair's attempts to embrace the market had shown him to be 'wandering aimlessly' across past political battlefields. Mr Hurd said the Conservatives still occupied the high ground in the battle of ideas, demonstrating since 1979 the 'massive power for good' of the free market. The economic recovery would allow the government to rebuild self-confidence by 'expressing our commonsense policies in a framework of Conservative philosophy'. Mr Hurd stressed that his approach built on the ideas for a more limited role for the state and greater freedom for the individual set out earlier this week by Mr John Major. But the foreign secretary's repeated emphasis on the market as a tool to 'strengthen and refresh our institutions, not to destroy them' was in marked contrast to the call from many rightwing ministers for a more radical agenda. Citing the examples of the government's approach to the civil service, the BBC and the Post Office, Mr Hurd said that Conservative reform was 'driven by common sense rather than ideology'. Change should come in response to need rather than dogma and should be designed to strengthen not weaken institutions and communities.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Czech Soldiers in France, French </F> Soldiers in the Czech Republic"]    [Text] Paris/Ceske Budejovice -- Two AN-26 aircraft with  120 soldiers of the Strasice 23d Mechanized Battalion landed  yesterday at the Clermont-Ferrand airport in central France.  This marked the beginning of the first Czech-French exercises,  agreed on by the [defense] ministers of the two countries,  Francois Leotard and Antonin Baudys, agreed in Paris in April.  The joint exercises are unique for both countries because they  are taking place in both countries concurrently with each  country using its own weapons. More than 1,000 French soldiers  arrived in the Czech Republic last weekend. The exercises  themselves, called Livradois, will begin on 7 June. The joint  exercises are, above all, to prepare the Czech soldiers for the  eventual participation in NATO missions.</p>

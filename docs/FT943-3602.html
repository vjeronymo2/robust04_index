			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Singer &amp; Friedlander advances 12% to Pounds 13m Singer &amp; Friedlander, the diversified merchant banking group, reported a 12 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 13.1m, boosted by significant growth in its investment banking operations. The performance was distorted by share sales during 1993, and profits before exceptional items for the six months to June rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 11.1m, up from Pounds 9.13m. Growing competition in the corporate lending market restricted growth in its core banking business, and loans to customers increased only marginally, from Pounds 274.3m to Pounds 282m. Bad debt provisions fell from Pounds 825,000 to Pounds 33,000. Profits from merchant banking and investment management rose to Pounds 6.92m (Pounds 5.77m). Corporate finance activity increased, and advisory deals for Embassy Property, Enviromed, and more recently Wellman, should ensure an increased contribution for 1994. Funds under management, primarily for private clients, rose to more than Pounds 1bn. Collins Stewart, the 51 per cent owned broker, saw a sharp decline in market making profits, and Singer's dealing profits fell from Pounds 2.19m to Pounds 415,000. It was also hit by the impact of falling bond markets on its debt trading portfolio. Singer's property portfolio, now valued at about Pounds 85m, contributed Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 1.89m), helped by trading profits. Interest and investment income rose to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 1.47m), reflecting increased cash from recent share sales. Singer made Pounds 3.9m of provisions against property values last year, and it wrote back Pounds 2m of this at the interim stage, almost off-setting a Pounds 2.57m profit from the sale of its Burford stake in 1993. During the half year Singer increased its stake in Associated Nursing Services to 22.6 per cent, and it now owns 60 per cent of Edgar Hamilton, the Lloyd's broker. It also has a 21 per cent stake in the highly profitable People's Phone, an independent provider of mobile phone services. Brokers estimate it could make about Pounds 20m profit from the sale of this stake. Mr John Hodson, chief executive, said Singer was looking to make further investments in teams and businesses within its core area of financial services. It has recently set up unit trust fund management and structured finance teams, and is thought to be negotiating the purchase of Carnegie International, the European securities business. House broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities forecasts full-year profits of Pounds 26m. The interim dividend is lifted to 1.4p (1.25p). Earnings per share rose from 4.63p to 5.16p.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE ACCENT IS MULTINATIONAL, INTERCONTINENTAL ON LE CAFE'S MENUS  </P> <P> Usually a restaurant whose menu travels all over the map -- France, China,  Mexico, Italy -- doesn't do anything especially well. Not so at Le Cafe, where  dinners (lunch is another matter) are composed of well-made dishes from several  continents, fully realized dishes with a good amount of national character  intact.  </P> <P> Start with a flavorsome and well-textured chicken liver pate (Chef's pate, they  call it here). It was a generous portion thoughtfully served at room  temperature (excessive cold deadens flavor). A thick slice of appealingly  coarse duck pate was likable but looked more interesting than it tasted. A  "handmade" beef tamale, enlivened with cilantro, however, had a welcome  tastier-than-it-looks freshness.  </P> <P> Skip the appetizer sampler whose pleasures -- oysters on the half shell and the  Chef's pate -- were outgunned by uninteresting boiled shrimp and a tired pasta  primavera. My favorite dish was a large bowl of tender mussels in a shallot,  garlic and wine sauce rich with butter and mussel broth.  </P> <P> Dinner entrees are also multinational. A first-rate New York steak had been  Cajun-blackened and topped with a deceptively normal-looking pat of herbed  butter. Deceptive because the butter had been spiked with chile and thus served  as a savory dose-it-yourself condiment.  </P> <P> Among the specials one evening was a generous portion of exquisite poached  salmon with a mustard-scallion topping that was too strong in massive amounts  but which left a distinctive, yet delicate swath of flavor when removed to the  side of the plate. Scallops and shrimp "Japon," in a dark ginger and black  mushroom and soy sauce, seemed more Chinese than Japanese. It certainly didn't  lack flavor but it was cruder than it could have been.  </P> <P> The vegetables and starches were unfortunately unreliable. One night they were  perfect: Lush, correctly cooked asparagus, napped with a well-balanced garlic  butter accompanied by crispy, rich scalloped potatoes. After that combination,  just OK carrots and green beans and rice were terribly tame.  </P> <P> La Cafe is such a well-run restaurant that on more than one occasion the  server, sensing that something didn't please me, asked whether I'd like a  replacement. This is an uncommon sensitivity to the diner, which is remarkably  welcome. Unfortunately, the same offer wasn't made at lunch. It's immediately  obvious that a different chef cooks during the day, because nothing really came  to life.  </P> <P> Crab cakes and stuffed mushrooms were dull, veal with scallions and shiitake  mushrooms failed to taste of the promised ginger, and warm honey chicken salad  was a bust. A uniform mound of frisee lettuce (with a fine, light dressing) had  been topped with pieces of overcooked white meat chicken drizzled with a  slightly sweet, tasteless syrup. The exception was linguine with a fresh  tomato, white onion and scallion sauce.  </P> <P> Let's not forget desserts. A large, mostly berry shortcake, for instance. It  wasn't a cake in the usual sense, but a thin layer of superb shortcake that had  been copiously topped with fresh strawberries and raspberries and whipped  cream. It was perky and inviting. A tarte tatin was as apple-y and caramelized  as it should have been. A peach cobbler, however, though obviously made of  fresh peaches, was too runny. Only a chocolate eclair didn't have a homemade  feeling to it.  </P> <P> In spite of some unevenness in the kitchen, Le Cafe is a fine quality  restaurant. Not only is the menu varied and most often pleasing, but the  atmosphere is welcoming. I got the feeling that the management really cares  about the diner. (For instance, you are told the prices of the specials so  there are no unpleasant surprises when you get the bill.) And that attitude is  reflected in the decor, which is a surprisingly harmonious combination of  high-tech -- both colorful and metallic -- including a wonderfully whimsically  erector set-like bar and the warmth of a plank floor.  </P> <P> There is a modestly priced wine list with a respectable range of California  bottlings, some under $20. And, typically, there are a few half bottles,  including a clean 1986 Joseph Phelps Sauvignon Blanc at $9.  </P> <P> If I lived near Le Cafe, it could easily become my neighborhood restaurant --  for dinner or a late supper: From 10 p.m. until closing, Le Cafe, which many  know as a well-respected jazz club, serves burgers and other items, including  appetizers, salads and sandwiches.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: chef's pate, $5; mussels, $8.50; blackened New York steak,  $15.50; poached salmon (price varies); tarte tatin, $4.50.  </P> <P>  Le Cafe, 14633 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 986-2662. Open 9 a.m. to 1  a.m. daily. Full bar. Valet parking. Dinner for two, food only, $40-$60.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;17&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;17&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Fort Worth, Texas 76137.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. (BHTI) Model 205A, 205A&hyph;1, 205B, 212, and 412 series helicopters, equipped with a main transmission lower planetary spider (spider), part number (P/N) 412&hyph;040&hyph;785&hyph;101. During recent BHTI fatigue tests, five spiders failed due to structural fatigue. Previously, there was no retirement life established for the spider. However, based on these test results, the FAA proposes to establish a 2,500 hours' time-in-service (TIS) retirement life for this design spider. This condition, if not corrected, could result in fatigue failure of the spider, failure of the main transmission, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved (1) BHTI Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) 205&hyph;93&hyph;54, dated June 18, 1993, applicable to Model 205A&hyph;1 helicopters; (2) ASB 205B&hyph;93&hyph;16, dated June 18, 1993, applicable to Model 205B helicopters; (3) ASB 212&hyph;93&hyph;83, dated June 18, 1993, applicable to Model 212 helicopters; and (4) ASB 412&hyph;93&hyph;72, Revision A, dated June 18, 1993, applicable to Model 412 helicopters. These ASBs describe procedures for the removal, retirement, and replacement of certain spiders when they reach 2,500 hours' TIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require removal and replacement of spiders with less than 2,400 hours' TIS, prior to or upon attaining 2,500 hours' TIS or, for spiders with 2,400 hours' or more TIS, within the next 100 hours' TIS. This AD also establishes a retirement life of 2,500 hours' TIS. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 40 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 26 workhours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per workhour. Required parts would cost approximately $8,929 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $414,360.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PHOENIX INSTALLS DEVICE TO TRAP POISON GASES; LACKS REGULATORS' OK  </P> <P> Without obtaining permission from local air-pollution officials, Phoenix  Research Corp. on Wednesday began installing a pollution-control device that  company officials claim will prevent the deadly gases they manufacture from  leaking from their La Mesa plant.  </P> <P> Phoenix President Randall Kelley said installation of a $250,000, 40-foot high  "scrubber" -- essentially a high-tech smokestack designed to catch arsine and  phosphine gases before they reach the atmosphere -- began Wednesday and is  expected to be completed by May 31, the date the company had promised La Mesa  city officials it would have a back-up safety system in place.  </P> <P> But use of the scrubber has yet to be approved by the Air Pollution Control  District, and the company's decision to install the device once again puts  Phoenix at odds with the agency in charge of regulating local air quality.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Violation of District's Rules'  </P> <P> "Installation of any air-pollution control equipment requires an  authority-to-construct permit from the air-pollution control district," said  APCD spokeswoman Lynn Eldred. "At this time, Phoenix Research does not have  such a permit. Installation of the scrubber . . . would be a violation of the  district's rules and regulations."  </P> <P> A Phoenix spokesman, however, said the company tried to meet with APCD  officials recently but was told they were too busy to talk about the scrubber.  </P> <P> "We had one meeting with them, and there was the press of other matters and  they couldn't deal with us at the present time," said Jim Secor, director of  communications for Union Carbide's Linde Division, which owns Phoenix.  </P> <P> One environmentalist said Wednesday that installation of the scrubber is  "little comfort" because the expensive device won't stop the escape of arsine  or phosphine during an earthquake or an explosion.  </P> <P> "Phoenix Research has tried to make it seem like the scrubber is the only  safety feature that was needed, but it is far and away not the only safety  feature that is needed," said Diane Takvorian, executive director of the  nonprofit Environmental Health Coalition. "The relocation of the facility is  what's needed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Announcement After Protests  </P> <P> Phoenix's announcement Wednesday came barely seven months before the  beleaguered company has promised to leave its plant at 8075 Alvarado Road for a  new home near Kingman, Ariz. The move was announced earlier this year after a  new round of community protests erupted over the presence of the manufacturer  of the deadly gas.  </P> <P> The company makes arsine and phosphine, both acutely toxic and used in the  semiconductor industry to alter the electrical characteristics of such  materials as silicon. County records show that, at any given time, the La Mesa  facility can have as much as 2,250 pounds of pure arsine on hand in several  large cylinders.  </P> <P> Federal limits for exposure to the gases are extremely low -- 0.3 parts per  million (p.p.m.) for phosphine and 0.05 p.p.m. for arsine. A whiff of 500  p.p.m. of arsine causes instant death by freezing the hemoglobin in the red  blood cells.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uncovered by Times Story  </P> <P> Despite the toxicity of the gases, Phoenix operated in relative obscurity until  a Times article about the company in 1985 stirred the ire of La Mesa residents  and public officials, who demanded that Phoenix leave its location near the  Grossmont Shopping Center, other businesses and several residential  subdivisions.  </P> <P> In 1986, the APCD ordered the Phoenix plant shut because it posed a potential  health hazard, lacking adequate pollution-control devices in the event of a  leak. Although the company successfully stalled the shutdown in court, it  developed the scrubber that workers began installing Wednesday.  </P> <P> Kelley said tests of the scrubber, which cost at least $250,000 to develop and  will be moved to the new Phoenix facility in Arizona, showed the device is  99.99% effective in removing up to 140 pounds of arsine or phosphine, should  that amount be accidentally released through the company's exhaust system. That  amount is contained in a cylinder and is the maximum amount handled by Phoenix  employees at any one time, Kelley said.  </P> <P> The APCD, however, has yet to determine how effective the scrubber will be,  said spokeswoman Lynn Eldred. Although personnel from the pollution control  agency were invited to witness the two field tests, they are still sifting  through scientific data, she said.  </P> <P> And Takvorian, whose organization has helped organize community pressure on  Phoenix, said Wednesday that the scrubber won't be any good in a number of  disaster scenarios.  </P> <P> "If a cylinder falls off a truck, if there is an explosion in the building that  is going to blow out a wall, it's not going to take care of arsine gas,"  Takvorian said. "If there is an earthquake, which creates a hole in the  building, the scrubber is not going to take care of that."  </P></p>

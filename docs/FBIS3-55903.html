			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Consultations between the heads of Latvian and  Russian delegations on the withdrawal of the Russian Army from  the territory of the Republic of Latvia began at the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs at 1000. An hour long break was announced at  1100, and our correspondent Janis Podins used this opportunity  and asked to the microphone a member of the Latvian delegation,  a deputy to the Fifth Saeima, Ilga Grava.    [Begin recording] [Podins] Taking into account yesterday's  incident, what was the first hour of the talks with the Russian  delegation like?    [Grava] Taking into account all that has happened, it should  be said that the first hour of the talks was very normal. We  both gave our apologies and some analysis of what has happened.  The Russian side already understands that thing very well.  They repeated once again their assessment, understanding that  that was a provocation and in no way blaming the Latvian  Government, nor blaming the delegation, nor Latvia as a state,  but stressing again that that was a provocation and just  reminded us that such provocations complicate not only relations  between Russia and Latvia -- if we have no agreements at the  moment which govern these relations -- but we also have to  understand that relations between Russia and Latvia also  determine relations between Latvia and other states, and that  such [sentence incomplete as heard].    Well, they assessed (?everything) in a very normal way and  we  have now their agreement [words indistinct] and we will continue  our work.    [Podins] And what new is, nevertheless, in the stance of the  Latvian delegation? And whether Russia accepts it?    [Grava] We have not spoken yet a single word about the  agreement, timescale, nor about anything else. Mr. Virsis said  -- 31 August. Russia said with such a bit of sarcasm that it  has really had to wait until the middle of January to come to  this conclusion, [word indistinct] also understood that we have  to accept that.

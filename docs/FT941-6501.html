			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Agfa-Gevaert in link with Daiei Daiei, Japan's largest supermarket chain, has linked with Agfa-Gevaert, the German photographic film maker, in an attempt to break into Japan's tightly held film market with an inexpensive German-made product branded under its own name, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. The film will retail at a 60 per cent discount to average photographic film prices, said a Daiei spokesman. On the strength of this the company Daiei is planning to achieve a market share of around a 3 per cent in the first year. Currently, the Japanese photographic film market is dominated by Fuji, with a 70 per cent share, followed by Kodak and Konika with just under 30 per cent combined, and Agfa-Gevaert with less than 1 per cent.</p>

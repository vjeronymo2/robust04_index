			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Cork Gully appointed as receivers at Astra Holdings ASTRA Holdings, the munitions and fireworks company, was put into receivership yesterday. Astra, which is being investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry and had a brush with the Iraqi supergun affair via a disastrous Belgian acquisition, owes Pounds 50m to five banks. They could not agree on a restructuring of that debt and receivers from Cork Gully were appointed yesterday to the parent company, but not to the main operating companies in the US and UK. The Pounds 50m facility was supposed to have been extended until June. It is understood that the banks, led by First National Bank of Boston, initially disagreed about calling in receivers, but all signed the document. Mr Roy Barber, chairman, and Mr Tony McCann, chief executive, have spent nearly two years sorting through the wreckage of a company which had accrued Pounds 80m losses. Its annual sales are little more than that. Mr McCann said: 'The five operating companies had all been brought back into profit before interest payments. The pain of restructuring in bringing the debt down to a realistic level would have been less than through this type of action.' The Pounds 50m syndicated loan dates back to 1988. It was organised by the Bank of Boston and also involved Midland Bank and Hill Samuel. It followed Astra's purchase of a British company called BMARC for Pounds 60m, twice the amount raised in an associated rights issue. Although Astra defaulted on the loan early in 1989, no mention of this was made in a rights issue document that summer. The main reason for the Pounds 36m issue was to fund the purchase of PRB, a Belgian munitions company, but about a third of the proceeds went towards reducing bank borrowing and strengthening Astra's assets. PRB has since collapsed and has never been included in Astra's profit and loss account. Another problem with the 1989 rights issue, which has been the focus of the DTI inquiry, was that the forecast profit increase failed to materialise. Indeed money was lost during the period of the issue in which the money was raised. Five directors resigned from the board after the troubles emerged. As a separate matter, Mr Christopher Gumbly, the former managing director, was convicted of corruptly giving a car to a Ministry of Defence official. Its share price was suspended at 3 1/4 p yesterday, giving the company a market value of about Pounds 3m.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAF SAYS U.S. EVIDENCE MAY LINK JEFFERIES TO ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTIONS  </P> <P> Lawyers in the GAF Corp. stock manipulation trial disclosed Wednesday that the  government has evidence that Jefferies Group Inc., a Los Angeles-based  securities firm, may have made illegal campaign contributions to members of  Congress.  </P> <P> Arthur L. Liman, GAF's lead attorney, made the disclosure in U.S. District  Court in Manhattan with jurors absent from the courtroom. Liman mentioned the  possible violations during a discussion about the admissibility of evidence in  the trial.  </P> <P> One source said the contributions were made primarily to several U.S. senators.  Lawyers said additional details about the contributions may come out in  testimony today.  </P> <P> In other developments, lawyers for GAF Corp. and its vice chairman asked U.S.  District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe to declare a mistrial in the case, claiming  that the government was too slow in turning over documents needed by the  defense.  </P> <P> The judge didn't issue a ruling, however, and the criminal trial is due to  resume today with the government's star witness, former Jefferies Group  Chairman Boyd L. Jefferies, still on the stand. Discussions about the documents  took place in closed meetings in the judge's chambers but are believed to  relate to Securities and Exchange Commission documents only recently turned  over to the defense. Some of them detail discussions between SEC officials and  Jefferies' lawyers.  </P> <P> GAF and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, are accused of hiring Jefferies  &amp; Co., the main brokerage unit of Jefferies Group, to bid up the price of  Union Carbide Corp. stock in 1986 at a time when GAF was poised to sell a big  block of Carbide shares. Boyd Jefferies has pleaded guilty to two felony counts  and is cooperating with prosecutors while he awaits sentencing.  </P> <P> Lawyers for both sides agreed Wednesday to limit their questioning of Jefferies  about other possible criminal violations of securities laws he may have  committed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANLEY CROUCH'S EAST L.A. COLLEGE ROOTS  </P> <P> In The Times' recent piece on the black writer Stanley Crouch he is quoted as  saying he is "a graduate of no college." I believe that to be true, and I also  believe it to be true, as the quote implies, that Crouch is largely self-taught  and has achieved his present eminence in literary circles as a result of his  own abundant energy and talent.  </P> <P> However, in 1965 and 1966 he completed 29 1/2 units at East Los Angeles  College, including courses in composition, literature, and creative writing.  </P> <P> Of course I don't now what value he places on those courses, but I do know that  we in the English Department recognized and nurtured his talent.  </P> <P> In the 1965 edition of the college literary magazine, Milestone, we published  14 pages of Crouch's poetry, citing him for "consistently high quality in his  portfolio of poems." This had never been done before and has not since.  </P> <P> In addition, Stanley won first and second prize for poetry in our then  semi-annual writing contest and wrote the introduction to that edition of  Milestone, a still-impressive and lovely affirmation of the artist's role in  contemporary society.  </P> <P> SAFFORD CHAMBERLAIN  </P> <P> Associate Professor of English (retired)  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Lime Street turns sour for Names: The plight of investors introduced by the agency MR GEORGE Pakozdi chuckles about his most recent demand for Pounds 300,000 from Lloyd's of London. 'It might as well be Pounds 3m,' he says. 'I went through a period when I couldn't laugh, but you can't cry all the time. They can only shoot me once.' Mr Pakozdi, a dentist living in Toronto, far from the ancient traditions of the London-based insurance market, is a Name. He is one of hundreds of people who were introduced to Lloyd's through Lime Street Underwriting Agencies, a company which is now insolvent and whose creditors will meet today to vote on winding it up. The lessons of Lime Street - named after the address of Lloyd's itself  - are not necessarily typical of how Lloyd's worked during the 1980s, but they illustrate how badly things could go wrong. From its headquarters in a restored house in Houndsditch, on the edge of the City, Lime Street recruited about 450 Names with nearly Pounds 200m in assets. It acted as a members' agency by enrolling them in syndicates - groups of Names that underwrite insurance contracts. Lime Street Names now constitute a significant proportion of applications to the Lloyd's hardship committee, which is considering the cases of individuals without the assets to pay their obligations. Many were enrolled in syndicates such as Gooda Walker 290 and 387 and Feltrim 540, which are among the syndicates with the largest losses. Lime Street Names comprise more than 70 per cent of all those on the 387 syndicate for 1989. The history of Lime Street begins in 1976, when Mr Robin Kingsley, a Name and a broker, branched out on his own. He created two members' agencies, Lime Street Underwriting Agencies and Kingsley Carritt Underwriting Agencies, which later merged. A relation said: 'Robin wanted more than anything to be a Name. Lloyd's was a god, a religion, an obsession to him.' One underwriting agent who always avoided doing business with Mr Kingsley said: 'He looked very sleek, with a double-breasted suit and a tan. He drove a Rolls-Royce from a very early age. I'm sure he had friends, but I never liked him.' He recalled an occasion when many syndicates were losing money in the 1960s. Mr Kingsley had earned a profit from his own syndicates. 'Robin walked past me, stopped, pulled out a cheque, showed me the amount and gloated.' Mr Kingsley specialised in excess-of-loss (XoL) and London market excess (LMX) syndicates, which write reinsurance business - taking on risk from syndicates seeking cover against catastrophic events. Reinsuring syndicates normally reinsure their own risk with other LMX syn-dicates. The theory was that any catastrophe which caused big losses on XoL syndicates would lead underwriters to push up premiums, allowing syndicates to achieve high rates of profitability. Mr Kingsley was a pioneer of personal stop-loss insurance, an equivalent of reinsurance for individual Names. The 1973 Finance Act made premiums for personal stop-loss tax deductible. Mr Kingsley ran a substantial recruitment campaign to attract Names. Like his father, he was a keen tennis player and a member of the All England Lawn Tennis Club at Wimbledon. He persuaded players including Mark Cox and Buster Mottram to join. He also found people whose financial position was more precarious, however. One London antiques dealer who had known him as a regular customer for more than 15 years said that when he bought his house - his only significant asset - and while he was still committed to substantial school fees, Mr Kingsley increased pressure on him to become a Name. The dealer obtained a valuation on his house of Pounds 298,000, and then went to a building society which provided the Pounds 100,000 guarantee Lloyd's required. This Name joined in 1988, never made a profit and estimates his losses to date are more than Pounds 400,000. He said: 'When we asked about the effect of a big disaster, Kingsley would say: 'This will only cost you a gin and tonic.' He did of course say we could lose everything, but it was always played down.' He says he did not read documents sent to him by Mr Kingsley once he had joined. 'I know it sounds pretty stupid, but we didn't understand anything. As far as we were concerned it was a respectable organisation, and we had known him for so long.' Until the regulations were changed to forbid the practice in the late 1980s, Mr Kingsley offered Names commission if they found new recruits. Many members of his own family also became Names. In the early 1980s he began what Mr Pakozdi calls 'annual pilgrimages' to the US and Canada. On his first trips he flew economy class. By last year he was planning to go by Concorde - but the trip was cancelled when Lime Street ran into financial difficulties. In Toronto he recruited a dentist and paid him a small sum to arrange regular meetings with prospective Names, including fellow dentists (like Mr Pakozdi), doctors, accountants, lawyers and business people. The dentist's savings were wiped out in losses from his syndicates and, at 70, he has had to come out of retirement and resume his practice. Mr Pakozdi says Mr Kingsley's gatherings were 'very professionally done. He paid for the bills. Well, I guess we really did in the end. The bill came a year later. The food wasn't that good.' Existing Names were also encouraged by Mr Kingsley to increase their capacity - the amount of money they pledge to different syndicates. 'It was not a question of whether you wanted to increase your capacity, but by how much,' says Mr Pakozdi. 'He would say rates (premiums) are hardening (increasing) - it's a fantastic time to take advantage - strike while the iron is hot.' Some Names were persuaded by the apparent ease of making their assets (often their house) work twice for them at a time when they needed extra income. Mr Kingsley offered expertise, a spread of syndicates, personal stop-loss insurance and the fact that the syndicates were reinsured. He was also a member of many of the syndicates himself. For many Names there was the advantage of being able to write off losses against tax. Some were comforted by the prestige and tradition of Lloyd's. All were impressed by figures showing profits stretching back over seven years made on typical syndicates. Many Lime Street Names never saw profits. Most were caught unawares in 1990 when they discovered the enormous losses for 1988 and estimates for 1989. The demands for money have started to exceeded the upper limit of reimbursement allowed under their stop-loss policies. Some could not afford the costs of resignation - Pounds 250 plus VAT per syndicate and other bills to the corporation and members' agents - let alone contemplate legal action. Others continued to underwrite on the brink of bankruptcy, hoping that one more year would bring recovery. Mr Colin Francis, who made money as a landlord and lost it through Lloyd's, said: 'It was a mixture of flattery and greed. I was turned into a docile fool by the mystique of Lloyd's' He says he is technically bankrupt, has had to rent out his Kensington house and is living with friends in north London. Names recruited by Mr Kingsley claimed they asked to be put on low-risk syndicates and said they never understood the high risks of the syndicates on which they were being placed. Some said instructions to be moved to less risky syndicates were ignored. But they have little written evidence to back their case. Mr Francis said: 'Everything with Mr Kingsley was done over a glass of wine or lunch.' Mr Kingsley refused to comment on the detailed complaints made by his Names. Earlier this week he said simply: 'People have totally different conceptions of high risk when they lose money.' The Names feel the regulation conducted by the Lloyd's Corporation has let them down, and have written documenting their complaints against Mr Kingsley and his companies. But Lloyd's will not even say whether an investigation is under way.</p>

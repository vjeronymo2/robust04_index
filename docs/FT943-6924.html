			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Israeli rabbis tour Hebron's Tomb of the Patriarchs Israel's two chief rabbis, Ashkenazi Rabbi Yisrael Lau (right) and Sephardic Rabbi Eliahu Bakshi-Doron (left) surrounded by Israeli army and border police officers as they tour the grounds of the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron yesterday, six months to the day after the massacre of 30 Palestinians by an American-born Jewish settler, Baruch Goldstein. The incident touched off months of bloodshed and disrupted the Middle East peace process. The tomb, holy to both Jews and Moslems, has been closed since the massacre. Both are demanding the site be re-opened. Hebron is one of the most tense spots in the Israeli-controlled West Bank, as home to about 80,000 Palestinians as well as a Jewish enclave of 450.</p>

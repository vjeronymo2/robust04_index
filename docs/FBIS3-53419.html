The 15 December clash took place during an attack by members  of a monafeqin splinter group, who call themselves the Execution  Squad, at the monafeqin's central garrison in Dayr in southeast  Iraq. A group of Kurds also assisted in the attack against the  three-story command post.    A former member of the monafeqin group who fled to Jordan  said on Saturday: The attack took place at 0530 [0100 GMT] on  15 December. The target was the operations control center of  the monafeqin in Basra and the headquarters of Mehdi  Abrishamchi, former husband of Maryan 'Azodanlu, third wife of  monafeqin leader Mas'ud Rajavi. During the attack, seven  missiles were fired at the building and five leaders of the  terrorist group were killed on the spot.    A former member of the monafeqin group, who says he deserted  because of the group's spying and terrorist activities, listed  the dead as follows: Mas'ud Mazlumi from Tehran, vice chairman  of the monafeqin's executive committee and one of the commanders  of the group's terrorist squad; Sadiqeh Ebrahimi from Tehran,  member of the so-called executive committee and one of the  leaders of the group's terrorist squad; Ahmad Afshar from  Mashhad, member of the so-called executive committee and one of  the main elements of the group's terrorist squad; Adham Tayyebi  from Tehran, the head of the organization's institutions and  commander of the terrorist group; and Zahra Hosnipur "Hoseynpur"  from Tehran, member of the executive committee and a head of the  terrorist squad.    The former member said: After the victory of the Islamic  revolution, these five people were directly involved in  terrorist attacks on farmers living in border regions.    According to Kurdish sources in northern Iraq, the attackers  were members of a splinter group that had deserted the main  group long ago in a bid to flee Iraq and was in hiding. They  gained the support of Kurds who oppose the presence of the  monafeqin in Iraq for the attack on the monafeqin headquarters.  The Kurds regard the monafeqin as Ba'thist agents and overtly  threaten to take revenge.</p>

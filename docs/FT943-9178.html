			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Losses widen at Unit Group Losses at Unit Group, the USM-quoted pallet maker, widened from Pounds 388,000 to Pounds 1.66m in the year to end-March. The deficit was split between trading losses of Pounds 1.07m, and closure and reorganisation costs of Pounds 580,000. During the year the company consolidated operations on a single site at Golborne, Warrington. Turnover fell from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 16.8m. At the end of May, Unit raised Pounds 1.26m before expenses through a subscription and rights issue which, together with the sale of a former engineering site, helped cut gearing from 135 per cent to 34 per cent. Mr John Adams, chairman, said: 'The group is now operating comfortably within its existing banking facilities. 'The immediate priorities are to achieve a further reduction in operating costs, improve production efficiency and recover increased timber costs by price increases.' Losses per share were 29.8p (6.3p) and again no dividend is proposed.</p>

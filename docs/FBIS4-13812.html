			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin left for an official  four-day visit to Moscow several minutes ago. Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres, who together with the rest of the cabinet  ministers accompanied Rabin to his flight, said that very  intensive negotiations with the Palestinians were expected this  week. If everything went well, Peres said, the negotiations may  be concluded this week. If this does not turn out to be the  case, the foreign minister added, we will have to find ways to  accelerate the talks. This was reported by our correspondent  Yariv Ben-Yehuda from Ben-Gurion airport.</p>

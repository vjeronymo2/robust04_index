			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour plans to end age discrimination at work THE Labour party's manifesto, to be announced tomorrow, will contain a commitment to outlaw age discrimination at work. This legislation would stand alongside the existing laws on race and sex discrimination. The measure would make it illegal to specify age in job advertisements or to select people for redundancy on the basis of age (as opposed to length of service). It would also make it illegal for government programmes to discriminate against the over-50s as does the Employment Training scheme, which gives priority to younger workers. Party leaders would offer nothing more than a broad commendation of the manifesto last night after a three and a half hour joint shadow cabinet and national executive committee meeting finalised the document in time for tomorrow's launch. Mr Jack Cunningham, the party's campaign co-ordinator, commented only that the 10,000-word manifesto would contain 'fresh ideas and some surprises.' He added that together with the shadow budget unveiled yesterday it would constitute a formidable launch pad for a Labour election victory. Supporters of such legislation argue that one worker in three will be over 40 by the end of the decade, yet older workers are widely discriminated against and increasingly used as a reserve army of labour pulled into employment in boom and jettisoned in recession. Well over a third of all unemployed over-50s have been out of work for more than one year - a far higher proportion than in other age groups. Labour policy makers argue that legislation could cut that number significantly. They also claim that nearly 40 per cent of all job advertisements discriminate on grounds of age. Most employer bodies acknowledge that there is some unjustified prejudice against employing older people, although some employers, including retailers B&amp;Q and Tesco, have special recruitment drives for older people. The US has outlawed age discrimination since 1967 but the UK's Conservative government has repeatedly opposed legislation. Last month the government announced plans to set up an advisory body to help eliminate age discrimination. Support for the government's voluntarist view has come from the Commons employment committee which examined, and rejected, the case for legislation in 1989. A growing number of big employers, including Unilever, Allied Lyons and BTR, are allowing men to retire at the age of 60, according to MSF, the general technical union. MSF claims there is now a strong pull towards harmonisation 'downward' to 60.</p>

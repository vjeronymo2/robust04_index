It will apparently officially  join this program in the very near future. There is no unanimity  of view among analysts on the question of whether or not Russia  needs this program and what it can provide for it. A great deal  has been discussed in official Ministry of Foreign Affairs  circles and circles close to them about the possible advantages  of membership in this program. I will discuss only those  problems that, in my view, may have serious negative  consequences on the strategic level as a result of Russia's  joining this program.    First of all, it is no secret to anyone that the  "Partnership  for Peace" is an element of the strategy of the United States  and the West with the aim of achieving a phased expansion of  NATO.    The fact that they did not manage to expand NATO in the  present stage by including a number of East European countries  that yearn to get in, hoping to intensify their integration into  the economic structure of the European Community through NATO  membership, is viewed by certain of our analysts as a success of  Russian diplomacy in the first round of the struggle against  NATO expansion.    If we are to make a choice between the "Partnership for  Peace" program and automatic NATO expansion, and movement of the  entire military-political infrastructure of this organization to  Russia's borders, then without a doubt the first alternative is  preferable for Russia. Especially since this leaves the door  formally open--with respect to both this program and NATO itself  in the future--for all, including Russia. It is possible to view  the situation differently, however. After all, the Cold War  ended following the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and collapse  of the Soviet Union, and it would be entirely reasonable to  expect that in the absence of ideological and military-political  confrontation in Europe, and with the beginning of a partnership  (certain documents and statements even make mention of an  "allied") relationship between Russia and the United States,  between Russia and the West, the necessity would disappear of  preserving a military bloc created as a deterrence to  international communism. In addition to this, it should be noted  that in agreeing to the unification of Germany, repudiating the  "Brezhnev Doctrine," and withdrawing from Eastern Europe, the  USSR obtained assurances from the United States and its Western  allies that they would not take advantage of this in filling up  the vacuum created and alter the military-strategic balance in  Europe to their benefit. I think former USSR President Mikhail  Gorbachev could discuss this more substantively and perhaps he  will still do so.    It is entirely evident that there are no external reasons  and  no threat on the part of Russia either for preserving NATO or,  even more so--in circumvention of agreements with the USSR, for  expanding NATO directly or indirectly (through the program  "Partnership for Peace") to Russia's borders. Most likely the  United States and its allies are setting other objectives  through NATO and the "Partnership for Peace" program, proceeding  from their long-range interests. First of all, the Americans  henceforth intend through NATO to maintain and consolidate their  military-political leadership in Europe. Secondly, for a number  of NATO member countries and for those East European countries  that have become candidates for membership in this bloc, joining  the "Partnership" program, the United States presence in NATO,  and the alliance itself constitute a reliable way of keeping a  unified Germany under effective control. Thirdly, the expansion  of NATO--even initially through the "Partnership for  Peace"--does in fact comprise real steps on the part of the NATO  bloc to fill the "power vacuum" left by the USSR, with the aim  of containing and disciplining what is now Russia.    A number of analysts believe that little depends upon Russia  in the situation that has come about. Whether we like it or not,  the process has already begun: More and more signatures are  appearing under the "Partnership" program. Therefore, it only  remains for us to find our place in this process. There are  those who believe that Russia should push others aside and stand  first in line at NATO's doorstep. It is strange that such  judgments are coming from quite serious people--far from  naive--who claim to be strategists in matters of foreign policy.    But in the situation that has developed, where indeed very  little depends on us, we are already unable to stand first in  line at NATO's doorstep. This doorstep is surrounded by the  Romanians, Estonians, Slovaks, and Czechs. Ukrainians, Latvians,  and Lithuanians are also straining to enter. It will be amusing  to see how Russia--still a superpower in the military  sense--will look in such a crowd, where everyone is screaming  about the threat from Russia and therefore desiring to lean on  the powerful shoulder of NATO in a search for guarantees of  territorial sovereignty and security. Whether or not these fears  and hopes are real or invented is a separate question, but  Russia is still capable all the same of securing its territorial  integrity and its own security. It is hardly worth it for us to  knock on NATO's door and join the "Partnership" for the sake of  obtaining dubious support from NATO against the territorial  claims of Estonia against Russia.    If Russia were to immediately enter NATO as a full-fledged  member and this organization were to become a universal  structure guaranteeing security in Europe, only a madman would  fail to support such a development of events. But under  conditions where NATO sets the terms, where the bloc itself  determines the schedule for entry of "Partnership for Peace"  program members, hardly anyone can harbor illusions as to how  long the period of Russia's "candidacy" for NATO membership will  be and under what conditions entry will be arranged.    Those analysts are entirely correct who say that in not  joining the "Partnership for Peace" program, and subsequently  NATO, we are dooming ourselves to strategic isolation. But it is  also true that having agreed to participate in the "Partnership  for Peace" program, with preservation of the NATO bloc which  decides who, when, and how one may become a full-fledged member,  we find ourselves in isolation here as well. Russia can hardly  be the same kind of candidate as Estonia and Poland, for  example, and Russia hardly has the same obligations and  responsibilities for peace and security before the world  community as do those countries that have today swarmed all  around NATO's door. In the face of myriad problems in both the  near and far abroad, Russia cannot be on a short leash held by  NATO when its national interests may require one decision or  another to be made in some part of the world which does not  coincide with the view of the NATO bloc, the United States, or  its colleagues in the "Partnership for Peace." Thus Russia's  entry into the "Partnership for Peace" program could give the  illusion of the breaching of possible isolation, but will become  a far more serious factor, facilitating the weakening of its  position and leading to real, not imaginary, isolation.    The attitude of the country's leadership with respect to the  issue of Russia's entry into the "Partnership for Peace" program  is ambiguous. At his January summit meeting with the U.S.  President, Boris Yeltsin noted that Russia does not view the  establishment of European security through the "Partnership for  Peace" program as a one and only opportunity, although it does  not oppose it either. One would think the president's message to  the Federal Assembly would contain great definitiveness on this  key issue in the development of Russia's strategic course in the  foreign policy sphere. However, internal foreign policy  contradictions within the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign  Affairs are unfortunately reflected in this document as well. On  the one hand, the president's message mentions Russia's support  for the "Partnership for Peace" program, although in the opinion  of U.S. and NATO strategists the program should become a  mechanism for gradually turning NATO into the single universal  mechanism for guaranteeing security both inside and outside  Europe. On the other hand, it is proposed to make the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) the main instrument of  European construction in the military-political sphere. Added to  this as one of the goals of Russia's foreign policy is the  affording of cross guarantees to the countries of Central Europe  on the part of Russia and its West European partners. Clearly,  both ends do not meet here. Until quite recently Western  strategists, advocating the automatic expansion of NATO by  virtue of the East European countries, or at least achievement  of the same objectives through the "Partnership for Peace"  program, believed that adoption of the concept of cross  guarantees for the countries of East Europe on the part of  Russia and its West European partners would be a strategic  victory for Russia. It must be said, however, that it is this  very concept that supported the decisions according to which the  USSR agreed to the unification of Germany and repudiated the  "Brezhnev Doctrine." But while we have been talking about cross  guarantees for the countries of Central Europe, the latter have  already entered NATO's waiting room. The same is true of our aim  to turn the NACC into the main instrument of support for peace  and security in Europe. First of all, within the framework of  the NACC too we are in fact joining as a single entity, without  allies. Secondly, it is our former Warsaw Pact allies, now NACC  members, that are longing to join NATO, and it does not depend  on us as to how quickly and effectively the NACC can be turned  into an instrument of European security.    Thus in joining the "Partnership for Peace" program, the  Central European countries view themselves as candidates for  NATO membership, and the question of cross guarantees loses its  meaning for them to a significant degree. If Russia joins the  "Partnership for Peace" program, we will in fact be giving the  green light to turning NATO into the military-political  instrument for construction of a new Europe.    In conclusion, I would like to sum up all the potential  negative consequences for Russia should the "Partnership for  Peace" program be implemented.    First. Historically, NATO emerged as a specific  military-political bloc directed against the Soviet Union. The  problem of its expansion lies in the danger that Russia will be  strategically isolated. We must not ignore even the theoretical  possibility of creation of a "cordon sanitaire" between Europe  and Russia and the threat of excluding Russia from Europe.    Second. It would hardly be advisable to convert this  regional  organization, created to accomplish quite specific missions, to  a universal instrument of security and conflict regulation  throughout Eurasia.    Third. The proposed concept fails to stipulate any temporary  framework for a transition period. A state such as Russia cannot  be waiting in the entrance hall while extremely important  decisions are made on matters key to its security.    Fourth. Whether the authors like it or not, this concept  includes an objective attempt to block the process of  military-political consolidation of the space of the former  Soviet Union.    Fifth. Entry of the countries of Central Europe and former  USSR republics into the "Partnership for Peace" program, with  their subsequent passage into NATO, would push Russia out of the  arms market with respect to these countries and thereby inflict  a serious blow to our military-industrial complex.    Sixth. The inclusion of Russia within NATO (even in the  long-range scenario) will in fact lead to conversion of our  country into an outpost of this bloc organization along the  border with the Islamic world and China. It is difficult to  imagine American soldiers undertaking to defend this border the  same way they once defended the border between the FRG and GDR.  And so, Russia will find its hands tied, its room for maneuver  restricted.    Skepticism that NATO can be an effective instrument for  guaranteeing security and resolving conflicts is confirmed by  the events in Bosnia. Clearly, Russia was hasty in agreeing to  the change in NATO functions. Recent events have shown that in  imprudently extending a mandate of broad authority to the UN  secretary general so that he could entrust the conduct of  peacemaking operations to the NATO Council, Russia, by the will  of its gullible (the one defect Marx considered excusable)  diplomats, denied itself the right of veto. So the NATO Council  made decisions and presented ultimatums, without regard to the  view and position of Russia. Without a full-fledged vote in the  NATO Council, Russia will hardly be able to influence the  decisions of this organization in the future on matters possibly  far more important to it than Bosnia. It is a good thing that  President Yeltsin exercised initiative at the last minute with  respect to untangling the Bosnian crisis and rescued the Russian  diplomats who had brought matters to the point where NATO was  openly ignoring Russia's position and preparing to inflict  strikes against the Serbs. Surely it would be advisable to  perfect the mechanisms of the CSCE--specially created as a  guarantor of peace and order throughout the European continent.  But prior to that--the countries of East Europe should be given  joint guarantees by Russia and the United States (or NATO).</p>

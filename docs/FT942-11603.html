			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Takeover of Swans backed by MPs A takeover of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, by French-owned Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie would create a world force in the shipbuilding market, two Tyneside MPs said yesterday after visiting CMN's Cherbourg yard, Chris Tighe writes. Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, and Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East, said Swan Hunter and CMN had complementary skills and facilities. Senior management of Triacorp, CMN's parent company, believed the acquisition of a British shipyard by CMN, creating an Anglo-French consortium, would be advantageous, especially in securing work in the Middle East. But Mr Byers said CMN's expertise in the construction of composite hulls, used in minehunters, could pose real competition for Southampton-based Vosper Thornycroft if such a consortium were created. Some MPs have questioned CMN's financial stability, but Mr Byers said Triacorp directors had fully answered the questions raised. He said he had been impressed at the way Triacorp had turned around CMN since acquiring it in 1990. The yard, he said, was full to capacity.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Keating's Mission to Asia"] </F>   [Text] After the black comedy of Mr Keating's mad  squabble with the Vietnam veterans, readers will be relieved to  hear that there was a serious purpose to the Prime Minister's  visit to Thailand, Laos and Vietnam and that, by all accounts,  it went quite well.    The excuse for the trip was the opening of the Friendship  Bridge over the Mekong River on the border of Thailand and Laos.    The real purpose, however, was to further strengthen  Australia's relations with two of the most important nations in  the region.    In Australia, the political focus naturally has been on the  Vietnamese part of the trip because Vietnam is the flavour of  the month, because of the row with the veterans and because this  is the first visit by an Australian Prime Minister since the war.    However, that should not be allowed to overshadow the  importance of the visit to Thailand. By far the biggest economy  on Mr. Keating's itinerary, Thailand is also of growing  strategic and diplomatic importance to Australia.    Economically, diplomatically and militarily, Thailand is a  major player in ASEAN and a friendly rival of ASEAN's other  major players, Indonesia and Malaysia.    For Australia, that makes Thailand a particularly important  friend. The Thais' shrewd and predictable diplomacy and their  distance from Australia mean that Australian-Thai relations tend  to be more stable than our relations with Malaysia and  Indonesia. (Curiously, distance does seem to be an important  factor; for example, Thailand's human rights lapses seem to  attract less attention here than Indonesia's.) At moments of  tension between Australia and Malaysia or Indonesia, the Thais  have interceded on Australia's behalf.    Thailand is a longstanding friend and an alternative  diplomatic and economic "gateway" to the region, always ready to  accept Australian investment and trade if other countries are  not so inclined. That, undoubtedly, has a calming effect on  Australia's relations with its more volatile ASEAN neighbours.    With its well-developed defence forces (including  significant  naval forces) and its borders with Cambodia and Laos, Thailand  is also an important player in the development of Cambodia and  Indo-China.    Vietnam's importance is more strategic than economic.    Indeed, for all the country's recent growth and long-term  potential, it will be a small, poor economy for many years to  come.    Strategically, however, it is of enormous potential  importance in the region, mainly because of its large and  well-educated population and its border with China.    The Chinese are paranoid about Vietnam, which is why they  spent a fortune to support the Khmer Rouge on Vietnam's  south-western flank.    The central objective of Western policy towards Vietnam must  be the country's successful economic and political integration  into the international community.    Vietnam needs massive infusions of capital and technology to  rebuild and expand its basic infrastructure (which is  insufficient for even its current needs), to develop its rich  natural resources and to create employment in labour-intensive  manufacturing.    The Vietnamese Communist Party is terrified of the kind of  political instability that has plagued Eastern Europe, and with  good reason. Vietnam's young population (the median age is 19)  means that the labour force is growing at a rate of 1 million a  year. The rationalisation of inefficient State-owned industries  means that jobs will be scarce for a good while yet.    Australia's policy is both to contribute to Vietnam's  development and to share in it.    As aid projects, Mr Keating's proposed high-profile projects  -- including a $100 million bridge over the Mekong River and the  preservation of Hanoi's historic architecture -- sound as  questionable as the Hawke Government's Friendship Bridge that  Mr. Keating went to Asia to open.    However, Mr Keating obviously expects the political and  economic benefits to Australia of the projects (in terms of  goodwill and access of Australian companies to the increasingly  competitive Vietnamese market) will make up for any shortfall in  their economic or social value to the Vietnamese people.    Of course, other countries are also trying to share in the  Vietnamese revival. Mr Keating was the sixth leader and the  14th senior politician to visit Vietnam in a month.    For that reason, the importance to the Vietnamese of Mr.  Keating's visit and offer of aid should not be overestimated.    Nevertheless, they undoubtedly represent a significant,  positive step in the development of Australian-Vietnamese  relations.</p>

To Implement the System of Selling Off Foreign Exchange  Receipts to the Banks and Abolish Foreign Exchange Retention  System </H3>   The foreign exchange receipts of all domestic enterprises,  public institutions, government agencies, and social  organizations in China shall be promptly repatriated. Foreign  exchange earnings which fall into the following categories  (except those of foreign investment enterprises) shall all be  sold off to the designated foreign exchange banks for renminbi  based on the exchange rates listed by the banks.    1. Foreign exchange earnings from exports, transit trade and  other trading activities;    2. Foreign exchange earnings from services provided by  communication and transportation, post and telecommunications,  tourism, insurance, and other service industries, and from  inter-governmental transfer;    3. Net foreign exchange proceeds from foreign exchange  operations of the banks, which are required to be turned over to  the State, and foreign exchange returns received from overseas  service contracts, and from investment abroad which are subject  to repatriation; and    4. Other foreign exchange receipts which are required to be  sold off to banks pursuant to the regulations of the exchange  control administration.    Foreign exchange earnings of the following categories are  permitted to be held in foreign exchange in the accounts opened  with the designated foreign exchange banks:    (1) Foreign exchange remittance to China for the purpose of  investment by non-resident legal entities or natural persons;    (2) Foreign exchange received from external borrowing, and  debt or equity issuance;    (3) Funds remitted back to China by the service contracts  companies within the contract period of their overseas projects  for current use of the project;    (4) Receipts from foreign donations and grants approved for  specific purposes;    (5) Foreign exchange receipts of diplomatic missions, and  residence offices of international organizations and other  non-resident legal entities in China; and    (6) Foreign exchange held by individuals.    When payments for domestic expenses occur for the  above-mentioned categories of foreign exchange, they should be  made in renminbi, which can be exchanged at the designated  foreign exchange banks.    All such existing foreign exchange allocation systems as  foreign exchange retention, compulsory turning-over, and quota  control are to be abolished. The current holding of foreign  exchange retention quotas, and the outstanding balance of  foreign exchange accounts, which is excluded from the  above-mentioned categories permitted to be held in foreign  exchange, will be dealt with in accordance with the following  principles:    The holdings of foreign exchange retention quotas will  continue to be valid and can be used based on the official  renminbi exchange rate published on December 31, 1993. The  foreign exchange retention quotas, which are sold off to the  banks before the unification of the exchange rates but of which  book entry is yet to be completed, shall be entered into the  book before January 31, 1994, and are also permitted to use  according to the official exchange rate published on December  31,1993.    The above-mentioned outstanding balance of foreign exchange  accounts, which is excluded from the categories permitted to be  held in foreign exchange, may be maintained under the system of  selling off all foreign exchange receipts to banks, but for such  accounts, only withdrawal is permitted with no more re-deposit  until all funds in the accounts are drawn off. The outstanding  balance of these foreign exchange accounts can be used for  current payments, debt service, and selling off to the banks.  <H3>  II. To Implement the System of Purchasing Foreign Exchange  From the Banks and Make the Renminbi Conditionally Convertible  Under the Current Account </H3>   After introducing the system of purchasing foreign exchange  from the banks, the existing authorization procedure of  allocating foreign exchange according to the State plan for  normal external payment items under the current account is to be  abolished. Foreign exchange needed by domestic enterprises,  public institutions, government agencies, and social  organizations for external payments under the current account  shall be purchased from the designated foreign exchange banks  with renminbi, upon presentation of the following effective  documentation and then the banks make the payment for them.    1. Import quota, licence, or other import authorization  issued by the departments concerned and relevant import contract  for those items subject to import quota or import restrictions;    2. Registration verification and relevant import contract  for those items subject to import voluntary registration;    3. Import contract and notification for payment from  overseas financial institutions for all other import items than  the above two categories, which are in conformity with the State  regulations; and    4. Payment agreement or contract and notification for  payment from overseas financial and non-financial institutions  for commercial payment under the non-trade account.    Purchase of foreign exchange for non-commercial payments or  for withdrawal of foreign currency in cash shall be proceeded in  accordance with the relevant regulations on financial and  foreign exchange control. The authorization procedures shall  continue to be in effect for foreign exchange remittance for  making overseas investment, lending, and donations.    As an interim measure the export enterprises, at the initial  stage of this reform, can open a record-keeping account over the  counter at the designated banks with 50 percent of the total  foreign exchange they sell off to the banks. When they need  foreign exchange for export operations and other supplementary  trading expenses, upon presentation of valid documents as  mentioned above, the banks will sell them the foreign exchange  and make the payment directly if the transaction amount is not  more than the outstanding entitlement as recorded in their  record-keeping accounts. For the payment amount exceeding their  entitlement, the enterprises may also purchase foreign exchange  with renminbi and make the payment at the designated banks, but  upon presenting valid documentation in accordance with the  relevant State regulations.  <H3>  III. To Establish an Inter-bank Foreign Exchange Market and  Improve the Mechanism of Exchange Rate Determination So As To  Maintain a Reasonable and Relatively Stable Renminbi Exchange  Rate </H3>   After the introduction of the systems of selling and buying  foreign exchange at the banks, a national unified inter-bank  foreign exchange market will be established. The designated  foreign exchange banks are main participants in the inter-bank  market whose main functions are to facilitate the matching of  long and short foreign exchange positions of different  designated banks, and to provide clearing and settlement service  for banks. This market is regulated and supervised by the  People's Bank of China through the State Administration of  Exchange Control.    The dual renminbi exchange rates are to be unified as of  January 1, 1994. The unified renminbi exchange rate will become  a single, managed floating rate based on market demand and  supply of foreign exchange. The People's Bank of China will  publish daily the middle rate of renminbi against US dollar  according to the transaction price prevailing in the inter-bank  foreign exchange market on the previous day, and also, with  reference to the changes of the international foreign exchange  market, publish the renminbi rates against other major foreign  currencies. Based on the foreign exchange rates published by  the People's Bank, the designated banks will then list their own  exchange rates within the floating range designated by the  People's Bank, and purchase or sell foreign exchange to their  customers at the listed rates. With the prerequisite of  stabilizing the domestic currency, the listed exchange rates of  different banks are to be maintained basically compatible and  relatively stable through inter-bank foreign exchange trading  and the intervention of the People's Bank through buying and  selling foreign exchange in the foreign exchange market.  <H3>  IV. To Strengthen the Legitimate Operation and Service  Function of the Designated Foreign Exchange Banks </H3>   The source of renminbi funds needed by the designated banks  to conduct foreign exchange trading shall be in principle from  the banks' own capital. The State only implements a  proportional control over the foreign exchange working funds  held by the designated banks, the proportional ratios of each  designated bank are to be determined by the People's Bank based  on the size of its foreign exchange assets and total turnovers  in foreign exchange settlement. If the foreign exchange working  capital holdings of a designated bank exceed the ceiling of its  designated ratio, it must sell the excess to other designated  banks or the People's Bank, if its holdings drop to a level less  than the low limit of the designated ratio, it must buy enough  foreign exchange promptly from other designated banks or the  People's Bank to supplement its holdings.    In order to allow their customers with forward payment  contracts or debt repayment agreements to be protected from the  exchange rate risk, the designated banks may conduct renminbi  hedging business against foreign currencies for their customers  when the valid documents are presented.    All designated banks shall maintain a rational assets and  liabilities structure, and conduct such business activities as  foreign exchange buying and selling, establishment of accounts,  deposit-taking, and loan-making in accordance with the relevant  regulations. The banks are expected to strive for high quality  in customer service, low level of service charges, legitimacy in  business conduct, and honesty in competition.  <H3>  V. Reinforcing the External Debts Administration and  Establishing a Debt Redemption Fund So As To Safeguard China's  International Credibility </H3>   China will continue its current practice of managing  external  borrowing and repayment by centralized planning, financial  authorization, and debt registration. All guarantees issued for  borrowing incurred by nonresident legal entities (including  those overseas institutions and enterprises controlled by  Chinese domestic capitals) shall be in rigorous pursuance to the  Requirements of Providing Foreign Exchange Guaranty by Domestic  Institutions which was promulgated by the State Administration  of Exchange Control.    In order to maintain the international credibility of our  country, the control over the repayment of external debts is to  be reinforced so as to continue with the principle that  repayment should be made by those who incur the debts.  Borrowers are required to intensify the management of those  projects financed by external debts in order to improve the  economic efficiency and capability of foreign exchange earnings  of the projects. The State encourages and supports those local  authorities, departments concerned, and heavily indebted  enterprises to establish redemption funds in proportion to their  total debt outstanding. Such redemption funds are permitted to  be deposited in the special foreign exchange accounts opened  with designated foreign exchange banks. Foreign exchange  receipts from designated exports specially authorized by the  State and earmarked for debt repayments can be credited directly  to the special accounts. Funds in such special accounts may  only be used for external debt service, and are forbidden to be  transferred or used for other payments.    The debt service payments shall be made from borrower's  special accounts opened for redemption funds. If borrowers are  inflicted with repayment difficulties, subject to review and  authorization by the foreign exchange control administration,  they may purchase foreign exchange with renminbi at the  designated foreign exchange banks, upon presenting certificates  of debt registration and debt service authorization in  accordance with the borrowing agreement, so as to make the  repayment. In the case that the borrowers intend to make the  repayment prior to the maturity date as provided by in the  borrowing agreements, such repayment is subject to the approval  of the foreign exchange control administration according to the  relevant regulations. No bank is permitted to make repayment  transactions without proper authorization for those unregistered  external obligations, or for those obligations incurred by  unauthorized issuance of debt guarantees to non-resident legal  entities by the domestic institutions.    As for those foreign exchange loans made by domestic  financial institutions, repayments may be made by borrowers  directly from their foreign exchange receipts, or with the  foreign exchange that they purchase using renminbi at the  designated banks pursuant to the loan agreements. Under the new  system, loans made by domestic financial institutions using  funds from their overseas borrowing and from collecting foreign  currency deposits will continue to follow the practice that  repayment of foreign exchange loans is to be made in foreign  exchange, and the process of repayment are those as described  above.  <H3>  VI. To Maintain the Current Foreign Exchange Administration  for Enterprises With Foreign Investment </H3>   The enterprises with foreign investment can still keep their  foreign exchange accounts with either the foreign exchange  designated banks or foreign banks in China. In cases that the  external payments of these enterprises are within the scope  authorized by the State regulation, and that it is to service  the foreign exchange debts incurred with domestic financial  institutions, these enterprises may make the payments from the  outstanding balances of their foreign exchange accounts  directly. If these enterprises, for the purpose of production,  operation, debt service, and profit and dividend remittance,  need more foreign exchange than the outstanding balance of their  foreign exchange account, after being reviewed and approved by  the State foreign exchange administrative departments according  to the documents and contracts authorized by the government  agencies concerned, they may also purchase foreign exchange from  the designated banks.  <H3>  VII. To Cease Domestic Pricing and Settlements in Foreign  Currency and Prohibit Foreign Currency Circulation in China </H3>   As of January 1, 1994, any type of domestic pricing and  settlements in foreign currency shall be ceased, and foreign  currency circulation and trading of foreign currencies outside  of the designated financial institutions shall be totally  prohibited. Issuance of foreign exchange certificates (FEC) will  also be terminated as of January 1, 1994. But the FEC in  circulation continues to be valid, and is to be phased out from  circulation gradually.  <H3>  VIII. To Enhance Macroeconomic Management of China's  Balance of Payment </H3>   Work on analyses and projection of changes and trends of  China's foreign exchange payment and receipts and its overall  balance of payments shall be enhanced in order to gradually  complete our macroeconomic control system over the balance of  payments. Establishing an efficient and effective balance of  payment reporting and statistics system, with a view to  strengthening verification, data-collecting, monitoring, and  management of foreign exchange receipts and payments, and on  foreign borrowing, will facilitate our efforts in blocking up  loopholes, and reducing and eliminating eventually the drain on  our foreign exchange reserves. All the departments concerned  shall work together in a timely and co-ordinated fashion to  resolve problems occurring in our work so as to make sure that  the forthcoming foreign exchange system reform is implemented  smoothly.</p>

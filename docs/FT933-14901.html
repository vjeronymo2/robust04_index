			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Arts: The country house as time machine - Architecture This is the time of year for the country house visit. International tourists and eager National Trust members are paying to glimpse the especially English ensemble of the great house with its collections and grounds. Throughout the land a quiet procession threads its way through silent rooms  -carefully keeping on the right side of the ropes and speaking in awed whispers. How much do we really see on the country house tour, and how much do we really understand about what is spread before us ? The great moment aesthetically in the English house is the eighteenth century. To assist us with the understanding of this period a valuable new book has been published - Eighteenth Century Decoration: Design and the Domestic Interior in England by Charles Saumerez Smith, (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, Pounds 50). It is the latest volume in the very comprehensive series that looks at the way interiors are depicted, by collecting together as much contemporary illustrative material as possible. In the case of the eighteenth century there are plenty of architects' drawings, pattern books, paintings and prints that do, when they are analysed, present a clear picture of life indoors at the time. A careful reading of Mr Saumerez Smith's book will open the eyes of visitors to country houses and give them a head start in understanding why the rooms look the way they do and how they were designed for use. There is relatively little published in this country that is serious on the subject of historic interior decoration. Mr Peter Thornton has done a lot to rectify this and his pioneering book on the seventeenth century interior in England and Holland set a very high standard. He went on to write the badly titled but rewarding book, Authentic Decor which updates to an extent the work of the master, Mario Praz, who gave us the gospel of interior decoration and its history. Anyone writing about interior design in the eighteenth century in England has to match the work of John Fowler and John Cornforth who published the key work in 1974 - English Decoration in the eighteenth century. Peter Thornton and John Cornforth have tried hard to show that our aesthetic response to eighteenth century rooms may well be a response that is conditioned by the current look of rooms and houses that were all substantially reorganised in 1910. The author of this important new book uses as his visual sources, paintings, prints and architects' drawings. The book is a rich visual feast but one of those books where the reader is really helped by being taken by the hand by the author and gently guided into new ways of interpreting old visual sources. When Mr Saumerez Smith is confronted by a painting by Zoffany or one of Arthur Devis's wooden compositions, he helps us to see them as documentary sources that reveal a lot about the look of the period. They also reveal a set of social relationships that need to be carefully interpreted. The author must have found it difficult to select from the quantity of material that exists for the period. He has brilliantly found a great deal of unpublished material, and his commentary also reveals hidden elements in familiar images. He is right to comment upon the growth in importance of the spread of possessions amongst all classes as the eighteenth century progressed. The developing range of manufactured products enabled a wide range of people to see their immediate surroundings as expressions of themselves. The fine arts express this to a degree - especially architecture which began to organise domestic interiors in terms of display. One of the best sections of this enthralling book for me was the one devoted to the impact of the great architect Robert Adam. Adam's career defines the second half of the eighteenth century. He went on the Grand Tour in the 1750's and met the influential Charles-Louis Clerisseau in Florence from whom he learned how to study the antique and how to draw. This book shows us some of the perfect results of this study at Kedleston, Syon, Kenwood and Home House. Adam understood the complete nature of a room - how to design walls, floor and ceiling as well as the furniture. Johann Zoffany as a leading artist and contemporary of Adam also understood the total domestic realm in his paintings and the examples shown here reveal not just family life but also the totality of the design of rooms and furniture. The role of the craftsmen and the pattern books of the period is clearly explored in a way that rightly emphasises the importance of the skilled artisan and demonstrates how printed books and engravings helped the spread of stylistic knowledge from France and Italy to London, and from London to the provinces. Above all this book took me into a world of refinement and taste leavened by satire and the perceptions of Hogarth. I felt by the end that I had lived briefly in the eighteenth century. I admired Mr Saumerez Smith's learning and visual sense and I coveted the architectural wallpaper shown in an interior of 1780 to the extent that I might well consider copying it.</p>

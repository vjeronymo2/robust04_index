			<p>BFN     [Text] The information and broadcasting secretary, Dr.  Tanvir Ahmad Khan, said no country of the world has forwarded  more meaningful proposals than Pakistan to make South Asia a  nuclear-free zone. It, however, is regrettable that India has  rejected most of these proposals. India is the only country in  the world where the pursuit of limitless power is increasingly  seen as a religious obligation in the context of militant Hindu  revivalism. Dr. Tanvir Ahmad Khan commented on a book called  The Critical Mass, in which its two authors presented  facts in a distorted manner, ignoring Pakistan's declaration  that it wants to utilize nuclear power to meet the growing fuel  and electricity demands in the country. Dr. Tanvir Ahmad Khan  criticized the arguments of a specific circle, which is  overlooking the peaceful nature of Pakistan's nuclear program  with the intention of reinforcing its own viewpoint, to have  strict restrictions imposed against Pakistan. He made it clear  that Pakistan has no intention whatsoever of using its nuclear  program for military purposes. On the other hand, he added,  India has been adopting an intimidatory posture toward Pakistan.  During the Cold War, which has now ended, India had acquired  massive stocks of arms from the former Soviet Union and acquired  arms and relevant technology from the Western countries. Under  these circumstances, Pakistan's national security has assumed  special importance and nuclear capability is the only effective  means of safeguarding national security under the current  scenario.    Tanvir Ahmad Khan answered a question about rolling back the  nuclear program and said no Pakistani Government will be able to  sign an agreement on the nuclear issue until a regional  agreement is signed. This agreement must bind all countries of  the region.    The information secretary said it is a matter of great  strength for Pakistan that today it enjoys the leadership of  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who possesses the full ability,  determination, courage, and foresight to lead the nation at this  time of difficulties. He said the opposition should cooperate  with the government at this difficult time so a national outlook  and strategy on the nuclear issue can be adopted.</p>

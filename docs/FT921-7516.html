			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Banks look at central register for shares A CENTRALISED institution to handle share registration, which could reduce costs for listed companies and make private share ownership simpler, is being considered by the UK's clearing banks. If adopted, records of most shareholdings in British companies would be held centrally by a new, jointly owned company. Co-operation on the project would save the banks from investing separately in their own technology. Otherwise, according to National Westminster, which is promoting the idea, the banks face having to spend between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m each in preparation for Taurus, the Stock Exchange's paperless settlement system, due to be launched in April 1993. The proposal was floated at a meeting of banks at the Stock Exchange yesterday, chaired by Mr Peter Rawlins, the exchange's chief executive. Banks at the meeting have until Monday to decide whether to take part in a Pounds 250,000 study into the project's feasibility by consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. For listed companies, a central utility could reduce the costs of maintaining shareholder records once Taurus is launched, though the scale of savings has yet to be assessed. The utility would act as a 'company account controller' under the Taurus system, holding details of most private investor shareholdings. Institutional investors and some private shareholders are expected to hold their shares in separate accounts once Taurus comes into operation. Holding shares in this way would simplify individual share ownership. Investors with several shareholdings would need to communicate with only one company. Once Taurus is launched, investors would receive one consolidated statement showing details of all their shareholdings, and would have only one Taurus code number. While details of shareholdings would be held centrally, banks would continue to provide separately the more profitable registration services, such as shareholder analyses.

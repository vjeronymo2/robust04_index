			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tenancy deregulation proposal angers UK farmers BRITAIN'S FARMERS' union yesterday angrily rejected long-awaited government proposals to free the market in agricultural land by removing tight restrictions that have discouraged landowners from letting. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said that new legislation would leave landlords and tenants free to make their own agreements without government interference. The measures were welcomed by the Country Landowners' Association but they brought a dusty response from the National Farmers' Union. The union said they would jeopardise the viability of future farm lettings because they did not specify any formula for rent reviews. 'They totally ignore the desperate need to protect tenants from upwards only rent demands,' said Mr David Naish, NFU president. 'Farmers will view these proposals as an abdication of the government's responsibilities to their industry.' Under existing legislation, which is widely held to be in need of reform, farm tenancies are for life and the government dictates how they should be assigned and allows tenants to decide what crops they grow. Deregulation would affect only future tenancies. Mrs Shephard said the government wanted to redefine agricultural tenancies to include a range of farm-based enterprises in an attempt to encourage diversification and benefit the rural economy. Only three safeguards would be attached to letting arrangements: That tenants should be fully compensated for improvements they make to the value of their holdings; That either side should have access to simplified arbitration to settle compensation disputes rather than having to resort to the courts; And that landlords must give a minimum of a year's notice of the end of a tenancy. Mrs Shephard said formidable barriers faced anyone wanting to buy their way into farming, with the cost of starting a basic dairy farm of 40 cows amounting to Pounds 300,000 at current land prices. 'Yet the obvious alternative of renting land is not readily available,' she said. 'As long as the government decides the detailed conditions on which tenants may lease land it is inevitable that landowners will remain reluctant to make it available.' Mrs Shephard, who is acting on a Conservative party manifesto commitment from the 1992 general election, was unable to promise legislation in next year's busy parliamentary timetable. If the proposals are held over, legislation would not come into force until 1995. The Country Landowners' Association said: 'What is crucial now is that parliamentary time is found as soon as possible.'</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Business looks again at social commitment A study by Business in the Community of its priorities on extending corporate community involvement will be examined by its board next month. The study by management consultants McKinsey will be on the agenda for the first board meeting chaired by Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, who is about to become chairman of BITC. Sir Allen said the study would stress the importance of focus in BITC's activities and the need to ensure that good ideas were actually delivered. This meant BITC had to involve other organisations to supplement its resources. BITC has promoted corporate community involvement since the early 1980s and, in recent years, has been particularly anxious that companies should see it in business rather than philanthropic terms. There was considerable growth in community involvement during the 1980s, although primarily in large companies. BITC, said Sir Allen, must encourage other organisations to become more active. 'Action must come from the community, and BITC's role is to find ways of increasing the impetus for people to do it themselves. 'We need to find ways of encouraging Tecs, chambers of commerce and other organisations to become more active in the community. This can be happen on many different levels, from a dinner party of interested groups every three months to something far more formal.' Corporate community involvement, he said, needed to be regarded as a central issue by all companies in the way corporate governance had become a central issue. Sir Allen's company is already particularly active in the community. Grand Metropolitan's community and charitable activities worldwide consume an annual Pounds 18m, or 2 per cent of profits. The company is conducting research to see if a link can be traced between community involvement and business efficiency. 'We have set up case studies to try to find out whether, if a group of Burger King employees are motivated to become strongly involved in voluntary work, they are good at running the business as well. First indications are that there is some evidence that this is the case.' Sir Allen stressed the need for companies to treat the management of community involvement like any other business activity. 'In Grand Metropolitan it has its own vision, strategies and annual and three-year plans.'</p>

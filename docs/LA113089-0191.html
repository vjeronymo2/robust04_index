			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> CITY TO PAY $3 MILLION TO SETTLE CRASH SUIT  </P> <P> Insurance carriers for the city have settled a lawsuit arising from a 1986  traffic accident by paying $2.1 million to one severely crippled motorist and  $1 million to another who suffered brain damage, attorneys said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Both motorists had sued the city and each other in the wake of the June 14,  1986, accident at Greenville Street and Sunflower Avenue, an intersection on  the city's boundary with Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Robert Orlowski, 28, of Fountain Valley can barely move his arms and legs from  injuries he sustained after he failed to see a stop sign while headed south on  Greenville and was struck by Ronald Sevilla, who was eastbound on Sunflower.  </P> <P> Ned Reilly of Santa Ana, an attorney for Orlowski, contended in court that the  intersection had been notoriously unsafe for years. He said the stop sign,  which has since been replaced by a traffic signal, was blocked from view by a  utility pole and that street lighting was inadequate.  </P> <P> The trial began Sept. 5 in Superior Court. The jury decided about a month later  that Orlowski was 56% at fault in the accident while the city of Santa Ana was  44% at a fault. New proceedings to decide the damages are expected to conclude  this week.  </P> <P> Reilly said he was able to win the $2.1-million settlement for Orlowski even  though the man had pleaded no contest to drunk-driving charges arising from the  accident. Reilly said he was able to show that while the man's blood alcohol  level was nearly double the legal limit when tested two hours after the  accident, he was sober at the time of the collision. Orlowski had just consumed  the alcohol and it had not yet entered his bloodstream, Reilly said.  </P> <P> Because of the man's severe injuries, which continue to worsen, the settlement  represented a way to protect the city's insurance carriers from having to pay  an even larger damage verdict in the future, said Phil Eaton, a private  attorney representing Santa Ana on the case.  </P> <P> "With the nature of the injuries to Mr. Orlowski, they would rather settle than  run the risk of a runaway verdict," he said. He said testimony indicated that  the crippled man's costs for care could run $87,000 a year.  </P> <P> Richard Love of Los Angeles, who represented Sevilla, said they were pleased  about the verdict.

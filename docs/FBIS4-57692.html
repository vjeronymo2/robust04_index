Today, the National  Commission for Prevention and Social Attention, presided over by  Comrade Vilma Espin, visited various tourist facilities in  Havana City to verify ideas, opinions, and suggestions firsthand  on pernicious conduct and its effects upon the image of national  dignity.

They do not have the moral and ethical conditions  required to do such delicate work, which is so important to the  country.

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hughes Aircraft sues GEC for Dollars 185m over radar system award HUGHES Aircraft of the US is suing GEC for Dollars 185m (Pounds 124m) over the hotly-contested award of the radar system for the European Fighter Aircraft in 1990. Hughes claims that GEC misappropriated information and breached obligations to Hughes. The case centres on GEC's Pounds 310m purchase of the radar division of Ferranti in January 1990. At the time, GEC was part of a consortium bidding for the EFA radar contract, using a Hughes radar system, the MSD 2000. The rival bidder was a consortium using a Ferranti system, the ECR 90. At the start of January 1990, press reports suggested that the Ferranti consortium was ahead in the race, but that the European governments awarding the contract were nervous of Ferranti's financial condition after the massive fraud it had suffered through acquiring International Signal and Control of the US. GEC's purchase of the Ferranti business later that month had the effect of guaranteeing its financial standing. The contract was awarded to GEC/Ferranti in May of that year. The Hughes suit, disclosed in GEC's latest report and accounts, also seeks a royalty on sales of radars designed by GEC subsidiaries from the alleged misappropriation of information. The case is contested by GEC, which is counter-claiming for over Dollars 5m.</p>

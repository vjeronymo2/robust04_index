			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 300 FLEE FLOODING IN ARKANSAS AREAS  </P> <P> Floodwaters surged down the Arkansas River on Monday, forcing more than 300  people to flee their homes and causing millions of dollars in damage to roads,  bridges and buildings in what may be the worst flooding in Arkansas in 63  years.  </P> <P> Some 327 homes have been evacuated in six Arkansas counties along the Arkansas  River.  </P> <P> Emergency workers said 182 homes were evacuated in Jefferson County and  predicted an additional 200 evacuations before the flooding ends. The river is  expected to crest today in Little Rock and Wednesday in Pine Bluff, Jefferson  County, about 40 miles downstream.  </P> <P> A Pulaski County judge on Monday called in the National Guard and declared a  state of emergency in the county to prevent further looting in some evacuated  neighborhoods northwest of Little Rock.  </P></p>

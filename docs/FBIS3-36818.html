There was a creative and  active examination of those issues that could open up the way to  implementation of everything agreed by the presidents of the  Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the United States at their  tripartite meeting in January this year." Yuriy Dubinin, the  head of the Russian Federation state delegation to the talks  with Ukraine, said this in an exclusive interview with the  ITAR-TASS correspondent.    "As a result of the talks a package of documents on this  matter was agreed. The drafts of these documents are now being  submitted to the presidents of Russia and Ukraine. We have an  understanding with our Ukrainian colleagues that until the  presidents consider and, we hope, endorse these documents, we  will not reveal the details of these agreements." On the whole,  however, Yuriy Dubinin stressed, "these agreements are highly  positive and promising."</p>

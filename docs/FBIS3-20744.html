			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by J. Dee Hill: "Czech Protectionism Grounds KLM </F> Flights"]    [Text] The Czech government last month reneged on its  air-transport agreement with the Dutch government and the  Netherlands' national carrier, KLM, forcing the airline to cut  back the number of flights it runs between Prague and Amsterdam.    KLM, which formerly ran twice-a-day, round-trip flights to  Amsterdam, now has 10 instead of 14 weekly flights, with  twice-daily service on alternate days. A KLM official said the  airline was not allowed to choose which flights to cancel.    When asked why the Czechs took this unilateral step, Ivan  Rada, head of civil air transport for the Czech Ministry of  Transport, replied, "To protect CSA."    Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) is a financially struggling  concern that lost about 1.2 billion Kc ($40 million U.S.) last  year. Blaming foreign competition for its woes, the  government-owned airline petitioned the Transportation Ministry  to take action. The ministry then stopped KLM from offering any  flights on days that CSA offers trans-Atlantic flights.    KLM protested that it had an agreement ratified by the Czech  Parliament; air-transport agreements are negotiated between  governments, not airlines. KLM made an attempt at conciliation,  offering to limit the number of seats while keeping the same  number of flights. KLM spokeswoman Marjorie Wenting said "it is  a better product for our customers to have regular service."    Nevertheless, KLM's flights between Prague and Amsterdam  were  slashed, at an undisclosed financial loss to the Dutch company,  beginning Jan. 1. An estimate using the 94-seat Fokker 100 plane  with a round-trip, midweek fare of 6,990 Kc pegs the loss at  about 2.6 million Kc ($90,628) per week. CSA's lowest fare for  the same trip is 8,560 Kc.    "According to our opinion, the agreement between the two  governments gives KLM rights," Wenting said. "It is a concern  for us that this is possible in this country even though we had  an official agreement."    Rada said the problem was that while the air-transport  agreement was approved by Parliament, it was not approved in its  final form by the Transportation Ministry. "Troubles appeared  when Holland's KLM office started selling tickets for flights  that weren't approved," he said.    Mike Higgins, director of British Airways for the Czech and  Slovak republics, said that regardless of who is right in this  instance, the government's protectionist stance toward CSA is  bad for the industry as a whole.    "A profitable company is better for customers all-around  because it can reinvest the money in providing better service,"  Higgins said. "In terms of competition, the whole idea of the  European Economic Community is a free market and deregulation. I  would certainly hope anyone who wants to become a part of that  would adopt these [free-market] principles."</p>

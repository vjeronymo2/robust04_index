			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Foreigners scent fresh opportunities China's long-awaited automotive industry policy drew generally favourable reviews from foreign automotive representatives, but they warned that the policy could unravel under political pressure, writes Tony Walker. Mr Donald St Pierre, president of the newly-established China Automotive Components Corporation, said the key to the policy's success would be the ability of the authorities to consolidate the sector into three or four conglomerates. Mr St Pierre noted signs of smaller Chinese producers among China's 120 vehicle manufacturers seeking co-production ventures with foreign carmakers outside the scope of the new policy. 'I hope they can make the new policy stick and ensure that the industry doesn't fragment,' he said. 'It's important they are really able to develop economies of scale and not allow local manufacturers to find a way around that.' Japanese motor industry representatives also reacted positively to the new policy which clearly leaves the door open to the entry of up to four carmakers, including two from Japan, after 1996, when the freeze on new entrants expires. Last month China told international vehicle makers that before they become involved in vehicle assembly in China they must show their commitment by investing in the components sector. The Japanese, who were left out in the cold in the first round when the Germans and the French were becoming established in China, now see opportunities in the second round. Toyota is regarded as the frontrunner among the Japanese with possibly Honda and Nissan fighting for the remaining slot. US manufacturers also believe the door has been left ajar to their entry after 1996. Ford and General Motors are positioning themselves for a more determined push in the next year or so. As a preliminary step both are becoming involved in components manufacturing with Ford announcing two ventures last month. Existing producers are led by Volkswagen, which built some 130,000 passenger cars in China last year, including Santanas, Audis and Jettas. Other foreign manufacturers include Citroen, which produced 13,000 of its ZX small cars at a plant near Wuhan in central China, and Peugeot, which is involved in the assembly of its 504 at a factory near Guangzhou in southern China. China's automotive manufacturing strongholds are located in Changchun in the north-east, Shanghai in the Yangtze Delta and in Hubei province in central China. However, Beijing and Tianjin in the north, Guangzhou and Nanjing, west of Shanghai, are all bidding to be included in the plans for a restructured industry. Mr St. Pierre said China's aim was 'fairly realistic' of satisfying 90 per cent of its passenger car demand of some 1.5m vehicles from local production by 2000. 'They really are aiming to develop their own automotive industry,' he said in reference to the tax incentives for both economies of scale and research and development. Mr St. Pierre, who helped launch American Motor's Jeep manufacturing venture in China in the mid-1980's, likened the involvement of foreign manufacturers in China to General Motors' experience in Europe. 'GM Europe became a European company. If a foreign manufacturer wants to operate in China they are going to have to become a Chinese company.' While the new automotive policy referred to the need for Chinese carmakers to compete internationally, much less emphasis was given to this than in previous documents. In the 1980's, China was insisting that 70 per cent of production should be exported. Now that living standards have risen sharply and car ownership is a reality for increasing numbers of Chinese, policymakers recognise that the industry will be hard-pressed to meet domestic demand.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Global emissions of carbon dioxide -- the main pollutant associated with global  warming -- rose for the fourth consecutive year in 1987 and developing nations  had the biggest growth, a federal scientist said. Worldwide, carbon dioxide  emissions from the burning of oil, coal and gas by power plants, factories and  motor vehicles increased to an all-time high of 5.65 billion tons, up 1.43%  from the 1986 levels of 5.57 billion tons, Gregg Marland, a staff scientist at  the Oak Ridge National Laboratory told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Committee. Marland said U.S. emissions rose 1.92% in 1987 and preliminary  estimates show another 3% jump in 1988. He said the highest rate of growth in  carbon dioxide emissions occurred in South and Southeast Asia, a 6.2% increase  over 1986 levels. Carbon dioxide is considered a primary contributor to the  greenhouse effect -- a predicted warming of the Earth by the accumulation of  gases in the atmosphere.  </P></p>

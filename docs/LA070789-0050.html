			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> A federal judge in Atlanta Thursday dismissed part of a lawsuit that accuses  Rob Lowe of enticing a teen-age girl into sexual encounters on videotape. The  girl's mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, sued the actor under a Georgia law involving  the seduction of a minor daughter, and she also alleged that Lowe intentionally  inflicted emotional distress on her family. U.S. District Judge G. Ernest  Tidwell, who heard arguments last week on Lowe's request that the lawsuit be  thrown out, agreed to dismiss the claim of emotional distress, saying the suit  did not offer enough facts to warrant the allegation. But the judge refused to  dismiss the claim for damages for seduction. Lowe, 25, is alleged to have  coaxed Lena Jan Parsons, then 16, into a filmed tryst involving another woman  last summer while he was in Atlanta for the Democratic National Convention.  </P></p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / EC Statement on foreign exchange markets Following consultations between EC finance ministers and central banks, the chancellor of the exchequer, Rt Hon Norman Lamont MP, in his capacity as president of the European Council of Economic and Finance Ministers, has today asked the chairman of the Monetary Committee to issue the following statement on behalf of EC finance ministers: 'The member states of the EC are committed to economic and monetary stability in the EMS, which is an important element in European prosperity. The governments of member states agree that a change in the present structure of central rates would not be the appropriate response to the current tensions in the EMS. They welcome the activation of the Basle-Nyborg agreement on intramarginal intervention and the respective co-operation among the European central banks. The authorities of Community member countries are actively pursuing economic policy co-operation and stand ready to enforce their co-operation to ensure an appropriate functioning of the EMS.' Commenting on the statement Mr Lamont said: 'I welcome this clear and unequivocal statement by EC finance ministers. It demonstrates the willingness of our European partners to co-operate intensively to maintain stability in the financial markets.'</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese economy The latest batch of economic statistics confirms the weakness of Japan's economic recovery so far. Next year also looks set to be below par. The government's 1995 budget, promising the lowest rise in public works spending for five years, will offer much less of a fiscal stimulus than last year's. Meanwhile, capital investment, the foundation of previous recoveries, continues to lag. Although it may be near the bottom after a four-year decline, any pick-up in corporate investment is likely to be muted. Industry is ambling along at less than 75 per cent of capacity. That is about the same level as during the aftermath of the first oil shock 20 years ago. Despite the recent upturn in corporate profits, the average return on fixed capital remains miserly, explaining companies' inclination to keep their money in the bank. Given the economy's sluggish progress, the Bank of Japan would be wise not to raise interest rates. The Bank is clearly concerned about inflation, its worst nightmare after the late 1980s bubble economy and its disastrous aftermath. But the large output gap which has emerged during the recession suggests that inflation fears are, for now, unfounded. As government spending weakens in 1995, the industrial economy will need an easy monetary stance just as much as it did in September 1993, at the depth of recession, when the Bank cut the official discount rate to resist a deflationary slide. The Bank has been nudging overnight rates down over the past week. That augurs well. It is, perhaps, evidence that its new governor is - contrary to the markets' worries - trying out an accommodative monetary policy.</p>

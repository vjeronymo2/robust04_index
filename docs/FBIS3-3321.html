			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Honolulu, 19 Mar (XINHUA) -- The United States must  reconsider its China policy to avoid the breakdown of relations  which may bring economic losses to the two countries, U.S.  Secretary of the Treasury Bentsen said here today.    He made the remark prior to the opening of the finance  ministers meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  forum. He said that he did not wish to see a confrontation  between the United States and China.    Bentsen said that if the United States cannot exert pressure  on China on the issue of human rights while ensuring that there  will not be a breakdown of relations, then "we have to explore  other methods."    He said that "viewed from the economic angle, the divorce of  the United States from China will be harmful to both countries."</p>

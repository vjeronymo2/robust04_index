			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Ratner returns to UK amid mounting concern MR GERALD RATNER, controversial chairman of Ratners Group, last night flew back from New York to London to confront mounting concern about the financial future of the jewellery company he built up from a small family business into the UK's biggest chain. Ratners is expected to make a statement about the company's prospects following what is believed to have been a dismal Christmas trading period. Mr Ratner said last night that a board meeting was being held today at which Christmas trading would be discussed and an announcement would be made later. It is thought the group's pre-Christmas aggressive discounting failed to stimulate sales sufficiently to avoid a massive erosion of margins. City analysts are bracing themselves for bad news and suggest the company's losses may have deepened following the Pounds 17.7m deficit at the interim stage. Last year the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 112.1m. If trading has been as weak as feared, Ratners may be in danger of breaching its banking covenants and may be forced into seeking a restructuring of its unwieldy short-term debt. In the past Ratners has toyed with the idea of floating part of its US operations or selling assets in the UK to raise cash. But this would be difficult given market conditions on both sides of the Atlantic. The group's problems have been exacerbated in the US where Zale, the country's biggest chain, seems to be heading towards seeking protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy laws. Sales at Ratners's 1,000 Sterling and Kay stores have been hit as Zale has dumped stock on the market at greatly reduced prices. Ratners' shares have fallen heavily over the past year from a high of 191p to 22p. The company has a market value of Pounds 64.5m. For several months Ratners has been looking to recruit a chairman to help restore confidence and allow Mr Ratner to split the positions of chairman and managing director. Several big institutional investors have sold their shareholdings in recent months as the recession and Ratners' high borrowings took their toll. The company has also suffered from adverse publicity after Mr Ratner's remark last April that a cheap sherry decanter set sold well because it was 'total crap'.</p>

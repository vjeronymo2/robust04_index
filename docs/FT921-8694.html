			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Manufacturing output falls 5.2% MANUFACTURING output fell by 5.2 per cent last year compared with 1990, with the rate of decline speeding up in the last quarter, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. Seasonally adjusted output in the three months to December was at its lowest quarterly level for nearly four years. Factory output in December was 8 per cent below the level in the second quarter of 1990, when it reached a record. In December output fell 0.3 per cent from November. Manufacturing output fell 1.2 per cent between the third and fourth quarters of last year, while between the second and third quarters it was flat. It fell 0.7 per cent in the second quarter and 1.5 per cent in the first. Factory production has fallen for six successive quarters, the longest run since the CSO started keeping records in 1952. While factory production in the 1974-75 and 1980-81 recessions fell for just five quarters, the total decline in manufacturing output was deeper - 12 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. Last year, output by the metals and chemicals industries was virtually flat between the last two quarters. Mineral products - such as building materials - food, drink and tobacco, textiles and clothing and general manufacturing each saw a fall of 1 per cent between the two quarters while engineering declined by 2 per cent. The chemicals sector increased output by 3 per cent last year compared with 1990, while food, drink and tobacco was unchanged. All the other main sectors recorded falls - engineering fell 7 per cent, textiles and clothing 8 per cent and metals and minerals 9 per cent. Since manufacturing output began to decline in mid 1990 engineering has been among the hardest-hit sectors, with production falling 12 per cent. Between the third and fourth quarters output of the energy and water industries increased by 3 per cent, leaving output of all production industries - manufacturing, energy and water - virtually unchanged over the period. For last year, energy and water output rose 3.5 per cent, with all production industries down 3 per cent. Because of a squeeze on earnings across manufacturing, unit wage costs in the three months to December were up 4.4 per cent on a year earlier, after 5.0 per cent in November. There was a further increase in manufacturing productivity, with output per person between September and December up 3.3 per cent on the previous year. In the three months to November this figure was up 2.7 per cent on the same period in 1990.</p>

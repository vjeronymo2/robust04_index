			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / International Company News: Wall St turns on Marlboro Man - Nikki Tait on why Philip Morris shares fell despite higher profits Profit surprises from Philip Morris, the tobacco, food and brewing combine, are about as rare as the sight of the Marlboro Man without his stetson. So why did the shares tumble 10 per cent in two days, after the release of solid third-quarter results? The reaction has little to do with the bottom-line numbers. Philip Morris remains a strong cash generator, posting double-digit earnings increases with enviable regularity. In the third quarter alone it reported a 16.4 per cent improvement in after-tax profits at Dollars 1.29bn on Dollars 15bn sales. Moreover, because of the large amounts of surplus cash which are thrown off  -reckoned to be around Dollars 20bn over the five years from 1991 to 1995 - Philip Morris has reinstituted a share buy-back programme. This ate up almost Dollars 600m during the latest quarter, but helped earnings per share to rise by an even more impressive 20 per cent. This scale of advance, said Mr Michael Miles, the company's chairman, should continue into the fourth quarter. It would, he added, be 'driven by continued strong performance in our international operations'. So what is the stock market's problem? It is true that elements of Philip Morris's food business have had a tough time. Hot weather, for example, in Europe depressed sales of confectionery - the US company now owns Europe's Jacob Suchard - while a poor summer across much of the US contributed to a fall of over 40 per cent in profits at Miller Brewing. But the reason for the share price reaction is the changing dynamics of the domestic tobacco sector. For all Philip Morris' efforts at diversification into food products and the growth of the international tobacco business, this remains hugely important. Last year, the domestic tobacco operations accounted for almost half operating profits, although only one-fifth of sales. Demand for cigarettes is on a slowly declining trend in the US, with shipment volumes falling by about 2.5 per cent a year. But within this overall pattern, full-priced brands are suffering particularly badly, at the expense of 'discount' brands. This trend is usually attributed to the squeeze on consumer spending, and is particularly problematic for manufacturers like Philip Morris because profit margins on discount brands - as opposed to established full-price brands - are lower. This year discount brands account for around 30 per cent of the US market, against about 19 per cent as recently as 1990. So concern about how Philip Morris's key full-priced brands - in particular, Marlboro - may fare is rampant. Recent figures provide some justification: in the third quarter, for example, Morris's total cigarette shipments were down by 0.5 per cent, at 53.3bn units, but this masked a 3.8 per cent decline for premium brands overall, and a 3.9 per cent fall for Marlboro. For the first nine months the story was similar: a 0.4 per cent fall in total cigarette shipments, but a 2.9 per cent fall for premium brands and a slightly larger 3.4 per cent decline for Marlboro. The shell-shock in Thursday's announcement was that Philip Morris expects a much larger 10 per cent fall in domestic shipments in the final quarter. This, in turn, seems to result partly from the group's aggressive defensive tactics. The shift towards discount brands, according to one analyst, encouraged Philip Morris to claw extra shelf space by increasing shipping levels. When retailers baulked at the move, a stock overhang developed, which will be addressed in the fourth quarter. Compounding the problem is the strong, but erratic, export demand - notably from Russia - which is satisfied from domestic factories. Some capacity problems and manufacturing log-jams have resulted. But the announcement's real impact was to highlight possible long-term problems should the discount sector continue its inroads into the tobacco market. Most analysts admit the swing to discount products could be a function of the recessionary climate. But, as Barry Ziegler, analyst with A. G. Edwards, says: 'There's always the risk that people will become used to generic brands, and not return to the full-price brands.' Concerns over Philip Morris's full-price brands have also been exacerbated by the success of Camel, a competitive product sold by Morris's biggest rival RJR Nabisco. Finally, although the company denied a recent move by its top US tobacco marketing executive to Philip Morris International implied either a shake-up or a shift in strategy, some observers have sensed the management changes could signal growing concern about Marlboro's performance. Even so, several analysts said Thursday's stock-market reaction was overdone. With the company still confident of 20 per cent earnings growth, it was - said one pundit - too soon for a fundamental reassessment. After all, in these straitened times, such numbers are something of a rarity.</p>

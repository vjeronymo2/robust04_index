			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian wheat harvest could be up 30 per cent TIMELY RAINFALL in Australia's main wheat growing regions will help increase production to 13.8m tonnes for the current 1992-3 season, up 30 per cent on last year. The 13.8m tonnes of harvest is from an area of 9.1m hectares (22.5m acres). The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the official forecasting agency, said, however, that continuation of the cooler weather conditions that prevailed in the spring could lead to a higher proportion of low protein wheat being produced. Abare said the forecast of the Queensland wheat crop had been increased to 650,000 tonnes from the September forecast of 550,000 tonnes. That would be about 90 per cent higher than the drought affected crop of 1991-92. Wheat production in New South Wales is forecast to be 2.9m tonnes, up 27 per cent.</p>

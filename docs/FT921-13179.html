			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Survey of Cheshire (2): Sore thumb seeks new image - Widnes and Runcorn development HALTON, one of the hybrid districts born during the local government reorganisation of 1974, has not made much impact since. Indeed, a survey carried out in south-east and north-west England last year showed that only 5 per cent of people knew where it is. Its saving grace is that 95 per cent of the people polled knew where Widnes and Runcorn are. They comprise Halton, albeit as two separate units struggling to become one. The survey impelled the partnership of public and private sector bodies trying to regenerate the area to change its name from Halton to Widnes and Runcorn Development (WRD). This may have improved Halton's chances of being found on the map but it has not yet done much for the area's image. Halton is the only part of Cheshire with enough problems to have been designated by the government as one of Britain's 57 urban programme authorities. It sticks out like a sore thumb, with the fourth worst male unemployment rate - 17 per cent - in north-west England. Cheshire's comparable male rate is 11 per cent. Within the county, the Wirral and Chester travel-to-work area is two points worse off, but Widnes and Runcorn is wholly in Cheshire, while the Wirral is in Merseyside. Mr Christopher Gibaud is chief executive of WRD and an imported specialist in economic development from Swindon via Peterborough. As he puts it: 'Halton sits very oddly with Cheshire, which has an image of being a green and pleasant land. We are a poor relation, a Merseyside urban area, an industrial blot on the landscape.' Both Runcorn and Widnes are on Merseyside in the sense that they face each other at the narrows before the Mersey widens into estuary and mudflats between Ellesmere Port and Speke, but neither is in Merseyside in a governmental or, increasingly, cultural sense. Before 1974, Runcorn was in Cheshire, Widnes in Lancashire. They had been joined by a road bridge - replacing a famous transporter bridge. And while an even more famous rail bridge had physically linked them for more than a century, its purpose was, and remains, the speeding of trains between Liverpool and London. Indeed, part of Widnes' image problem is the view from these passing trains as they dawdle under speed restrictions along the elevated track to or from the bridge. Widnes railway station is not even on this particular track. Its claim to fame is as the place where Mr Paul Simon wrote 'Homeward Bound' - an ode to misery - when still an impoverished and touring folk-club singer. Runcorn also has an image problem. It was designated a new town and imported thousands of Liverpudlians in the 1960s and 1970s. The were decanted from a developing urban crisis into a planners' concrete dreamscape which was soon christened Legoland. This infamous housing is now well on the way to final demolition, but the trauma was damaging. Runcorn now has very attractive areas of new housing, but Halton has struggled for 17 years with trying to marry a working class corner of Lancashire on one bank of the Mersey with a small town of imported Scousers on the other. Manufacturing industry predominates - and not for nothing is the wonderfully successful Widnes rugby league team called the Chemics. Widnes mushroomed 120 years ago when Lancashire canal owners hiked the tolls for transporting Cheshire salt to chemical works in St Helens and beyond. The chemical industry upped sticks to the river bank to cut costs. Runcorn developed later as the Manchester Ship Canal opened it up to bulk transportation of chemical feedstocks and finished products by sea. ICI now employs 9,000 of its 44,000 UK workforce in Widnes or Runcorn. Chemicals predominate, but related industries like food processing, drink, packaging, plastics, light engineering and chemicals spin-offs are also there. Apart from the local district council, the only large providers of white-collar or professional jobs are ICI's offices and the Department of Employment, which has relocated 900 jobs from the south-east. Good communications ensure that managers and their families can live outside Halton in Cheshire's more salubrious or bucolic districts. This is the background against which Halton district council and WRD are going to take on big city opponents in this year's City Challenge competition for urban funding from the government. The competition is open to all 57 designated authorities and Mr Richard Stevens, the council's leg-man on the challenge, thinks Widnes is well on the way to fulfilling the necessary criteria to win a share of the prize money. A solid, working partnership between public and private sectors is crucial to making the final shortlist, and this looks well in train. WRD is chaired by Mr Geoff Wynne, ICI's director of Merseyside operations, with active support from British Oxygen, British Rail, British Waterways and the Commission for the New Towns (CNT). CNT's presence is helpful for two reasons. Not only does it own large tracts of Halton's development land in the wake of the winding-up of Warrington-Runcorn new town development corporation, but it is also a government agency with a possible inside track in the competition. What WRD wants is Pounds 5m a year for five years. The plan is to clean up derelict or soon-to-be redundant land blighted by the chemical industry, build new factories and offices so as to have premises ready to offer incomers, and finish the replacement of Legoland with better housing. Widnes' currently dreary waterfront - which could otherwise be a problem when ICI withdraws from making Paraquat in the town as part of its modernisation and restructuring - would figure prominently. Mr Gibaud says it offers the opportunity to create a good quality industrial park with good views. 'No one knows how ICI will evolve at Runcorn, where it makes chlorine and faces problems,' he says. 'But we can't sit back and wait. We have to plan for a post-ICI future in the next century. 'The way to overcome our poor image is not to spend money on promotion, but to create a local climate and environment for new investment. If we can demonstrate things are happening, we can build a new town on the back of that.' Ultimately, he hopes Widnes and Runcorn will become as attractive as neighbouring Warrington was in the 1970s and 1980s. With development land at Pounds 120,000 an acre compared with Pounds 150,000-Pounds 250,000 in Warrington, early birds may well win some good prizes, especially if Halton wins a City Challenge prize to make the place nicer.</p>

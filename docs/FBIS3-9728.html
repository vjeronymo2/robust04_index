The minister expressed  his trust in Russia's foreign policy, and said that peace  partnership would provide a good framework for reducing  anti-Western prejudice in Russians. In his view, Russia's more  active foreign policy poses no danger to the region. If this  policy aims to restore peace in the Balkans, it is welcomed by  all, Jeszenszky said.    The minister mentioned that Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin would visit Budapest next week.    Russian Patriarch Aleksey II, who visited Hungary recently,  could also experience that both the Hungarian people and  policy-makers are eager to strengthen economic relations with  Russia, Jeszenszky said.    Concerning the new Slovak government, the minister said that  Hungary is ready to pursue a policy of extended arms. Should  someone grasp this arm, it would be fortunate not only for the  two countries but even for Europe as a whole, he said.</p>

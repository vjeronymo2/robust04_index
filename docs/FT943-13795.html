			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Renault French and foreign bankers will receive letters this morning inviting them to bid to advise the government on its 80 per cent stake in Renault. They will be smacking their lips. Whoever wins the adviser's mandate will parade it like a trophy. Though the government is not yet committed to an early privatisation of the car maker, a sale looks increasingly likely. Assurances Generales de France was originally slated as the next privatisation candidate. But international investors have recently been so stuffed with new insurance issues that they probably have little appetite for another one just now. Investors would welcome Renault, which is in the midst of a cyclical upswing, as a variation in their diet. If France does decide on an early privatisation, the timetable will be tight. Given trade union opposition, waiting until 1995 would not be advisable. With presidential elections next May, a Renault privatisation in 1995 could get caught in political cross-fire. A flotation at the end of this year looks a better bet. A quick sale would help Renault draw a line under its unhappy alliance with Volvo, which floundered in part because of concern over the continuing involvement of the French state. A flotation would be a good opportunity for the Swedish motor group to exchange most of its 20 per cent stake in Renault for the French company's 45 per cent stake in Volvo Trucks. Renault will still need a partner to share the cost of developing future car models. One of the lessons of the Volvo saga is that this too may be easier once it is privatised.</p>

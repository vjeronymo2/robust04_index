			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Court Cavendish ahead despite interest hedge Court Cavendish, the nursing home operator which was one of a handful of companies to disappoint the market in initial trading when it floated last year, reported pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 86,000 to Pounds 450,000 for the six months to October 31, in spite of a Pounds 600,000 exceptional charge for an interest hedge. In July, the shares failed to hold their issue price of 225p and fell to 207p by the close of first day dealings. Yesterday, the shares rose 1p on the figures to close at 251p. The board declared an interim dividend of 1.35p, payable from earnings after exceptionals of 2.34p (1.79p). Turnover on continuing activities rose to Pounds 7.17m (Pounds 6.87m). Acquisitions contributed Pounds 287,000. Net interest charges fell to Pounds 285,000 (Pounds 1.38m) as borrowings of Pounds 24.7m were paid down with flotation proceeds of Pounds 38.6m. Cash and deposits were Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 669,000) at the half-way stage. The company is aiming to reach 3,000 beds at a rate of 500 beds a year for the next three to five years, spending between Pounds 12m and Pounds 15m a year. Initial expansion will be funded by the flotation proceeds and debt. COMMENT In a rising market, the shares are now trading above the issue price, reflecting the company's success in mollifying institutions. Concerns, not least about the quality of the management, have been soothed by assurances about acquisition policy and trips around the homes. Analysts have been encouraged by the 17 per cent gross return achieved on Pounds 11.6m of assets purchased since the float. The return should hold up when the company turns to debt finance in the next two years or so. The company says going back to shareholders for more equity finance is a long-term option. The forecast of Pounds 3.1m for the full year gives a rating of 17.  This looks high in a sub-sector rated at 20.8 and populated by companies with better track records.</p>

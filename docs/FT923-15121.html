			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / MFI price of 115p lower than planned RECENT falls in London share prices have forced MFI Furniture Group, the kitchen and bedroom furniture retailer, to set a 115p price for its flotation, far lower than it had originally hoped. There will also be fewer shares on sale than had been intended. The price puts a market value of Pounds 669m on the company against earlier estimates of Pounds 750m or even Pounds 800m. The market value compares with the Pounds 718m price when the company did a management buy-out in 1987. Mr Derek Hunt, chairman of MFI, said yesterday: 'We gave ground on the price for obvious reasons. It was underwritten and that is what matters.' But he and fellow directors decided against selling any of their own shares. 'I am not selling at that price,' Mr Hunt said. He has 521,000 shares, worth Pounds 600,000 at the issue price. Like the share issue for The Telegraph newspaper group earlier this week, there are initial indications that private investors are showing little enthusiasm for MFI's offer. Originally up to 10 per cent of the MFI issue was to be placed with regional stockbrokers, to sell to their clients. But they found demand for only 1 per cent of the issue. A quarter of the issue is being sold through a public offer, to meet Stock Exchange requirements for flotations. The other 74 per cent has been placed with institutions. The price was fixed around 2am yesterday after a meeting lasting several hours at County NatWest, the merchant bank sponsoring the issue. People who attended the meeting said that the possibility of cancelling the issue was not considered seriously. Mr David Barclay of County NatWest said: 'Pulling an issue is always an option but it is a nuclear weapon, not to be used lightly.' The investors who backed the buy-out are selling fewer shares than planned, only just realising their original investment. Asda, the supermarket group which had owned MFI until the buy-out, is selling the whole of its 25 per cent stake, realising Pounds 73m. MFI will receive the planned Pounds 545m before expenses, enabling it to repay much of its Pounds 500m of debt, repay Pounds 183m of preference and convertible shares and pay an Pounds 11m bonus to management. The price puts the shares on an historic pro forma price/earnings ratio of 15.3, which compares with a stores sector average of about 18. MFI said it would have paid a 3.75p dividend in its last financial year if it had been a public company, giving a yield of 4.4 per cent at the issue price.

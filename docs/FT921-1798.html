			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (5): Tax incentives attract - Offshore companies FIFTEEN years of quiet growth as an offshore centre has brought a diversity of business to the republic of Cyprus, including multinational corporations, banks and shipping companies. The central bank issued a record 1,270 registration permits for offshore enterprises in 1991, bringing the total to more than 8,000 since 1976 when Cyprus introduced offshore incentives. While most are 'brass-plate' entities  -often set up to hold a wealthy individual's private assets - about 900 companies operate full-fledged offices. Pepsi-Cola, RJ Reynolds, Alico and United Distillers are among familiar names using Cyprus as a base for their regional operations. There are almost 20 offshore banking units (OBUs), among them Barclays and Banque Nationale de Paris, and more than 70 shipping companies, including leading ship managers such as Columbia and Hanseatic. Initially, Cyprus was as seen as a convenient perch for businessmen driven out of Lebanon by civil war. Then its appeal as a comfortable base for expatriate staff was discovered by the multinationals. In the past year, however, the largest number of new arrivals has been from eastern Europe, mostly companies from the breakaway Yugoslav republics or the ex-Soviet Union. For the sake of being close to their markets, companies are clearly prepared to discount what sets Cyprus apart from islands like Malta and Madeira, its nearest offshore competitors: the division of the island into Greek and Turkish Cypriot sectors separated by a UN peacekeeping force. 'European companies probably give less weight to the Cyprus problem than the Americans. But it's still a factor at the back of everyone's mind,' says a banker. However, Cyprus offers advantages such as relatively low wages and housing costs, along with a pool of highly skilled labour; it boasts more university graduates in proportion to the population than any other country in Europe. Respectability is a word stressed by officials in charge of offshore registrations. 'We're not a tax haven; we're offering tax incentives,' says Mr Sophocles Michaelides of the central bank. The difference, he says, lies in the controls exercised by the central bank. All offshore companies must submit an audited financial statement every year. Those with full-fledged offices must also produce a confidential annual report detailing their current financial status. Audits are carried out by local accountants, mostly trained in Britain. Banks are examined carefully before being allowed to set up in Cyprus. The preference is for branches or subsidiaries of 'reputable' organisations rather than a bank seeking incorporation on the island though, once established, the OBUs enjoy confidentiality similar to that in Luxembourg. A new financial services bill, expected to pass in parliament later this year, is intended to give greater protection against fraud. It will empower Cypriot authorities to license and supervise offshore financial service companies, seen as a potential growth area. The other piece of legislation awaiting parliamentary approval is an international trust bill, based on UK trust law. It will update existing regulations on trusts established in Cyprus by non-resident investors, basing incentives on the beneficiary's country of residence. Tax incentives for offshore companies include paying only 4.25 per cent tax on earnings and exemption from capital gains tax from share transfers in an offshore company. Expatriate employees pay income tax at half the local rate and can import new cars and household goods duty-free. Improvements in telecommunications in the past few years have helped to attract more offshore companies. The switch-over to digital exchanges and transmission systems was followed at once by the introduction of cellular telephones and paging facilities. However, the most frequently heard complaint from offshore managers concerns a special 20 per cent tax levied on their telecommunications expenses. It seems unlikely to be lifted soon; the central bank says that offshore companies must expect to contribute to maintaining the high standards of telecommunications. Increased anxiety about security, a consequence of the Gulf war, has resulted in tighter controls on issuing residence permits. Owners of 'brass-plate' companies are no longer entitled to residence in Cyprus. Foreigners working as domestic staff may be sent home after two years. Both moves have provoked strong objections from Cypriot lawyers and accountants who service the offshore operations. 'We get calls from annoyed expatriates whose 'au pairs' are being refused an extension of their residence permits. It's bad for Cyprus's image,' says Mr Michael Zampelas of Ioannou Zampelas, the local member of Coopers and Lybrand. For the past few years, new offshore shipping and ship management companies have been opening in the port of Limassol at a rapid rate. This is in response to an energetic government campaign to attract vessels to the Cyprus registry, which is now the seventh largest in the world. More important, about 40 per cent of the 21m-tonne Cypriot fleet is managed from the island. Limassol can provide a broad range of maritime services. Fees and tonnage taxes in Cyprus are considered more competitive than in the Panama and Liberia registries, especially for newer ships. The government is offering discounts on registering ships under 10 years old in an effort to bring down the average age of the fleet. That is 14 years at present, and 75 per cent of Cypriot-flag vessels are more than 10 years old. To encourage more owners of Cyprus-registered ships to establish themselves on the island, discounts are also being offered to shipping companies using Cypriot services and employing Cypriot crews. The government hopes that others will follow the example of Mr Klaus Oldendorff who moved both his fleet of 20 ships and his offices to Cyprus from Germany four years ago. 'After some thought, I decided it would be better to operate my ships out of Cyprus itself. It's a pleasant place to live and, with the exception of major ship financing, you can carry out almost all your business here,' Mr Oldendorff says.</p>

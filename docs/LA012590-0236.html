			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS RATE BUSH CHOICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS CHIEF LOW  </P> <P> President Bush plans to announce his choice for the top civil rights job in the  Justice Department is a former New York state legislator, John R. Dunne, White  House sources said today.  </P> <P> Dunne would fill a post left vacant since December, 1988. Bush's first choice,  William Lucas, failed to win Senate confirmation last year.  </P> <P> Bush has held two meetings this month with civil rights leaders alarmed at the  recent wave of racial bombings and threats in the South. NAACP leaders on  Monday urged the President to step up the Justice Department's efforts to  promote racial understanding through community outreach offices.  </P> <P> Dunne, 59, of Garden City, N.Y., has a sparse background on civil rights and  consistently received low ratings from the New York Civil Liberties Union for  votes cast while in the state Senate.  </P> <P> After some reports that Dunne was in line for the civil rights post, he  resigned from the all-male Garden City Golf Club, which he had belonged to for  32 years.  </P> <P> During most of his 24 years in the state Legislature, a part-time post, Dunne  lived in Albany at the Fort Orange Club, which until 1988 barred women as  members.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, he has the backing of Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel, an old  friend and the most powerful black member of New York's congressional  delegation. Dunne is white.  </P> <P> "If the President has to pick a Republican, he couldn't pick a more decent  person than John Dunne," Rangel said in a recent interview.  </P> <P> Dunne also has the active support of Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh.  </P> <P> A graduate of Georgetown University and Yale Law School, Dunne resigned his  legislative seat last September after losing a contest for majority leader in  the Republican-controlled state Senate. He is a partner in a Uniondale, N.Y.,  law firm.  </P> <P> During his state Senate career, Dunne was better known for his role in drafting  environmental and corrections legislation, although he served on the Judiciary  Committee, which handles such matters as civil rights.  </P></p>

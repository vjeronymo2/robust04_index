			<p>BFN     [Text] A tense situation has reached a climax surrounding  the nuclear issue with the break in the negotiations with North  Korea on the nuclear fuel rods. In this connection, the  government plans to request the United Nations to actively  pressure North Korea to change its attitude.    A government authority said that the Chinese Government will  not be able to oppose the principle that North Korea must reveal  the actual condition of the past nuclear developments by  accepting the inspection of its fuel rods. He said that since  the Chinese Government's position will also be difficult if the  North Korean issue is discussed on a full-scale at the United  Nations, it is expected that the Chinese Government will play an  active role as mediator to induce North Korea to change its  attitude.    He also said that there is still some room for resolving  this  issue through dialogue, but warned that if North Korea makes it  so that the actual condition of the past nuclear developments  cannot be examined because it replaces its fuel rods,  discussions will be held for taking sanctions immediately at the  UN level.</p>

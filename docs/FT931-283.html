			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Vitaly Churkin arrives in Belgrade Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister and special envoy to the peace talks, arrived in Belgrade yesterday in order to add his voice to international pressure on Serb leaders to endorse the UN peace plan for Bosnia, writes Laura Silber. He was due to meet Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic to press for Serbia's support for the proposal, drawn up by international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, to divide Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces. Western diplomats believed Mr Churkin would threaten withdrawal of support by Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia. Moslem and Croat leaders from Bosnia have already endorsed the plan. Mr Churkin's visit coincides with public support in Serbia for the Russian nationalist opponents of President Boris Yeltsin's administration. Said one western diplomat: 'He will urge Serbia to make a constructive suggestion if they expect anything from Russia at the UN.' The Russian minister will go on today to Pale, the Serb mountain fiefdom, for talks with the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and then to nearby Sarajevo to meet President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia. Mr Aleksa Buha, the foreign minister of the self-styled Serb state in Bosnia, said the parliament might accept the Vance-Owen plan but seek additional amendments.</p>

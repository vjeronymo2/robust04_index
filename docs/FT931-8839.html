			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Outokumpu tries to salvage Pechenga smelter project DESPERATE attempts are being made to salvage a Dollars 640m project to renovate one of the world's biggest polluters, the Pechenga nickel smelter on Russia's Kola peninsula, near the Finnish border. The scheme was first aborted in March last year because of Russia's financial problems but was resurrected when Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group acting as technical manager of the proposed project, reinstated its tender - Dollars 600m for smelter renovation and Dollars 40m on infrastructure. Outokumpu said yesterday that it had not proved possible to reduce the cost of the project any further, so recent efforts had concentrated on reducing the amount of foreign currency Russia would need by establishing how much equipment could be supplied from that country. This study would be completed early next month and then the proposals would be considered by the Nordic governments. Finland and Norway have promised environmental grants of up to Dollars 100m towards the project and, with Sweden, have said they would provide loans for the rest of the required investment. If Russian remained short of foreign currency, Outokumpu would be willing to take up to Dollars 100m of nickel a year and would help repay the banks. Pechenga spews out about 284,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide a year. Some falls on the nearby town of Nikel but prevailing winds take two-thirds across Finland and Norway where the acid rain it causes has severely damaged forests. The project would cut sulphur dioxide emissions to only 15,800 tonnes and enable Russia to meet the undertaking (first given by the Soviet Union) to halve emissions in the Finnish border area. Equally important, from Russia's point of view, the project would provide the Norilsk nickel group, one of the country's most reliable and successful exporters, with a new smelter. Western observers suggest that the present Pechenga smelter, established in the 1930s and renovated in the 1940s, has only a few years of life left. Pechenga produces about 100,000 tonnes a year of nickel in matte (an intermediate material), which is sent to Montshegorsk for refining. At first the pollution abatement scheme was to have cost more than Dollars 1bn and to have included Montshegorsk but this proved to be economically impossible because of transport problems. Outokumpu said yesterday there had been little progress in negotiations with the Russians in the past year. 'But we are trying to make ourselves useful, whatever route they choose,' said an official. Outokumpu has spent between Dollars 3m and Dollars 5m so far on the project.</p>

UN patrols due to start as early as Saturday will be  accompanied by unarmed Croats and Moslems, said Major Rob  Annink, a spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR).  Starting Saturday talks will also be held on opening up six  routes to cross the frontlines.    The report comes a day after Bosnian army General Muslimovic  and his counterpart, General Vrbanac of the Bosnian Croat HVO  [Croatian Defense Council] force, agreed on the terms of the  patrols.    UN peacekeepers will be deployed immediately at the  Croat-Moslem hotspots of Mostar, Vitez, Gorni Vakuf, Prozor,  Konjic, and Jablanica where ceasefire violations have been  rampant, said UNPROFOR spokesman Major Guy Vinet. Under the  Moslem-Croat agreement all checkpoints manned by HVO and Bosnian  army troops will come under UN control, Vinet added. [passage  omitted]    Meanwhile in Vienna, representatives of the Moslem-led  Bosnian government and Croats were due to open talks at the U.S.  embassy at 3:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) Friday on the fineprint of how  to establish a federation.    Bosnian Justice Minister Kasem Trnka will head the  government  delegation while the Croat delegation will be headed by Deputy  Croatian Foreign Minister Sanader Ivo. U.S. special envoy on  ex-Yugoslavia Charles Redman will also attend.    A high-level transitional committee has been charged with  drafting a constitution for the Croat-Moslem federation as well  as the outlines of a confederal arrangement linking the proposed  alliance with the Republic of Croatia.    The committee in addition will try to forge a military  accord  between Bosnian Moslems and Croats and an agreement on the shape  of governmental structures in the proposed federation. The  talks here are expected to last around 10 days. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH AIDE LOBBIED HER FORMER DEPT. FOR CLIENT;  </P> <P> BUSH AIDE SOUGHT FUNDS FROM FORMER DEPARTMENT  </P> <P> U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills, a former secretary of Housing  and Urban Development, lobbied her old department on behalf of a real estate  firm trying to win federal subsidies, her spokeswoman confirmed.  </P> <P> "They hired her because of her expertise. I don't see a story in it," Clair  Buchan said Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Hills represented Swezy Realty in 1987 and 1988 when she was in private  practice as a lawyer in Washington.  </P> <P> The two projects were in Florida's Dade and Broward counties.  </P> <P> Buchan said she believed that one project won funds and one was not approved,  and she did not know their names or which was successful. She also said she did  not know how much money was sought, or what Hills' fee was.  </P> <P> The New York Times reported in its editions today that Hills reported a fee of  at least $5,000 from Swezy in her January financial disclosure form.  </P> <P> Hills is the first prominent Republican in the Bush Administration known to  have acted as a lobbyist for developers seeking HUD "moderate rehabilitation"  funds under the Reagan Administration. The program is being investigated by  Congress after revelations that well-connected developers won tens of millions  of dollars in aid.  </P> <P> Many Republican campaign advisers and former officials out of office, such as  former Interior Secretary James G. Watt and former Massachusetts Sen. Edward  Brooke, won six-figure fees for telephone calls to HUD officials on behalf of  their clients.  </P> <P> Many of these consultants had no particular expertise in housing.  </P></p>

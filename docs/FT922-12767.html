			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: RMC declines further to Pounds 167m - Squeeze on margins and higher interest charges behind the fall FALLING DEMAND for ready-mixed concrete in the UK hit RMC Group's profits for the second year running, with the pre-tax figure of Pounds 167m in 1991 down from Pounds 216m in 1990 and Pounds 248m in 1989. However, the group proposes a slightly higher final dividend of 13.4p to give a total of 20p (19.3p). The dividend is covered 1.8 times by earnings per share of 36p (57.9p). The shares rose 22p in response to 606p. Last September when the group reported interim results, Mr Jim Owen, managing director, said that RMC would do well to match the 1991 profits in 1992. Mr Derek Jenkins, finance director, said yesterday that that view still held, although he confessed to being 'a bit confident'. Group sales were 8 per cent up at Pounds 2.8bn, but operating profits fell by 16 per cent to Pounds 195m, reflecting a squeeze on margins. Associates, mainly the company in Israel, contributed Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 4.1m). Interest charges rose from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 33.9m. Mr Jenkins said that reflected a full year of financing the acquisition in eastern Germany made at the end of 1990, and the capital expenditure programme of Pounds 248m in 1991 (Pounds 311m). Interest cover was still 5.9 times (11.9). The tax rate rose to 35.2 per cent (32.7 per cent) because of the higher proportion of profits made in Germany, and minorities rose from Pounds 33.2m to Pounds 38.5m again mainly reflecting the rise in German profits. Operating profits from the UK fell 61 per cent to Pounds 34.9m, on sales 12 per cent lower at Pounds 903.6m. Mr Jenkins said that the UK businesses all suffered. Ready-mixed volumes were down about 20 per cent and a further 5 per cent fall might be seen in 1992. However, he said reductions in capacity by RMC and its competitors were beginning to arrest the fall in prices. There was some hope that housing activity might pick up following the election result, and this would help the group's Great Mills DIY stores. But Mr Jenkins said he saw no recovery in commercial building until 1993. In Germany operating profits rose 26 per cent to Pounds 90.4m on sales up 32 per cent to Pounds 926.7m. Mr Jenkins said that forecasts of slower economic growth in Germany did not take account of expansion in eastern Germany where RMC is building a cement plant and increasing the number of ready mix plants it has. He said RMC hoped to at least maintain its German profits in 1992. Elsewhere in the EC, operating profits fell 3.2 per cent to Pounds 55.1m as lower profits from the Irish Republic, Belgium and the Netherlands offset good performances in France and Spain. Other countries, such as Israel and Austria, increased profits from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 14.2m. The group's balance sheet showed net debt of Pounds 326m (Pounds 220m) if the Pounds 78m convertible capital bond is treated as debt rather than equity. The bonds, which mature in 2006, have a conversion price of 810p. Shareholders funds were Pounds 695m (Pounds 662m) and minority interests Pounds 225m (Pounds 179m). See Lex</p>

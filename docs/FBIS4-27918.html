			<p>BFN     [Text] The outline of a report on the desired nature of  the industrial structure in the 21st century has been revealed.  This is a report compiled by an advisory committee for the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry by the Basic Issues  Subcommittee of the Council for Industrial Structure (chaired by  Kotaro Tsujimura). The report designates 12 areas as new and  growing markets: housing, information/communications, energy,  environment, medical/welfare, circulation/distribution, life  culture/leisure, improvement of urban environment, international  exchange, utilization of human resources, support for business,  and new technology for new products. It also recommends further  deregulation and strengthening of the policy to promote  competition in each of these fields. Moreover, it proposes a  shift of the industrial structure away from one dependent on  export industries, such as automobiles and household appliances,  to one determined by domestic demand. It points out that the  smooth transfer of labor among industries is also indispensable  and seeks an active policy for mobility in the labor market.  The Council for Industrial Structure is scheduled to complete  its final report on 16 June. Preceding that, the Council's  Basic Issues Subcommittee will hold a joint meeting on 31 May  with the Special Committee, which is in charge of administrative  arrangements for the final report, and will firm up the outline.    What is noteworthy in the report's content is that the  industrial policy, which up until now has centered on the  supplier (enterprises, public corporations, and so on), is  changed, and a new consumer-oriented point of view is adopted.  As for the hollowing of industries, with the premise of a high  yen and the correction of the domestic-overseas price gap, it  takes the position that we should not worry excessively about  it. That is because "the move, to some extent, to overseas as  an alternative to importing (hollowing) is a structural  adjustment itself."    On the whole, the report proposes that policies are  necessary  for: 1) macroeconomic measures which are centered around front-  loaded enforcement of improvements in social overhead capital;  2) microeconomic reforms such as deregulation, correction of the  domestic-overseas price gap, and so on; and 3) smooth  restructuring (restructuring of enterprises), improvement of the  capital procurement market for the growth of new industries, and  so on. If these were to be realized, the real growth rate for  the Japanese economy would be about 3.2 percent annually until  the year 2000. Thereafter, it would be able to maintain about  2.4 percent, and the ratio of the current account surplus to the  gross national product (GNP) would be held to between one and  two percent.    As for housing, among the new/growing markets, it sets a  target for housing costs to be reduced to two thirds of the  current figure (90,000 yen [Y] to Y120,000 per square meter) and  space to be increased by 30 percent (to 40 square meters per  person). This will be done through a review of zoning  regulations and promotion of the introduction of imported  residential buildings which, in turn, will result from reform of  construction standards.    As for the utilization of human resources, to accomodate the  aging population and women's new role in society, the principles  of of the Employment Stability Law's prohibitory regulations  which govern employment agencies are to be reviewed. And at the  same time, the type of jobs to which human resources can be  allocated are to be increased. Further, the tax laws which  involve severance pay and annuities, which have been  disadvantageous for people who change jobs, are to be reformed.  And a diverse employment situation which also includes  non-long term and nonsecure employment is to be developed, and  fluidity in the labor market is to be advanced.    The report takes up deregulation as a significant subject  among new industrial policies. In addition to housing/land,  information/communications, and import promotion, which the  Headquarters for Administrative Reform Promotion is now  studying, the report points out that the field of  finance/securities/insurance should be examined.    Besides deregulation, it mentions the promotion of  competition. It calls for examination of Anti-Monopoly Law  violations as possible causes for a demand to cease undesirable  practices under terms of the Unfair Competition Prevention Law.  Furthermore, it advocates review of prohibitory rules for  bonafide share-holding companies and of merger regulations.  Further, it seeks to improve the corporation partition  provision of the Commercial Law, and to simplify procedures for  the merger/transfer of operations.    As for the nurturing of new industries, it says that reform  of the finance/capital market is indispensable for  diversification of capital fund procurement measures.</p>

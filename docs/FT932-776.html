			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's The repercussions of crisis at Lloyd's spread far beyond the individual Names now being asked to pick up the pieces of past mistakes. The thumping Pounds 3bn loss on Lloyd's 1990 underwriting account announced this week, with another Pounds 1bn deficit forecast for business written in 1991, is causing a serious erosion of underwriting capacity. Far from creating opportunities for other insurers which write international risks in London, business is being driven elsewhere. It is in the wider interest of the City, then, that Lloyd's shrinkage is reversed. With premium rates increasing and tighter underwriting standards in place, business now being written should show decent profits. The 25 per cent average return on capital - including underwriting and investment returns - targeted in Lloyd's business plan does not look unduly optimistic. But neither is it generous, given the level of risk. A quoted Lloyd's fund of the type planned by Sedgwick might attract investors on the basis of such returns. Corporate investors putting money into Lloyd's through less liquid vehicles will be looking for something more. Professional investors will fancy their chances of beating the average, notably by picking winners among the underwriting syndicates. But the sums are finely balanced. If the entry cost for corporate capital is set too high  -or if future returns are diluted by the cost of borrowing to subsidise past losses - there is a danger that Lloyd's will be starved of new blood.</p>

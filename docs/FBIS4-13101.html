			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lebanese villages just north of the occupied  border strip came under further Israeli attacks today. The  eastern hills of Kafr Rumman were shelled from the position of  the occupation forces in al-Dabshah at 1500 today. Majdal Silm  and Wadi al-Saluqi came under shell fire at noon today. Israeli  planes overflew the central sector, al-Nabatiyah, and Iqlim  al-Tuffah.    Security reports tell about a massacre in 'Aramta last  night.  The details are as follows: About 20 Lahd [South Lebanese Army]  militiamen entered 'Aramta, firing wildly in all directions.  The militiamen then broke into houses and wantonly shot several  citizens, killing four and wounding several others, including  Jihad Hikmat Jarjah and Fu'ad Jandal Yunus. Two bodies are yet  to be identified.    The Lahd militia then took the town's entire population of  70--many had already deserted the town--to Jazzin, where they  were made to sleep outdoors. Today, the occupation forces and  their agents took the 'Aramta inhabitants from Jazzin to Marj  'Uyun to question them about resistance fighters. The women  were then released, but the men are still in custody. [passage  omitted]</p>

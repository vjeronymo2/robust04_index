He said a statesman must foresee criticism regarding  electoral activity, and he, in effect, has planned several  strategies that he will not disclose due to obvious reasons. He  ruled out resorting to undemocratic activities such as  dissolving Congress.    De Leon Carpio's remarks were made merely 10 days before  approximately 3.5 million Guatemalans of voting age will  participate in the first referendum of its kind in the country's  political history.    After noting that he has prepared some "strategies" if the  popular consultation fails, the reporters repeatedly asked him  what will be the nature of these strategies, and the president  said only: "You will learn about them in due time."    De Leon Carpio also ruled out that the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal will prohibit departmental tours, because his duty is  to deliver the 8-percent constitutional fund to the  municipalities and not to campaign for the yes vote, much less  use state resources as speculated by certain people, he  explained.    "I trust that the results will be favorable, because the  people do not want vices to continue at Congress and the Supreme  Court. In fact, ever since I assumed office, they have been  demanding a purge in the three [as published] organizations," he  said.    He said he respects the position of various popular sectors,  including the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG), an  organization that is urging a no vote. De Leon Carpio says the  consultation will be a civic celebration in which all sectors  will participate.    De Leon Carpio rejected pressures from public employees who,  he said, are asking for a salary increase in exchange for not  interfering in the popular consultation. Regarding the energy  policy, he said electricity rates have not yet been established.    In conclusion, the president agreed with Vice President  Arturo Herbruger Asturias who said "to vote no is to be totally  insane."</p>

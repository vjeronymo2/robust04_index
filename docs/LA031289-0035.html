			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLEASURES OF THE ROAD;  </P> <P> FIT FOR A KING;  </P> <P> THIS FERRARI, CUSTOM-CRAFTED FOR A MONARCH TO GUIDE ALONG THE STREETS OF  CALIFORNIA, IS A LIMITED-EDITION SPECTACULAR  </P> <P> Certain automobiles seem to radiate a sense of regality, a to-the-manor-born  assurance that sets them apart from their more mundane relatives of the road.  And no motorcars exhibit more regal grace than those bearing the name of the  late Enzo Ferrari. The master craftsman's touch was much in evidence when he  produced his 1958 250GT Series I. A mere 36 were built, each outfitted a bit  differently by coach builder Pininfarina, and the client list was indeed royal.  The V-12 cabriolet pictured here (yes, that's two views of one car,  photographed at UC Irvine) was first seen at Italy's 1958 Turin Salon, where it  caught the eye of Iraq's King Faisal, who purchased it and shipped it to the  United States, planning to drive it on his visits to Southern California.  However, Faisal was assassinated before he ever got behind the wheel and the  car subsequently went through a series of owners. Today, it's the property of  John and Linda Clinard of Irvine.

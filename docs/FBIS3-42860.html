The Communists of Lithuania  will duly facilitate the implementation of these proposals for  the benefit of the working people. Respectfully yours..."--these  are the words opening a letter from...Mikolas Burokevicius to  Prime Minister of Lithuania A. Slezevicius on the occasion of  the third anniversary of 13 January.    The document of the Communists narrates: "The renewal and  development of the Communist Party of Lithuania in the republic.  It is necessary to restore in Lithuania the political power of  the working people as represented by the soviets; while  implementing democracy consistently, to restore the national  economy and develop production; and to radically improve the  standard of living of the people." It is indicated in what  manner the improvement in the standard of living of the  population is to be achieved: "To undertake initiatives aimed at  urgently convening a conference of the heads of governments of  all or most of the former Soviet republics."    Having generously shared wise ideas with the head of the  Government of Lithuania, M. Burokevicius completes his program  for overcoming the crisis with the demand "to cancel the ban on  the activities of the Communist Party and stop the judicial  persecution of it, political blackmail, and moral terror against  Communists."    During the days of the restoration congress of the Communist  Party of the Soviet Union, which was held in April of last year,  the leader of the Lithuanian Communists, who was elected to the  Central Committee and was in hiding outside of Lithuania,  responded to questions from LETUVOS RITAS correspondent V.  Bartusevicius. He boasted of having restored the entire party  structure: "Even our secretariat operates in Lithuania."    Last year a few issues of the newspaper TARIBU LIETUVA  (Soviet Lithuania) in the Lithuanian and Russian languages were  published in neighboring Belarus. The headlines were "Awaken  Those Who Sleep" and "Resistance Will Grow." The text was not  short on propaganda, either: "It is necessary to go to the  inactive, passive trade unions. In instances where it is  impossible to bring them to life, new trade unions should be  created.... to engage in picketing, to prepare petitions....  Occupation strikes during which workers seize plants are  particularly effective."    It appears that at all times, occupation was the guarantee  of  the accomplishments of the Communist Party. During these days  Lithuania is honoring the victims of one of the breaches in the  occupation.</p>

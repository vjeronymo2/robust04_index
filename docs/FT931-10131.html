			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Letter: Credit not where credit's due Sir, Sir Teddy Taylor, in quoting that 'strange singer' Bob Marley at the Young Conservatives conference, was in fact misplacing the credit for the line he chose (''Yobs' blow loud Euro-raspberry at Major', February 8). 'Stand up for your rights' in this context comes from the song 'Get Up, Stand Up', written by Marley's friend Peter Tosh who was murdered in Jamaica in 1987. I would draw Sir Teddy's attention to the very fine solo works of Mr Tosh, which for many articulated the messages of Rastafarianism and anti-racism more potently and coherently even than Marley himself.

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK gilts Government borrowing figures released yesterday confirm that public sector finances are in a mess. Not too much can be read into the sharp increase in expenditure during September, since this is a volatile figure. More worrying for the gilts market are signs that the recessionary squeeze on revenue is accelerating: income tax receipts were sharply lower last month, reflecting falls in employment. It is surprising that gilts should treat this news with such equanimity. Deepening gloom about the prospects for growth and equities may be an explanation, prompting institutions to switch into bonds. Interesting, though, that long gilts should rise again after yesterday's base rate cut. The continued demand for index-linked gilts - evidenced by yesterday's Pounds 400m issue - certainly suggests the market retains a healthy degree of scepticism about the chancellor's promise to bear down on inflation. Without firm action to bring the PSBR under control, the gilts market may find its optimism impossible to maintain. PSBR forecasts of more than Pounds 40bn next year may be premature, but funding on anywhere near this scale would place upward pressure on yields. The government may conclude that higher long gilt yields are a small price to pay for the political advantage of lower mortgage rates. A deficit of perhaps 6 per cent of gross domestic product would be easy to fund if the markets had confidence in the government and in sterling. Both commodities are in short supply.</p>

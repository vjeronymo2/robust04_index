			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Observer: Major rethink As their continental brethren survey the shards of the EMS, British politicians have been exceeding even their usual propensity to rewrite history with the latest round of 'I told you so's'. Euro-enthusiast Kenneth Clarke indulged in it on the way to Brussels on Sunday, while John Major recalled his warning last autumn of the 'fault-lines' which had led to sterling's ejection. Anyone would have thought the lot of them had stage-managed Black Wednesday down to the last second - instead of spending oodles of taxpayers' money trying hopelessly to man the defences. Lady Thatcher, by contrast, has something of a genuine claim to gloat. Observer recalls an animated conversation with the Iron Lady more than three years ago when she detailed how German reunification would rip the system apart. But she will be disinclined to trumpet her prescience; it was, after all, she who failed to talk her then chancellor, Major, out of the idea, hence landing Britain in there in the first place.</p>

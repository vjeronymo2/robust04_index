The accounts will then be shown to Mr Alphandery so that he can finalise the rescue package. Officials declined to comment on French press reports that the Caisse des Depots, the state financial institution, would participate in the capital injection together with Thomson, the electronics group that owns 21.6 per cent of Credit Lyonnais.

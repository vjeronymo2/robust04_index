			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: Whizz-kids in greener pastures - Lucia van der Post on the growing band of born-again craftsmen IF THE recession has meant gloomy times for some, it has also offered new opportunities to others. Many of those bright young things who used to earn telephone-number salaries that they never had time to spend have found that there are other ways of earning a living than gazing at screens in offices. Many have started small businesses, and found a great deal of pleasure in new ways of living. All sorts of chaps who in years gone by would have been adding up figures in accountancy practices, working in banks or defending the law are these days to be found digging gardens, making furniture, framing pictures and generally discovering a great deal of fun in creating and making things with their hands. This is good news for those of us who are looking for the small and not-so-small special things that cannot be bought off-the-shelf. We are now spoilt for choice when it comes to finding people to build a cupboard for a strange-shaped corner, a table to a special size, a chair of precise dimensions. The recession has meant that craftsmen are keener than ever to give the customer exactly what he or she wants. Take Philip Hearsey, who from his base in Herefordshire heads up a small design team working in the area of architectural, interior and furniture design. I featured some of his designs on this page last year, but since then he has moved on, developed his range and his ideas and now has a richer selection than ever for potential customers to choose from. He still makes much of the furniture for the interiors he designs because run-of-the-mill production-line furniture does not fit the bill. The new range he has developed has a strong medieval character - for instance the large cabinet, photographed top right, looks for all the world as if it were hewn out of some rather solid timbers and was designed to fit into the house of a Spanish nobleman. In fact it is made from English beech, distressed and coloured, and it is the hand-forged ironwork and the heavily carved panels that gives it its strong medieval air. This particular cabinet conceals a drinks cabinet which is fitted with brilliant blue lacquered paintwork but, of course, anybody ordering the cabinet would specify the internal requirements. The price varies, depending upon the fittings, but the cabinet alone would be about Pounds 3,000. One of the qualities of Philip Hearsey's work is its air of strength and solidity, much of which comes from the abundant use of hand-forged metal components - the result of the relationships he has built up with other workshops and craftspeople all over the UK. Whilst he will take on all sorts of commissions - whether for whole buildings and all the fitments, large cabinets or complete kitchens - I am possibly most attracted to his smaller pieces of furniture. Occasional tables are a notoriously difficult area if dinky nests and glass-topped steel-legged versions are not your taste - Philip Hearsey provides some wonderful options. There is, for instance, a beautifully turned piece of solid elm or oak, 375 mm in diameter, 450 mm high, which doubles as a stool or table, for Pounds 464.13. There is the Tom-tom, a huge lump of turned elm settled into a four-legged stand, for Pounds 605. Hearsey works in metal, wood, stone or granite and uses them to create pieces that have great strength and originality. His small tables with wrought-iron bases and glass or wood tops, sometimes carved, sometimes plain, would be very useful in halls or as side tables and are completely different from anything else I have seen on the market. Philip Hearsey can be contacted at Monkhall Court, Callow, Hereford HRT 8DA. Tel: 0432-351170, or, in London, 071-244-9825. David Savage is another furniture maker who, though he makes a lot of special one-off pieces, has a recognisable hand-writing to his work. He always has available a range of chairs and tables which can be seen and ordered at 21 Westcombe Lane, Bideford, Devon EX39 3JQ, and other examples of his work can be seen at The Design and Decoration Building, 107a Pimlico Road, London SW1W 8PH. He works a great deal in English hardwoods such as sycamore, pear or yew. The particular piece photographed bottom right was originally specially commissioned and was made from solid yew. The client asked for a 'simple but elegant occasionable table that could be used as a dining table in the traditional Japanese manner.' Many of his European clients liked the design and found that the height worked well alongside a traditional upholstered sofa, so he has now incorporated it into his standard range. Available in different sizes and timbers, it costs about Pounds 1,950. Rupert Senior and Charles Wheeler-Carmichael have been designing and making individual pieces of furniture to special commission for several years. Their pieces range from a conference table seating 28 delegates to a four-poster bed and the child's chair photographed far left. This is slightly different as it is produced in a limited edition. Made from timber salvaged from the 'Great Storm of 1987' they call it the Lilliput chair, and they hope it will prove popular as a Christmas, birthday or christening present. The Lilliput chair costs Pounds 535.00 plus VAT and is available from Senior Carmichael, Whitehouse Workshop, Church Street, Betchworth, Surrey RH3 7DN. Tel: 0737-844316.</p>

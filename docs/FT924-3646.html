			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Russian congress converts no-one to democracy 'DEPUTIES: get rid of this government of Chicago gangsters,' read the telegram pinned on the notice-board at the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow. But most Russians, concentrating on a struggle for survival, are indifferent to the drama which will continue to unfold this week in the Kremlin as the full parliament continues to fight President Boris Yeltsin's painful economic reforms. 'I don't trust anybody,' was how one army officer, who moonlights as a security guard to feed his family, summed up the feelings of many Russians. Although many of the deputies' complaints reflect real popular grievances, congress proposals for action adopted at the weekend either defend narrow vested interests - such as the state farms - or make potentially disastrous populist promises. An attempt to set up a system of parliamentary government, narrowly defeated at the weekend, would have led to chronically unstable cabinets that would have plunged the country further into crisis. Not surprising, an opinion poll quoted by Ostankino television found that while 57 per cent of the population is dissatisfied with the government, 59 per cent is also dissatisfied with parliament. The high point of last week's proceedings, a punch-up between deputies, spoke volumes of the absurdity of an institution which is only formally democratic. If anything, its performance has served to encourage popular disillusionment with democratic practice. Elected in the days of communist domination of society, its unwieldy 1,000-plus membership makes it even more open to manipulation than the smaller standing parliament, the Supreme Soviet. The parliamentary chairman, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, a power-hungry figure promoted by Mr Yeltsin to the latter's subsequent regret, cuts an equally paradoxical figure as standard-bearer of democracy. Pursuing his own personal power struggle by promoting the failed attempt to deprive the president of the right to form the government, he will resume the offensive by backing calls for Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar's removal today and promising new trouble when the congress next meets in April.</p>

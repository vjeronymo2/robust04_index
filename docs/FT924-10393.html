			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: A step ahead of the trackers - Diary of a Private Investor SHARE PICKING while watching an index can be profitable. As a private investor, I welcome the introduction, earlier this month, of two new FT-SE indices. The FT-SE mid 250 Index comprises, as its name suggests, 250 large to medium size UK companies which rank, in market capitalisation terms, below the 100 companies included in the longer established FT-SE 100 Index. The new FT-SE 350 index combines the companies in both indices. In recent years there has been a rapid growth in 'tracker funds' where some unit trusts and other institutional fund managers have 'tracked' an index, buying shares in companies that are included in that index. If the market suddenly falls, at least tracker fund managers can tell their clients that their performance has not been very much worse than the index. In the US, tracker funds account for more than 25 per cent of institutional fund investment and in the UK an increasing number of pension funds have at least part of their assets in funds which track an index. This has meant, for example, that shares in companies that are removed from the FT-SE 100 Index tend to suffer a further drop in their share price as tracker fund managers sell them. Similarly, there is sometimes a useful 'bounce' in the price of shares in companies which are promoted to the index. For example, in October 1990 Dalgety's share price increased by 6p when it was announced that it was being included in the FT-SE 100 to replace the then-suspended Polly Peck; while Burton Group fell 6p on being demoted. Companies are removed from the FT-SE 100 Index when their market capitalisation has fallen by so much that it appears they are no longer likely to be regarded as one of the largest UK companies. Others are promoted as their share prices rise, increasing their market capitalisation to the level of acceptance within that index. Some companies that are removed from the index never recover - like British and Commonwealth and Maxwell Communications. Others manage, eventually, to bounce back into the index or at least remain profitable and well regarded. The current constituents of the FT-SE 100 Index range from Glaxo in first position with a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 23bn to BET at the bottom, with a capitalisation of more than Pounds 900m. It takes a substantial number of shares to change hands in companies of this size for the share price to rise or fall sharply. But look at the lower reaches of the new FT-SE mid 250 index. While S G Warburg is in first position, with a market capitalisation of over Pounds 1bn and likely to be promoted into the FT-SE 100 Index, there are a number of companies at the bottom end, like AMEC, Simon Engineering, Laura Ashley and Leigh Interests, which have market capitalisations of less than Pounds 150m. It would not take huge amounts of buying and selling to affect their share price. Even more interesting is the reserve list of companies which are being monitored by those responsible for compiling the index with a view to including them should any of the existing members have to be removed. It seems to me that this reserve list provides opportunities for profit by the astute private investor. If a company on the reserve list is promoted to the index it ought to attract the attention of tracker fund managers who will have to buy shares in it to match the index. Inclusion in the index also brings extra attention to the company which ought also to be initially helpful to the company's share price. The organisers of the FT-SE mid 250 index stated, after their quarterly review meeting on September 9, that the following companies were on the reserve list for possible future inclusion in the index: Betterware, EIS Group, Cray Electronic, Waddington, Wagon Industrial Holdings, Temple Bar Investment Trust, Daejan Holdings, TT Group, Renishaw, Scholl, American Trust and Davis Service Group. Not all of these companies will necessarily make the index, but I will certainly be keeping an eye on them and following the details of their market capitalisations as listed on the share price pages of the Financial Times. I am hoping to spot the companies next in line for promotion in the hope that if they make the index their share price will rise by a useful percentage. Initially, such share price rises may not be too great as there are not many tracker funds following the FT-SE mid 250 index. But as the number of such funds grows, so the opportunities of making a profit increase. The existence of this new index ought also to bring more attention to companies already in it, such as Pentland Group and Photo-Me, in which my personal pension scheme already has holdings and harbours hopes that they will progress. However, it should be remembered that not all companies included in an index may stay there. A company could be badly managed and initially have its share price sustained by a small number of fund managers following an index, rather than looking too closely at the underlying value of the company. At least the FT-SE mid 250 index focuses more attention on some companies where growth may well out-perform the average. But why buy shares in all 250 companies when you can pick and choose the best. A tracker fund will have the excellent performance of a few considerably diluted by the poorer performance of the rest?</p>

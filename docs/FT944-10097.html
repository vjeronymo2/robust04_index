			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Reprieve for herbal remedies Selling herbal remedies will continue to be legal, the government announced yesterday, quelling fears that selling ancient herbal treatments would be outlawed under a European Union directive. Under the 1968 Medicines Act, herbal cures are exempt from licensing requirements. But the Medicines Control Agency - the executive agency of the Department of Health which licenses drugs and medicines for sale in the UK - found no exemption for herbal medicines in a series of EU directives. Last month it announced that it would enforce the new regulations from January 1, requiring the licensing of thousands of products - thought to be used by about 5m people a year. It was feared that the expense of compliance would have done serious damage to an industry which employs about 3,000 people with a turnover of about Pounds 300m a year. Medical herbalists had also warned that this could create a dangerous underground trade. Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said yesterday that the relevant EU directive required herbal medicines to be licensed if 'industrially produced' - a term not defined in UK or European law. 'The government believes that those herbal medicines currently exempt under UK law are made according to a number of traditional processes that fall outside the interpretation of an industrial process,' he said. 'As a result they can be exempted from the new legislation.' Homeopathic medicines are licensed under separate EU directives and their position is not affected.</p>

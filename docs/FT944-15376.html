			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / A pact shaped in distrust: The US-North Korea nuclear accord When the US and North Korea sign their nuclear agreement on Friday, it will set in motion a train of events that could last almost a decade before the dispute is completely settled. The goal is to remove suspicions about North Korea's nuclear programme while breaking Pyongyang's diplomatic isolation and providing it with much-needed economic aid in the form of new nuclear reactors and other energy supplies. The accord consists of phased steps designed to provide each side with leverage to make sure that the other adheres to its promises. This reflects the deep mutual distrust which exists between the US and North Korea and which prevented an agreement being reached earlier. Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, yesterday described the agreement as a combination of steps in an 'incremental process'. The elements of the deal, details of which will be announced on Friday, include North Korea abandoning its nuclear programme and accepting full international inspections of its nuclear facilities in return for improved ties with the US and economic aid. Pyongyang also promises to resume negotiations with South Korea on the implementation of their 1991 non-nuclear pact. Many pitfalls lie along the way, with parts of the carefully calibrated timetable remaining unclear. The first steps are likely in the next month or two. They include North Korea returning to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and accepting ad hoc and regular inspections at its Yongbyon nuclear complex from the International Atomic Energy Agency. North Korea threatened to withdraw from the NPT in March 1993 and later 'suspended' its treaty obligations, which provoked its confrontation with the US and South Korea. At the same time, North Korea will freeze its programme. This includes suspending the operation of its 5MW graphite reactor and halting construction of two larger 50MW and 200MW reactors, which can produce considerable amounts of weapons-grade plutonium. It will also close its suspected nuclear reprocessing centre. All these facilities are later to be dismantled. North Korea will place in dry storage spent fuel that it withdrew from its 5MW reactor last spring. The fuel, which could produce enough plutonium for four or five nuclear bombs, will later be transferred to a third country for reprocessing. But Pyongyang will only accept at a later stage special inspections by the IAEA to determine if it had reprocessed plutonium for one or two nuclear bombs in 1989. The IAEA wants to examine two undeclared nuclear waste dumps to answer this question. The special inspection demand triggered North Korea's threatened withdrawal from the NPT and lies at the core of the dispute. North Korea may only allow the special inspections once equipment for new and safer light-water reactors is delivered over the next several years, but before they are completely built. North Korea has agreed to resume negotiations with South Korea on their 1991 de-nuclearisation treaty. However, South Korea is demanding inspections that are more intrusive than those to be conducted by the IAEA, and prospects for those talks remain uncertain. Disagreements over South Korea's demand for spot or challenge inspections of suspected nuclear facilities in the North led to the breakdown of the talks in 1992. In return for the North Korean concessions, the US has offered several promises. They include a guarantee to provide North Korea with two 1,000MW light-water reactors and alternative energy supplies while they are being constructed during the next decade. This would help solve North Korea's chronic energy shortage, which has been one of the main reasons for its declining economy. The light-water reactors are dependent on imported enriched uranium for fuel, making it easier for the US and other countries to maintain control over the future North Korean nuclear programme. They also produce plutonium less suitable for the manufacturing of atomic weapons. The current graphite reactors use uranium mined in North Korea. The light-water reactors will be supplied by an international consortium, probably led by the US. But the reactors are expected to be built by South Korean companies using a Westinghouse design. Seoul will also provide the bulk of the financing for the Dollars 4bn project, although contributions are also expected from Japan and other countries, according to Mr Han. In the meantime, North Korea will start receiving heavy fuel oil fuel supplies from an international consortium to replace energy lost from the shutdown of the graphite reactors. The US has also promised to improve ties with North Korea by establishing liaison offices. It is also expected to ease its trade embargo against North Korea and possibly offer a pledge not to launch a nuclear attack against North Korea, a guarantee Pyongyang has long sought. However, the pace of US-North Korean negotiations may be determined by progress in the inter-Korean talks, although Mr Han said there were 'not one-to-one preconditional constraints' between the two. South Korean has insisted on linking the resumption of inter-Korean talks with the US-North Korean accord out of concern that Pyongyang is trying to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington on the nuclear issue.</p>

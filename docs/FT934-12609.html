			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Technology: Meter readers go remote The days of the peripatetic meter reader could soon be numbered in Britain as new technologies are developed to take readings remotely and dispense with the human eye. Instead of utility officials having to enter homes, factories and offices to measure the amount of water, gas or electricity used, future readings could be taken from moving vehicles through low-power radios from transmission devices on the meters. Meters could also be read down the mains electricity network, with information sent back to users, if necessary, about new charges or rates of consumption. At present, these technologies are still in the trial stage, the main interest being shown by the water industry. Aid-Call, which makes medical alarms for the aged, will start installing its meter-reading devices later this year for tests. In the US, remote meter reading is common. But Terry Giles, Aid-Call's technical director, says tougher UK and continental European regulations and the use of different frequencies for meter-reading radios than in the US means different equipment is needed. Aid-Call, part of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the big French water and communications concern, has spent three years developing its product, called Ramar. It uses transponders to obtain the readings through low-power radio. Giles says remote metering technology needs to be cheap since so many devices have to be installed. Ramar has just gone into partnership with Kent Meters, which makes more than 7m meters a year for the world market. The companies will work on a radio-assisted, hand-held reading system capable of reading meters up to 50m away and a mobile system to obtain readings in vehicles moving at up to 30mph from distances of around 100m. In Somerset, Wessex Water plans tests on a different system developed by Remote Metering Systems, half-owned by Scottish Hydro-Electric. Tom Houston, Wessex's commercial services manager, says the trial will show whether meter reading by electricity works over long as well as short distances.</p>

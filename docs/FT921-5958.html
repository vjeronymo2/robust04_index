			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / General Motors signs joint venture deal with Poland GENERAL MOTORS, the world's largest vehicle maker, yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Polish government and FSO, the Polish state-owned car maker, for assembly of Opel cars in Warsaw, writes Kevin Done. Separately, Volkswagen and Toyota are negotiating with the Polish authorities to set up a joint venture with FSR (Fabryka Samochodow Rolniczych) for possible assembly of pick-up trucks in Poznan. The GM agreement - an important step in modernisation of the Polish auto industry - is the latest move in the company's ambitious expansion in eastern Europe. This already includes the building of a DM1bn (Pounds 346m) assembly plant at Eisenach in eastern Germany and a DM350m engine plant and small volume car assembly plant in Hungary. Under the accord, a joint venture will be set up with FSO in which the US car maker will hold a large majority stake. The new company would initially invest up to Dollars 75m in plant and equipment at the antiquated FSO plant in Warsaw for production of the Opel/Vauxhall Astra, GM's best-selling car in western Europe. Mr Robert Eaton, president of GM Europe, said a final agreement should be completed in 1-2 months. GM is planning capacity to produce a total of 35,000 Astras a year on three shifts, with initial output starting within 18 months of a final deal being signed. GM and FSO are also negotiating a more ambitious second stage, which could lead to development of a new integrated plant with capacity to produce 100,000-150,000 cars a year. GM and FSO will form a joint study team to develop a replacement model for FSO's existing, out-dated Polonez model, a hatchback derived from the Fiat 125. In a more immediate step GM said it intended a technical assistance agreement with FSO aimed at upgrading the current product and manufacturing performance for the Polonez. FSO plans to produce 78,000 Polonez cars this year. GM will also seek to develop FSO components suppliers in co-operation with its own wholly owned components subsidiaries and leading suppliers in western Europe. Volkswagen's negotiations in Poland are for a joint venture with FSR, the small light commercial vehicle maker, to assemble the Toyota Hi-Lux pick-up, which is currently assembled in small volumes under licence at VW's Hanover commercial vehicles plant. Last year VW assembled 12,017 of the pick-ups in Hanover of which 5,989 were sold under the VW Taro badge and the rest under the Toyota badge. It is understood VW and Toyota are considering a capacity of 20,000-30,000 for the pick-up venture in Poland. The GM and VW projects are essential if they are to qualify for the controversial 10,000-a-year quotas of duty-free car imports proposed by Poland under its planned free trade pact with the European Community. Poland is planning a 30,000-a-year quota of duty-free car imports to be split equally between GM, VW and Fiat. The quotas are conditional on investment contracts with Polish partners.</p>

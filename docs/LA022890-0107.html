			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ENTREPRENEURS: The editor of Irvine-based Entrepreneurial Woman, a new magazine  out this week (D1), says women want something different from a business  magazine. . . . "Women don't have as many role models as men," Rieva Lesonsky  says. "They want to hear about who is doing these things, as well as what  they're doing." . . . Elsewhere on the entrepreneurial front, Inc. magazine of  Boston rates Anaheim as the 10th-most-entrepreneurial city in the nation, based  on "job growth, business starts and proportion of high-growth companies."

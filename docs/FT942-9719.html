			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / West to relaunch Bosnia peace plan: US, EU and Russia agree new drive The foreign ministers of the US, Russia and five members of the European Union yesterday called for a four-month ceasefire between the warring parties in Bosnia and the resumption within two weeks of negotiations on a political settlement. Meeting in Geneva, the seven ministers put on an impressive show of unity over Bosnia, though it is clear that important differences of emphasis remain. In particular, the Europeans secured a reluctant endorsement from the US that any peace settlement should be based on their formula allocating 51 per cent of Bosnian territory to the newly formed Bosnian-Croat federation and 49 per cent to the Bosnian Serbs. Earlier this week the Bosnian and Croat sides agreed in Vienna on a US-brokered plan which would give their proposed federation 58 per cent of Bosnia. However, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said in Geneva yesterday that the 51/49 per cent split was 'a desirable basis on which to proceed'. US officials said privately that the 58 per cent figure was based on the 'maximum possible formula', arrived at by adding all areas where Moslems and Croats could form a majority of the population. The federation's borders would have to be determined in negotiation with the Bosnian Serbs, they noted. Mr Christopher said he thought the warring parties would attend the reconvened peace talks, to be held under the aegis of the five-nation 'contact group' (US, Russia, France, Britain and Germany). The Bosnian Serbs have said the lifting of United Nations sanctions against Serbia must be a precondition of resuming talks, a demand the ministers yesterday rejected as 'unacceptable'. The ministers, from the 'contact group' countries plus Greece and Belgium, said sanctions would be progressively eased only in response to the 'good faith implementation' of a peace settlement. The communique also calls for the ceasefire accord to include the separation of forces, the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the 'interposition' of Unprofor troops, a move which would require further reinforcement of UN peacekeepers. In Bosnia itself, fighting between Serb and Moslem forces was reported to be escalating sharply in the north of the republic. Serb sources reported heavy losses in clashes round the mouth of the Ozren pocket, a Serb mountain stronghold. It remains unclear whether yesterday's show of unity in Geneva can overcome the escalating war of words over Bosnia between politicians in Moscow and Washington. The Russian parliament yesterday urged President Boris Yeltsin to lift the arms embargo against Serbia unilaterally if any other country began sending arms to Bosnia. This was an angry response to a US Senate resolution supporting sales to the Moslem leadership in Sarajevo. The state Duma, or lower house of parliament, voted 270-1 for the resolution, which also told the Russian government to seek a negotiated end to all sanctions against rump Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro. A senior Bosnian military source acknowledged yesterday that the Moslem-led government army received raw material for ammunition from Iran and anti-tank rockets of unspecified origin, AP reports from Sarajevo. The army source claimed hundreds of anti-tank rockets, allegedly of American manufacture, reached the Croatian coast aboard a ship from Brazil.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> 2 Live Crew in Court: The debate over whether the lyrics of a recording by the  million-selling rap group 2 Live Crew are obscene moved to a higher level  Monday with the issue's first airing in federal court in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.  U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez was asked to determine whether "As Nasty as  They Wanna Be," which has been removed from store shelves in several Florida  counties, should also be banned in Broward County. The first witness to  testify, Broward Detective Sgt. Mark Wichner, said he found the recording  "explicit and degrading to the female sex." GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

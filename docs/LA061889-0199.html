			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COOK PASSES FOR 2 SCORES TO LEAD EAST TO 12-7 WIN  </P> <P> Wayne Cook of Newbury Park High passed for 190 yards and two touchdowns to lead  the East to a 12-7 victory over the West in the 16th Ventura County All-Star  game Saturday night at Hueneme High.  </P> <P> Cook, who has signed a letter of intent to play football at UCLA this fall,  completed 10 of 17 passes despite playing only a little more than two quarters.  Cook was named the game's most valuable player.  </P> <P> The West made a late surge but the East held on when Jeff Moore of Thousand  Oaks recovered a fumble at the 17-yard-line with 24 seconds to play.  </P> <P> The East took a 6-0 lead as Cook capped a 10-play, 98-yard drive with a 24-yard  touchdown pass to Royal's Pat Ledesma with 4:47 to play in the first quarter.  Ledesma, a quarterback last season who played wide receiver in the all-star  game, was left uncovered and waited patiently for about 10 seconds before a  scrambling Cook located him.  </P> <P> The East added a touchdown in the second quarter on what could easily have been  a turnover.  </P> <P> Cook was pressured out of the pocket and, scrambling, lofted a pass high  downfield in the vicinity of four West defenders. But it was Royal wide  receiver James Jones who reached up behind the defenders to grab the ball and  take a couple of easy steps into the end zone with a 60-yard touchdown  reception.  </P> <P> "We had nothing to lose, so I threw it as far as I could and he made a great  catch," Cook said.  </P> <P> Westlake tailback Keith Burke helped keep defensive pressure off Cook by  rushing for 96 yards in 18 carries with a stellar performance at tailback.  </P> <P> "The offensive line really opened up the holes for me tonight and it was a  really great experience," Burke said.  </P> <P> The touted offensive potential of the West never got in gear and the team's  only score came on a trick play.  </P> <P> Hueneme's Carlos Cardenas took a handoff on a fake punt and scrambled 45 yards  for a touchdown in the third quarter.  </P></p>

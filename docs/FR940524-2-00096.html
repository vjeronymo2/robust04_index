			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. A daily charge equal to an effective annual rate of 1.20% of the value of the net assets in Account B will be imposed to compensate Banner Life for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts. Of this amount, approximately one-third is attributable to mortality risks, and approximately two-thirds is attributable to expense risks. The rate may be increased in the future but is guaranteed never to exceed 1.25%. The charge may be a source of profit for Banner Life which will be added to its surplus and may be used for, among other things, the payment of distribution, sales and other expenses. Banner Life currently anticipates a profit from this charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The mortality risk arises from Banner Life's contractual obligation to make Annuity Payments (determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the Contracts) regardless of how long all Annuitants or any individual Annuitant may live. This undertaking assures that neither an Annuitant's own longevity, nor an improvement in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the monthly annuity payments that the Annuitant will receive under a Contract. A mortality risk also is assumed in connection with the Death Benefit guarantee because it could exceed the Account Value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The expense risk assumed by Banner Life is that its actual administrative costs will exceed the amount recovered through the administrative charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission, by order upon application, to conditionally or unconditionally grant an exemption from any provision, rule or regulation of the 1940 Act to the extent that the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust, its depositor or principal underwriter, from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments, other than sales loads, are deposited with a qualified bank and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a reasonable fee, as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties normally performed by the bank itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants request exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction from the assets of Account B of a maximum charge of 1.25% for the assumption of mortality and expense risks. Applicants believe that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants submit that Banner Life is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and expense risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts is consistent with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge. The mortality and expense risk charge is a reasonable charge to compensate Banner Life for the risks that: (a) Annuitants under the Contract will live longer individually or as a group than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; (b) the Account Value will be less than the Death Benefit; and (c) administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the administrative charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity contracts. This representation is based upon Banner Life's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. Banner Life will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be available to pay distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. Banner Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit Account B and the Contract Owners. The basis for that conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by Banner Life at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Banner Life also represents that Account B will only invest in management investment companies which undertake, in the event they should adopt a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors or trustees, a majority of whom are not ``interested persons'' of the company, formulate and approve any such plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth above, Applicants represent that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

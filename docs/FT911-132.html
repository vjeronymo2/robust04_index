			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (10): Useful systems for the well-connected - Manufacturing Software, the complexity of the applications requires careful co-ordination SOFTWARE to control manufacturing is among the most complex of commercial applications. In its most sophisticated form it entails connections between customers, suppliers, accounting, warehousing and the shop-floor. Its implementation must therefore be carefully co-ordinated. In the 1960s, IBM, among others, recognising that manufactured products could be progressively 'exploded' into a bill of materials, realised how useful a computer could be in estimating the raw material quantities required to make up finished goods. These databases, originally held on punched cards, evolved rapidly. The data handling needs of Bill of Materials Processing (Bomp), led software designers to create hierarchical databases, from which products such as IBM's IMS Early systems provided data for Materials Requirements Planning (MRP). Take a manufactured item, reduce it into sub assemblies, then explode those progressively until you have raw materials, multiply the numbers by the overall quantity of finished goods needed, and you have an estimate of overall requirements. Ally that to a manufacturing schedule - showing which parts are needed when  -and you have a planning system from which you can order goods. Such systems were very useful for manufacturing goods made up of discrete parts. However, for process applications - production of paint, foods or other products - the process is not so simple. The number of a certain type of switch or body panel needed to make a car does not vary. You may have some wastage in small items such as nuts and bolts, but the quantities used are still discrete. In continuous process manufacturing you must rely more on statistics than precise figures. You are not producing one product at a time, but a continuous stream of the product. The principles may seem similar, but the practice is more complex. A consideration common to both discrete and continuous process manufacturing can be batch control. You may need to track a batch of finished goods from its components, through to its eventual customers. When a batch of yoghurt was found to contain botulism the manufacturers had to be able to say precisely where the tainted goods had gone, and then go back and identify the raw material responsible to find out which other goods might be similarly affected. As a result, they were able to focus their warnings on a particular set of hazelnut flavour products. Inability to track products in this way would lead to the wholesale withdrawal of a product line, with disastrous consequences for the manufacturer's profits. The production planning process involves ensuring that enough goods are produced to meet forward orders for a period, without running out or becoming overstocked. The effect of this flows back to the beginning of the process. You must take delivery of enough raw materials to ensure that your production lines do not stop for the want of a component, but that your parts inventory does not overwhelm your storage and financial resources. Moreover, your suppliers must be able to schedule their production processes to ensure that you are supplied with goods at the right time and in the right quantity. The first MRP systems did not cater for this requirement. They were able to extrapolate need based on orders and schedules. Purchasing managers had to ensure that the correct quantities were ordered at the correct time. With MRP II systems, the interface between the outside world - suppliers and customers - and the manufacturing system is automated. The system is driven by sales order processing. Customers' future ordering requirements are entered into the system. These are exploded into component parts, and a schedule of raw materials is built up. At this time the system may be dealing with estimates in the form of future ordering requirements from component suppliers. From these will be generated similar forecasts all the way back to the suppliers of the basic raw products. Once the sales order becomes firm, the manufacturer can call off goods from his suppliers, based on the schedule - with whatever variations might be needed to suit actual needs. If the MRP system is sufficiently advanced, all this can be automated. Sales orders, once input, can automatically drive the whole process. Using electronic document interchange (EDI) no further human intervention should be needed after the input of a customer order. All intermediate documentation right down the chain of suppliers can be automatically produced. The need for standards for data interchange is obvious, and there are a number in use. In the motor industry there is Odette, other standards include ANSI X12 and Edufact. These define the form and contents of documents and electronic packages. Some suppliers of manufacturing software, such as Istel, a subsidiary of A T &amp; T, point to the importance of the open systems movement. However, according to Mr Alan Topliss, of Price Waterhouse, their robustness, security and ability to handle the very large amounts of data needed, are still not considered sufficient by many users. The most advanced use of MRP, mainly for companies producing in relatively low numbers is Just In Time (Jit) manufacturing. The idea is to produce goods only when they are needed - rather than stockpiling them. The ramifications flow right back down the chain. You must be able to call off ordered parts from your suppliers in the same fashion. A motor manufacturer, for example, may only keep a small stock of wheels - perhaps two hours' supply. In these circumstances, you need not only to forecast your numbers, but also how long it will take to deliver them. It is logical to drive shop floor control systems from MRP. However, as Mr Tony Baggot of EDS points out, you need a competent 'systems integrator' who understands how to link together all the disparate components. 'It's not just a matter of connecting machines up, they must share the same protocols' he stresses. The automation of manufacturing is an area in which not only machines, but also the operations of companies become interlinked. The benefits are obvious, but the complexity calls for careful adherence to standards.</p>

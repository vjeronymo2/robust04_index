			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Pickets hold line in TSB dispute LONG BEFORE dawn yesterday Mr David Carter slipped out of his Middlesbrough terraced home and drove north in his K-registered Cavalier to TSB's large Tyneside branch beside Newcastle upon Tyne's Haymarket bus station. For Mr Carter, a former Inland Revenue executive officer, yesterday's strike was the biggest organisational challenge in the six years since he became the Bifu banking union's organiser in north-east England, a TSB stronghold. Haymarket was a symbolic battleground. TSB chose this large branch as its flagship for an experiment - to be piloted on Tyneside but with far-reaching implications within TSB - in increased automation and 24-hour telephone banking. Before daybreak the pickets were in place. Mr Carter, having aroused the regional media with a faxed press release about 'the bank that likes to say, you're sacked', was briefing reporters using his new mobile telephone. At 8.15am TSB managers filed into the offices upstairs. The pickets handed out leaflets to members of the public eyeing the cash dispensers. The branch, to Mr Carter's delight, remained closed. He estimated that about 75 per cent of the 100-plus TSB branches between Berwick and Scarborough were shut yesterday. TSB disputed this figure, saying 30 per cent of branches in northern Britain closed, but confirmed there were strong pockets of action. Local TSB management said half the 60 branches between Tweed and Tees were shut. The other central Newcastle branch stayed open but, Mr Carter claimed, security men delivering money and postmen refused to cross the picket line. Nor, he said, would British Telecommunications staff cross the line at TSB's Gateshead Teleservice centre. After taking six of the most frozen pickets to thaw out over bacon sandwiches, he drove to Sunderland, where only one branch out of eight opened. Then it was down to East Durham's coastal coalfield areas where bank staff had organised detailed picketing rotas.</p>

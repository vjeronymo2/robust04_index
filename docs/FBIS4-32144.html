			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Pristina, 20 Jun (TANJUG) -- The trial of 14  ethnic Albanians charged with setting up "the defense ministry  of the Kosovo republic" and municipal "military headquarters in  Kosovo and Metohija," which has been adjourned several times,  began in Pristina today.    Hazer Hajzeraj, who, according to the indictment, was "the  minister" in "the ministry," was heard first before the court  council. Hajzeraj, who had for a long time been deputy defense  secretary and the commander of the civil defense in the Kosovo  province, did not admit to being the minister, claiming that he  had never organized "a defense ministry" or any similar  association. He confirmed that he had had contacts with Fehmi  Agani and Anton Koljaj, the leaders of the Democratic Alliance  of Kosovo [DSK], but he justified this by saying that the  meetings had been "informal and not specially organized" and  that they had simply exchanged opinions on the situation in  Kosovo.    He also said that he had not advocated the secession of  Kosovo from Serbia and Yugoslavia, explaining that the "autonomy  of Kosovo" was his position.    "I am aware that there is already one army in Kosovo and  that  there is no room for two armies here", Hajzeraj said.    Asked by the prosecutor to explain his contacts and meetings  with the self-declared Kosovo prime minister in exile, Bujar  Bukosi, Hajzeraj admitted that they had met three times in  Albania and Germany. They discussed, as he said, "only how to  protect the population and property."    He gave a similar explanation of his meetings with DSK  deputy  president Anton Koljaj, who is in charge of defense issues in  Rugova's party, and admitted that his "expert assistance" had  been required.    However, he did admit to having received certain amounts of  money in German marks, but explained that this was "help for the  Albanians sacked from work." [passage omitted] The trial  resumes tomorrow, when the other accused are expected to be  heard.</p>

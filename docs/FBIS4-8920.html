			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Foreign minister of  the Serb republic (S.R.) in the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina Aleksa Buha said on Tuesday [19 April] that  Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin's angry statement on Monday  evening that talks with Serbs should be broken off had been made  in the heat of the moment. Buha said in an interview to  Obrenovac radio that `Mr Churkin had a very ambitious plan to  turn partial peace in Gorazde into a lasting ceasefire in the  entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would give sense  to the former, but the Moslems rejected the global plan so that  very little has remained of the partial plan.'    `Faced with the current situation, it is possible that Mr  Churkin was afraid of possible further developments so that his  statement that talks with Serbs should be discontinued was made  in the heat of the moment,' said Buha. Over the weekend,  Churkin and head of the U.N. mission in Former Yugoslavia  Yasushi Akashi mediated talks on ending hostilities between the  Bosnian Moslems and Serbs.    We agree with Churkin that his country, Russia, must act as  a  great country which it is, i.e. with responsibility, but we  also believe that it should use the right words to address other  problems elsewhere and that a small country like ours should not  be the mirror of its greatness, he said. Reacting to Churkin's  statement, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations Yuriy  Vorontsov said that the Russian Government and President Boris  Yeltsin did not stand behind it.    Buha denied that there were any significant disagreements  between the S.R. political and military leaderships, adding  that there were only some minor differences. Asked whether the  return of Lord David Owen marked also a return to Geneva talks,  Buha said that the peace talks should have stayed in Geneva.    Future Geneva talks must start from the fact that, after the  creation of the Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia, there are  currently two entities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Buha said and  added that the talks should be held in two phases. In the first  phase, the two states should be delineated while in the second  agreement should be reached on possible future ties between the  Moslem-Croat federation and the S.R., he said. Under U.S.  pressure, the Moslems and Croats last March signed an agreement  on forming a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia, which would  subsequently form a confederation with Croatia.    The Serbs were not invited to the talks.</p>

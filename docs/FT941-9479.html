			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Parliamentary answer 'delayed' Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's shadow treasury secretary, yesterday expressed concern that ministers had not responded to a recently tabled parliamentary question about the tax increases that people will face from April 1995. Ms Harman's question asked the chancellor to provide an estimate of the burden of direct and indirect taxes for 1995-96. She claims that an answer was due by January 31 at the latest.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / GATT: Uruguay Round completed after 8 years Governments from more than 120 countries yesterday drew a line under almost eight years of complex and often fraught negotiations by signing their names to the Uruguay Round. The world's most ambitious trade liberalisation package is expected to boost global economic output by at least Dollars 235bn by the year 2002, according to estimates by the Gatt secretariat after it takes effect next year. As ministers unsheathed pens at the concluding conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, their tributes to what had been achieved, their regrets about what had not been agreed and their prognoses for the future were overshadowed by wonderment that the enterprise had been completed at all. Some saw more than just a further step towards global economic integration and re-affirmation of multilateral rules which have governed world trade for almost half a century. Mr Sergio Abreu Bonilla, conference chairman and foreign minister of Uruguay, where the round started in 1986, yesterday claimed it would underwrite political stability, above all in developing countries. Yet for all the ritual declarations of unity and goodwill in Marrakesh, there have been conspicuous reminders that the squabbles, rivalries and jockeying for national advantage which threatened more than once to scupper the talks remain as fierce as ever. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, may have moderated his language for the occasion. But he still insists his government has neither totally renounced the right to unilateral trade sanctions, nor relaxed its aggressive campaign to open Japan's markets, which other governments consider contrary to the spirit  - if not the letter  - of Gatt. The developing countries, meanwhile, have refused to swallow assurances from ministers of industrialised countries that their demands to place workers' rights on the world trade policy agenda were not protectionism in disguise. Nor have repeated claims by Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, that everyone will benefit from the Round removed worries in the poorest countries that some of the gains will be at their expense. For the European Union, Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, has somehow contrived to present himself as a shrewd and purposeful negotiator. That is a remarkable feat, given that the governments he is employed to represent  - and above all the French  - often seemed bent on undermining him by squabbling among themselves or trying to unravel previous agreements. But at least the EU enlivened proceedings with a memorable impersonation of a pantomime horse. On the eve of the Uruguay Round signing ceremony, the 12 staged an acrimonious row about German banana imports, which France then turned into a minor crisis by threatening not to approve the new Gatt agreement to liberalise public procurement. Like all farces, this one ended  - more or less  - happily, with liberal applications of Brussels fudge. But not before other EU ministers had vented their spleen on Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, for keeping them waiting at the negotiating table late into Thursday evening while he ostentatiously dined with friends in Marrakesh.</p>

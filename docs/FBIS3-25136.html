			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Cuito by correspondent Abel Abraao] </F>   [Text] Several people died in the past eight hours in  nonstop shelling by National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola bandits against the martyred city of Cuito. While the  war claims more victims, famine increases every tenth of a  second because relief operations have been suspended, affecting  more than 130,000 people. Should the situation continue, famine  and war could claim 50 lives daily. The hospital recently  renovated by the Belgian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres  has been shut down and the patients left to their own devices.  Hospital sources say the hospital is providing only first aid  treatment.</p>

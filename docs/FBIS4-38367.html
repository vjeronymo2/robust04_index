			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov, Andrey </F> Krasnoshchekov, and Andrey Shtorkh]    [Text] Paris May 27 TASS -- "The signing of an agreement on  Russian-European partnership will be a major Russian step to  Europe," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told ITAR-TASS  correspondent while in Paris to attend an international  conference on a stability pact.    In the words of Kozyrev, much work has been done to finalize  the document, and it is clear already now the document will be  fundamental. Technical details will be coordinated and the  document will be edited and translated into languages of  states-members of the European Union.    The minister did not exclude experts may fail to do this job  by the next session of the European Union to be held in June.  That is why, the agreement will be signed later, and initialed  in June. He stressed "there is no need to hurry, since the  basic agreement to sign the document has been reached".    The Russian-European agreement is very important from the  political point of view, stressed the minister. This document  will provide for the future form of all Russian-European  relations. The agreement envisages a system of political  consultations, a mechanism of political interaction. Under the  document, summit meeting with the leaders of the "European  Three" will be held at least once in two years, and contacts  between ministers will be regular.    A major aspect of the agreement is that it opens way "to  gradual but decisive Russian entrance to the world markets of  goods, including products of the nuclear cycle, services,  capital and labor", said the minister. The document will lay  down the basis for fundamental political and economic  interaction between Russia and the European Union, he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our colleague Tihomir Ladisic talked with  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic  through a satellite link this afternoon. Here are excerpts from  the conversation:    [Begin recording] [Ladisic] What has been promised to you,  President Izetbegovic, what do you expect from this federation  in Bosnia and the confederation with Croatia?    [Izetbegovic] I must say that this agreement is a result of  our interests -- they did not have to bribe us or pay us to  conclude it. However, they told us, the most authoritative  instances -- they told both us and Croatian officials, I believe  they told President Tudjman -- that Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Croatia will have an open door to all forms of European  integration. Step by step, of course, but this door will remain  open and we will receive lavish support for the reconstruction  of the war-ravaged parts of the country. We will receive  financial aid. They were unequivocal in this. Of course, we  Bosnians were told that Western forces would come and help out  in the implementation of what has been agreed.    [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, would you agree to a single  Bosnia-Herzegovina if the Serbs consented to remain in  Bosnia-Herzegovina but made this conditional on the creation of  a confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia?    [Izetbegovic] I believe I can give a brief reply to that:  out of the question.    [Ladisic] Does that mean that the creation of a new  Yugoslavia under pressure from the world powers would also be  out of the question?    [Izetbegovic] I think there is too much speculation  surrounding the world powers' ideas on the creation of a new  Yugoslavia. As far as I could deduce from my contacts, such an  idea is not being entertained by serious, responsible people in  the West. I am not saying that certain individuals are not in  favor of such a thing, but I believe that such an idea is not  being voiced as a realistic possibility -- I have not heard  anything to this effect so far, in any form. There has been  talk about certain forms of cooperation between the states  created on the ruins of the old Yugoslavia -- economic  cooperation -- but nobody had even hinted at the creation of  some state entity.

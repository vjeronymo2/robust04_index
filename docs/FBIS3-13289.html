			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Two Weeks After the Massacre"] </F>   [Text] Two weeks have passed since the odious massacre at  the Ibrahimi mosque. Yet, no signs have appeared of any Israeli  or U.S. moves to reopen the road to peace, which the  perpetrators of the massacre have blocked with blood and fire.    Provided with U.S. political cover at the UN Security  Council, the Israeli Government seems to be shirking its  responsibility as an occupying force. According to the Fourth  Geneva Convention, Israel must protect civilians in wartime.  However, the Israeli Government continues its terrorist policy,  without showing the least respect for human rights.    Instead of encouraging the Rabin government to assume its  full responsibilities toward this terrible crime, the United  States for two weeks has hampered any move by the UN Security  Council to issue a resolution providing for the validity of the  Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied Palestinian territory  and securing protection for the Palestinian people.    In view of this Israeli arrogance and the flagrant U.S. bias  toward the Yitzhaq Rabin government, the Arab side looks like a  weak, wounded body watching what is taking place at the UN  Security Council, unable to move or even to express pain as a  result of the ceaseless knifing of his flesh.    Having seen the odious massacre in Hebron and the subsequent  killings of scores of youths, children, and women in the  occupied territories, we are still both panicked and unable to  respond to the challenge that has been posed by the spilled  blood. Two weeks after the massacre, we see an Arab and Islamic  world full of signs that call for regret, sadness, and pity.    Vis-a-vis all that, it is not ruled out that this  Arab-Islamic submissiveness and the spiteful U.S. bias toward  Israel will encourage the ultra-Zionist extremists to commit  something more horrible than the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, so  long as murderers and criminals can avoid accountability, not to  mention punishment.</p>

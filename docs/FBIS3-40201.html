China has had power  shortages for 20 years, and the people have been waiting 20  years for the electric power industry to lead the takeoff of  other industries.    But the electric power industry bears heavy burdens, which  are keeping it from taking off.    An annual increase of 12 million kW in installed generating  capacity is insufficient to catch up with the increase in  demand, and the annual electricity shortfall is still as great  as 20 percent. The electric power industry has been operating at  more than full load for 20 years, its equipment continues to be  overburdened, and investments are inadequate; it lacks the  capability to replace obsolete equipment, and damaged or  defective generating sets continue to operate. In addition, a  heavy debt of more than 90 billion yuan is making it difficult  for state-owned enterprises, which are the mainstay of the power  industry, to continue.    Western observers say that it would take a miracle for  China's economy to achieve a growth rate of 10 percent or more  with an 8 percent rate of expansion of the power industry.  People in China's electric power industry state that "We are  bearing up under every calamity and pressing forward under a  heavy burden."  <H5>  Operating at Full Load, Working at More Than Full Load </H5>   A visitor to the Beijing No. 1 heat and power plant has  reason for amazement. Three large generating sets that were  commissioned in 1958 have already exceeded their rated service  life by 150,000 to 200,000 hours. Starting in the 1970's, the  quadrennial major overhaul has had to be replaced by an annual  overhaul. Practically every assembly of the boilers, steam  turbogenerators and main transformers has had repeated major  repairs. When repair is no longer possible, they have been  replaced one by one, so that by now all components have been  replaced at least once.    In this large enterprise, which relies on its superannuated,  aging equipment to provide power to a large part of the capital,  overuse has caused cracks up to 82mm deep to form in the wall of  the boiler steam jacket. The cracks have been patched by welding  to keep the equipment operating. Wang Miaocheng, who has been a  duty engineer at the plant for 20 years, says that each day's  work is done with his heart in his throat.    The operation of worn, superannuated equipment is by no  means  limited to this plant. Many generator sets that were  commissioned during the First 5-Year Plan are still in  operation. According to statistics from the Ministry of Electric  Power, in the current power grid, medium- and low-voltage  generating sets representing a total capacity of 33 million kW  are in need of thorough renovation or modernization, and, in  addition, 7 million kW of severely deficient hydropower  generating equipment and 6 million kW of overage heat supply  equipment is still in operation. If you take the road north from  the Shanhaiguan Pass, you will see the sagging cooling towers of  old power plants; if you touch them, you will find that their  concrete coating is scaling off. When the head of the Panmian  electric power office in Liaoning assumed his duties, he  discovered that the tables and chairs used for office work were  relics of the Japanese-installed puppet government, and that the  first domestically produced main transformer is still in  operation.    Maintaining reliable output amid a multitude of perils and  maintaining a superior record of full-load operation have long  been the daily reality in China's electric power industry.    In order to alleviate China's electric power shortage, the  power industry has always taken full generation and full  delivery as its guidelines. For 20 years, the industry and the  electric power enterprises, like the Beijing No. 1 heat and  power plant, have consistently been operating at full capacity,  with no breathing space. The national average annual number of  hours of operation of fossil-fired generating sets is 6,000  hours; some newly constructed power plants operate their  equipment for 7,000 hours or more a year; and in a few cases,  the length of operation reaches 8,000 hours, far above the  international standard of 5,000 hours per year.    Behind this equipment-risking, exploitative mode of  operation, to which there is no alternative, the electric power  industry is also afflicted with inadequate equipment maintenance  capabilities owing to depreciation rates that are below the  national average. As a consequence, equipment overhauls must be  extremely stringent and careful: they constitute a succession of  intense struggles to gain a little more time and a little more  quality. It is common for employees to work round the clock or  to be on the job for a week without returning to their homes. A  power plant director under the North China electric power  office, who had spent several days and nights riveted to the  site of a rush repair job, collapsed from exhaustion after the  generating set finally rumbled back into operation.    An accident resulting from a violation of regulations at the  Hefei heat and power plant shocked the Ministry of Electric  Power. Four persons were killed. But the comrades of the  investigating board could hardly bring themselves to take  action. At the time, two generating sets at the plant were being  overhauled, and a mass of coal slag suddenly became hung up in  the one unit that was still in operation. If the generator had  stopped, there would have been a major emergency. As a  consequence, the plant directory and the operating crew put  themselves in harm's way, trying to prod loose the suspended  slag inside the hot furnace. The slag, at a temperature of over  1000 degrees, fell down and crushed them.    The situation in the power grid is even more difficult than  that in the power plants.    The country's urban and rural low-voltage power distribution  network is universally outmoded. A considerable fraction of  China's old municipal power networks have been in operation for  25 years or more, and some have been operating for 40 years. The  bustling city center of Shanghai is still using power  distribution equipment left over from the 1920's and 1930's; 30  percent of the utility poles are at or above the maximum rated  load, voltages are too low, and breakdowns are frequent.    In Dalian, Fushun, Shenyang, and Changchun, power  distribution equipment left over from the Japanese puppet regime  continues in use. In Beijing, emergency shutdowns caused by the  aging power delivery facilities are almost a daily occurrence.  The seriously aging power lines in Tian'anmen Square are now  carrying five times the load for which they were designed. The  insulation is peeling from wires that have been in operation for  more than 30 years. Six years ago, the electric power  departments proposed a program to replace this equipment, but it  was shelved owing to lack of funding.    People not in the industry have difficulty in comprehending  that every success in the onerous task of power delivery is  ultimately the result of "human wave" tactics in which personnel  at all levels pitch in together. When the Asian Games were held  in Beijing, the electric power departments mobilized a huge  "militia," posting one person at each utility pole between the  power plant and the site of the games in order to assure timely  detection and rectification of malfunctions.    Behind the full-load provision of light is an effort at more  than full load by the machinery and personnel.  <H5>  A Virtually Insuperable Debt </H5>   Corresponding to the equipment that cannot be modernized is  a  mounting debt. At the end of 1992, the major state-owned  enterprises of the Ministry of Electric Power had a debt of 96.7  billion yuan.    The fixed assets of the Ministry of Electric Power's East  China Electric Corporation are the greatest of the country's 500  large enterprises, but the debt of the Northeast China power  grid is fully 10.5 billion yuan, with an annual interest of 550  million yuan; the total operating profit of the power grid in  1991 was only 50 million yuan.    After decades of struggle and devotion by their employees,  well-known large enterprises that provide the power on which  other enterprises rely for survival are making insufficient  profits to pay even a fraction of the bank interest on their  debts; they must wage an agonizing struggle to survive under  their crushing indebtedness and its steadily compounding  interest.    It should be noted that for several decades, the electric  power enterprises were well off. But since the policy of  replacing allocations by loans was instituted in the 1980's, and  especially since the second stage of replacing profit payments  by taxes was instituted, the tax rate on the electric power  industry has been increased from 15 percent to 25 percent; the  combination of a high tax burden, high operating costs, and low  prices have made the state-owned electric power enterprises  increasingly hard pressed.    As of 1990, the ministry's electric power enterprises were  able to retain only 8.2 yuan of every 100 yuan of earnings. At  the same time, prices for coal, oil, rail haulage and other  transport were repeatedly adjusted upwards, and the prices of  water, materials, and equipment rose steadily, so that the cost  of producing electric power skyrocketed. In 1978, the cost of  producing 1000 kWh of electric energy was 31.55 yuan, but by  1992 the cost of producing 1000 kWh in the  Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power system had risen to 96.03 yuan;  meanwhile, the prices charged for electric power remained  basically unchanged.    As a result of high taxes, high costs, and low prices, in  the  course of a decade the profitability rate of funds in the  state-owned electric power enterprises declined steadily, from  12 percent in 1980 to 3.7 percent in 1991. The enterprises'  borrowed funds correspondingly lost their ability to generate  earnings sufficient to repay principal and interest, and the  indebtedness of the large state-owned enterprises mounted  rapidly, at a rate of 15 to 20 billion yuan a year, snowballing  into a loan that could never be paid off.    Since the bad practices of the old enterprises are so  difficult to eradicate, can new construction projects bring  about a beneficial cycle?    The repayment period for Gezhouba is 24 years, with an  annual  principal and interest payment of 300 to 500 million yuan, but  the total profit of the Gezhouba power station since it went  into operation has been no more than 200 million yuan. The Dahua  hydroelectric station and the Heshan fossil-fired power plant,  newly constructed in Guangxi, have made a significant  contribution to alleviating the electric power shortage in the  area, but the annual loan interest alone for the two plants is  150 million yuan while the annual profit of the entire Guangxi  power grid is only 60 million yuan.    As the number of construction projects increases and as  deliveries of electric power rise, the cost of producing power  increases. As the contribution that the electric power  enterprises make to the state and localities grows, the debt  burden that they carry becomes steadily heavier.    The difficulty of achieving a beneficial cycle is casting a  dark shadow over the development of the electric power industry.  In the first five months of 1993, less than 11 percent of the  funds allocated for power construction nationwide were actually  disbursed. There are, of course, many reasons, but everyone is  calculating economic benefits, and who is willing to pour money  into a bottomless pit? The failure to increase construction  affects not only the present, but the future as well.    We hope for a full supply of electric power as one hopes for  rain clouds after a long drought.  <H5>  Electric Power Quality: A Difficult Task </H5>   The burden of electric power enterprises is not limited to  their debt of more than 90 billion yuan: another factor is the  heavy sense of responsibility for improving the quality of  China's overall supply of electric power.    In Japan, interruptions of electric power to users total  less  than two hours a year. In the United States, they are a maximum  of five to eight hours a year, and likewise in Europe. In China,  for many years there have been power shortages 15 to 20 percent  of the time, and in some provinces even 30 percent of the time.  The only way to deal with them is to cut off the power or to cut  back the supply. In 1992, as a result of these stoppages, the  country lost between 500 and 700 billion yuan of output value.  And behind this calculable loss there is another hidden loss. A  decline in the quality of the electric power supply as a result  of excessive load and below-standard frequency slows down  machine tools and causes unevenness of yarn in textile mills and  fading of colors in dyeing plants. These phenomena directly  affect the quality of China's manufactured goods, and the  intermediate hidden loss involved cannot be expressed in  numerical terms.    One year, a brilliant soccer game was being played in  Shenyang. Just as one of the players made a kick toward the  goal, the electric power suddenly went off. Shenyang went dark,  the live broadcast stopped, and soccer fans all over the country  were enraged.    In Sheqi County, Henan, on one occasion the peasants left  their wheat fields and walked 10 miles to burst into the  electric power office and demand electricity. The conflicts of  the energy shortage are concentrated in the electric power  departments. In Guizhou, in order to maintain the prescribed  frequency and to assure grid safety, a scheduler acting under  orders from his superiors cut off the power to an enterprise  that used excessive amounts of electric power. As a result, he  was arrested and charged with "sabotaging production."    In response, the electric power departments have done  everything possible to resolve conflicts in a realistic spirit  of "Don't wait, don't rely on others, don't bear a grudge," and  have displayed profound understanding of society's "lack of  understanding." From the original Ministry of Energy to the  present-day Ministry of Electric Power, they have treated the  work of supplying urban and rural dwellers with electric power  for their daily needs as a matter of "promoting stability and  unity and motivating the masses to build socialism." On two  occasions they have issued regulations on maintaining the supply  of electricity for daily needs and for lighting to the urban and  rural populace.    Assuring lighting means putting pressure on industrial  production, which is a matter that requires infinitely  painstaking planning.    A tiny power-management office in the town of Niudu, Linyi  County, Shanxi, created an approach that later was widely  disseminated. At the time when the populace was making its peak  use of electric lights, the office shut off nondomestic power  supplies to assure that light would be available, and at the  peak period of power consumption for purposes other than  lighting, it made all possible efforts to assure that power  would be available for production. It signed notarized electric  power contracts with the users. The power supply office in  Fucheng County, Hebei, made even more detailed regulations and  installed meters to keep track of power use in periods when  limitations were imposed. The local problem of "having the power  go off just when dinner was served and seeing the sign-off when  you turned on the television" was set right. The leadership and  rank-and-file of many power industry offices in the country not  only have a thorough knowledge of the industry, but are  conversant with the circumstances of the local enterprises,  services, and units. In addition to managing electric power  effectively, they cannot avoid becoming involved in arranging  social life as a whole. China's electric power industry and its  personnel truly are called upon to shoulder too heavy a burden.    Don't wait, don't depend on others, don't bear a grudge. Put  out all your strength and effort, assure that the existing  facilities are used with high efficiency. This spirit is  precious and commands respect. It is this spirit of putting up  with humiliation to perform one's mission and of continually  driving oneself that supports China's ability to use its  8-percent rate of increase in electric power output to provide  light and heat for a 10-percent growth rate of the national  economy.    But we can also see that the call for the power industry to  get into a beneficial cycle is essential to assuring the  sustained, stable, rapid development of China's economy.</p>

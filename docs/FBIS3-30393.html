			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr </F> Vondra by Stanislav Cervinka in Prague; date not given: "The  Reform Developments in Russia Will Probably Slow Down"]    [Text] Last week, First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr  Vondra made a two-day trip to Moscow. We were interested in the  purpose of the visit and the impressions he brought back to  Prague.    [Vondra] I attended a regular annual consultation between  the Foreign Ministries. With the single exception of the  parliament observer mission, there has been no official mission  there from our country since the elections. We discussed the  agenda for next year. I met with two Russian deputy foreign  ministers, Churkin and Kirov. I mentioned the crude oil issue in  the context of the planned joint commission for the economy,  which is supposed to be headed by deputy prime ministers -- we  are waiting for the Russian component to be formed, which will  be possible only after the restructuring of the Russian  Government. A protocol is signed annually on the supplies of  crude oil and power plant fuel, and the new commission will also  deal with this issue. Regarding the recent five-day  interruption in supply, I can only say that I do not believe  that it was caused by some political influence. Crude oil  prices were declining on the world markets at the end of last  year, and I have the impression that Chemapol and Transpetrol  were eliminating their stock. They acted in a market-conforming  manner, and did not think of the complications that could arise  if reserves smaller than usual are maintained, as happened at  the beginning of this year before the Russian Government was  formed. The processing of the relevant documents was delayed in  the still non-market environment in the Russian Federation.    [Cervinka] What is the new political climate like in Moscow?    [Vondra] I wanted to utilize the visit to Moscow to probe  the situation in the Russian parliament. I met with the  deputies of all the main political streams, and it is my  impression that a somewhat new stage is beginning in the  development in the Russian Federation, that the future progress  of particularly the economic reforms will be limited by the  political will of the parliament, and the support for a rapid  transfer to capitalism and free market will clearly decline.    [Cervinka] Can these changes lead to a change of the  development initiated in Russia?    [Vondra] It is difficult to predict. A complete retardation  of this development backwards [as published] may not be  possible, but it is likely that a slow down and a change in the  style of the reforms will occur, and a trend will commence  toward command methods in the management of the economy.    The anti-inflationary policy and budget stabilization will  no  longer be a priority. It is possible that inflation will be  reduced in Russia by the non-market measures, a price regulation  at the cost of a budget deficit.    [Cervinka] Can the changes you have indicated affect  relations between Prague and Moscow?    [Vondra] I believe that we completed the basic  transformation steps long time ago, and the distance between  Prague and Moscow -- in this respect -- has grown sufficiently.</p>

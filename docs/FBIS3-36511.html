			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with State Council chairman Eduard Shevardnadze </F> by correspondent Nato Oniani in Tbilisi -- live]    [Text] [Oniani] Good morning, friends. We are presenting  our traditional Monday radio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze,  chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of state,    Batono Eduard, both you and Mr. Yeltsin gave a high  appreciation to the signed treaty of friendship, good-neighborly  relations and cooperation at the news conference last week.  This is really a large, comprehensive treaty, apparently  different from all other agreements Georgia has had with other  countries. Yeltsin said that Russia aspires not only to  friendly relations with Georgia but also to allianced-based  relations. Could that probably annoy the West? In addition, the  military package of the treaty and other documents stipulate  joint guarding of the Georgian-Turkish border. Also signed was  a memorandum according to which a drafting group will work out  principles of transferring Russian troops to military bases.  Could that mean that we will not have equal relations with all  countries and that certain special relations have been formed  with Russia?    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. I would like to add  to what I said at our joint news conference and in my other  speeches that all the agreements, I mean the major treaty and  the package of all other agreements we signed, represent a  balance of interests of both countries. We have long been  looking for this balance. Work has been carried on for almost  two years. The well-known Paragraph 3 of the treaty and its  part stating certain responsibilities and commitments Russia is  undertaking in connection with building Georgia's Armed Forces  was included in the treaty at the last stage only. This  demonstrates that during the last two years we were busy  thinking about the treaty and wanted to have every word and  phrase weighed and selected so that it could endure the test of  time.    Of course all depends on how this agreement is implemented.  This will depend on the two parties and on processes which  develop within the two countries.    Now a little more detail in connection with guarding the  border. First, I have to remind you that we are guarding the  border jointly at present, too. Or rather, mainly Russian  border forces are guarding the border at present. Our frontier  troops are not able to guard the border independently,  unfortunately. There is neither a material or financial basis  for this, nor appropriate personnel. You should be aware that a  border is technically rather a complex object. It is not easy  to maintain it. This is connected with professions and it will  apparently take several years to acquire the skills.    We speak of friendly and fraternal relations with Turkish  leaders. I believe we will build such relations with this big  neighbor of ours. In future, there will probably be no  necessity to guard the border. You were in Turkey when Mr.  Demirel said that we have such fraternal relations that in time  the border could became symbolic. I agree with him. But, at  the moment, the elimination of the border will cause big  problems for both countries.    A mechanism for annullment has also been included in the  treaty.    We shall create our own border forces. This will probably  take several years. Then time will show and we will make a  decision as convenient and necessary for our own interests and  the interests of our neighbors.    Second, the presence of the Russian troops in Georgia and  Caucasia is a fact. Not only in Georgia but in Armenia, in  particular. As far as I know, Azerbaijan has a similar approach  to the settlement of the issue, I mean the principle of military  bases. Speaking of Georgia, we mean a new statute and there  really is a compromise. We have found a compromise. The  statute of the troops will be founded on the principle of  military bases. It will happen in the future because, to be  more precise, there is no agreement yet. This is a memorandum  about our recognizing the principle and wishing to create an  operative group which will work out the issue and get the text  of the agreement ready.    Now, where is the compromise? Russia is interested in  remaining here on the principles of military bases because we  cannot speak of creating a stable infrastructure in one or two  years. When we speak of bases, we mean a long stay. No country  can be happy at allowing other country's troop to enter its  territory. But we can see Russia's interest on one hand and, on  the other hand, we have to create an army, a real army. The  other side of the compromise speaks in our favor and it will be  reflected in the agreement stating detailed commitments and  measures Russia will have to take to have our army created.  Today we possess nothing of our own. We have no arms, no heavy  equipment, medium and light equipment, no ammunition, nothing.  We failed to get arms even for the police from anywhere.    [Oniani] There seemed to be certain promises in the past.    [Shevardnadze] We were promised but...[pauses] let us think.  If a country can exist without an army we would not make that  decision. But an army is apparently a necessity. If a country  can exist without the police we would ask the Russians to quit  and no talks about any bases would take place. But at present  normal formation and functioning of the police and interior  ministry troops depend on arms, a technical basis and finances,  if you will.    [Oniani] Batono Eduard, sorry to interrupt you but I  remember  that having returned from Turkey you said at the Tbilisi  conference of the Union of Citizens that Georgia will really  have its own army which will fight to the last drop of blood for  the country and will protect the country's interests. Did you  mean that? Did you mean that there would be assistance in  building troops?    [Shevardnadze] You know, Turkey, despite the fact that it is  rendering immense help to us with credits and other supporting  actions, cannot provide arms.    [Oniani] Was it known then that we would transfer to the  system of bases and Russia would help us?    [Shevardnadze] Of course it was meant at that time. Along  with these factors, the compromise has to be expressed in  another thing. Russia and its armed forces should play an  active and positive role in the settlement of the Abkhazian  issue and in the settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. Only if  we see that this positive role is guaranteed, only then shall we  sign an agreement.    Now, will this complicate our relations with other  countries?  I believe that politicians and analysts of other countries  interested in Russia's policy in Caucasia and in Russia's policy  in general are scrutinizing all this. I do not think this could  cause any serious complications.    Turkey could be the most sensitive toward this issue. But I  already informed Mr. Demirel yesterday, I wrote to him what we  had in mind when signing the agreement. Turkey as well as  Russia is most of all interested in a stable Caucasia and a  stable Georgia. And the guarantees which secure this stability  will be welcomed with understanding by our neighbor Turkey,  other neighbors and other countries. So, I do not think that  this could have an adverse effect on our relations with other  countries.    [Oniani] I would like to remind you of a few phrases said  by Yeltsin during his visit: There are forces in our country who  want to restore Moscow's role, to restore the empire within its  former borders. This tendency is dangerous primarily for Russia  itself.    You have expressed a hope that the treaty will not have a  fate similar to the two previous ones, meaning the Tractate  [signed between the East Georgian Kingdom and the Russian Empire  in 1784] and that of 7 May 1920 [between the independent  Republic of Georgia and Bolshevik Russia] and it will not be  violated unilaterally. You have also said that Yeltsin is the  only person who properly understands Russia's strategic interest  which implies having a stable and friendly neighbor in the  south. In principle, stability is the target Georgia has been  striving for for a long time. It can be said that Russia has  already specified its interest in relation with Georgia. How  reliable are these interests if Russia is not stable itself?  Does it imply that the stability of the two countries is of  mutual interest for our countries?    [Shevardnadze] I highly appreciate what Yeltsin said in  Georgia. Along with the phrases you remembered so well, I would  like to draw your attention to yet another phrase. I regard his  speech in the Academy of Sciences as a very important one, a  landmark in Russian-Georgian relations. There was a phrase like  this: Russia is not relieving itself of responsibilities for the  fact that agreements on the settlement the Abkhazian conflict  failed. He admits it. You have to be a courageous and honest  man to say this. One thing is that we said something and we  complained but the other thing is that the president himself  said it. In fact, he said many significant things during his  stay here.    Now, has Russia defined its strategic goals in Caucasia in  general and in Georgia in particular? Speaking of the president  and his policy and his understanding of Russo-Georgian relations  in the long run, I think that the president has this issue well  understood. At least, our conversations and his speeches  differed from those at previous meetings. I saw that he really  understood this.    He persistently stated in his conversations that he  interprets Russia's strategic interests in Georgia's being  united and integral, strong and friendly toward Russia. I see  this in the same way. However Russia's fate develops in future  and however complicated the internal relations between various  forces and regions become, I believe that friendly relations  with Russia are a better shield than confrontation. Even if  imperial forces, as we call them, come to power in Russia. In  any case, we took a proper step and we did what we had to do. I  have no doubt at all that the majority of our population  expected the same from the visit and assessed the results in the  same way. If I did not have a deep conviction that 70 or 75  percent of the Georgian population interpreted Russian-Georgian  relations the same way as I did I would not have signed these  documents. Seventy percent and probably even a little more.    [Oniani] After Yeltsin's visit you said that if we had had  this treaty a year ago the Abkhazian conflict would have been  over. Last week, UN Security Council resolution No. 896 was  made public. Abkhazian issues will again be discussed on 8  February. Information has been spread that the treaty will not  be ratified until the Abkhazian issue is settled. What is your  assessment? What did this treaty bring into the problem of the  settlement of the Abkhazian issue?    [Shevardnadze] When I said that had we had the treaty a year  ago Abkhazia would not have been lost I meant that Russia would  have also avoided a lot of troubles. Russia gained nothing at  all from the fact that Georgia lost Abkhazia temporarily. On  the contrary, it found far more difficulties near its southern  borders in North Caucasia in particular and in the country in  general. Russia found certain difficulties on the international  arena, too. The international opinion about Georgia is quite  sensible and quite objective.    When I said that had we had this treaty ready a year ago  Abkhazia would not have been lost and we would have avoided lots  of troubles, I said this and I am saying it now for the  attention of the forces which even now continue the traditions  of that old Supreme Council. I am really sorry that they cannot  understand that friendly relations, normal relations between two  countries are a guarantee for the settlement of conflicts. If  we do not trust each other, I mean Georgia and Russia, how can  any issue be settled without Russia's participation? This  atmosphere of distrust brought us to the disaster linked with  Abkhazia. All these 200,000 refugees, so many lost lives and  other misfortunes are the cost of this.    [Oniani] There was a statement by the forces you have just  mentioned that if Sukhumi were lost and Abkhaz forces occupied  Sukhumi the world would see with whose participation it happened  and the world would take our side and return Abkhazia to us.  Not only Sukhumi but virtually whole of Abkhazia has been lost.    [Shevardnadze] I would like to say that I meant forces in  Russia, too. They criticize Yeltsin for signing the treaty. I  speak more to the attention of those forces. Indeed, I speak to  the attention of our partners and opponents, too, but  particularly to the attention of those forces who state their  fundamental position and criticize the president for signing  this treaty. I reiterate that Georgia has lost much but Russia  has gained nothing. This senseless confrontation must by all  means come to an end. And I think that a foundation has been  laid for this.    Now, about Russia's role in the settlement of the Abkhazian  conflict. This role is in close contact with active  participation of the United Nations and European security  structures. This is very important now. The use of  international forces in its classic form is not ruled out  despite the negotiations Yeltsin and I held and despite Russia's  readiness to take the most of the commitment on itself. It is  not ruled out but I am not very convinced that the Security  Council will take a decision of this sort.    [Oniani] Does it mean that international forces should enter  the territory with various countries having a definite role, and  not only Russia?    [Shevardnadze] There is such a possibility. However, the  main factor of the settlement is Russia, anyway. We do not have  to be afraid to state this. I believe that this emphasizes not  only Russia's role but its commitments. The visit provided us  with certain guarantees. At least the president's public  statements and what he told me during our private meeting can be  considered as a guarantee. Now the main thing is how quickly  will there be a settlement of all problems, including and  apparently primarily the issue of refugees. Tomorrow  negotiations on the statute of Abkhazia are beginning and we  believe that the issue of the return of refugees should be  submitted once again and the process has to be sped up.    [Oniani] During your meeting with Yeltsin you presented your  own model of the settlement of Caucasian conflicts. It was  three plus one, that is three Caucasian states plus Russia with  its North Caucasian subjects. North Caucasian republics have  been against the treaty from the very beginning and joined the  camp of the opponents of the ratification. Obviously, Russia  has to consider this but Russia has to consider Georgia, too  because, as you have said, a disintegrated country in the south  next to North Caucasia cannot meet Russia's interest. What does  the Caucasian factor mean for Russia, for Caucasia and who will  manage this process?    [Shevardnadze] The Caucasian factor is one of the guarantees  for the stability of huge areas and vital centers in the south  of Russia's territory. Not the only one but a very important  one. An unstable Georgia is not acceptable for Russia's  national interests. If there are considerations and actions in  conformity with the law, Russian politicians should understand  this in this way and I believe that the Russian president  understands it in this way.    As for starting the mechanism, this needs time. The peoples  of North Caucasia will be interested in a Caucasian dialogue. I  am positive about that. They are not probably ripen for it  today. Let us wait till tomorrow. Some time is needed. And I  think that this is not very far off. I have publicly said that  the Azeri president, the Armenian president, and President  Yeltsin had a positive response to this idea of three plus one,  or maybe one plus three, and I believe that it has far-reaching  prospects.    [Oniani] And yet another issue which could be considered as  important. We have been refused the right to join the ruble zone  for the time being, although there has been a fear in Georgia  that we would be dragged into the zone by force. How important  are those economic acts stipulated by the agreements?    [Shevardnadze] Measures and agreements included in the  treaty  do not imply imply our joining the ruble zone. As for the issue  by itself, they have neither refused nor agreed to it. We have  not insisted on it, either. The issue is so significant that it  cannot be solved overnight. The principal thing is whether we  will be able to strengthen the coupon, to vitalize our economy.  Economic agreements signed in Tbilisi as well in Moscow can be  considered as preconditions to this. If we find that we are able  to strengthen the coupon there will be no need to speak of the  possibilities of joining the ruble zone.    Important measures have been planned for this week. These  include an assessment of the results of the last year, plans and  targets for the current year, discussion of a program of  surviving the crisis -- but the main issue is strengthening the  coupon. We shall consider and discuss this issue at every level,  at the government level, with my participation, without my  participation. Then parliament will take up the issue and in a  certain time we may be able to give a definite answer to the  question whether we need the ruble zone.    [Oniani] Batono Eduard, yet another explosion resulted in  the  killing of Deputy Defense Minister Nikoloz Kekelidze in Tbilisi  last week. The idea is circulating that some state or  government structures were involved in this incident to some  extent. First, could you please comment on this. And another  question. The mass media reported the resignation of Defense  Minister Georgiy Karkarashvili. Have you any information for us  on this issue?    [Shevardnadze] As for the death of Mr. Kekelidae, it is most  deplorable. I was rather distressed. Similarly deplorable was  an assassination in Rustavi a week ago, as well as the brutal  killing of two police officers in Tbilisi the other day. As you  know, the killing of Kekelidze coincided with the date of the  Yeltsin's visit. It happened at 0330 and the visit was beginning  in the morning.    But I do not think that any state structure, even if there  is  a bandit terrorist group in it, would time this horrible crime  to coincide with a crucial day like this. I have read a  statement by one of the parties mentioning state terrorism and  implying that we could be dealing with the state terrorism.  Speaking of state terrorism and somehow linking this event with  it is to my mind a very worrying fact in itself. A politician  who admits the possibility of the state's involvement in  terrorist acts so easily, is probably not far from  implementation of an idea like this if we permit him to manage  any state structure -- or if the people elect him to manage a  state structure. I cannot simply bear the thought that the  state has chosen the path of terrorism in Georgia today. Whoever  assumes such a possibility may be brooding over this idea  himself.    As for Karkarashvili's resignation, I could not see him and  I  will meet him soon. His resignation letter is rather  categorical and I do not think that it was written rashly  because the demand to let him resign is so categorically stated.  I have not made any decision yet. We shall meet in two or  three days and the final decision will of course be made public.    [Oniani] And finally another question. I would like to  return to Yeltsin's visit. The ceremony of meeting him and other  matters were organized in such a normal way that we experienced  a feeling of a sort of statehood. We felt that we were citizens  of a state. Tomorrow, 8 February, we celebrate the memorial day  of Davit Aghmashenebeli [12th Century Georgian king], a Georgian  king to whom the idea of Georgia's statehood is linked. During  your meeting with Kutaisi citizens yesterday you said that a new  stage of the national movement was beginning, a new era which  could be called an era of commitments, commitments to one's own  country because this is your state and it does not belong to  someone else. Youth has a special role in this.    Finally, restoration work is being carried out at the shrine  to Bagrati [first Georgian king to unite Georgia in 11th  Century] in Kutaisi, which can be considered a symbol of the  unity of the Georgian people. Do you think Bagrati will become a  real symbol of unity or it will remain a mere symbol?    [Shevardnadze] You are right. The reception of a high level  visitor like Yeltsin is not easy for the country in such a  disastrous situation. This is linked with lots and lots of  factors. As we saw Mr. Yeltsin off and the plane took off I told  one of my colleagues that we were beginning to resemble a state.  It really meant a lot.    I met with citizens of Kutaisi yesterday. You could see some  people from Tbilisi, too, but there were mostly visitors from  Kutaisi headed by Kutaisi Mayor Temur Shashiashvili. And I  really spoke of a new stage of national commitments. What is  being done in Kutaisi can be considered as one of the links in  this. I am aware that a lot is being done in Tbilisi, in Ajaria,  in other regions. But this is a Kutaisi citizens' initiative. I  have welcomed this initiative. It is a magnificent initiative.  The Bagrati temple and the name of Bagrati should be connected  with the struggle for unity, not merely symbolically but truly  and meaningfully. It should give an impetus to a new stage of a  new real national movement for the unity of Georgia.    There is a proposal to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of  integrated Georgia next year and I fully support the idea. I  think that if we manage it adequately it will mean the return to  the path taken by Bagrat and the great Davit -- not in words and  only at anniversary times and not with loud festivities. We  have to move forward and build, following in their footsteps.  We have to move along the road of building and not of  destruction. This is the road we have to take. I understand  this in this way. If I have the tiniest chance I will visit  Gelati [monastery in Kutaisi where King Davit is buried] and  kneel before Davit the Builder's tomb, not because I want to  connect it with a sort of populism but to appeal to my people  that we have to advance together along the road of building and  that it was not by accident that our people gave great Davit the  name of Builder.</p>

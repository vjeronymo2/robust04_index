			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The first of six frigates built by France for Taiwan  was launched, in utmost secrecy, during the night of 11-12 March  at Lorient. The launch of the frigate, baptized Mop-1, took  place at 0300 and was attended only by a Taiwan delegation.  According to the port authorities, this launch was done at night  for "technical reasons."    In reality, however, the French Government always has been  reticent about this 14-billion-franc [Fr] naval contract known  under the codename "Bravo," and it only very reluctantly  admitted to the existence of a second contract with Taipei for  60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft (Fr30 billion).    The Mop-1 frigate then was moved to a Lorient-Keroman port  dock for further arming.    The Taiwan vessels will be equipped with French equipment  and  arms systems, contrary to what government circles had said at  the time when the French press disclosed the contract. The  second vessel, Mop-2, is scheduled to be launched in September.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / New bomb blast in Calcutta At least one person was killed and 11 injured when a bomb exploded at Calcutta's crowded Sealdah station last night, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. The explosives were reported to have been in a suitcase. The explosion was the second in Calcutta in less than four days, after a bomb blast in the busy Bowbazar area late on Tuesday night left 86 dead and over 70 injured. Police say that the blasts in Calcutta are not linked to the series of bomb attacks which rocked Bombay last Friday, leaving over 250 dead.</p>

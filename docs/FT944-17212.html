			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Palestinians given pledge of aid Britain yesterday pledged substantial aid to the Palestine Liberation Organisation in building an autonomous civil administration in Gaza. Mr David Hunt, minister for science and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, that Britain was also ready to offer money and expertise in promoting international investment in Gaza, helping with scientific and technical research and establishing a Palestinian Standards Institute. Mr Hunt, the first cabinet minister to meet Mr Arafat since his return to Gaza, held two hours of talks with the PLO chairman after a week-long visit to Israel and the formerly occupied territories. He said afterwards that the British aid package would be worth Pounds 75m over three years. About Pounds 3m was spent last week in an emergency operation to guarantee the salaries of the Palestinian police force, but the main purpose is to help the PLO to build a civil administrative structure from scratch. Palestinians will be trained in the UK and British experts will be sent to Gaza. Mr Hunt will now report to the international contact group co-ordinating aid for the PLO on other areas in which Mr Arafat is seeking assistance.</p>

			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (2): The changing faces of fashion / A look at the latest design trends in timely accessories There was a time when watches existed independently of fashion. Men or women customarily received an important watch to mark their 21st birthday and, other than the addition of a dress watch, they continued to wear the same timepiece. However, the watch has become a fashion accessory. 'Today the norm is to have many different watches for several different functions: a classical watch for smarter events and evening, a fun watch that can be worn casually at the weekend and sports watch to wear in the office which, although being a diving watch or chronograph, will never go near the water and have nothing more important to time than seconds on a parking meter,' says Matthew Cundy, sales manager for Cartier. But what of trends? Although flashy watches, bristling with precious stones, remain popular in the middle and far east, the general movement, like fashion itself, is far from the ostentation typical of the 1980s. 'It is no longer important for your wrist to show everyone how successful you are. All that matters is that you know,' says Cundy. Frank Edwards, of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, agrees: 'Watch makers have latched on to a need to get away from the avaricious 1980s and a yearning towards a more romantic, stable and attractive past.' To this end, Cartier has designed a charming Art Deco range, made from materials such as black enamel and diamonds. Franck Muller, a newish, clever Geneva watchmaker, has produced a range of wristwatches called Casablanca. You must go to Switzerland to buy them. Nostalgia manifests itself in two ways. First, the mechanical watch, which only a few years ago was threatened with extinction by quartz, has fought back. It accounts for 12 per cent of volume and 48 per cent of value of all Swiss watches sold. Chris Parks, of Chronoswiss, a brand of watches with customised movements that has enjoyed great success since its introduction to Britain a year ago, says: 'Why buy something that has been stamped out on a production line, when you can have a watch that has been made by craftsmen?' Secondly, there has been a renaissance of watches that were popular in the inter-war years. 'Improved technology has meant that square watches are ripe for a relaunch, because the glasses are now made of sapphire crystal, which does not fall out and protects against dust and damp,' says Parks. All the leading brands have them. Patek Philippe, which makes some of the most beautiful watches, has a chronograph in a tonneau case with a perpetual calendar and, for women, a rectangular Gondolo watch with an elegant bezel paved with diamonds. Cartier produces its famous 'tanks', including the new Tank Obus which features Roman numerals and a crown set with a cabochon sapphire. Jaegar-LeCoutre offers Reverso Duo, which has two back-to-back dials, showing times in different zones. Franck Muller has devised his own version of the tonneau, known as a curvex, which houses intricate mechanisms. Grand old Breguet has a super tonneau and Audemar Piquet delights with a 1940s-style square wristwatch in 18-carat gold. More affordably, there are tanks from Gucci, Maurice Lacroix, which offers designs for men and women in a curved shape that fits the wrist perfectly, and Oris, which has created a handsome model in gold, steel, and gold plate to mark its 90th birthday. Metal colours are also changing. There has been an increase in the number of watches made in white materials such as steel, white gold and, even the expensive and notoriously difficult to work, platinum. Omega has a limited edition of 50 beautiful platinum watches to mark the 25th anniversary of man's first step on the moon. Baume &amp; Mercier offers the Hampton, which has a curved, polished, stainless steel case and matching bracelet. Zenith sells a range of steel chronographs which are modestly priced but good looking. However, for all the purity of white metals, it would be a mistake to believe there is no colour around. Coloured faces - particularly a certain shade of Royal blue - abound and add an individuality to any watch. Coloured straps are also in abundance - reflecting the trend for buying an assortment of straps with a watch. Breitling, makers of pilot watches, is offering colours that must have found their inspiration in a sweet shop. The most colourful watches are, of course, the cheap, fun throwaway ones. Swatch, which can be credited with persuading people to have a wardrobe of watches, still dominates. The new collection includes pop-outs, scuba - for underwater sports, stopwatches and an alarm to wake you up with a jolly tune. A brand to watch is Mondaine, which offers many fun designs including the award-winning Swiss Railway clock watch, the brightly-coloured M-Watch and an interesting little number based on a yoghurt pot. Sport continues to assert the same directional influence on watches as it has on fashion. 'Cultural and social changes such as increased leisure time and emphasis on looking sporty and dynamic have contributed to an explosion in sales,' says Duckworth He introduced Tag Heuer to Britain a decade ago and can boast a seven-fold increase in turnover. He says people are spending more on sports watches and has introduced a new 18-carat gold addition to the 6000 range. Also, more women, according to Duckworth, are buying sports watches and he has a new automatic which manages to look both sporty and smart. Adidas, known for its sports equipment, has launched a range of timepieces, including functional and rugged models designed for tough sports, classical chronographs, water-resistant to 200 metres, and a set of inexpensive sporty leisure watches. Sector, which specialises in watches that perform well in extreme weather conditions, has the new Underlab STE, which boasts an extremely strong steel / fibre glass case and is available in four versions including two chronographs. Ebel offers the handsome Sportwave Chronograph: robust and functional, it times performances on three registers to a tenth of a second, gives intermediary times, has a tachymeter and is available on either bracelet or leather strap. Even Dunhill, that most sedate of companies, known more for its period watches, has shaped-up with the Londynium, which, although designed to be worn at all times, has a particularly sporty appearance and is available in four sizes in steel, steel combination and 18-carat gold. Finally, if you are looking for something completely different, why not invest in the latest trend - erotic watches. Hublot, better known for discreet little timepieces is enamelling illustrations of the Karma Sutra on to its watches, while Blancpain, that outwardly most understated of watchmakers, has a range that features couples (all proclivities catered for) copulating with all moving parts (literally). The designs are so explicit that I am told the watches might soon be banned. John Morgan is associate editor of GQ Magazine</p>

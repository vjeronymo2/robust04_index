			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jakarta, KOMPAS -- After conducting  investigations from October 1993 to February this year, an  environment protection group, Wahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia  [Indonesian Environment Vehicle or Walhi], managed to identify  10 local companies which imported dangerous and toxic plastic  waste. Walhi urged the government to take action against these  companies by pressuring them to return the toxic waste to the  country of origin, and if necessary, take legal action against  them.    Walhi's program director Muhammad Sifaudin Zulkarnaen  disclosed the findings to reporters at his office in Jakarta on  17 March. Zulkarnaen was accompanied at the news conference by  Walhi's information manager, Lili Hasannudin.    The 10 companies are based in Jakarta and have imported at  least 68 containers of plastic waste through Tanjung Priuk Port  since 25 November 1992. In Ministerial Decree No. 349 dated 21  November 1992, the trade minister banned the import of  industrial waste or plastic waste into the country effective 25  November 1992.

Walhi based its investigations on authentic shipping  documents, which had been used to import the waste into the  country. The documents revealed the identity of the importing  companies as well as the number of containers they ordered. The  containers were then checked and those found to have dangerous  and toxic waste had the owner' name put in the list. Walhi also  contacted each company to check the accuracy of its  investigations. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman </F> Myacheslaw Hryb by Maria Graczyk in Minsk; date not given:  "Love Dictated by Common Sense"]    [Text] [Graczyk] Was the proclamation of independence in  1991 a mistake?    [Hryb] It is certainly difficult for us to maintain the  sovereignty that we achieved then, especially from an economic  point of view. However, which of our neighbors finds things  easy? Even though all changes call for some effort, we are not  going to give up our independence.    [Graczyk] However, there remain increasingly fewer  attributes of it.    [Hryb] So far we have not lost anything -- we have our own  territory, borders, and Constitution. The official language is  Belarusian. In fact, we also have our own economy -- a meager  and limping economy, but it is still our own, independent  economy. We have already adopted a packet of sovereign legal  provisions and international agreements, concerning, for  example, human rights. Belarus is the first country in the world  which had strategic nuclear weapons on its territory and  abandoned them voluntarily. Does this not prove the sovereignty  of our Republic?    [Graczyk] What about the presence of Russian troops?    [Hryb] It is an historical necessity; it is our historical  legacy that we cannot evade. We cannot demand that our neighbor  all of a sudden withdraw all of its troops. To where should it  withdraw them? We have signed a bilateral agreement in which we  consider this state of affairs to be only temporary. Actually,  apart from the Baltic states, no one treats this issue that  rigorously. We must understand Russia, which is not to blame  for this situation. The CIS is, in a way, like a family which  exists only thanks to the art of compromise. This also holds  true for relations with our eastern neighbor.    [Graczyk] What are these concessions all about?    [Hryb] We agree to the dates for withdrawing troops which  have been proposed by the Russians and we provide assistance in  transit; the Russians sell us energy resources at lower prices.  We are all but forced to use that source. Perhaps other  sources will emerge in the future; however, for the time being  we must live and cooperate somehow. We are realists.    [Graczyk] Is this desire to be embraced by Russia dictated  by common sense? This is at least how the agreement on merging  the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems is interpreted.    [Hryb] Signing this agreement does not at all mean a  combination of the monetary systems. This would be possible  only after the Supreme Council ratifies the agreement or after  appropriate amendments to the Constitution are made. For the  time being, nine articles of this agreement have come into  force; they concern, among other things, taxes and tariffs.  Personally I am an advocate of integration; however, the  integration should not be achieved with such great steps.    [Graczyk] What will be the next step? The military and  financial steps have already been taken.    [Hryb] The agreement on collective security, which was  signed in Tashkent, is not a military alliance. It merely  envisions cooperation between members states of the CIS in the  area of armament; our Army will not survive without it. Since  the arms industry of the post-Soviet states is strongly  decentralized, we are practically required to cooperate with  each other. For the time being, there is also no uniform ruble  zone. Both in Belarus and in Russia many milieus are against  this concept. However, I must concede that it would be much  easier for us if we bought energy sources for instance, for the  same prices as the Russians buy them. Right now they sell oil  for $80 per ton, whereas they offer the same amount of oil to  their own enterprises at $40. It is obvious that this affects  the cost of production. Aside from that, it is first of all  Russia that constitutes the market for our goods. We will not  sell them in Poland or in the West.    [Graczyk] The Baltic states, which until recently were also  strongly tied to Russia, are facing similar problems. Even  though they achieve various results, they are still trying to  reform their economies.    [Hryb] I do not agree with the statement that we were in a  similar situation as the Baltic states. First of all, Soviet  authority came to Belarus in 1917, not in 1939. This is a quite  important difference. Second, our economy was more dependent on  Russia and other Soviet republics. Third, after the war we did  not have reserves of gold or hard-currency deposits abroad.  Regretfully, it must also be noted that Western states have all  along treated the Baltic states differently than they have  treated us.    [Graczyk] Why has Belarus not even tried to embark on a  reform program? Why has it chosen to return to Russia instead?    [Hryb] It is not true that we are giving up on reforms. We  merely believe that haste is inadvisable in this case and that  it can be very dangerous. We do not have any guarantee that if  we implement reforms and destroy some branches of the economy,  such as agriculture, for instance, we will find someone who will  feed us on the following day. The attempts to privatize  agriculture have failed in Lithuania and the land is now fallow.  We believe that people who live in the countryside should  themselves choose a method of working: they can be farmers,  lease holders, or they can remain collective farmers. Before we  destroy anything, we should build something new, and only then  should we decide what is to be done with the old structures.    [Graczyk] However, the privatization of agriculture is very  slow and land has been leased to only 3,000 people.    [Hryb] No one can be made to do anything by force. Whenever  I visit collective or state farms, I ask people if any of them  want to lease land from the state. No one ever does. Why?  First, it is a new phenomenon; second, it is difficult; third,  it yields profit only after some time. The lease holder can  then only count on himself because the state, unfortunately,  provides him with too little assistance. Now, on a collective  farm he is guaranteed low but still sure wages and assistance  from his fellow workers.    [Graczyk] Many investors, including foreigners, would be  interested in private activity. However, they are discouraged  by the fact that no reforms are being implemented. So far less  than $550 million has been invested in Belarus.    [Hryb] We have already registered more than 1,000 foreign  companies and joint-venture companies. Privatization is rather  slow because we cannot afford the costs of restructuring.  Belarus has probably the largest budget sector among all the  republics of the former Soviet Union -- we maintain 2.5 million  senior citizens and we subsidies to 2.2 million people who were  victims of the Chernobyl catastrophe. Thus, almost half of our  society is maintained by the state budget. These circumstances  force us to carefully consider all contingencies before making  any changes.    [Graczyk] Do you not fear that the price for this caution  may be, in the long run, the state's independence?    [Hryb] People will always judge the government; they will  compare the present living standards with the previous period.  In that period their lives were undoubtedly easier. Thus, they  are now beginning to blame both the government and independence  for this fact.    [Graczyk] Therefore, the solution to this problem is the  establishment of a Belarusian-Russian confederation?    [Hryb] So far the issue of political structures with Russia  or other CIS states has not been discussed at all. We are only  discussing economic cooperation. However, I must concede that  there are also people who are dreaming about more than that and  who are striving to achieve it.    [Graczyk] It seems that Belarus is the only country in this  part of Europe which does not believe that Russia is trying to  conduct an imperial policy.    [Hryb] We cannot complain about the cooperation with our  eastern neighbor; we manage to successfully resolve many  problems. Russia has more important tasks today than building an  empire; the most important task for it is to overcome the crisis  and improve the economy.    [Graczyk] The Belarusian opposition claims that Minsk's  decision of whether or not to join the "Partnership for Peace"  depends directly on Moscow.    [Hryb] We support this American idea; however, we do not  conceal the fact that it needs some finishing touches. Your  suggestion that we depend on Russian in this area does not  correspond to the truth. The most important problem for us is  first of all money. After joining the "Partnership" we would  have to spend $5 million a year to implement it. This is the  only reason why we have not yet signed the document.    [Graczyk] Soon you will cede your powers as the head of  state to the first Belarusian president. What will be -- in  line with the Constitution -- the mutual relations between him,  the parliament, and the government?    [Hryb] These issues will be finally decided after the  elections. We would like the new president to be able to take  part in discussions on this subject. Along with political  scientists, we are seeking to find the optimum distribution of  power. We are realists, after all.</p>

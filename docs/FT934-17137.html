			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Problem of housing policy Sir, Osman Streater (Letters, September 27) alleges, from the sanctuary of the Savile Club, that the driving force behind Liberal-run Tower Hamlets council's housing policy is 'middle-class, post-colonial guilt'. Rubbish. Tower Hamlets Liberals have as far as possible tried to put the housing needs of local people ahead of recent arrivals in our borough. Three times our councillors have been sent to court for trying to break the Homeless Persons Act, which forces councils to put the homeless (ie, recent arrivals in the area) ahead of locals. London's most densely populated borough needs exempting from this act now. That one, misguided, piece of legislation was undoubtedly the result of middle-class guilt. Its effect has been to cause immense working-class anger  -as we saw in Millwall two weeks ago. It continues to cause anger among people of all ethnic groupings in the East End who suffer unjustifiable overcrowding and misery as a result of it. Tower Hamlets Liberals have done everything in our power to alleviate this problem, but we alone cannot solve it. If the middle classes still feel guilty, then those of them sitting at Westminster know what to do about it. Tom Winnifrith. Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats, Bethnal Green, London E2</p>

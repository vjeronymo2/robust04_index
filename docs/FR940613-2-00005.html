Conduct non-predator animal damage management, such as controlling small mammal populations on plantations, and necessary environmental analysis and disclosure on National Forest System lands consistent with forest plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Recognize that taking of predators, including removal of depredating animals (for example, removal of a nuisance bear in a high-use recreation area), may be carried out on National Forest System lands by an individual in accordance with state and federal law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.

Use an integrated approach to the prevention of animal damage and management of animal damage control programs. Consider a full range of methods, including physical barriers, repellents, habitat manipulation, biological controls, silvicultural methods (for example, fertilizing to improve soil fertility), pesticides, and hunting and trapping. Use licensed hunting, fishing, and trapping as a control technique where practicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.

			<p>Money   Laundering Law   <F P=102> BK0106091394 Bangkok THE NATION in English 1 Jun 94 p 2 </F> <F P=103> BK0106091394 </F> <F P=104>  Bangkok THE NATION </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan has asked the  Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) and the Bank of  Thailand to set the scope of the proposed money laundering law  in a way that will not affect the country's financial system,  according to government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa.    Amnuai told the council of economic ministers on Monday the  two agencies had also been instructed to consider whether the  proposed legislation should target drug traffickers alone or  include other criminal groups as well, Aphisit said.    Members of other crime syndicates, such as those involved in  prostitution and the smuggling of contraband and war weapons,  are also known to launder their profits through legitimate banks  and financial institutions using the same methods as drug  traffickers.    Government leaders have said they agree with the proposal by  anti-narcotics officials to introduce a money laundering law,  provided that such a move does not infringe on individual  freedoms.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he approved of the idea in  principle because a money laundering law would prevent dishonest  people converting their ill-gotten wealth into legal currencies.    Anti-drug officials say that without such a law, drug  traffickers will continue to flourish through their illegal  trade.    ONCB staff say many major traders in illicit drugs are  beyond  the reach of the law because law enforcement officials do not  have hard evidence to link them to the crime.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Brazil tax defeat jolts stabilisation Brazil's economic stabilisation programme has been cast into doubt by the government's failure to win support for a tax increase required to help balance this year's budget, reports Angus Foster in Sao Paulo. A balanced budget is needed for an economic stabilisation programme launched by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, to tackle inflation of about 40 per cent a month. The proposed tax increase was relatively small, and the money can probably be found elsewhere, but the failure has damaged the credibility of the programme and its architect. The defeat stemmed from the government's inability to muster a quorum in Congress on Thursday night, in effect the deadline for several measures to be adopted this year. The planned tax increase and other measures will now lapse, costing the government the equivalent of about Dollars 500m (Pounds 334m) in annual revenue. If Mr Cardoso can present a balanced budget, he plans to introduce a new inflation index which could gradually become a new currency linked to the US dollar or a basket of currencies. To try and balance the budget, the government is likely next month to start negotiating alternative measures. It may propose a reduction in export incentives and further cuts in development programmes. Also, public servants' income tax may go to the federal government rather than to the states.</p>

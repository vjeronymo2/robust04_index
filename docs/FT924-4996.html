			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: Malts to savour FOR SEVERAL years now, Oddbins has been the high-street leader for its excellent range of wines. Its secret seems to lie in its openness to new ideas as well as an adventurous young team of buyers who receive the very minimum of interference from their parent company, Seagrams. Oddbins has always had a good range of malt whiskies, but in recent years its list has got better and better. Now, in the run-up to Christmas, it has pulled a new plum out of the Scottish pudding in a range of cask-strength malts. The mention of cask strength naturally requires a note of both explanation and warning. Whisky runs off the still at around 65 per cent alcohol. When the time comes to bottle the whisky the strength is broken down to somewhere between 45 and 40 degrees depending on the targeted market (the lowest strength is generally reserved for Britain). Most people put a splash of water in their whisky, even at 40 per cent, and this is thought to make the whisky 'blossom' and reveal further aromas. Kenny Fraser, the distiller at Aberlour on Speyside, merely rinses the glass with water, adding that the few drops left clinging to the side will do the trick. Nor should tap water be used. Scottish spring water is available just about everywhere these days. Oddbins cask strength whiskies are nearer 60 per cent so prepare to add a little more water to your glass to bring out the best in the spirit. Oddbins has selected individual casks belonging to the brokers Cadenhead. They represent small quantities of different batches of whisky each with its own distinct character. Some of these have been in relatively new Bourbon casks which give the spirit a toffee or fudge character which for me at least, detracts from the flavour of the malt. Others have been run into casks previously used for Oloroso sherry. In some cases I found the fruity, sherry character had overwhelmed the whisky. Here then is my personal selection from the list. Some are released in Scotland only: Clynelish 1972, cask 5641, northern Highlands. This is the undoubted star of the range. Like Islay's Bruichladdich, this is a sensationally fruity whisky with a bouquet of strawberries and peaches (Pounds 35). Glendronach 1970, cask 26 Speyside. This is something of a classic with its aromas of honey, lavender and heather. The cask 25 had rather more sherry character which obscured its bouquet a little (Pounds 37.50). Springbank 1980, cask 182, Campbeltown. There was considerable cask variation here, but 182 was a clear winner with its redolence of burnt sugar and bananas. On the other casks, the toffee character of new casks - or the raisiny tastes of sherry wood - appeared to mask the basic flavour of the whisky (Pounds 29.99). Lagavulin 1978, cask 128, Islay. The iodine character associated with Islay malts was unmistakable here, yet the whisky had a certain elegance of structure. Cask 14 appeared to have a light intriguing sea-weed character. Cask 127 smelled too strongly of new Bourbon wood (Pounds 29.99). Glen Albyn 1975, cask 3344, Speyside (Scotland only). This comes from a distillery that has since been demolished. Like Clynelish is is a fruity whisky with a bouquet of apples, pears and honey (Pounds 33). Talisker 1978, cask 2, Skye. Extremely peaty whiskies of this sort tend to be an acquired taste. Tasting this might be likened to walking through a hospital ward. An outdoor whisky: put a bottle in your pack before you next go yomping. (Pounds 29.99). Many of the other malts in the Oddbins range seemed to have overdone the cask. The disadvantage of releasing individual lots in this way is that you may not blend up the whisky to balance out these defects. Not that malts such as Alt-a-Bhainne 1980 (Pounds 29.99) and Pittyvaich 1977 (Scotland only  -Pounds 29.99) will fail to find admirers. Glenugie 1980 (Scotland only - Pounds 29.99) had gone overboard on the sherry cask, leaving it the colour of teak with a aroma one might have easily mistaken for Spanish brandy. Clearly its owners had second thoughts too: the distillery has been demolished and on its site stands a motor mechanics workshop.</p>

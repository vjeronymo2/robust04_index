			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Secretary of  Defense William Perry has delayed his April 17-19 visit to  Seoul, citing the shooting down Thursday of two U.S. helicopters  in northern Iraq by American fighters, diplomatic sources here  said.    Perry, who was scheduled to leave for Tokyo and Seoul Friday  to discuss the North Korean nuclear crisis, decided to postpone  his trip because of the tragedy in which American F-15 fighters  enforcing the "no-fly" zone over northern Iraq mistakenly shot  down two U.S. Army choppers, killing more than 20 people, the  sources said.    The Department of Defense notified the South Korean Embassy  here of the delay, saying Perry's visit to Seoul will be  rescheduled next week when the downing is cleared up, they said.  The diplomatic sources, however, did not rule out the  possibility that the visit could be delayed for a longer period  if the mishap triggered a political and military uproar in and  outside the United States.    The U.S. defense secretary was scheduled to meet with his  South Korean counterpart Yi Pyong-tae to tackle the North Korean  nuclear problem in Seoul from April 17-19.</p>

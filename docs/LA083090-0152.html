			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> 1987 McDowell Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($8) -- As the wine market becomes more  competitive -- due, in part, to a greater supply of wine than the marketplace  can absorb -- wineries must either lower prices or increase discounts.  </P> <P> McDowell Valley, which used to make an expensive Cabernet from its own grapes,  decided to drop the price of the wine. By blending in some purchased grapes, it  could afford to. The result is a wine of quality nearly equal to the  estate-bottled version, but with a lower price. The aroma is delicately herbal  and the balance excellent.  </P></p>

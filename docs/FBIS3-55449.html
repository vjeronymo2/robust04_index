			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, January 9 -- Estonian President Lennart  Meri has rejected parts of government reshuffle proposed by  Prime Minister Mart Laar leaving key cabinet positions vacant.    Meri signed a decree on Saturday [8 January] replacing  Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste with Juri Luik who has thus  far held defence minister's portfolio. Under the same decree,  Meri awarded defence minister's job to Indrek Kannik. He also  dismissed Finance Minister Madis Uurike, but turned down Laar's  nominee for the position leaving the post vacant. Meri also  rejected Laar's proposal to dismiss Economics Minister Toomas  Sildmae.    "Under the constitution of the Republic of Estonia, changes  in the government lie within prime minister's jurisdiction while  the president has no right to form the cabinet," the  government's press office said.    President's legal advisor Vahur Glase replied telling ETA  that the government's statement had not been correct and that  under paragraph 90 in the constitution, changes in the  government were to be made by the president after a proposal by  the premier. Premier's proposal is of advisory, not compulsory  nature, Glase added.    Laar also said in his statement he was prepared to take the  matter to the legal chancellor and the constitutional court  while ministers who had been appointed by Meri would not take  office.    Consequently, Estonia has no foreign, defence or finance  minister.    "This is a crisis on how to interpret the constitution and  legislation and by no means a government crisis," government's  spokesman Ain Saarna told ETA.    Laar expressed his regret over the situation saying  instability in Estonia's domestic policy was not acceptable in  the present situation.    Four nominated ministers -- Juri Luik, Toivo Jurgenson,  Indrek Kannik and Heiki Kranich -- met Meri in his presidential  palace Sunday evening. After the meeting, the situation  remained unchanged. Luik and Kannik refused to take up their  new positions and Meri refused to accept the package and appoint  all four ministers.    Jurgenson was Laar's choice for economics minister and  Kranich was his nominee for finance minister's position.    The current government reshuffle contains danger of crisis,  but is not crisis, Environment Minister Andres Tarand said in  his commentary to ETA while adding the situation was not  dramatic.    "At the moment, we have a replacement system which is being  used during ministers' foreign trips," Tarand said.</p>

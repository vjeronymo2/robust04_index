			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Taking the temperature around Barts ST Bartholomew's Hospital, familiarly known as Barts, has been a feature of the City of London since 1123. If the recommendations of the Tomlinson report are followed, within a few years it will merge with the Royal London Hospital at Whitechapel, and the Smithfield site it has occupied for more than eight centuries will be vacated. St Bartholomew's shadow NHS trust (approved in principle for opting-out pending the outcome of the Tomlinson inquiry) said yesterday the hospital was 'a local, national and international centre of excellence', and there was an 'overwhelming case' for its retention. 'We believe that to lose such an institution would be seriously detrimental to the healthcare of Londoners and people who work and visit the capital city,' hospital management said, adding that it was unable to understand the reasoning behind the Tomlinson recommendations. Campaigners for Barts' survival argue that, in addition to specialist care, it provides a valuable outpatient and emergency service. They say it serves a commuter population of more than 300,000 working within a two-mile radius of the hospital, as well as 200,000 residents of Islington and Hackney and 5,000 of the City of London. Mr Charles Croot, chairman of the residents' association at the Barbican, which houses a substantial proportion of the City's population, said he believed there was tremendous affection for Barts at the Barbican, and strong opposition to its closure. 'I am outraged by the mere possibility of closing down such a historic building,' said Mr Croot. He said many people who, like himself, had been involved in raising money for new facilities at Barts would feel their work had been wasted. 'I really think that if the government decides to close down Barts, I am not voting for the Conservative party again, ever,' he said.</p>

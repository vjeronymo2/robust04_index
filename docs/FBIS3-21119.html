			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shintaro Arai, Yoshihiro Ueda, Yoshifumi </F> Maruyama, Satoshi Tonegawa, Yasunori Aizawa and Toshimoto  Makino; Microwave Tube Division, NEC]    [Text]  <H5>  Abstract </H5>   NEC has already developed high efficiency klystrons with  outputs of 30 kW and 80 kW (jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries) in the 2.45 GHz frequency band as microwave sources  in microwave power systems that require high output and high  efficiency. Now NEC has developed a high-wattage,  high-efficiency klystron with an output of 100 kW and an  efficiency of 76%, the world's best, as the  top-of-the-line  model of this product series.    Because the electron beam bunching efficiency is  dramatically  improved in this klystron, for two of the seven cavity  resonators we used higher harmonic cavity resonators coupled to  the 2nd harmonic. We also selected a relatively small perveance  and optimized the positions of the various cavities.    Furthermore, along with high power, this klystron features  excellent power resistance and output stability, and it is  lightweight, compact, and has a long product life.    This article describes points that were given special  consideration during the design stage in developing this  klystron and the properties that were obtained.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Recently microwaves are being used in industry for heating,  drying, baking, sintering, etc., and in fields such as medicine,  environmental protection and energy. The microwave sources in  these microwave power systems must have high output, high  efficiency, and high reliability.    Magnetrons that have been used up till now have a low  maximum  single-tube output of about 15 kW, and they are also relatively  short-lived. Klystrons, on the other hand, have a large  single-tube output, excellent frequency stability, and are  better in terms of lifetime as well, so klystrons have received  a great deal of attention as replacements for magnetrons.    In response to these needs, NEC has already developed  high-efficiency klystrons with outputs of 30 kW and 80 kW  (jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) in the 2.45 GHz  frequency band.[.sup]1[/] To answer the need for greater  power and higher efficiency, NEC has developed the world's first  klystron that features a high output of 100 kW, an efficiency of  better than 75%, and a long product life. This product is  discussed below.  <H5>  2. Design Policy </H5>   In designing the high-efficiency klystron with a high power  output of 100 kW, we made a comprehensive design of the main  parts--the electron gun, high-frequency circuit and  collector--on the high-precision CAD developed in house at NEC.  The following points were given special consideration during  design.    (1) Cooling    We planned to use the same water-cooled format for the  collector that we used in the 30 kW and 80 kW klystrons, but  because the power loss at the collector would be increased to  about 150 kW, it would be necessary to use a large volume of  water to cool the collector, and if we did not change the  collector structure, the pressure loss in the cooling system  would be too great.    Moreover, it was also necessary to reduce pressure loss so  we  could make the device more compact. Therefore, we studied  designs for the klystron collector cooling system that would  allow us to maintain cooling efficiency while holding pressure  loss in the cooling system to a minimum.    (2) High Voltage Resistance    We decided on a relatively small perveance in this klystron,  so that meant the beam voltage would be quite high. Therefore,  we had to consider ways to maintain the voltage resistance of  the electron gun.    (3) Beam Shape    It is essential to obtain a uniform, rod-shaped beam with  laminar flow in order to maintain stability during high-output  operation. Therefore, we studied the electrode shape and  magnetic circuit shape to realize the proper beam shape.    (4) High-Frequency Circuit    We designed the length of the high-frequency circuit based  on  the electrical circuit lengths of the 30 kW and 80 kW klystrons.  Furthermore, to hold down heat generation in the drift tubes  that accompanies such high output, we optimized the shapes of  the drift tubes.    Generally, if we increase the OD and the wall thickness of a  drift tube, the cavity impedance R/Q will drop. As a result, our  target efficiency is difficult to realize. Therefore, we  considered how to make the R/Q value the same as in the 30 kW  and 80 kW klystrons that we had already made.    (5) Long Life and Reliability    Generally, the life of the microwave tube is dependent on  the  life of the cathode that emits the electron beam. Therefore, we  studied how to create a long-lived, highly-reliable cathode and  adopted those modifications in this klystron.    Next we determined the objective characteristics for this  klystron as shown in Table 1. We set the operating frequency  band at 2.45 GHz, which is the ISM band (Industrial, Scientific,  and Medical), set output at 100 kW or better, and efficiency at  75% or better. Further, we considered the capability of  the  input pre-stage solid-state amplifier, and set a target gain of  48 dB or more. On the other hand, we also wanted the device to  be constructed so it would produce the specified characteristics  without adjustment when it was installed to facilitate  maintenance and replacement operations. As far as cooling was  concerned, we used water cooling for the body and the  electromagnets, and forced air cooling for the electron gun.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

On the other hand, there are disadvantages  in terms of voltage resistance and compactness because the  voltage is higher and the high-frequency circuit must be longer.    Naturally, for the sake of compactness, the lower the beam  voltage the better. We studied this overall problem and settled  for a perveance of 0.5A/V[.sup]3/2[/]. Therefore, because  of the relationship between output and effectiveness, the beam  voltage became 38.5 kVdc.    The parameters of the electron gun are shown in Table 2. To  obtain stable operation, it was necessary to increase voltage  resistance between the electrodes and obtain an electron beam  with laminar flow that has few ripples. Therefore, we used  computer simulations to determine the cathode diameter, electron  beam focusing ratio, distance between electrodes, and the design  of the electromagnetic circuit that creates the magnetic field  for focusing. Figure 1 shows the electron beam trajectory  obtained by computer simulation. The ripple rate of this  electron beam was an extremely small 1.5%, and thus we  obtained  an excellent electron beam.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2. Electron Gun Parameters                                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Item                                  |Features                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Perveance                             |0.5A/V[.sup]3/2[/]             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cathode Average Current Density       |1.0 A/cm[.sup]2[/]                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Beam Voltage                          |38.5 kVdc                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Accelerating Electrode Voltage        |38.5 kVdc                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cathode Current                       |3.8 A                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------            Generally, the greater the power the bigger the collector  that captures the electron beam. We used the CAD to optimize the  shape of the collector so that it will capture the electron beam  with greatest efficiency, and this enabled us to make it more  compact overall.    We used the same water-cooling format that we used on the 30  kW and 80 kW klystrons. Generally, as the Reynolds number gets  higher the convective heat transfer between the collector and  the cooling water improves and cooling efficiency increases. On  the other hand, however, pressure loss also increases. In this  100 kW klystron we computed the optimal cooling grooves on the  collector for maximum cooling efficiency with minimum pressure  loss and were able to design a very small collector.  <H5>  4. Performance </H5>   Table 4 shows the operating characteristics of the klystron.  The input/output properties under the operating conditions in  Table 4 are shown in Figure 4. At a frequency of 2.45 GHz we  obtained an output of more than 100 kW, a power gain of 50.5 dB,  and under saturated output operation, a conversion efficiency of  76%. These were nearly identical to the computed values  predicted by the CAD. Moreover, as far as weight is concerned,  we were able to make the device compact and lightweight at about  60 kg. Cooling the collector requires a flow volume of 150 L/min  of cooling water, and the pressure loss is a small value of 2.0  kg/cm[.sup]2[/] or less.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-22B>           Fig. 4 Input/Output Characteristics </FIG>       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4.

First of all, with respect to nMOS's drain current-gate  voltage characteristics, even if drain voltage is raised to 2V,  current quickly responds to this with precipitous rise,  confirming the fact it is equipped with a function to increase  width as a transistor. Secondly, as for the nMOS's properties of  drain current and drain voltage, it has been confirmed that when  source voltage is set at .1.5V , if gate voltage is below 0.6V,  drain current will not flow (in other words, it has a cut-off  property); also saturation characteristics has been confirmed  for drain voltage.    As for breakdown voltage by [punch-through], it was possible  to obtain 3.5V, comfortably topping the 1.5V which is equivalent  to the upper limit of power source voltage with current gate  length. An increase in drain current resulting from  [punch-through] was said to have been observed at around 4V.  This was due to the 10nm-deep shallow junction formed through  [punch through]. With a 30nm-deep junction, because of the  [punch-through], the transistor cannot be activated below the  0.5V level.  <H5>  To Get Around the Problem of Short Channel, Hot Carrier </H5>   With Toshiba's latest nMOS transistor, it became possible to  make change in threshold voltage and suppress lowering of S  factor (the inverse number of subthreshold current inclination).  Hot carrier effect is said to be minimum.    First of all, with respect to change in threshold voltage by  short channel effect, the threshold voltage for the 1.5V drain  voltage was controlled at below -0.16V through shortening of a  gate length from 1 micron to 0.04 micron. This compares  favorably with the case in which change of 0.1 V was obtained by  shortening a gate length from 1 micron to 0.1 micron by using  existing impurity-diffusion technology. As for the S factor,  although inferior to 80mV/[keta], still it was able to obtain  100mV/[keta].    Toshiba found that it was difficult to generate hot carriers  with the nMOS transistor. Measurement of impact-ionization ratio  and drain voltage dependency of substrate current indicated that  in both cases drain voltage plummeted to below 1.5V. Since this  drain voltage of 1.5 V is very close to Si's energy gap of 1.1  V, it stands to reason that not many hot carriers will be  generated under such conditions. Moreover, the energy level of  most hot carriers generated( which is a low-probability event)  in many cases tends to be low. For this reason, even if gate  length becomes minute, effect of hot carriers will not be  increased.    It was possible to improve the transistor's driving power  even with a 0.04 micron gate. With a 0.1 micron transistor,  improvements in both drain current and mutual conductance have  been in the range of from 30 to 40%. This will put drain  current at 600mA/mm and mutual conductance at 450mS/mm. It used  to be that, if below 0.2 micron, because of speed saturation, it  was not possible to improve drive capability by miniaturization.  However, the results of Toshiba's new transistor undermines this  thinking. The company's plan for the immediate future will be to  examine its mechanisms.  <H5>  Gate Length 0.04 micron, Junction Depth 10 nm </H5>   In order to prevent short channel effect, something which  must be done in order to obtain Toshiba's new transistor  characteristics, it is necessary to make a junction 10nm deep  for the gate length of 0.04 micron.    In order to achieve the gate length of 0.04 micron, after  the  excimer laser has been exposed, a gate electrode was made still  thinner using an isotropic [aciding]. Using the SEM measurement  method, Toshiba verified the length of the gate to be 0.043  micron after etching.    In order to obtain a shallow junction of 10nm, solid-phase P  was diffused from a gate-side wall. The company used 1000C,  10 seconds RTA (rapid thermal annealing) processing. Use of a  solid-phase diffusion using RTA is a technique Toshiba has  developed in order to develop a 0.1 micron pMOS transistor. In  this case, Toshiba achieved a 40nm junction formation by  diffusing B from BSG. On a Si substrate on which As is mounted,  since P is inclined to be segregated more than B, Toshiba's  thinking was that it would be easy to form a shallow junction.  In the case of B, the company could not form the junction less  shallow than 30nm.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-30A>           Fig. 3. Realizing Low Sheet Resistance Diffusion Layer </FIG>       Distribution of impurity in the direction of depth was  examined by measuring SIMS and sheet resistance. Using the SIMS  analysis, the company was able to verify that distribution in a  10nm zone was 10[.sup]18[/]/cm[.sup]3[/]. Sheet resistance  was improved to achieve    An overall process flow consists of the following:    (1) formation of a field-separation oxidation film;    (2) mounting of B on channels;    (3) heat diffusion by a furnace unit;    (4) formation of an oxidation film of a 3nm-thick gate using  800C oxidation;    (5) polycrystal Si film formation by adding P as impurity  in-situ;    (6) exposure of the gate using excimer laser;    (7) processing designed to make resist thinner using  aciding;    (8) etching of gate polycrystal Si using RIE;    (9) PSG film formation;    (10) formation of 190nm thick-side wall with RIE etchback;    (11) mounting of source- and drain-impurity As masking gate  electrodes and side wall;    (12) RTA processing to achieve diffusion of solid-phase P  forming a shallow junction of 10nm.  <H5>  Realization of pMOS Problem of Future </H5>   Future problems include realization of pMOS and suppression  of parasitic capacity. According to Toshiba, the company is  studying various methods, including solid-phase diffusion, to  develop pMOS. However, since the solid-phase diffusion of B  results in a junction as deep as 30nm, Toshiba feels that it  should investigate other type of impurity.</p>

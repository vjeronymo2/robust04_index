			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Northern Rock climbs 37% to Pounds 74.7m NORTHERN Rock Building Society, the 11th largest building society, yesterday announced a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 54.6m to Pounds 74.7m, in the year to December 31. The society's strong pre-tax performance in the year was partly offset by an extraordinary loss of Pounds 5.7m from the sale of its Northern Rock Property Services estate agency chain, as goodwill previously written off was credited to reserves. Profits after the extraordinary item and tax rose 22 per cent to Pounds 44.7m (Pounds 36.6m). This followed the takeover of the Lancastrian Building Society, which contributed 6 per cent to a 36 per cent rise in assets to Pounds 6bn (Pounds 4.4bn). Mr Christopher Sharp, managing director, said he believed Northern Rock's perfor-mance would prove exceptionally strong among the larger societies. However, he thought societies would in general report good results for the year. Mr Sharp said that 60 per cent of the society's provision of Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 6m) for possible bad debts during the year related to the Lancastrian's Pounds 25m commercial property lending book, which was now heavily provisioned. He said that the Lancastrian's 'sound' Pounds 230m portfolio of residential mortgage lending, and its 10 branches would bring in a regular annual income of between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m. Northern Rock's overall mortgage balances rose 34 per cent to Pounds 5bn (Pounds 3.7bn) and its net intake of retail funds rose 45 per cent to Pounds 914m (Pounds 636m). Mr Sharp said the inflow was helped by a postal saving account launched during the year. The ratio of costs to total income fell by a fifth to 38 per cent, largely because of the rapid growth in assets while costs were contained. The ratio of management expenses to mean assets fell by a quarter to 1.04 per cent.</p>

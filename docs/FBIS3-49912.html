			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, January 12 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec believes that since the Partnership For Peace  programme was first announced, there has been a shift which the  Czech Republic finds very agreeable, he said today after ending  bilateral talks with the other foreign ministers of the Visegrad  Four.    Zieleniec said this shift was the result of the diplomatic  attempts of the Czech Republic and other countries. The  political dimension, above all, of the project is now very  noticeable. It is emphasized that its aim is to extend the  community of nations holding the same values, which is specified  in the project in some detail. "This enables a European  security system to be built on values which we share, on the  protection of our way of life. This is the most essential part  of the alliance," he said.    He also pointed out that the project stressed the individual  approach of each country in the space allowed, which was logical  as it led to differentiation and not to the formation of further  groupings. From the interviews which he had had with Foreign  Ministers Olechowski, Moravcik and Jeszenszky, it seemed that  this awareness was beginning to predominate among the states of  central Europe. This meant that awareness of individual  countries' responsibility was becoming fundamental, as was  responsibility for political and economic stability within each  country. Under today's conditions, this was the most important  security consideration. Zieleniec said. This had been helped by  yesterday's meeting of foreign ministers with American Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, who saw things almost identically.    Asked if during the discussions any criticism of the Czech  Republic's individual approach to NATO had been voiced,  especially by Poland, Zieleniec said he believed the Polish  position was the result of a certain nervousness and also of  differences between individual Polish politicians. Zieleniec  quoted the Polish Foreign Minister as saying after today's  meeting that both parties now shared the same opinion.</p>

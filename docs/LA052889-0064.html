			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSIDER PROFILE: LARGE HOUSES REALM OF 'TEAR-DOWN KING'  </P> <P> Alan Khaderi wears a couple of hats, but the crown some bestow on him is not to  his liking:  </P> <P> "Tear-Down King of Beverly Hills."  </P> <P> The developer cringes at the words. He disassociates himself from the wave of  tear-downs that prompted city zoning law changes in March. And he prefers a low  profile, though he is president of the residential development arm of Columbia  Savings, a company with high visibility.  </P> <P> Since Columbia Residential Development was formed under his leadership five  years ago, it has built and sold more than $100 million in residential  properties. By Khaderi's count, this represents about 40 homes, 25 of them in  Beverly Hills, most on razed-home sites.  </P> <P> Khaderi probably has demolished more houses in Beverly Hills than anybody else.  He was a pioneer in leveling houses to build larger ones, on spec.  </P> <P> But he blames "other people who tried to copy our houses and overdid them or  built big boxes with little landscaping" for the City Council's action to  restrict the size of homes on bigger lots in the north part of the city.  </P> <P> The move was partly prompted by the construction by other developers of two  huge houses on a cliff above Coldwater Canyon Park, said city officials, who  requested anonymity, but one added, "Columbia Savings set the tone for building  the bigger houses, because they did so many."  </P> <P> Khaderi noted, however, that the zoning changes "will not affect the size of  our plans, because we've always been under the (new) allotted square footage."  </P> <P> He said he doesn't want the houses he develops to stand out because of unusual  size or style but, instead, wants them to look as if they were always part of  the neighborhood, he said.  </P> <P> He considers it a compliment when a new Columbia house is mistaken for a home  that has been remodeled. He uses mature trees "to give an impression that the  trees have been there for awhile," and he has put mud between tiles to make  roofs look old. He also has created weathered, monolithic-looking entries of  cast concrete.  </P> <P> The houses have fetched base prices from $1 million to $6.5 million. Khaderi  estimates that 75% of his buyers have been singles or couples, so Columbia  houses have been generally designed for these markets.  </P> <P> A $5.9-million house he just completed in Bel-Air is typical, although it has a  carport instead of the standard garage. The 6,892-square-foot house has two  stories, but the master suite takes up the entire second floor.  </P> <P> And the house has all three ingredients Khaderi says his home buyers want:  privacy, security and a good location. It is a block away from the home of  President and Mrs. Reagan.  </P> <P> Among its other features are white oak floors, light-colored walls, large  windows and many skylights -- all part of Khaderi's effort to make interiors  light and bright, which he learned from veteran builder Fred Smathers, starting  in 1975.  </P> <P> "We built quite a few homes together in Nichols Canyon," Khaderi said. They  stopped building in the early 1980s, when the economy slowed, and Khaderi  resumed, with Columbia, when the market picked up again.  </P> <P> When he met Smathers, Khaderi was a full-time dentist with a practice in  Hancock Park. "I was interested in art history and architecture when I was an  undergraduate at UCLA," Khaderi said, "but I became a dentist because my mother  and father wanted me to become a dentist."  </P> <P> He earned his dental degree at USC, where he was a student of Ellis Ring,  another dentist who became a developer.  </P> <P> "He was a role model for me," Khaderi said of the 75-year-old Ring, who  developed, with his brother, more than 6,000 apartments in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Now 49, Khaderi is still a dentist after 25 years, though he sees only a few  patients -- mainly family and friends. "It would have been very difficult for  me to have given it up entirely," he said.  </P> <P> As a real estate developer, Khaderi maintains unpretentious offices in the back  of a Columbia Savings building in Beverly Hills. As a dentist, he shares an  office with another dentist in Hancock Park.  </P> <P> "That makes my mother happy," he said, "because she worked to put me through  USC."  </P></p>

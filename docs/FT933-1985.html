			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Turkey moves into line with EC - A thorough shake-up of the banking sector TURKEY'S new banking law, which officials describe as the biggest change in the financial landscape since the mid 1980s, entered the statute book last week. The long awaited decree accelerates Turkey's economic convergence with the European Community, and underpins the growing internationalism of what is already the country's most up-to-date business sector. The new law has a number of broad objectives: To force banks to strengthen balance sheets through improvements to assets quality and through the provision of extra capital as a cushion against bad debt; To help restructure the sector, notably in creating a more formidable buffer between banks and their industrial affiliates; To reduce the role of the state by forcing loss-making public banks to run down loan portfolios in order to meet the more stringent capital requirements. Taken with the plans for the privatisation of state banks, the government reforms represent the most thoroughgoing shake-up of the banking system since the mid-1980s. The legislation establishes international standards of banking prudence, bringing Turkey into line with the EC's second banking directive on a number of key issues - legal lending limits, property exposure, and a bank's equity participations. For the first time, banks will have to publish externally audited accounts, something a number of state banks have not done in the past. The moves have been well received by the industry. Mr Ibrahim Betil, of Bank Ekspres, is particularly encouraged by the changes to the bankruptcy provisions for banks. Until now, the government was left to bail out insolvent private banks, which were either merged with or transferred to a state bank. Under the new law, a bank can choose liquidation. Such a threat, Mr Betil believes, will encourage greater efficiency. It will also make depositors take the overall health of a bank into account. Turkey has 69 banks, of which 57 are commercial banks. Total assets at the end of 1992 stood at Dollars 67.2bn. The state dominates the sector, with the nine state banks accounting for half of the assets, a ratio which, despite liberalisation and the arrival of new banks, has changed little over the past decade. The challenge for Turkey is to balance liberalisation with the need for a better regulatory framework. Considerable strides have been made. Changes in the debt provisioning rules were introduced in 1988, together with a communique on capital adequacy the following year. Treasury officials concede that the provisioning policy is 'not 100 per cent in line with EC practice'. Turkish banks also have some way to go to meet the capital adequacy requirements of Bank for International Settlements. Banks have six years to meet the new capital ratios but the property provisions have to be in place by 1995. The choice for many banks is either to raise new equity or sell property assets. Dr Ekrem Kesin, senior economist at Turk Economi Bankasi, says there should be little difficulty in accommodating the changes. Many private banks are currently reporting peak profits, although the day when some family-owned banks are forced to float shares on the stock market may not be far off. The new regulations go some way towards addressing the need for more arm's length dealings between banks and related third parties, such as subsidiary companies, directors and partners. In parallel with this, there are now additional curbs on the equity investment a bank can make. Mr Aclan Acar of Garanti believes that from now on, group companies will be encouraged to be more independent of the group banks. In the state sector, with profits squeezed and the government unlikely to pump more funds into the sector, most state banks will be forced to run down investment holdings. On a modest scale, this is already happening. The state owned Development Bank TKB is selling its participations in rural industries. Vakiflar Bankasi is following a similar course. But bank analysts say for the bigger state banks - like Halk, Emlak and Ziraat - the capital targets are a considerable challenge. Isbank, the largest commercial bank, is 40 per cent state-owned and has been more successful in divesting shares. But Mr Unal Korukcu, general manager, points out that even here, the nominal share portfolio has actually increased as non-performing loans have been converted to equity. Mr Korukcu also suggests that with fewer good borrowers at current high real interest rates, the high level of liquidity of many banks is hampering efforts at meeting capital standards. Yet whatever the difficulties, the way ahead seems unmistakeable. The state is in retreat. As the state banks put their houses in order, they will also be preparing for their eventual privatisation. This is the central pillar of the government's reform programme.</p>

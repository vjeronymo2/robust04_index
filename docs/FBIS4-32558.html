			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 27 Jun--According to Grzegorz Kolodko,  deputy prime minister and finance minister, cooperation with the  World Bank "Will be even better than it has been so far."  Kolodko said this to journalists after meeting today with  Wilfried Thalwitz, World Bank vice president (Europe and  Central Asia Regional Office).    The bank supports the "Strategy for Poland" program, as well  as new, joint projects, which will be financed from the bank's  resources. They are connected with the development of  infrastructure, a restructuring of the power industry and the  welfare system, and development of the transport network. "Today  we talked about the money, which is big," Kolodko said.    Most of the World Bank funds are used, but we have some  problems with utilizing some of these funds--for example, in the  housing industry. The aim of the talks is to find the best  solutions so that the World Bank can join in the implementation  of tasks resulting from the Strategy for Poland program.</p>

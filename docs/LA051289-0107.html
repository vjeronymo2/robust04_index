			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEIRA AND KROFT JOIN IN CBS MUSICAL CHAIRS  </P> <P> CBS News correspondents Meredith Vieira and Steve Kroft will leave the  low-rated "West 57th" magazine series for its high-rated older brother, "60  Minutes," the network said Thursday.  </P> <P> The shift comes three months after Diane Sawyer made her well-publicized jump  from "60 Minutes" to ABC News to co-anchor a new prime-time series, and less  than two months after Connie Chung left NBC to anchor what will be a revamped  version of "West 57th" next fall.  </P> <P> Vieira, 35, has been with "West 57th" since it premiered in 1985. Kroft, 43,  joined it a year later. Their reports for "60 Minutes" will start appearing in  the fall, when the show launches its 22nd season, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> In announcing the move, CBS said the shift was intended to ensure that its  durable Sunday news magazine series "has as bright a future as it has had a  past and that it continues to be successful in the 1990s."  </P> <P> Vieira and Kroft will join the program's other regulars -- Morley Safer, Harry  Reasoner, Ed Bradley and Mike Wallace, who turned 71 on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The exit of Vieira and Kroft from "West 57th" leaves only Karen Burns and John  Ferrugia remaining on that Saturday-night series. Whether they'll return with  it next fall isn't yet known, a spokesman said. "West 57th" executive producer  Andrew Lack is revamping the series, with Chung to serve as its anchor.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, CBS News correspondent Susan Spencer signed a new four-year  contract, even though Chung has taken over the Sunday "CBS Evening News" that  Spencer had been anchoring. Spencer will continue to cover the medical beat  that she's been on since 1986, but now also will be involved in political and  international coverage.  </P> <P> And a proxy statement given to CBS shareholders at their annual meeting here  this week showed that former "CBS Evening News" anchor Walter Cronkite will  earn a total of $3,750,000 over a 10-year period under an agreement reached  last September. It also said that CBS Broadcast Group President Howard  Stringer, who until last July was head of CBS News, is negotiating a new  contract that both sides agree will pay Stringer a total of $2.6 million for  three years.  </P></p>

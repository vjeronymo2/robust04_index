			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (6): Top-ranking regional event - International Aerospace Exhibition AS many as 450 companies from 33 countries will be taking part in the second International Aerospace Exhibition in Dubai on November 7-11. The degree of interest shown by supplier countries and aviation companies has confirmed the hopes of its organisers, the UK's Fairs &amp; Exhibitions, that 'Dubai '93'  -held every two years - ranks, in the Middle East, on a par with Farnborough and Paris for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The Financial Times is organising a conference, also in Dubai, on 'World Commercial Aviation' on November 8-10. Speakers include senior executives from aviation companies, government organisations and commercial banks. Some 75 civil and military aircraft which will be on display and will take up the bulk of the one kilometre-long exhibition grounds at Dubai's international airport. Equal numbers of civil and military suppliers are expected and the exhibition is intended to reflect a trend for manufacturers to display future aerospace technology rather than just existing products. But the immediate interest lies in potential orders for high-technology defence equipment from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi are expected to spend more than Dollars 30bn over the next seven years, in addition to existing orders, on advanced fighters, helicopters and air defence systems. A Kuwait Defence Ministry spokesman said on October 5 that the government was still evaluating different options for helicopters, following reports that Kuwait had followed Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi in having placed firm orders for the McDonnell Douglas Apache attack helicopters. Offset agreements, by which the supplier or the supplier government agrees to invest 30 per cent or more of the contract value in the client country, are now a standard part of large defence contracts. Two factors have caused competition to intensify between traditional western suppliers and companies from the former Soviet bloc countries. The first is the expected decline in defence requirements from Israel and the Arab front-line countries following the signing of the PLO-Israel accord in September. The second is that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, whatever the size of their budget deficits, are perceived to be the last remaining countries with significant amounts of cash to spare and obvious high-technology defence needs to compensate for their small populations and defence establishments. Since the end of the 1990-91 Gulf war which exposed their defence weaknesses, they have all embarked on expensive defence procurement programmes. The UAE in particular is concerned about the recent Iranian occupation of the UAE Gulf islands of Abu Musa and the Tumbs near the Gulf entrance to the Strait of Hormuz. The Gulf states and the western countries with which they have defence agreements have also commented on the Iranian acquisition of two former Soviet diesel submarines at a cost of some Dollars 400m and at a time when Iran is conspicuously strapped for cash. Iran is reported to have an option on a third submarine. It is also reported to have plans to assemble North Korean-made medium-range Scud missiles. The Iranian government has denied recent Saudi newspaper reports that it was planning to test-fire the North Korean missiles in the Dasht-e-Lut desert in central Iran. Russia and other CIS and eastern European countries will be represented by some 40 companies. Russia also intends to put on display the giant Antonov 125 cargo carrier as well as the Mig-29 and the Sukhoi-27 fighters. Russian companies also have a wealth of research and development experience, most of which cannot now be afforded by their own government. Their weakness may be their need for financing. Among civil airline fleets, the most publicised customer, Saudi Arabia's flag carrier Saudia, has yet to select suppliers to revamp its ageing fleet of some 60 aircraft. Both Boeing and Airbus are vying for the deal. India is expected to spend several hundred million dollars modernising its airports. Dubai is also due to expand its airport - where the exhibition is being held. The Dubai government is still examining different options, and it is possible an announcement could be made at the air show.</p>

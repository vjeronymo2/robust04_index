			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Bank to resume Ecu issuance programme THE Bank of England plans to sell Ecu500m of three-year notes next month, resuming its Ecu issuance programme after the turbulence seen in the last months of 1992. The announcement is the second recent sign of commitment to the Ecu market. On Friday, the French Treasury said it would hold an auction of between Ecu500 and Ecu700m of 10-year government Ecu bonds tomorrow. The Bank was forced to cancel its October tender of three-year Ecu Treasury notes last year because of tensions in the European financial markets. However, tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism have recently eased. The first tender is scheduled for February 2, when the Bank plans to sell Ecu500m of notes due January 23, 1996. The Bank sold Ecu2bn of three-year Ecu notes in 1992.</p>

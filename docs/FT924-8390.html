			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Marsh &amp; McLennan buys Frizzell Group MARSH &amp; McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, yesterday announced the Pounds 107m acquisition of Frizzell Group, the Poole-based financial services and insurance group. The deal, Marsh's most significant expansion in the UK since it acquired CT Bowring, the Lloyd's and London market insurance broker, in 1980, could pave the way for an expansion of marketing of personal insurance through 'affinity' groups such as trades unions and leisure groups. Frizzell and Marsh are market leaders in this field, which can yield significant cost advantages over traditional distribution methods. It will also yield a large profit for 3i, the venture capital company, which has built up a 40.8 per cent stake in Frizzell since 1954. The Frizzell family own a further 40 per cent of the company, with the balance held by directors, staff and the company's pension fund. These shareholders will retain ownership of Frizzell Insurance Brokers, but the rest of the group will become part of Marsh. At the core of the group, Frizzell Financial Services insures more than 500,000 individuals through organisations such as the Caravan Club, the National Trust, the National Association of Local Government Officers, the National Union of Teachers and Civil Service Motoring Association. Revenues in 1991 were Pounds 66m. The Marsh subsidiary, Seabury &amp; Smith, is the leading manager of insurance programmes for affinity groups in North America and counts employees of corporations such as Ford and Chrysler among its clients. Seabury 1991 revenues were about Dollars 150m (Pounds 96.7m). Mr Colin Frizzell, chairman, said: 'We had reached a point in our history where we needed to spend more capital on information systems. We needed to re-engineer or update the whole of our business.' Refurbishment of the company's offices in Poole, where most of the 1,450 employees work, will be a priority. The link would allow Marsh to sell personal lines insurance products to employees of companies with which CT Bowring does business. Mr Claude Mercier of Seabury said that by combining with Frizzell his group hoped to 'achieve savings. The secret of this business is to keep costs to a minimum.'</p>

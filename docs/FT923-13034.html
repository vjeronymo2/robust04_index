			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Heavy futures trade STERLING futures contracts again traded in a wide range, reflecting fears that UK interest rates might be increased in the wake of tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting. However, activity in the cash markets was more subdued. Many traders failed to alter their positions on the future direction of changes in UK borrowing costs, and cash rates were mostly unchanged from the previous night's close. With more than 45,000 lots changing hands, trading in the September short sterling contract was heavy for the second day running. From an opening price of 89.83, the contract was pushed down at one stage to 89.80. That reflected the sentiment in the market that an increase in UK base rates, now 10 per cent, was likely over the next two months. Towards the close of trading, dealers took a more circumspect view of the outcome from the Bundesbank meeting. Many believe that it will tighten conditions under which German banks can borrow from the central bank, dampening inflationary pressures caused by unification. Such an action would be in place of a move to raise German interest rates, and would have fewer international repercussions. As a result, the sterling contract picked up in the afternoon, ending at 89.89, the same level as its Monday close. In the cash market, the three-month interbank rate, which reflects perceptions about the likely shift in UK base rates, closed unchanged at 10 1/8 per cent. Overnight money was quoted at 10 1/16 per cent. Most other cash rates ended at the previous night's close of 10 1/8 per cent. As for operations by the Bank of England to meet the estimated Pounds 650m liquidity shortage, the discount houses refrained from active participation in the market until relatively late yesterday. This fitted the pattern of recent weeks. In the morning, faced with lack of enthusiasm by the houses to part with their paper, the Bank bought just Pounds 10m of Band 2 bills at the established rate of 9 7/8 per cent. Later the Bank bought Pounds 8m of Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 71m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 50m of Band 2 Treasury bills and Pounds 105m of Band 2 bank bills, all at 9 7/8 per cent. It provided late assistance of around Pounds 230m.</p>

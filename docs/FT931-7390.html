			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Moscow protests against Yeltsin SOME 10,000-15,000 people yesterday marched through Moscow in a protest against Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and his government. The rally marked Russian Armed Forces Day, which had been officially observed by government figures putting flowers on the grave of the unknown soldier by the Kremlin. Mr Yeltsin was absent from the ceremony, on holiday, while Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, his rival and head of parliament, continued an official trip to Finland. The demonstration was led by three of the alleged ringleaders of the August 1991 coup: Mr Valentin Pavlov, the then Soviet premier; Mr Vladimir Kryuchkov, the KGB chief; and Mr Oleg Baklanov, a senior Communist official. The audience in the central Manezh Square heard officers denounce Mr Yeltsin, their commander-in-chief, and demand the resignation of Gen Pavel Grachev, the defence minister.</p>

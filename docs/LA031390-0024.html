			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS 2ND PARK FOR OFF-LEASH DOGS  </P> <P> With little debate, the city Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners voted  unanimously Monday to establish an off-leash dog exercise area in the Woodley  Park area of the Sepulveda Basin.  </P> <P> Supporters hope the additional dog run will relieve congestion at Laurel Canyon  Park along Mulholland Drive, the only city park where dogs are allowed to run  unleashed.  </P> <P> But before dogs can run free in the Woodley Park exercise area, the City  Council must allocate $23,000 for improvements, including $12,000 to fence in  the three-acre site, $3,000 for a water fountain for people and a water spigot  for dogs, and $5,000 for an irrigation system for the area. Since April, 1988,  Laurel Canyon Park has been the site of a popular pilot program in which dogs  are allowed to run free during certain hours. The council approved the dog park  after a three-year controversy that began when Councilman Joel Wachs, who  represented the area at the time, cracked down on unleashed pets in the park.  </P> <P> But the park attracted dog owners from all over the San Fernando Valley,  prompting demands by dog owners to expand the program. The board is also  considering the creation of a similar dog run in the Riverdale area of Griffith  Park.  </P> <P> The new dog run will be in a grassy area south of the Sepulveda Basin archery  range.  </P></p>

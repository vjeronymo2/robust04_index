			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: The price of share dealing Sir, I was interested to read the latest proposals by the Stock Exchange to inhibit insider dealing as reported by Robert Peston ('Tighter checks on insider dealing proposed', October 5). I would like to make the following two observations: 1) Suspension of dealings in shares after 'normal' price fluctuation parameters have been exceeded would probably be too late, as the professional insiders would have already dealt. 2) In the specific case of Portals it is doubtful that any stockbroker asked by a client whether or not to sell the shares during the four-day period in question would have failed to point out the bid speculation - the shareholders who missed out would more than likely have been those using execution-only, cut-price share dealing facilities. Investing is the same as any other business - you only get what you pay for. Richard Uzupris, 6 Britannia Gardens, Westcliffe-on-Sea, Essex SS0 8BN</p>

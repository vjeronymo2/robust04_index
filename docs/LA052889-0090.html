			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COELHO TO RESIGN FROM CONGRESS;  </P> <P> FACING ETHICS PROBE, CALIFORNIAN REPORTEDLY SAYS IT'S TIME TO LEAVE  </P> <P> Rep. Tony Coelho, the third-ranking member of the House Democratic leadership,  is resigning from Congress, sources said Friday night.  </P> <P> The stunning decision by the 46-year-old Californian follows mounting reports  of ethical problems that threatened to block his advancement up the leadership  ladder.  </P> <P> Coelho's announcement was made in the form of an interview with the New York  Times. In it, Coelho (D-Merced) said that he did not want to put his party and  his colleagues through a protracted investigation of his personal finances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Chance to Move On'  </P> <P> "I want to give my party a chance to move on," he said. "I don't intend to put  my party through more turmoil. I don't intend to put this institution through  more turmoil. And more importantly, I don't intend to put my family through  more turmoil."  </P> <P> Coelho had been expected to face investigations by the House and the Justice  Department for a 1986 investment involving the purchase of $100,000 in junk  bonds underwritten by the investment firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert. He has  acknowledged failing to report on his financial disclosure form the help that  he received from a Columbia Savings &amp; Loan executive in buying the bonds.  </P> <P> The resignation announcement came only hours after Coelho's press spokesman had  informed reporters that his boss was planning to jump into the expected race  for House majority leader "with both feet."  </P> <P> Officials in Washington were thunderstruck by the news, which came near the end  of a tumultuous week that saw House Speaker Jim Wright move toward an expected  resignation this week.  </P> <P> "Oh, my God," said George Kundanis, a top aide to House Majority Leader Thomas  J. Foley (D-Wash.) when he learned from a reporter of Coelho's decision.  </P> <P> Foley is expected to become the new Speaker if Wright's resignation takes  place. That would open up his job as Democratic leader, the No. 2 position in  the House. Coelho had been regarded as the front-runner for that post.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A New Challenge'  </P> <P> "If I can't be leader and if I can't be whip," Coelho told the New York Times,  "it's time to try a new and different challenge. Therefore, June 15, which is  my 47th birthday, will be my last day in the Congress."  </P> <P> Coelho's unexpected move clears the way for Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of  Missouri to enter the race for majority leader. Gephardt and Coelho met Friday  in the latter's Capitol office.  </P> <P> Other candidates in the race are expected to include Rep. Ed Jenkins of  Georgia.  </P> <P> There will also be a spirited fight for the post of majority whip, which Coelho  is vacating. The likely candidates include Reps. William H. Gray III of  Pennsylvania, David E. Bonior of Michigan and Beryl Anthony Jr. of Arkansas.  </P> <P> Earlier, Common Cause, the liberal lobby group, called for a House ethics  investigation of Coelho.  </P> <P> In a letter to House Ethics Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles),  Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said that a formal House inquiry is  needed to determine whether Coelho violated rules prohibiting members from  accepting "favors or benefits" under questionable circumstances.  </P> <P> Coelho has admitted that he did not report details of a 1986 junk bond  transaction that netted him $6,882 in six months -- a deal in which he put up  none of his own money.  </P> <P> Coelho also admitted underpaying his tax on the bond transaction by more than  $2,000. He blamed his accountant for the error.  </P></p>

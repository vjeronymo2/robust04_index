			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Government poised to lift ban on Adams' visits to mainland The government is poised to lift the exclusion orders banning Mr Gerry Adams and other prominent Sinn Fein members from visiting the British mainland. The move is likely within days and would be part of the government's staged response to the IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland. The decision may be agreed at a meeting of Mr John Major and cabinet colleagues today. Ministers will use the meeting to conduct a detailed stock-taking of the situation in Ulster after last week's loyalist ceasefire. London is considering opening a 'reversible' dialogue with republican leaders. Senior ministers have come to recognise that they may never be given an unequivocal pledge that the IRA ceasefire is permanent. Ministers have acknowledged that such talks could be under way by Christmas. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said last week that the loyalist ceasefire made it harder for the Provisional IRA to return to violence. Moderate unionists, whose support for the peace process is vital, are not expected to object to an early move to lift the exclusion orders since many see them as a denial of the union's integrity. The exclusion order against Mr Adams, the Sinn Fein president, was made last October under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, refused to revoke it in January. The ban was referred to the European Court of Justice in July, with European judges asked to lay down legal guidelines on the competing interests of Mr Adams' right to move freely within the European Union, including the UK, and the government's right under European law to take action against him in the interests of national security.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Profit surge at Axel Springer Verlag AXEL Springer Verlag, the German media group, yesterday reported a surge in profits for 1992, but warned that recession and intense competition were taking their toll on turnover in the current year. Reflecting the impact of a cost-cutting programme and lower newsprint prices, net profits last year were DM57.2m (Dollars 35.7m), more than five times the DM11.2m made in 1991. Another factor behind the profits increase was the sale of loss-making investments, Springer said. Springer said that the improvement in profitability would allow it to resume paying dividends. The 1992 dividend is to be DM12 per share, the same level as for each year from 1986 to 1990 inclusive. In 1991 the group paid no dividend. Turnover for last year dropped by DM115.4m, or 3.1 per cent, to DM3.57bn. Springer blamed the decline on competition in the media sector which had led to a fall in advertising revenue as well as from newspaper sales. The group, which publishes the daily mass-circulation Bild newspaper as well as Die Welt, a more serious daily newspaper, said the trend had continued into the current business year, with newspaper revenues down by 3.4 per cent and advertising revenue down by 7.5 per cent in the first four months of the year. It said in the light of the recession in Germany there were no signs that the deterioration would be reversed. However, Springer said it intended to pursue its rationalisation policies with the hope of reporting a reasonable profit for the current year. Capital investment for the current year is set to be DM330m, with the emphasis on improving the quality of newspapers printed in eastern Germany. This involves the development of a new offset-printing plant in Spandau in Berlin. Last year, capital investment amounted to DM245.2m, up from DM198m.</p>

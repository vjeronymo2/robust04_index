			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HONECKER TO GO ON TRIAL;  </P> <P> ACCUSED OF USING POST TO ROB STATE  </P> <P> Prosecutors said today they have filed criminal charges against former  Communist Party chief Erich Honecker and five other ousted officials accused of  using their power to rob the state and live in luxury.  </P> <P> The announcement preceded a crucial party congress that opened tonight in East  Berlin. Party leaders were expected to choose their third party leader in three  months and radically alter the party structure.  </P> <P> Prosecution spokesman Peter Przybylski told reporters that formal charges were  filed against Honecker, former Premier Willi Stoph and four other ex-leaders  ousted in the nationwide pro-democracy movement.  </P> <P> "They are accused of damaging the economy of the German Democratic Republic and  of personally enriching themselves by abuse of office and corruption," the  spokesman told reporters.  </P> <P> He said the officials' homes were searched but did not say when the charges  were filed or when a trial will occur.  </P> <P> Four of the six are in prison. The 77-year-old Honecker, ousted from power Oct.  18, is too sick to be jailed, and former Politburo member Hermann Axen is  having an eye operation in Moscow, Przybylski said.  </P> <P> In addition to Stoph, those under arrest are former Politburo members Guenther  Kleiber, Werner Krolikowski and Erich Mielke, he said.  </P> <P> Two months of political upheaval in East Germany set into motion investigations  into abuses of power by the ousted Communist elite, whose members allegedly  used their high positions to live in luxury off the state.  </P> <P> Honecker has been under house arrest in the lavish residential compound where  he and other Politburo members lived.  </P> <P> The Communist Party's historic emergency congress, held in an East Berlin  sports hall, this evening began debating the party's proposed new program that  calls for free elections and broad cooperation with opposition groups.  </P> <P> The congress was to elect a new leadership and reportedly planned to consider  changing the Communists' name to the Socialist Party of Germany and scrapping  the leadership hierarchy of a general-secretary, a Central Committee and a  Politburo.  </P> <P> East German Premier Hans Modrow delivered the keynote speech to the congress  and echoed other calls for Communist Party unity.  </P> <P> "Let us not allow the party to be broken, to go under, but let's make it clean  and strong," Modrow said as the 3,000 delegates applauded.  </P> <P> "We too are the people," Modrow said, referring to the slogan widely used by  thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators who have taken to the streets to  demand democratic reforms and the prosecution of corrupt former officials.  </P> <P> Modrow, one of the few Communists to enjoy popularity, also ruled out  reunification of the two Germanys.  </P> <P> "Reunification is not on the agenda," he said as the delegates broke into long  applause.  </P> <P> The party agreed during historic "round table" talks with opposition groups  Thursday to hold free parliamentary elections May 6, draft a new constitution  and back the dissolution of the despised security police apparatus.  </P></p>

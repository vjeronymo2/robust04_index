			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Smith sees threat in jobless toll LABOUR'S onslaught on the government over the recession intensified yesterday as Mr John Smith, the party leader, issued a stark warning that unemployment was reaching levels that posed a serious social threat. Mr John Major, the prime minister, was yesterday once again upbeat about the economy, saying he thought people might be inclined to spend again now they had repaid debts incurred a few years earlier. 'It could be that the tide is turning, but it is too early to say how profound that change is,' the prime minister said. But Mr Smith insisted that 'second-hand assurances' from Mr Major that the economy was on the brink of recovery were failing to convince people. Speaking in Cardiff, he warned that unemployment was reaching 'an extremely dangerous level'. 'It is beginning not only to menace our prospects of economic recovery, but we are on the edge of having serious social problems,' he said. As the opposition sought to capitalise on unease about government performance suggested by opinion polls, such as that in the Times yesterday, which gave them a 12 point lead, all three main parties are turning their minds to the forthcoming by-election at Newbury. The seat, held by the Tories with a majority of about 12,000 against a Liberal Democrat challenge at the general election, will offer the first test of how far the continued economic recession has turned opinion against the Conservatives since last April. With the return of Mr Major the Tories will use their local government conference today to seek to regain the political initiative and steady the nerves among their supporters. Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, will lead the offensive with a return to the theme of law and order and an attack on opinion pollsters, based on their poor performance in last year's election campaign.</p>

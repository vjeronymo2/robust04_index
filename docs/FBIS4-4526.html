			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's foreign  minister sought Japanese help Sunday in allaying fears of war on  the Korean peninsula raised by North Korea's nuclear program.  Han and his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata discussed recent  developments concerning North Korea and agreed they should give  diplomacy another chance to solve the nuclear crisis, South  Korean officials said. Han came to Tokyo after high-level  consultations with U.S. officials in Washington. He briefed  Hata on overall discussions during their private meeting and at  dinner.    Expressing concern over various side effects caused by the  impression of danger in South Korea, such as a visible decrease  in foreigners' investment activities, Han requested Tokyo's help  in painting an accurate picture. He emphasized that no special  military movements have been detected on the North Korean front.    Both foreign ministers gave positive marks to the U.N.  Security Council presidential statement urging Pyongyang to  allow further nuclear inspections, noting China's active  participation in the process. Han called for a  Seoul-Tokyo-Washington alliance in dealing with Pyongyang's  nuclear program and a Chinese role in applying pressure on North  Korea, the officials said.    While Han and Hata talked about pressing North Korea, they  took note of the mid-May "deadline" for the Stalinist state to  accept further nuclear checks. Until then, the foreign ministers  agreed to carry on with diplomatic efforts, the officials said.    "I have emphasized to Japan that South Korea and the United  States have neither any intention nor need to take a new  initiative right now," Han told reporters after his meeting with  Hata. "South Korea and the United States decided to keep our  doors open and resume dialogue efforts when the opportunity  arises," said Han.    If the U.N. Security Council did decide to push for economic  sanctions against North Korea, Japan's support would be critical  to the embargo's effectiveness. Chochongnyon, a pro-Pyongyang  organization in Japan, is believed to send 600 million to 800  million U.S. dollars annually to North Korea. Successfully  severing this money line would have serious repercussions for  Pyongyang, and Foreign Minister Han sought Tokyo's help if such  action was needed, according to the officials.    Han was to call on Prime Minister Morihito Hosokawa Monday  morning before returning to Seoul.</p>

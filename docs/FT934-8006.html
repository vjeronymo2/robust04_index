			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum oversupply forecast to continue WESTERN WORLD platinum supply this year will be well ahead of demand, according to Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group. Nevertheless, it suggests that present prices closely reflect the fundamental market position and platinum's price during the next six months is likely to range between USDollars 350 and Dollars 390 a troy ounce. But the forecast holds only as long as there is no market-disturbing news from South Africa or Russia, the two biggest producing countries. Platinum is heading for a supply surplus for the fourth successive year, JM says in a special interim report on the platinum group metals markets. This year's surplus is predicted to be 190,000 ounces and will be much bigger than the 20,000 ounces seen in 1992 or the 120,000 ounces for 1991. But the market should be able to absorb it with little difficulty, suggests Mr Jeremy Coombes, general manager, marketing, of JM's precious metals division. He points out that the platinum market, unlike many western base metals markets, is no longer in turmoil because of Russian exports. Russian export sales have been placed in the hands of one central organisation, Almaz, which has been selling platinum mainly on long-term contract at volumes similar to those in 1992. Mr Coombes predicts Russian platinum shipments to the west this year will fall by about 100,000 ounces, or 13 per cent, to 650,000 ounces. He warns, however, that the South African producers, have little room left for further voluntary closures of capacity. 'It is difficult for the mines to forego revenue by reducing shipments,' he points out. South African producers will continue to increase output until 1997 when their present expansion programmes are scheduled to be completed. 'If this aggravates market oversupply and causes further price weakness, the mines with the highest costs may not avoid closure or sale.' JM predicts that platinum demand will grow by 6 per cent, from 3.8m to 4.02m ounces, this year, thanks to increased consumption by the automotive and jewellery industries. Automotive demand will rise by 12 per cent to 1.74m ounces - 42 per cent of total demand - driven by the European Commission's regulations (which have required anti-pollution catalysts to be fitted to more cars) as well as higher car production on the American continent. Platinum supply is forecast by JM to grow by 10 per cent, from 3.82m to 4.21m ounces. South African platinum shipments are set to reach a record 3.25m ounces this year, up by 18 per cent from 2.75m ounces, and represent 77 per cent of total supply.

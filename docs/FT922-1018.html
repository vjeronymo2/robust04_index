			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (5): New car plant will be test-bed for 'lean production' - Mercedes-Benz THE label 'Made in Germany' which has served for so long as the prime marketing tool of the federal republic's quality car makers, is no longer enough. Recession everywhere, luxury taxes in the US, and the opposition using every sales stunt in the book have hit them hard. Mr Arno Bohn, head of hard-pressed Porsche, goggles as he tells of a US Rolls-Royce dealer giving away a mid-range Mercedes with every Silver Cloud. Mr Werner Niefer, Mercedes-Benz chief, mutters darkly about dumping and 'strategic pricing' capers which lead to Toyota's selling its Lexus in the US for less than Dollars 40,000 and for more than Dollars 55,000 in Germany. Meanwhile, German makers are getting their act together. Mercedes acknowledges that Japanese manufacturers on average have a 35 per cent production cost advantage over their German competitors. About 10 per cent of that is accounted for by relatively low capital costs in Japan and the extraordinarily long working hours the competition squeezes out of its workforce. While social evolution and globalisation of capital markets work at eroding these advantages, Mercedes-Benz has set about improving its competitive condition through its own efforts. The most obvious signs of emergent determination to cut the fat have appeared in the past few months in announcements of huge job cuts among all German motor manufacturers. The half-way mark in Mercedes' plan to slash its workforce by 20,000 will be reached by the end of this year. The aim is clear. As Mr Niefer and his colleagues have stated: additional wage costs, which exceed improvements in productivity, will not be passed on to customers. They will be paid for indirectly by the German workforce. While forced redundancies are almost unknown in Germany, job cuts will be achieved by non-replacement of people moving on and 'social measures' including early retirement and training for other jobs. Accordingly, this year's 5.8 per cent pay rise - adding an extra DM600m to Mercedes' costs - will lead to cuts of between 8,000 and 10,000 jobs by the turn of the year. There are already rising expectations in industry and government that the narrow squeak in this year's engineering pay round - a damaging national strike was averted at the last minute - and the 23-month duration of the deal, may mark a turning point and a return to the traditional German pattern of 'rational' pay settlements. The implementation of recommendations from leading management consultancies that the auto, engineering and electronics industries should shed almost 400,000 jobs in the next few years, already widely underway, should underline the message to the powerful IG Metall union. Meanwhile, Mercedes is adding capacity. Its new car plant at Rastatt, close to the border between Baden-Wurttemberg and Alsace, will steadily increase output to 90,000 cars a year by 1996, raising group capacity from 580,000 today. The works, only the company's third in the country, appears to be a demonstration of faith in the old 'Made in Germany' principle. It might also be considered a remarkable development in the light of constant claims from Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of the Mercedes parent, Daimler-Benz, that domestic production costs are killing off Germany's attractions as a manufacturing base. But it is much more than a factory: it is a test bed for the company's future manufacturing strategy. Especially in its early days, Rastatt will function as a proving site for new techniques in 'lean production', logistics and manpower management which will subsequently be introduced into the group's other established works at nearby Sindelfingen and Bremen in the north. The lessons will also be passed back to component suppliers, which will in future work far more closely with the Mercedes research and development teams. One initial short-term aim is to reduce the number of parts which have to be handled and fitted at the works. Suppliers will be required to supply complete pre-assemblies built and tested precisely to Mercedes standards. The clearest clues to what is afoot in Rastatt are provided by the absence of anything resembling a conventional production line and the presence of teams of 10 to 15 workers clustered around custom-built cradles swinging body shells to and fro giving them easy access to bolt holes and fixing points. This is 'group working' German-style. Not, Mr Niefer stressed, copied from Japan or Scandinavia, but developed specially to suit domestic conditions. Teams of eight to 10 are given responsibility for each stage of assembly. Members elect their own spokesperson, organise their own work as they choose, manage their own logistics, swap jobs when they like, mend their own tools and equipment, fix holiday rotas and resolve problems as they go along. A quality card, marked with each worker's individual stamp and signed off with a group stamp, travels through all stages with the car. At the end of processing, the vehicle will typically roll directly into a loading bay or storage park. Each day only one or two will be given an overall quality check. Just as Rastatt has no conventional assembly line, it also has no bottleneck bay at the end of the line - typical of most German plants where cars are checked over and defects corrected. Quality, Mr Niefer said, is built in. So, too, is economy. While 10 per cent of the 45,000 Sindelfingen workforce is occupied solely with quality control and end-of-line repairs, at Rastatt the line worker and quality controller are one and the same person.</p>

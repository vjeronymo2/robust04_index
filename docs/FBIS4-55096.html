			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 5 (CTK) -- There will not be any new  law on national security, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told  journalists today. He was speaking after today's meeting of  cabinet ministers rejected a draft bill on national security  presented by Defense Minister Antonin Baudys. The draft was  drawn up in the radical post-revolutionary spirit and it aimed  to completely overhaul the existing legislation, Klaus said.    The ministers retained the existing law except for a few  minor changes in the wording, concerning the threat to people's  security and the extension of the powers of authorities. They  agreed that no new bodies should be set up in the security  sector. The bill concerned the deployment of the army for  life-saving operations necessitated by natural disasters or  nuclear power plant emergencies.    Rules governing the deployment of emergency services  including the army and fire and security services in the event  of large-scale disasters, and rules governing the duties of  individuals in case of national emergencies are at present  scattered among several laws. The draft bill aimed to bring the  matter under a single heading.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These final regulations adopt the provisions of the proposed regulations with only minor modifications, as described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Changes Made by OBRA '93  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a. Lower Limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to its amendment by OBRA '93, the annual compensation limit was $200,000 adjusted for cost of living increases ($235,840 for 1993). Section 401(a)(17) was amended by OBRA '93 to reduce the annual compensation limit to $150,000 and to modify the manner in which cost of living adjustments are made to the limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Annual Adjustment of Compensation Limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the effective date of the OBRA '93 changes, the annual compensation limit was increased annually based on the section 415 cost of living adjustment. After the effective date of OBRA '93, the annual compensation limit, as adjusted for changes in the cost of living, is rounded down to the next lowest multiple of $10,000. Thus, the annual compensation limit increases only when the cost of living adjustment would increase the limit by an increment of at least $10,000. These final regulations retain the rules in the September 1991 regulations that any increase in the limit is effective for the plan year, or other 12-month period used to determine compensation, commencing in the calendar year for which the limit is adjusted and that the increase applies only to compensation for the year of the increase and subsequent years that are used in determining an employee's benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> c. Proration of the Limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These regulations retain the requirement in the September 1991 regulations that the annual compensation limit must be prorated if compensation for a period of less than 12 months is used for a plan year. However, in response to comments on the proposed regulations, the final regulations clarify that no proration is required merely because the amount of elective contributions, matching contributions, or employee contributions that is contributed for each pay period during a plan year is determined separately using compensation for that pay period. For example, a section 401(k) plan provides each employee with the right to elect to defer up to 6 percent of compensation for a plan year, and then, in accordance with each employee's election for the plan year, contributions are made monthly using the employee's compensation for that pay period. Although the compensation for the plan year that may be taken into account in determining each employee's elective contributions is subject to the annual compensation limit, the compensation for each month would not required to be limited to $12,500 (1/12 of $150,000) in this situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Effective Date and Transition Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 401(a)(17) is generally effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989. The changes made by OBRA '93 are generally effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1994. Special statutory effective dates are provided for collectively bargained plans. In addition, OBRA '93 provides a special grandfather rule for certain eligible participants in governmental plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations under section 401(a)(17) are generally effective at the same time that the reduced limit under OBRA '93 applies to the plan. However, in the case of plans maintained by tax-exempt organizations, the regulations are effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minor modifications have been made to the examples in these regulations to reflect the OBRA '93 statutory change, the change in the effective date of the regulations from the date in the 1991 regulations, and an employer's choice of complying with the provisions of these regulations prior to the effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a. Fresh-Start Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations retain the rule from the September 1991 regulations that benefits accrued or allocations made under a plan for plan years prior to the effective date of section 401(a)(17) are not subject to the annual compensation limit. The regulations also retain the rule in the proposed regulations that the benefits accrued or allocations made under a plan for plan years prior to the effective date of the OBRA '93 changes are not subject to the reduced annual compensation limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(17), a defined benefit plan must ``fresh start'' the benefits of all employees with accrued benefits that are based on compensation that exceeded the annual compensation limit. In order to implement the reduced limit under OBRA '93, a defined benefit plan must again ``fresh start'' the benefits of all employees with accrued benefits that are based on compensation that exceeded the OBRA '93 $150,000 compensation limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in the proposed regulations, these final regulations provide guidance on the implementation of these and other multiple fresh starts and coordinate the regulations with the fresh-start rules of the section 401(a)(4) regulations. For example, the regulations continue to cross-reference the section 401(a)(4) regulations for the definition of an employee's frozen accrued benefit. Thus, an employee's frozen accrued benefit as of the OBRA '93 effective date includes benefits accrued as a result of an amendment made within the TRA '86 remedial amendment period that is recognized under section 401(b) as effective before the OBRA '93 effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Amendments to Comply With Section 401(a)(17)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conjunction with publishing these regulations under section 401(a)(17), the IRS issued Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;13, 1994&hyph;3 I.R.B. 18, dated January 18, 1994. Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;13 provides guidance on the remedial amendment treatment for plans being amended for section 401(a)(17), including guidance on the conditions under which a plan may be amended to comply retroactively with section 401(a)(17) even if the amendment results in a reduction of a benefit protected under section 411(d)(6). Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;13 also provides guidance on the extent to which section 204(h) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) will not apply to a plan amendment that limits an employee's compensation taken into account under the plan to the maximum permitted under section 401(a)(17) of the Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Arts: Concepts which make their mark - The work of Ian Hamilton Finlay Ian Hamilton Finlay is a reclusive and controversial figure, as combative a polemicist as he is rigorous in his address to the personal aesthetic of his work. Pity the poor ratings officer who treads too light a path to his door, or the unwary critic whose too easy reading of the work, and more casual utterance, soon betray him. Finlay is a conceptual artist, which is to say that the work is always the vehicle to the particular idea, to which it gives physical embodiment and presence. Its expression invariably combines image or object with a text or inscription of some kind. That this last should be so often gnomic or inscrutable serves simply to give this intellectual content, or aura of intellectuality, an added force. Mere ambiguity, by contrast, comes as blessed clarity and relief. Now in his late 60s, he has lived at Stonypath, his 'Little Sparta' in Strathclyde, since 1966. There he has made the garden itself both his studio and gallery, the only true context and setting for his work. He never leaves. The world must come to him on his terms, which is a fine trick if you can bring it off and sustain it by the qualities of what you do. What Finlay does is to conceive of the informing idea and then to commission the actual expressive object - the carved stone, the plaque with its lettering, the bronze, the print, the symbolic item - from the latest craftsmen in whom he has come to place absolute confidence. Exhibitions of the work that comes from so detached a process are not over-frequent. Finlay is an anxious perfectionist and his inevitable absence from the seat of practical debate, as the show comes together, hardly helps. Misunderstandings and quarrels with curators, administrators and dealers are common enough, last-minute cancellations not unknown. To the embattled artist such creatures are the enemy. But the shows do go on, or up, and it happens that two such are now in London. Instruments of Revolution &amp; Other Works occupies the Institution of Contemporary Arts (The Mall SW1, until April 5, then on to Leeds and to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park at Wakefield), and Victoria Miro (21 Cork Street W1, until April 3) is showing 10 Maquettes for Neo-Classical Structures. While in no sense retrospective, together they give us enough of the true flavour of the man and his work at their most serious, fascinating and successful - and precious, and tiresome. Finlay is as much a romantic as he is a classicist, a poet as likely to be seduced by the poetic dream as puritan in thrall to his severe ideal of perfectibility. Apollo pursues his Daphne whom he must lose, his dream turning to wood before his eyes, just as Saint-Just and Robespierre must lose their Republic, though they themselves would be the ones to be destroyed. 'And even as she fled/ the Republic charmed him . . . He on the wings of Love/ She on those of Fear.' Finlay is alive to every irony. His imagery is that of revolutionary sentiment; transformation and contradiction; and the general follies of mankind, making frequent use of puns and obscure erudition. The French Revolution in particular stands as an abiding theme in his work, as much for the loftiness of the hopes and aspirations that inspired it as for its abject and bitter failures and cruelties. It is for him a true image of all human enterprise. At the ICA a set of inscriptions on slate walls marks the decade of the Argentine strike at San Carlos Water. 'Transformations of Fire/ First San Carlos Water/ But half the Water is Earth/ Half Lightning Storm.' 'Fure coming on/ Will discern/ And catch up/ With all things.' 'Exocet steers all.' These are declared Heraclitan sentiments: Heraclitus, the philosopher who held that the world was created from fire. Of a naturally melancholy disposition, so Lempriere tells us, he passed his time in a solitary, unsocial manner. He was called the mourner, 'from his unconquerable custom of weeping at the follies, frailty, and vicissitudes of human affairs.' Rendered rambling and unintelligible to his doctors by a dropsical complaint brought on by a voluntary diet of grass, he retired to a dunghill in vain hopes that the natural warmth would effect a cure. His sad story is a lesson to us all. Finlay's Instruments of Revolution are implements variously set and inscribed: a hoe - osez; a spade - Ventose; a sickle; a wheelbarrow; a light machine-gun; three watering cans - 'Robespierre, Saint-Just, Couthon'; a beribboned axe in a block - 'la Revolution est un bloc'; the blade of the guillotine. Upstairs the room is full of tiny hinged wooden pieces, each to its own plinth and very simple, that stand open to reveal text, or sun-dial image, on their plane faces: 'Water's Edge/ Water Sedge', 'Sheepcote/ Dovecote/ Whichcote', 'pebbled brook/ freckled freshet/ strong stream': poetical, fey, irritating by turns. But, as with the ten maquettes at Victoria Miro, what justifies the work is not the force of sentiment or idea as such that it supports, but rather the sense of its object-hood, its physical being. That this should be so is, in the circumstances, remarkable - a true feat of imaginative appropriation on the artist's part. There is never a doubt that these strangely eloquent things are Finlay's very own. In this respect these new maquettes - obelisks, columns, pyramids and arches with their elegiac lapidary inscriptions - are as successful as anything he has done. 'Edifice - the seat or summit of reason': 'all greatness stands firm in the storm'.</p>

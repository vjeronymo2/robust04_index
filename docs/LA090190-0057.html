Figueroa  St.  </P> <P> Austere yet beautiful, detached yet compassionate, Taiwanese filmmaker Hou  Hsiao-hsien's superb 1987 "Dust in the Wind" tells a classically simple story  of two rural young people who are in love and seek a better life in Taipei. Not  surprisingly, the struggle for survival is harder than they anticipated. In  fact, nothing is really surprising in the entire film, yet thanks to its  director's masterly talents, it is deeply compelling. Throughout, Hou's  discretion is palpable, manifested in his middle-distance, deep-focus shots;  it's as if he did not wish to intrude upon his vulnerable couple. At the same  time Hou's vision is unwavering, and we come away with both a sense of  timelessness and a sense of immediacy -- of how the un- and semi-skilled are  losing in an increasingly technological society. Wang Chien-wen is the young  man, Hsin Shu-feng is the young woman, and they are perfect. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Hugo Boss holds payout as profits fall sharply HUGO BOSS, the German men's fashion group controlled from Japan, yesterday reported a steep decline in profits for 1990 but said it would maintain the dividend. On sales slightly higher at DM922m (Dollars 534m) against DM884m, the company suffered a fall in net profits to DM28m last year from DM35.9m in 1989. Operating profits were DM67.7m, against DM90.9m. Earnings per share fell from DM62 to DM51. The company is holding its dividend at DM20 per share and DM21.50 per preference share. Hugo Boss said its earnings potential remained strong this year, but it was too early in the year to make a profit forecast because of the uncertain outlook for the German economy and the dollar. Mr Gunther Strothe, management board member for finance, said Hugo Boss's profit had fallen, largely due to DM30m in extraordinary depreciation on US activities. 'Disregarding the effect from the extraordinary depreciation on the parent company, its operating profit would have been DM88.9m - just under 14 per cent of sales - or DM7.8m more than the previous year,' Mr Strothe said. In the first four months of this year, parent company sales had risen by more than 10 per cent, he said, adding the company did not expect to take any extraordinary depreciations this year. Majority control of Hugo Boss was sold in December 1989 to Leyton House, a privately-owned Japanese group specialising in sports and leisure wear. Leyton is controlled by Mr Akira Akagi. Hugo Boss floated 20 per cent of its equity capital on the German market in March 1989. The shares were sold by the company's two founding brothers, Uwe and Holy Boss.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Chinese premier accuses Patten of breaking pact MR Li Peng, the Chinese premier, yesterday accused Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, and the British government of 'perfidiously' dishonouring agreements on the colony's transition to Chinese rule in 1997. Mr Li, addressing the opening session of China's parliament, departed from his prepared text and made one of the sternest attacks yet by a Chinese leader since relations deteriorated last year after Mr Patten disclosed plans to extend Hong Kong's democratic reforms. The speech followed the publication on Friday of Mr Patten's legislation to enact such reforms. Beijing's reaction hampers any early resumption of talks on the colony's future, and adds to pressures on Mr Patten from an increasingly nervous local business community. The Chinese premier's address sent Hong Kong share prices sharply lower. The Hang Seng index fell 315.79, or 5.1 per cent, to close at 5,854.61, leaving it a full 10 per cent below its peak, reached a week ago. Senior business leaders called for calm. Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, the owner of Hongkong Bank and of Midland Bank of the UK, said he remained optimistic about Hong Kong's future in spite of the political problems between the colony and China. He warned, however, that domestic business confidence could be affected and that foreign investors might be 'frightened off' if the row dragged on. 'I very much hope that they (Britain and China) can sit down and devise a way forward for the 1995 elections,' he said. Britain stressed that it remained willing to hold 'unconditional' talks with Beijing on its plans for political reform in Hong Kong. But in an otherwise conciliatory statement in the House of Commons, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, insisted that London would not accept the downgrading of Hong Kong's role in any negotiations. Speaking with the overwhelming support of MPs from all the main parties, Mr Hurd stressed there was still time for talks with Beijing to modify Mr Patten's plans. But the foreign secretary flatly rejected a charge by Mr Li that Mr Patten's proposals were in contravention of the Basic Law governing Hong Kong's future. Referring to Beijing's demand that the status of Hong Kong officials in any talks be downgraded, he said: 'The implication of that was not one we could accept'. Mr Li told some 3,000 delegates at the National People's Congress that Mr Patten's democratic reform proposals ran completely counter to Britain's 'commitment' to bring Hong Kong's system into line with the Chinese-controlled 'Special Administrative Region' after 1997. 'The British government,' he added, 'shall be held exclusively responsible for all serious consequences arising from its latest action.' Mr Li described as a 'sacred right' China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 which 'shall not be interfered with and sabotaged in any way.' But he also observed: 'We hope for co-operation, not confrontation.' Hong Kong politicians, stockbrokers and political analysts, noted that he had not ruled out talks. Mrs Selina Chow, a senior member of Hong Kong's conservative political grouping known as the Co-operative Resources Centre, said: 'It seems that there is room for further discussion.' But it emerged yesterday that a planned meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group for this month was unlikely to proceed. A Foreign Office official said the two sides had not discussed an agenda for the meeting.

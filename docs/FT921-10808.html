			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Leading Article: L'etat en crise SOMETHING IS rotten in the state of France. As so often, the latest symptom has a farcical quality to it. In a country which prides itself on le sens de l'etat, four top civil servants were made to resign last week for taking a decision whose political character could not possibly have escaped their notice: the admission to the country of a senior Palestinian leader, well known for his hostility to the current Middle East peace process and, in the past, for his association with spectacular hijackings. Supposedly at death's door, the gentleman was seen to walk into the hospital, and his wife claims he was there for nothing more than a thorough check-up. If there is any country in the world where a civil servant could safely be expected to refer such a decision to his political masters, it is France. Not surprisingly, public opinion is reluctant to accept that responsibility goes no higher, and suspects that the luckless officials have been made scapegoats for some piece of bungled skulduggery ordered by those very political masters. But the explanation given by Mr Hubert Vedrine, President Francois Mitterrand's chief of staff, is perhaps more damaging to his master's reputation than any conspiracy theory. Implicit endorsement The officials, he suggests, may have been endormis (put off their guard) by the fact that the request reached them through Mrs Georgina Dufoix, a former minister. She was acting in her capacity as head of the French Red Cross, but was also a presidential adviser. (She has now resigned both jobs). So the request appeared to come from the Elysee palace, with an implicit presidential endorsement. That would be sufficient to convince civil servants, Mr Vedrine implied. They would feel no need to check with their immediate bosses, who are ministers in a government responsible to parliament, according to the constitution. If that explanation is correct it illustrates all too well what is wrong with the French political system. Power is concentrated in one man's hands. That man is famous for keeping his cards close to his chest. He makes policy by a series of delphic utterances, which ministers and civil servants alike try desperately to decode, and secures implementation of his wishes through semi-official personal representatives. The legal government, headed by the lamentable figure of Mrs Edith Cresson, is there only to act as a screen between him and public opinion. 'Of course she's unpopular. She was appointed to be unpopular,' Mr Mitterrand blandly told a group of journalists last week, shortly before the 'Habash affair' hit the headlines. Real problems It would be funny if it were not so serious. France is a country struggling to come to terms with some very real problems. It has to reconcile a strong tradition of national independence with an assumed position of leadership in the march to a federal Europe, based on alliance with a Germany economically more powerful and politically no longer submissive. It has to adapt dirigiste and nationalist economic traditions (represented by Mrs Cresson) to the exigencies of an interdependent world (voiced by the finance minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy). It has to absorb a large immigrant population, and overcome the racist backlash represented by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front, in an economy whose record of job-creation in the last 15 years has been very poor. Until two or three years ago, Mr Mitterrand could plausibly claim that he was managing these problems with greater strategic vision and tactical sense than any of his political rivals would be likely to bring to them. Now he is floundering miserably. On one point at least he is right: two seven-year terms in such an office is too long. He should make it clear quickly what alternative he intends to propose to the electorate in a referendum later this year, and promise unambiguously to apply the reduction to his own current mandate. Meanwhile, he should appoint a prime minister capable of running the government, and allow him (or her) to do so as the constitution prescribes.</p>

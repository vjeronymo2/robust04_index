			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Liffe plans futures only for Mid 250 The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) plans initially to launch only futures contracts on the FT-SE Mid 250 index, postponing the introduction of options, according to members of the exchange who have attended recent meetings at Liffe to discuss the matter. They also said that Liffe is being rushed into an announcement by the decision of OMLX, the London-based equity derivatives exchange, to launch conventional and flexible futures and options on the index on February 4. Last November, the London Stock Exchange surprised the market by awarding both Liffe and OMLX a licence to trade derivatives on the index of medium-sized UK companies. Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive confirmed yesterday: 'We are considering just doing futures. We believe the real interest in this contract is in the futures.' Liffe members are expecting an announcement shortly that a futures contract will be introduced on to the Liffe trading floor in the next month or so. 'If OMLX had not appeared on the scene, Liffe would still be waiting, but their hand has been forced,' said one member. Some Liffe members have expressed frustration at Liffe's delay in announcing its plans for the contract, given the growing activity in the underlying stock market and the speedy reaction of OMLX. However, others said they supported Liffe's view that the ground for the new contract needed careful preparation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Paid Trumpeters Dancing to the Tune of Warmaniacs" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- THE NEW YORK TIMES in  an editorial kicked up a war hysteria, crying for a prompt  bombing raid on the nuclear sites of North Korea by the United  States, according to Voice of America April 4.    USA TODAY also clamoured about "the inevitability of a war  on  the Korean peninsula."    The U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry has let loose a  string of bellicose outbursts, fully revealing his true color as  a warmaniac. In an interview with the U.S. NBC Television on  April 3, he again brought forward the fiction of "nuclear arms  development by North Korea" and declared that the United States  was ready for a war adventure to check it.    Responding to the bellicose utterances of a U.S. brasshat,  paid trumpeters of the United States are coming out with  nonsensical arguments against the DPRK.    The very one bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war over  the Korean peninsula is the United States which is threatening  the DPRK with nuclear weapons.    In vociferating about the fictitious "nuclear weapons  development" by North Korea, the U.S. warlikers seek to find a  pretext to stifle the socialist system of the DPRK.    Ignoring this stark fact, paid trumpeters of the U.S. are  dancing to the drum-beating of the warmaniacs. This shows that  they are despicable hackwriters who have thrown away justice and  conscience, impartiality and truth of the press like a pair of  wornout shoes for a few dollars.    The trumpeters bribed by the U.S. bellicose elements would  be  well advised to act with discretion, drawing a proper lesson  from the doom of such warmaniacs as Hitler and Tojo who perished  in the flame of the war of aggression kindled by them to  subjugate other countries and nations and from the doom of the  hackwriters who played into their hands.</p>

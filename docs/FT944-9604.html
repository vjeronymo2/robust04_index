			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bureaucracy in Brussels Sir, Having read the article by Emma Tucker about her experiences with Brussels bureaucracy (Perspectives: 'Welcome to Soviet Belgium', November 12/13), I can only feel sorry for her. However, being a Dutchman, who has lived in Germany, France, Belgium and the UK, I regret that my experiences with the authorities in the UK were by far the worst. This starts when you enter the UK and your car is thoroughly searched for an hour (although I have short hair), and it continues when you want to have a residence permit. Maybe having an Indonesian wife does not help, but I have never felt as humiliated as when I waited in a queue outside the Home Office in Croydon at 6am - after a 2 1/2 hour drive - only to be told several hours later that I should have gone to my local police station, which had just sent me to Croydon the day before. So, not much different from Brussels, I fear. Paul Cohn, Singel 19, Blaricum, The Netherlands</p>

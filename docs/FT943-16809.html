			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Tory leaders stress unity on EU Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday sought to cement the Conservatives' fragile consensus on Europe by claiming widespread European backing for a multi-speed union. In a speech to coincide with the start of Germany's six-month presidency of the EU he firmly ruled out further transfers of sovereignty to Brussels at the next intergovernmental conference in 1996. But Mr Hurd also went out of his way to placate pro-European Tories, uneasy about Mr John Major's decision to veto the candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene at last week's Corfu summit on the presidency of the commission. He said arguments about the principle of Britain's EU membership were 'yesterday's debate' and insisted that the veto would lead to 'healthier' decision-making. Mr Hurd's comments were echoed by other cabinet ministers in a concerted government effort to build on the common ground established around the multi-speed concept. Mr William Waldegrave, the open-government minister and a pro-European, said the Conservatives were uniting around the vision of 'a Europe of the nations, not a Europe to supersede the nations'. Baroness Thatcher, the former Conservative prime minister, broke a six-month silence on the European issue, describing Mr Major's handling of the Corfu summit as 'top class'. Mr Hurd, addressing the Harborough Conservative Association, rejected Labour claims that the use of the veto had relegated Britain to the sidelines of Europe. He said the government's success in reshaping the European agenda was evident in Germany's programme for its presidency, which focuses on deregulation, subsidiarity and enlargement. He said there was no case for further automatic and inflexible pooling of sovereignty in Brussels. In a clear rebuff to Continental federalists he warned that 'rigid' EU structures might face disaster. He said: 'We must respect the achievements of those who dreamt of a 'United States of Europe', while being clear that it is the wrong model for the new Europe. 'When the prime minister and I have talked about a multi-track, multi-speed, multi-layered Europe, we have clearly struck a chord, and not just in Britain.' He added: 'All around Europe, people are rejecting the idea that there is some detailed blueprint for the future of the union. They do not want to receive decrees from Brussels. They do not want their sense of nationhood to be affronted.'</p>

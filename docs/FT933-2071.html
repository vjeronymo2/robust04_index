			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Arts: New quartet, old orchestra - Weekend music in London The Skampa Quartet - Czech, prizewinners at two European competitions - was not entirely new to the Wigmore Hall on Saturday evening: it had preceded this full-length evening recital with, last February, a Sunday-morning 'Coffee Concert' which evidently left a powerful impression - powerful enough for word of mouth to get about and the house to be packed on Saturday. The euphonious musicality and unforced grace of style of the Skampa - every phrase given the illusion of displaying its own innate weight and direction, every rhythmic pattern naturally tapped - are characteristics that might be deemed traditionally Czech. But, as shown in this programme of Haydn, Smetana and Dvorak, the personality that emerges from the ensemble - distinctive, vital, questingly energetic - is anything but familiar. This arresting combination of tradition and innovation may perhaps be ascribed to the coaching the group has received from Milan Skampa, violist of the (alas]) now-defunct Smetana Quartet and a leading chamber-music guru. The use of his surname pays a compliment which is handsomely returned, for the performances had a shining freshness miles removed from the hard-drilled or the masterclass-copied. From Skampa these players have certainly absorbed the missionary commitment which overflowed from their account of Smetana's Second Quartet (as it used to from the Smetana Quartet's celebrated own). In the past this less-often-played of Smetana's two string quartets, a 'late work' of sometimes overpowering intensity and telegraphic economy of statement, has too often been dismissed as the incoherent product of Smetana's overwrought mental condition (by 1882 his syphilis was already far advanced). In this reading its pungently dramatic, passionately emotional qualities were both balanced and heightened by a grasp of its astonishing concentration of form and lyrical statement, all of which added up to an overwhelming experience. The Dvorak 'American' quartet, after the interval, was perhaps one easier to digest but no less exhilarating; only the opening Haydn (the 'Fifths', Op. 76 no. 2) had been lightly flecked with nervous imprecision on the part of the quartet's brilliantly communicative leader, Pavel Fischer. The quality of the players' instruments is plainly not of the highest (step forward, some chamber-music-loving Maecenas]). Everything else about the group arouses huge excitement for the future.                         *      *      * The trial has begun in earnest. By the end of this year one of London's orchestras will know that it has been sentenced to death by starvation of funds. Until then the Philharmonia, the London Philharmonic and the Royal Philharmonic will be under close scrutiny. Given the importance of concerts in London, it was unwise of the Philharmonia to open its programme at the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday with the Prelude to Act 1 of Wagner's Lohengrin. The orchestra's strings are a long way from being able to deliver the exposed first few minutes with any kind of style. There were as many ideas on tuning and ensemble as there were players, thankfully soon rescued by their colleagues. That despatched, the rest of the evening proceeded more confidently. The soloist was Margaret Price, fresh from an impressive performance as saviour of the Geraint Evans tribute in Cardiff. There she had sung Verdi's Desdemona with wondrously pure, poised tone. Wagner's Wesendonk Lieder lie lower and call for a different kind of singer. Quite rightly not wanting to employ the Margaret Price Mozart voice, she sang with bigger, richer tone - a plausibly Wagnerian sound, except that it loses focus when she calls upon it for more volume. The best songs were the third and fifth, where the scoring is lighter. Unlike other singers, concerned with keeping up a golden flow of voice in these songs, she sings words, urgently and intensely. At times the music nearly wandered into the world of expressionism. Giuseppe Sinopoli is a reasonably considerate accompanist and she was not often drowned. In Bruckner he could afford to let the brass rip - and he did. In the passages of the Fourth Symphony where they sing Bruckner's noble melodies the strings were more certain of their ensemble, though Sinopoli drove them so hard that they often sounded under stress. For the rest, the brass dominated, obliterating everybody else rather than trying to blend. All of this is central to Sinopoli's views on Bruckner, typified by the blazing assertiveness of every climax. The comparison here has to be with the Leipzig Gewandhaus and Kurt Masur, who gave a Bruckner Fourth at the Proms which was on another level, grand, unforced, eloquent. I do not wish to suggest that anybody over here should try to follow the Leipzig model but the Germans do know how to play Bruckner. It is unlikely that any London super-orchestra would match them.

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Thatcher joins Tory assault: Former prime minister launches scathing attack on Labour's policies MRS MARGARET Thatcher joined Mr John Major in a scathing assault yesterday on Labour's 'socialist' prospectus for the 1990s as the Conservatives relaunched a faltering general election campaign. The much sharper edge to the attack - focused directly on Mr John Smith's shadow budget - came as a clutch of weekend surveys confirmed that Labour had held on to a small lead in the opinion polls. Mr Major, with Mrs Thatcher alongside him at a London rally, launched what colleagues promised would be an unrelenting onslaught on the opposition's tax policies and on Mr Neil Kinnock's leadership. Warning that an inconclusive election result leading to a 'hung' parliament would 'hang the future of our country', Mrs Thatcher said: 'Everything that we have gained could so easily be lost unless we are returned for a fourth term.' Their joint appearance, however, was dismissed by the Labour as a 'panic' admission that it had seized the initiative. Mr Kinnock reaffirmed an earlier prediction that his party would secure an overall majority of 20 seats on April 9. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the Conservatives' tactics showed clearly that they were 'rattled'. Mr Major's speech, which followed a scathing denunciation by his predecessor of Mr Kinnock's 'socialism', signalled the start of a determined and abrasive campaign to win back the support of the skilled working classes. Amid Conservative recognition that many of these so-called 'C2s' had been reassured about Labour's intentions by Mr Smith's shadow Budget, Mr Major widened the attack on the opposition's tax plans. Drawing on his party's calculation that Labour would have to increase public spending by Pounds 38bn a year if it were to meet the commitments in its election manifesto, the prime minister said every taxpayer would face an increase of Pounds 1,250 a year in his or her tax bill. Employing phrases which echoed the unabashed rhetoric of Mrs Thatcher, he said Labour offered a 'hands-in-your pockets Britain where you can only go so far before a Labour chancellor is at your throat'. The Pounds 1,250 figure, dismissed by Mr Kinnock as 'sheer fantasy', will be at the centre of the Conservative approach for the remaining weeks of the campaign. One senior official commented bluntly: 'We have to destroy John Smith's Budget.' Party strategists dismissed suggestions that a new series of polls showing an average two-point Labour lead had forced them to rethink their approach. They insisted that they had always judged it would take some time for their message over taxation to 'sink in' with the electorate. But they accepted that the election outcome now hinged on whether they were effective in getting that message across during the remainder of the campaign. Candidates attending yesterday's rally said a number of local party associations had conveyed to Conservative central office their disquiet about Labour's more effective campaigning. Others suggested that the party's central organisation had underestimated the level of resentment caused by the recession. Mr Major's aides confirmed that from now until polling day he would maintain a barrage of attacks on Labour policies. Conservative strategists added that Mr Michael Heseltine, judged to be one of the party's most effective campaigners, is to be given a central role in the assault on the opposition's tax plans. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was judged to have failed to match Mr Smith's political 'punches' during the first week of the campaign and would move into the background.

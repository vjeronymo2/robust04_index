			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock scorns PM's support for business - Prime Minister's Questions MR Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, accused Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons yesterday of ignoring 'the voice of business'. Mr Kinnock claimed that the prime minister had been reduced to 'paralysis' in face of the recession created by his policies. His comment came during rowdy exchanges stimulated by election fever. Mr Bernard Weatherill, the speaker, called on MPs to 'moderate their language'. In a rebuke to Conservative and Labour MPs who have been subjecting the rival party leaders to disorderly catcalls and barracking, he said: 'I hope in this period of electioneering excitement we can keep off the personalities and concentrate upon policies.' Mr Weatherill warned Tory backbenchers not to repeat earlier breaches of the rules of the House by questioning the prime minister - frequently at the prompting of government whips - about Labour party policy for which he had no responsibility. The Labour leader cited the findings of a survey by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce indicating worsening employment expectations, higher job losses and declining business confidence. He charged the prime minister with complacency and indolence in failing to take action to remedy the situation. Mr Major urged Mr Kinnock to take account of the view of the president of the chambers of commerce that industry and commerce was on 'an improving trend of slowly and steadily climbing out of recession'. The prime minister highlighted a European Community report identifying the UK as the only EC country where signs of sustained economic recovery were discernible. To government cheers, Mr Major claimed that investment by Japanese and German companies indicated their confidence in the British economy. He said: 'It is a shame that some of the doom and gloom-mongers in this country do not share the same confidence.' The prime minister also highlighted a survey of the 100 top companies showing that 63 per cent believed that the recession would get worse under a Labour government, while not one thought it would get better. There was 'no enthusiasm whatsoever' among business men for a Labour government, he said.</p>

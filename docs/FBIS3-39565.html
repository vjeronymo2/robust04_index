One hundred and  twenty-five million consumers with the world's highest average  purchasing power make Japan Europe's second largest potential  market. To make the most of this, European companies need extra  help to deal with the special demands of the Japanese market  ranging from information and consultancy services in Europe  through to introducing companies to the Japanese market. The  Commission's export promotion initiatives are not only the  natural counterpart to its market-opening efforts with the  Japanese, they directly meet the needs of companies exporting  and wishing to export to Japan.    "Gateway to Japan" is the second integrated campaign which  will be made up of a series of initiatives to foster lasting  success in the Japanese market by European enterprises in  sectors which are internationally competitive, but  underperforming in Japan. The Commission's aims are both to  answer the problem of the Community's trade deficit with Japan  by helping to increase exports to Japan and to encourage  European enterprises to confront their Japanese competitors in  the Japanese market, enabling them to maintain their competitive  edge in other markets worldwide.    The approach adopted by the Commission for the `gateway'  campaign is based on the experiences of the first export  promotion campaign. The campaign will provide services in  response to the needs of companies following the logical chain  of activities which companies face when developing trade with  Japan.  <H5>  Workshops </H5>   At the first stage, `gateway' offers information for  European  enterprises here in Europe on their company's needs and will  attempt to help coordinate their approach. Throughout Europe,  the Commission will be holding strategy workshops for European  companies interested in Japan. These will provide both general  information on the obstacles and opportunities of the Japanese  market and also market information on those sectors selected by  the Commission for participation in the campaign.  <H5>  Trade Missions and Trade Fairs </H5>   The bulk of "Gateway to Japan" campaign activities will take  place in Japan. on the basis of a qualitative assessment of  export promotion methods and in the light of the experience of  the first campaign, the Commission has identified trade missions  and trade fairs as the most effective way of engineering  long-term profitable relationships between European companies  and Japanese buyers. The campaign will organize European groups  at Japanese trade fairs, providing European pavilions,  orchestrating European days and facilitating contacts with  suitable, potential clients. Trade missions will take place  before, during or after trade fairs in order to offer companies  the opportunity to study the market and to develop contacts  directly with Japanese counterparts. For both fairs and  missions, participating companies may then receive financial and  logistical support from the Commission in complementarity with  support provided by the member states.    Follow-up Services    A Long-term commitment to developing a presence in the  market  is essential in order to profit to the full from the  opportunities in Japan.    Bearing this in mind, the Commission will offer follow-up  services for companies who have participated in the fairs and  missions in Japan. In line with the view that the campaign  should be responsive to the needs of the market, the exact  nature of the follow-up activities will depend on the  requirements of companies after their participation in fairs and  missions.  <H5>  Funding </H5>   The scope of export promotion activities is limited by  budget. The European Parliament agreed an increase in the exprom  budget of ECU1.5 million to ECU8 million for the financial year  1994. This allows ECU7.1 million for "Gateway to Japan" for the  three years of the campaign.  <H5>  The Sectors </H5>   In the first phase, 1994-5, the campaign will support  companies from the medical equipment, mechanical handling,  machine tools and furniture sectors. For the second phase,  1995-6, the five sectors for selection are still to be decided.  Those under consideration include marine equipment,  construction materials, construction equipment, waste management  technologies and packaging machinery.    These sectors have been selected on the basis of three sets  of criteria - competitivity, promotability and complementarity.  Competitivity demands that the sector should be made up of  European companies which are competitive in price and product  worldwide, but which are still underperforming in the Japanese  market. Based on the experience of the first campaign, `gateway'  will promote seven capital goods sectors and two consumer goods  sectors. The scope for success also depends on the extent to  which these sectors will answer a real need in Japan.  Naturally, therefore, selection has been and will be responsive  to the changing demands of the Japanese market. Competitivity  cannot be the sole criterion. The experience of the first  campaign has shown that another significant element is the  extent to which a sector can be promoted within the framework of  our program. This principle of promotability requires that  participating sectors should be represented by a strong European  trade federation and have access to a viable trade fair in  Japan. The campaign is also run in a spirit of complementarity  with the member states.    "Gateway to Japan" aims primarily at medium-sized  enterprises. It intends to help both those companies which wish  to start exporting to Japan and those which are planning to  develop their existing trade.    The campaign is directed by the European Commission's unit  for relations with Japan. The campaign will be implemented by  the non profit-making organization Eurochambres -- the  association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry.  Their job will be general coordination, publicity, distribution  of information and the sectoral initiatives of the campaign. In  all this they will work in a consortium partnership with Roland  Berger GmbH, the management consultants with offices in Tokyo.  The consortium partnership of Eurochambres and Roland Berger  was selected on the basis of a call for tender in the EC  Official Journal. The campaign will be run in cooperation with  both industry and the member states. National chambers of  commerce, the European Business Council in Tokyo and European  trade associations will provide information networks and will  help coordinate our activities with individual companies. The  campaign haS been developed in consultation with the member  states in the Exprom [EC export promotion program] experts group  meetings, meetings with the commercial counselors in Tokyo and  through overseas national trade bodies.    In launching the campaign the Commission appreciates the  cooperation and contribution of its Japanese counterparts.  "Gateway to Japan" will be coordinating its activities with the  import promotion programs of MITI [Japanese Ministry of  International Trade and Industry] and JETRO [Japan External  Trade Organization]. The Commission welcomes this active  cooperation and sees it as further evidence of the development  of Europe's partnership with Japan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by James Aparicio] </F>   [Text] Retired General Ruben Dario Paredes has confirmed to  LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that he has met with presidential  candidate Ruben Carles, at the request of Dr. Arrigo Guardia  [National Integration Movement national coordinator], to discuss  issues related to security, the future of the police corps, the  penitentiary system, and intelligence organizations. He has  also expressed regret over the "electoral mediocrity" of the  former comptroller general and his main advisers.    In a letter sent to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, Paredes has  admitted he met with Carles and Guardia on 15 January for what  he called "a working meeting."    In a telephone conversation, Paredes has denied he is  involved in a plot against the opposition Democratic  Revolutionary Party (PRD), "because nobody catches me making a  slander campaign against anybody." Paredes added: "I would not  lose my time doing this."    In a letter sent to the Justice and Peace Commission last  week, Mitchel Doens, PRD first assistant secretary, charged  Carles' team was preparing a slander campaign by reporting the  opposition PRD candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares had a pact  with former military personnel to reinstate the Defense Forces.  Perez Balladares announced there will be no Army in Panama, and  Carles denied the alleged slander campaign against the PRD.    Paredes has expressed regret, however, that Carles had  denied  the alleged "working meeting" as if "one stinks." He added:  "When the news broke out and caused its effects, Professor  Carles and two of his closest advisers were struck with  political panic and instead of rising up to the situation and  admitting we did discuss public security issues, which are a  real problem, they descended down to the levels of electoral  mediocrity."    Why were Carles and his advisers so afraid of our meeting  being made known, and what compelled them to take such an  irregular attitude? Paredes asked himself. He has expressed  regret that "a candidate with Professor Carles' potential of  success has made such a mistake, which will surely be punished  at the ballot tables."    According to Paredes, "this mistake (Carles') will  contribute  in defining the candidates' positions and will benefit the  country and voters, because it reduces the possibility of making  a wrong choice."</p>

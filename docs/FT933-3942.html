			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: European prices volatile after Bundesbank easing EUROPEAN bonds were volatile after the Bundesbank's latest round of easing, which triggered rate cuts in France, the Netherlands, Austria, Italy and Belgium. After an initial jump on the news, most bond markets weakened during the afternoon. 'There was a feeling this was the last easing for a while,' said Mr Andy Bevan, head of fixed-income research at Bear Stearns. He now expects most European markets to consolidate after their recent rallies. Traders were also disappointed by the Bundesbank's decision to set fixed-rate repos at 6.70 per cent, only 10 basis points below this week's level. This indicated that German rate declines will continue to be very gradual. Still, 'once the dust settles, people will realise we're back on the rate-cutting road,' said Mr Carl Holt, head of trading at ABN-Amro. He expects yield curves across Europe to steepen as investors prepare for further easing in Germany, where inflation and money supply data are expected to improve in coming months. The German bund future fell  1/4 point after the Bundesbank's announcement, then rose about  1/2 point. It finally closed slightly lower on the day. The larger-than-expected half-point cut in German rates initially put pressure on bond prices. But traders were soon heartened by the tiny repo-rate cut which indicated that the Bundesbank was not accelerating its easing process while inflation and money supply growth were still above target. 'Keeping the repo at 6.70 per cent was the best thing they could have done for the long end,' said the head bund trader at a Frankfurt bank. Still, he said that investors should take profits in 10-year bonds and move to shorter maturities which may offer greater gains. 'Some time next year I expect the discount rate to be around 4 per cent, but long yields will probably still be around 6 per cent,' he said. FRENCH government bonds initially rallied on the German rate cut, but then dropped on disappointment over the extent of the French easing. By lowering its five to 10-day repo rate to 7 3/4 from 10 per cent but leaving its intervention rate unchanged at 6 3/4 per cent, the Bank of France 'put us back at pre-ERM crisis levels, but no more,' said a dealer. In the event, OATs recouped most of their losses to end little changed. UK GILTS eased in line with other European markets, but rate speculation did not spill across the Channel. 'What happens to continental rates in advance of November 30 is more or less irrelevant to UK rates,' said Mr Kevin Adams, UK bond strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The UK budget for next year is due to be announced on that date. THREE days of surging US bond prices came to an abrupt end yesterday when rumours that Congress was considering taxing interest earned in the US by foreign investors prompted heavy selling at the long end of the market. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 7/16 at 104, yielding 5.959 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down 7/32 at 99 31/32, to yield 3.874 per cent. After the market's strong three-day rally that followed the unexpectedly weak August employment report, no one was surprised yesterday when prices turned tail. Although what sparked the selling was mere speculation - that a Congressional committee is thinking of imposing a tax on foreign holdings of Treasury securities - the reports were enough of an excuse for dealers and investors to book some of the profits earned over the past week. Prices recovered some of their losses later in the morning when staff members in Congress said they doubted a tax on foreigners' Treasury holdings would ever be passed into law. However, by mid-afternoon, the pace of selling picked up again, sending prices to new session lows.</p>

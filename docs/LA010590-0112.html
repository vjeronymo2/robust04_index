			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BABY BELLS FEEL HEAT  </P> <P> Pacific Bell, GTE California and the state's 20-odd other local phone companies  still enjoy virtual monopolies in their respective service areas. But that is  changing -- in ways that promise to revolutionize the way consumers and  businesses buy and receive phone service.  </P> <P> In the same way that giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has lost market  share to smaller upstarts in the long-distance business, a handful of  entrepreneurial competitors are asking regulators to open local phone markets  further to competition. That will enable them to cash in on a growing business  and chip away at the market shares enjoyed by Pacific Bell and other local  firms.  </P> <P> So far, such increased competition is minimal. But the prospect of its growth  was a major factor cited by Pacific Telesis on Thursday in announcing that it  will cut 16% of its work force in the next five years, mostly in its Pacific  Bell unit.  </P> <P> "Looking at the next five years, it's etched very keenly in everybody's minds  that we have to do this to remain competitive," said Pacific Telesis  spokeswoman Amy Damianakes.  </P> <P> An example of the new breed of competitor is Metropolitan Fiber Service, a  2-year-old private venture that offers local connections to big business in a  dozen U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco.  </P> <P> "Our competition today is in what is designated as special access only, a very  small part of the total access (provided by) the Bell operating companies,"  said George Tronsrue, a vice president of Metropolitan Fiber Systems.  </P> <P> Its local links connect major telecommunications users, such as brokerages and  other financial institutions, to the long-distance carriers of their choice,  bypassing local public networks run by Pacific Bell and other local phone  companies.  </P> <P> Metropolitan Fiber Systems, based in the Chicago suburb of Oakbrook, Ill.,  installs its switching system in the heart of a major metropolitan area -- 800  W. 6th St. in Los Angeles. Then it extends high-capacity, high-fidelity optical  fiber strands to connect surrounding buildings to one another, creating its own  local network. This in turn is hooked to the nearby switching machines of such  long-distance carriers as AT&amp;T, MCI, US Sprint and the more than 100 other  more specialized long-haul companies.  </P> <P> "It's a small niche, but a viable business for us," Tronsrue said. "But when  you look at what else is there, there is a significant portion of local-access  service that we are precluded from developing."  </P> <P> Building a tiny niche into a big business mirrors the genesis two decades ago  of MCI, which began by handling private traffic by microwave between St. Louis  and Chicago and parlayed that into opening the entire long-distance  telecommunications market to competition.  </P> <P> Now federal and state regulators are begining to lighten their control over  AT&amp;T, which has watched its former long-distance monopoly shrink to a  two-thirds share of the market. At the same time, MCI and US Sprint have grown  into billion-dollar concerns themselves, and both now are also profitable.  </P> <P> Now, Metropolitan Fiber Systems has asked federal authorities to let it broaden  its entry into local telecommunications. It seeks the right to plug its private  customers into the Baby Bells' local networks, paying just for the part of  local service that it needs to complete its own system.  </P> <P> RELATED STORY, A1.  </P></p>

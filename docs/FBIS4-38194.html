			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "One Day the Hammer Will Fall on Certain Heads"] </F>   [Text] The late former Turkish President Turgut Ozal had  played the card of U.S. aggression against Iraq on the basis of  lose one, win three. However, Turkey lost all four. In fact,  it lost, and is still losing, a great deal.    Turkey lost its trade with Iraq through which it used to  make  $20 billion annually. It also lost 400,000 job opportunities  which were available to workers in restaurants and gas filling  stations as well as to the kids on the road to Zakho and the  drivers and owners of 17,000 Turkish trucks which used to  transport goods to Iraq. If we also count the family members of  these workers, drivers, and truck owners we get a clear picture  of the great damage that has hit that region.    But what is more important than all that and which cannot be  compensated or evaluated in dollars, whether U.S. or Gulf  dollars, is the serious threat which the Americans pose to  Turkey's national security and territorial integrity which, as  we know, has always been the main obsession of all governments  in Turkey.    The Americans and the British have created a so-called  "security zone" for Kurds in northern Iraq guarded by an  Anglo-American force which they termed the "Hammer Force" to use  as a tool which, they believe, would help them shake up the  leadership of Saddam Husayn.    They and their agents in Saudi Arabia wagered that the  situation in Iraq would not last for more than six months. But  their wager failed miserably.    When the first six months passed, they extended the presence  of this "hammer" another six months in the hope that their  wishes and wagers would materialize. But they also failed. The  renewal was repeated every six months and the Americans and  British were disappointed six times.    Yesterday, the Turkish Parliament renewed the presence of  this "hammer" for the seventh abortive time. The result of the  voting in the Turkish Parliament on the seventh renewal was as  follows:    - The deputies who voted for the renewal were 193.    - The deputies who voted against the renewal were 147.    - And, the deputies who were absent were 110.    Although the renewal decision obtained the "legal" majority,  the large number of deputies who voted against the renewal and  those who were absent -- it was said that most of them had  stayed away deliberately -- indicates that the decision did not  gain the "political" majority.    This means that the opposition to U.S. presence, which has  become a real threat to Turkey's national security and  territorial integrity, U.S. tampering with the question of the  pipeline which carries Iraqi oil across Turkey, the pressure  being brought to bear on Turkey concerning the Cyprus issue, the  campaigns which are being waged in Europe and the United States  against the violation of human rights in Turkey, and the lack of  a U.S. desire to open the Zakho gateway before Turkish trucks;  all these facts have for some time now aroused strong reactions  among Turkish nationalist parties and figures which have reached  the point of disgust at the continuous U.S. domination and  pressure to influence Turkish national policy in order to  satisfy the egos of worthless politicians in Washington.    But what is regrettable is that in his defense before the  Turkish Parliament of the decision to renew the presence of the  Hammer Force, Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said: "Were  it not for this force, the Turkish Army would not have been able  to cross into northern Iraq from time to time to strike at  elements of the Turkish Kurdish Workers Party-PKK.    He also said: "It is the prerogative of the Turkish  Government to ask these forces to leave Turkey whenever it  wants. That time will come when Baghdad abides by all the UN  resolutions and enters into a direct dialogue with the Kurds,  Turkmen, and other nationalities."    Cetin noted: "This subject will be discussed during a  meeting of the foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran, and Syria in  Damascus next month."    Here, we would like to remind the Turkish foreign minister  of  the following facts:    1. Coordination between the subversive organizations in  northern Iraq and the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] in Turkey has  actually increased with the presence of the "Hammer Force."  Turkey has carried out several large scale air raids on PKK  military bases in northern Iraq without avail.    2. The coordination which existed before the U.S. aggression  between Iraq and Turkey on issues concerning border security was  most effective and security conditions in both Turkey and Iraq  were stable, calm, and satisfactory to both sides.    3. The so-called "security zone" has not been secure for a  long time. In fact, we are not exaggerating when we say that  this zone has witnessed, and continues to witness, under the  ignorant U.S. hegemony the worst state of insecurity and  instability similar to the one existing in Bosnia and  Herzegovina, especially after Iran has also come in to secure a  foothold for itself in the region -- something which it would  not have dared to do in the past -- through the formation and  training of Islamic movements operating under the direction of  the Tehran ayatollahs.    4. Turkish-Iranian cooperation on this issue in particular  is more beneficial to Iran than it is to Turkey under the  existing insecure conditions in northern Iraq. By cooperating  with Iran, avoiding cooperation with Iraq, and approving U.S.  policy in the region, the Turkish side places all its cards  before the Iranian side. Turkey will not gain anything from  this cooperation other than more headaches. it is understood  that for some time now Iran has been preparing and backing  subversive movements which claim to be Islamic inside and  outside Turkey and that the current situation in northern Iraq  is so precarious that Iranian presence in it has become clear,  thanks to the "security zone" policy which is supported by  Turkey.    If the Turkish side is unaware of these facts or ignores  them, this is a tragedy.    While it is correct from the legal viewpoint, as the Turkish  foreign minister has said, that the Turkish Government has the  prerogative to ask these forces to leave Turkey whenever it  wants, the question is: Can Turkey do that politically?    Moreover, what is the relationship between the Hammer Force  and Iraq's implementation of the Security Council resolutions?  Why does the Turkish foreign minister purposely mix the cards  when he knows full well that the Hammer Force was a unilateral  hostile action by the Americans and that there is no Security  Council resolution authorizing them to take this action?    Cetin also knows full well that Iraq has implemented its  obligations under the Security Council resolutions and that  several states, including three major powers, are demanding a  partial or total lift of the blockade on Iraq since it has  fulfilled its obligations.    Cetin also says that the time to ask these forces to leave  will come when Baghdad enters into a direct dialogue with the  Kurds, Turkmen, and other nationalities.    Although such talk constitutes an interference in Iraq's  internal affairs and is therefore rejected, Cetin knows full  well also that the Iraqi Government had entered into a deep and  wide dialogue with the Kurds and reached an agreement with the  Kurdish parties in September 1991. We were about to sign and  announce this agreement were it not for the interference of the  U.S. Administration which prevented the Kurds from signing it  and kept them prisoners in the "U.S. protectorate."    Cetin should remember also that one of the problems of the  Kurdish region is the refusal and inability of the Turkish side  to hold a dialogue with 15 million Kurds in its own country all  these past years.    Unfortunately, it seems that the Turkish side has been  infected by U.S. double-standards. The day will come when the  hammer will fall on the heads of the worthless politicians in  Washington and London.</p>

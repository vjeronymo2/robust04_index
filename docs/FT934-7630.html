			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / French resist state sales MORE than 10,000 French public sector workers demonstrated in Paris yesterday against plans by Mr Edouard Balladur's government's plans to privatise their companies. Leading the protest march from the Eiffel Tower to the prime minister's office were workers from Air France, where the recent strike forced the government to back away from an austerity plan, and from other state-owned companies slated for eventual sale. These include Renault, the motor group, Bull which makes computers, Giat Industries, a defence company, and Seita, the state-owned tobacco concern. Air France's new chairman, Mr Christian Blanc, warned this week that full-year losses for 1993 could be as high as FFr7bn (Dollars 1.19bn), compared with earlier forecasts of more than FFr5bn. An equally large number of workers from Aerospatiale demonstrated in Toulouse, the base of the state-owned aerospace group. Trade union leaders had called the protest after state-owned companies in September announced planned redundancies of up to 15,000 workers in an effort to make themselves more attractive for sale.</p>

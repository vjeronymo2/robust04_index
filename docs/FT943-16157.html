			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Howard is rebuked for bitter attack on Blair Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, was rebuked last night for breaching Commons rules in launching a personal attack on Mr Tony Blair, the front-runner in the Labour leadership contest. Mr Geoffrey Lofthouse, the deputy Speaker, twice called on Mr Howard to deal with the content of the police and magistrates courts bill instead of criticising Mr Blair. Mr Howard ridiculed claims that Mr Blair had succeeded in establishing Labour as the party best equipped to tackle the crime wave and improve law and order. Dismissing Mr Blair's 'muddled' opposition to the bill, the home secretary said Mr Blair had given the impression that he had discovered the Ten Commandments and that he had 'received them from the Almighty'. As Labour backbenchers protested, Mr Lofthouse ordered the home secretary to return to the third reading of the bill. He added: 'We are showing a great example of law and order in this House tonight.' Mr Blair said the bill had been 'savaged' by the House of Lords, and remained a centralising measure which would undermine the concept of community policing favoured by the public. He forecast that the home secretary would also use it to secure 'wholesale amalgamations' of police authorities against the wishes of the people in the areas concerned and without any public inquiry. Earlier, government whips encouraged Tory backbenchers to leave the chamber when Mr Blair had his first opportunity to star from the Opposition front bench since emerging as the clear favourite to succeed John Smith as Labour leader. Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall North, complained that the Tory whips were trying to empty the government back benches. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, said she did not know what the Conservative whips were up to. 'As far as I am concerned I am totally riveted on Mr Blair,' she said.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / RBC may lose up to CDollars 300m on O&amp;Y loans ROYAL Bank of Canada has added CDollars 300m (Pounds 138m) to its loan-loss provisions to cover expected losses on the O&amp;Y portfolio and some other problem accounts. However, this write-down has been offset by an equal reduction in provisions for Third World loans, thus containing the fall in second-quarter earnings to 8 per cent. RBC, Canada's biggest financial institution, said it has classified two-thirds of its CDollars 780m exposure to O&amp;Y as non-performing, resulting in a 45 per cent jump in non-accrual loans over the past year to CDollars 2.7bn. It still expects its net loan losses for the year to be CDollars 740m. The net second-quarter provision was CDollars 185m, up from CDollars 155m a year earlier. Earnings slipped to CDollars 212.3m, or 59 cents a share, in the three months to April 30, from CDollars 230m, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Net interest income edged up to just over CDollars 1bn from CDollars 977m. Canada's six big banks have disclosed a total exposure to O&amp;Y of CDollars 3.1bn. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the ailing developer's biggest creditor, has taken a special charge of CDollars 1bn. Bank of Montreal, which says its loans to O&amp;Y are secured, has left its estimate of loan losses unchanged for fiscal 1992. Like RBC, Bank of Nova Scotia cushioned the O&amp;Y blow, using Third World writedowns. London's riverbus, Page 6 US property market, Page 19 Observer, Page 15</p>

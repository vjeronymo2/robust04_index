			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time to stop shooting the investment regulator Sir, Alison Smith ('Life with a frisky watchdog', July 23/24) provides a useful summary of the current debate about the regulated product environment and the new, and now official, Personal Investment Authority. However, gripes about today's practice of regulation and doubts about the future effectiveness of the PIA miss the fundamental point, that the primary objective - stronger investor protection - is now being achieved in the UK for two clear reasons. First, the balance of risk (and the need for protection implies the presence of risk) is moving away from the buying public. Once upon a time they were overly exposed, being expected to comprehend complex financial products and cope with the super salesforces trying to push them. Now, as the pendulum swings towards the supply side, businesses have realised that core income streams are at risk if laws are broken. Under the new equilibrium, corporate finance will suffer, rather than personal finance. Second, the subject of compliance risk management is now firmly on the agenda in many boardrooms. That will lead to better governance and therefore better 'balanced' performance of investment business in the future, restoring confidence in a vital sector of the economy. The PIA still has work to do to come to terms with the spectrum of risk which it now oversees for private investors. But far from firing shots at the new regulator as it takes to the air (even if it isn't the most aerodynamic vessel and has only mere humans at the controls), surely the time has come to wish all concerned a safe and pleasant flight.

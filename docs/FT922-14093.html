			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Schools and jobs will make the difference DRUIDS HEATH in Birming-ham Hall Green is an election-poster desert. The campaign has had little impact on this 1960s estate of about 2,700 council houses and flats, where unemployment is about 30 per cent. The implications of the tax proposals of Mr Norman Lamont and Mr John Smith mean little in this part of Birmingham, where fear of unemployment and the recession have dominated local concerns. 'People here have to think carefully about the financial consequences when they catch a bus into town,' said Mr Ken Atkinson, treasurer of the neighbourhood development association. 'The problem for Labour here is whether people in this part of the constituency will bother to vote at all. Many are beyond hoping that any system is going to benefit them.' Turning out for the vote is crucial if Ms Jane Slowey, the Labour candidate, is to achieve the swing of nearly 9 per cent needed to unseat Mr Andrew Hargreaves, the Tory defender. The neat, owner-occupied semi-detached houses that comprise the majority of housing in Hall Green have returned a Conservative since the seat was formed in 1950, but it has never been safe. The constituency exemplifies the working-class Tory vote that has been a tradition of skilled labour in Birmingham since the 19th century. Running through the workforce is a strong thread that upholds ideals of self-betterment and improvement through education. Perhaps because of that, the Conservatives have been able to capitalise on parental fears about Labour's education policy. Baverstock School, next to Druids Heath, has made a success of opting for grant-maintained status and neither the headmaster nor the parents want it to return to the former system. Ms Slowey has taken issue with the headmaster over his stance - but she was the one who faced heated questions from Baverstock parents at a meeting last week, and she may have seen some Labour votes desert her because of the row. In a seat which, because of national swings, is likely to be a close result, the loss of any votes by Labour might mean the difference between winning and losing. An enthusiastic campaign run by the Liberal Democrat candidate, Mr David McGrath, may be a factor in the result. He claims that his party is taking votes from the Conservatives and holding on to votes it collected in the local elections last year, which made it the dominant party in one ward. All the candidates agree that the issues have not changed here during the campaign. Tax was never very important. Fear of unemployment is a real concern, so is education, but come tomorrow the parties believe voting will largely reflect national intentions.</p>

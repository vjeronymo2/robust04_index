Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 26.21(b) regarding fitness-for-duty (FFD) refresher training to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company and Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (the licensees), for the Haddam Neck Plant, located in Middlesex County, Connecticut, and Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2 and 3, located in New London County, Connecticut. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action would exempt the licensees from the requirements of 10 CFR 26.21(b) regarding FFD refresher training on a nominal 12-month frequency. By letter dated February 10, 1994, the licensees requested a one-time exemption from 10 CFR 26.21(b) to allow the licensees to consolidate their response to several training requirements by extending the time requirement for providing FFD refresher training to approximately 21 months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed exemption is needed because the licensees perform FFD refresher training as part of a consolidation of various annual training requirements. While the consolidation of annual training requirements results in substantial gains in efficiency, it also results in the potential for individuals who would have been scheduled to receive FFD refresher training during January 1994, to go until October 1994, before receiving this training. In addition, there will be individuals whose scheduled training interval is extended for shorter durations. However, the 9-month delay is the most bounding, so an overall extension from 12 to 21 months has been requested by the licensees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensees state in their February 10, 1994, application that they are confident that affected personnel understand the FFD program and requirements, and that no adverse impact will result from this requested change. Between the four units, approximately 15 percent of the on-shift personnel will fall outside of the nominal 12-month window. All of the individuals have received FFD training in the past, and will read and sign a synopsis of the FFD requirements prior to exceeding the nominal 12-month window. In addition, within each shift, the supervisory personnel will be trained within the nominal 12-month frequency pursuant to 10 CFR 26.22. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff evaluation of the proposed exemption from 10 CFR 26.21(b) indicates that the granting of the exemption will not impair the level of knowledge of personnel involved in the FFD program. Moreover, there will be no changes in plant operating conditions or associated routine or accidental effluents. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no measurable radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission has concluded that there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption, any alternatives will either have no environmental impact or have a greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce the environmental impacts attributed to this facility and would result in forcing the licensees to separate the FFD refresher training from other annual training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statements for the Haddam Neck Plant (October 1973), Millstone, Units 1 and 2 (June 1973) and Millstone, Unit 3 (December 1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's staff consulted with the Connecticut State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State official had no comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated February 10, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street, Middletown, Connecticut 06457 for the Haddam Neck Plant, and the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360 for the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 17th day of March 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ronald W.

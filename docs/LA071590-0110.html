			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL RISK AND FAITH;  </P> <P> PATENTING THE SUN POLIO, THE SALK VACCINE, AND THE CHILDREN OF THE BABY BOOM BY  JANE S. SMITH (WILLIAM MORROW: $22.95; 413 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-688-09494-5  </P> <P> For the better part of the 20th Century, the summer was a time of fear for  American parents and children. As schools adjourned for the summer, anxiety  about the return of paralytic polio would begin to rise. And, of course, there  were powerful reasons for concern.  </P> <P> Early in the century, polio epidemics would sweep through a city or town; in  1916, about 27,000 people were paralyzed, 6,000 died. Despite remarkable  improvements in health by mid-century and the introduction of "miracle"  therapies for many childhood diseases, polio had only grown as a threat. The  worst epidemic in U.S. history occurred in 1952, when 60,000 new cases were  reported.  </P> <P> This pattern of anxious summers and long falls, counting the cases-some  crippled, some dead, some remarkably spared in spite of infection -- came to a  dramatic end in the spring of 1955 when immunologist Tom Francis announced to  the world that the polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk and his colleagues at  the University of Pittsburgh safely and effectively prevented polio. It is this  dramatic story that Jane Smith tells so effectively in "Patenting the Sun."  </P> <P> Smith shows how polio and the campaign to conquer it reflected the basic  preoccupations and cultural values of a new generation of post-war Americans.  The vaccine became a symbol of American scientific expertise, social  voluntarism and the future of our children. Implicit in the victory over polio  were heightened expectations that science and medicine would necessarily solve  the most difficult persisting problems of disease and disability. The triumph  of the Salk vaccine marks a moment of faith in the technological fix, in the  magic bullets of modern medicine.  </P> <P> The vaccine that Salk discovered in 1952 marked the culmination of the efforts  of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, better known as the March  of Dimes. Founded in 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose personal  battle against polio had focused national attention on the disease, the  foundation was led by F.D.R.'s former law partner, Basil O'Connor.  </P> <P> The foundation revolutionized American philanthropy by seeking funds from all  Americans, not only the wealthy; everyone could do their bit to fight polio.  From providing medical services to the afflicted -- iron lungs, leg braces and  rehabilitation -- the foundation soon moved to provide resources to researchers  to study the scientific aspects of polio. Although much of the research was  technical and basic in nature, hopes soon were raised that a vaccine would be  produced to end the threat of polio. O'Connor became the impresario of polio,  dominating the philanthropic, public-relations and even scientific aspects of  the campaign.  </P> <P> Jonas Salk -- brilliant, dedicated and unwavering in his commitment to  "solving" polio -- remains Smith's hero, although her portrait is nuanced. As  she clearly shows, while the press and the public quickly came to consider Salk  a demigod, to many in the scientific community he seemed a demagogue, far too  eager to go public with his work, far too eager to appear on television or  radio, to elite bioscientists hardly respectable forums to air scientific  disagreements. The development of the Salk vaccine, highly publicized by the  public-relations juggernaut of the March of Dimes, fractured the norms of the  quiet, autonomous workings of science. Salk and his public pronouncements  violated the norms of his caste.  </P> <P> Salk's colleagues never forgave him his success. In his quest for the vaccine,  he left the fold of academic research and never has returned. It was Enders,  Weller and Robbins who won the Nobel Prize for their earlier discovery that the  polio virus could be grown in culture -- the basic science breakthrough that  made all subsequent vaccine research possible. Salk never was elected to the  National Academy of Science. Many considered his development of the vaccine  "pedestrian." But as Smith emphasizes, Salk was first, and in this instance,  first meant that lives were saved by his vaccine.  </P> <P> Making scientific investigations and their vicissitudes accessible to a broad  audience is no easy task, but Smith makes the science of polio research both  clear and exciting. She effectively captures the genuine intensity that  characterized the race to "conquer" polio. One breakthrough led to another, as  it so rarely does: research from basic investigation into growing the virus in  culture, and then into "typing" the various strains, quickly led to the  possibility of a human vaccine.  </P> <P> Cooperation and collegiality soon succumbed to back-biting (and back-stabbing)  as titanic egos clashed. The laboratory became more often a place of politics,  ideologies and bitter personal competition. The vociferous controversy between  Salk's killed virus vaccine and Albert Sabin's attenuated-virus oral vaccine  remains something of an epic in the annals of 20th-Century biomedicine.  </P> <P> And indeed, three decades later the protagonists still will take up the debates  concerning the relative safety and efficacy of these competing products. If  "Patenting the Sun" has a failing, it is that Smith's narrative fails to go  adequately beyond these powerful personalities to evaluate the more fundamental  questions implicit in the scientific and medical controversies raised by the  development of these polio vaccines.  </P> <P> As the history of the Salk vaccine makes clear, the obstacles inherent in  evaluating a new medical technology -- especially a vaccine -- are daunting. To  demonstrate conclusively that a vaccine is both safe and effective is an  enormously complex undertaking; ultimately a vaccine must be tested on humans,  who risk succumbing to the very disease for which they are to be immunized.  Almost 2 million American schoolchildren participated as test subjects in the  Salk field trials, the largest medical experiment in history. These "Polio  Pioneers" waited anxiously through the spring of 1955 to see if the vaccine was  effective.  </P> <P> Throughout the research and field trials, the federal government was nowhere to  be found. The failure of the government to maintain adequate oversight of  vaccine production after the trial led to the distribution of small amounts of  contaminated vaccine in which all the virus had not been inactivated. The  notorious "Cutter incident," which resulted in 204 cases of polio and 11 deaths  among vaccinated children, nearly destroyed confidence in the Salk vaccine. The  episode made clear the need for an active federal presence in evaluating and  regulating research and production of vaccines and drugs.  </P> <P> Of course, even magic bullets need to be efficiently produced and delivered.  The persistence of paralytic polio in the developing world signals all too  tragically this conundrum: Why, given the effectiveness of vaccines for polio,  do children go unimmunized?  </P> <P> And while celebrating the campaign against polio, it is impossible not to think  of AIDS. Smith's narrative makes clear that a set of complex relationships  among science, government and philanthropy, as well as our popular  understandings of the disease, will fundamentally affect the course of the  epidemic.  </P> <P> A quarter-century ago, one of the Polio Pioneers who bravely volunteered (with  the consent of her parents) was none other than Jane Smith. Now she has told  the story of the Salk vaccine -- her story -- with spirit and intelligence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BOOK MARK  </P> <P> For an excerpt from "Patenting the Sun," see Opinion, Page 1.  </P></p>

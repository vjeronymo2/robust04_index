			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Loss adjusters pursue jobless GENERAL ACCIDENT is sending loss adjusters to those receiving payouts from unemployment insurance policies, following a doubling in claims. And the company is stopping payments if policyholders do not immediately agree to a visit. The Association of British Insurers said the use of outside loss adjusters on umemployment claims was very unusual. The Bradford branch of GA, which mainly handles policies sold through building societies, is believed to have sent loss adjusters out to nearly 300 redundancy claimants in the last month. Among those approached was a computer systems analyst made redundant in November 1990. At the beginning of 1990, he took out a GA accident, sickness and redundancy policy through Abbey National. The policy covered up to 24 monthly payments of Pounds 1,500 to meet mortgage instalments, plus the maximum 50 per cent margin allowed for other bills. Payments under the policy began five months after he was made redundant. Last week, a representative of the loss-adjusting company, Thomas Howell, telephoned the analyst saying it had been appointed by General Accident and asking to interview him at home. 'He mentioned a questionnaire but would not say what was in it, so I said I was not prepared to talk to him and would contact GA.' He wrote to GA, asking if there had been a mistake, and pointing out that he had stuck to the policy terms by sending in a DSS certificate of unemployment each month and did not recall having agreed to visits by loss adjusters. On Tuesday a letter from GA acknowledged the latest unemployment certificate but noted that the analyst had declined a visit from Thomas Howell. 'We would advise you that until we receive a report from the Thomas Howell Group we are unable to release any further payments under this scheme,' wrote Sue Bramley of GA. 'This is a relatively new scheme that has been adopted by the GA with regard to accident, sickness and unemployment to give us a better overall view of the various claims.' At General Accident's Perth head office, creditor insurance manager Jim Hunter said: 'We are certainly within our rights,' citing a clause in the policy 'the insurer shall be entitled to make inquiry of the insured borrower's immediate past employer or otherwise as deemed necessary.' He said that these last five words alone, authorised the company to send in loss adjusters at any time. GA claims manager John Fleming said the questionnaire's purpose was to ensure that people were seeking work but not working and claiming at the same time. He defended immediate stoppage of payments if loss adjusters were not admitted: 'Why should we continue to pay if someone is clearly not prepared to provide information? It is the right of every insurance company to conduct whatever inquiries they need.'</p>

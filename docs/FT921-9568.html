			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Balancing Britain's pay scales / Assessment of prospects for moderation in this year's round of pay negotiations A negotiator in a south-east London estate agency will be lucky to earn Pounds 12,000 this year, perhaps one-third of the amount he or she might have expected in 1988 at the height of the property boom. But as the annual UK pay round gets into its stride most British companies are likely to find that pay is not responding in such textbook fashion to the recession. January saw fewer pay freezes and pay cuts than for the same period last year, as pay bargainers pre-empted the end of recession. Most pay analysts say settlements are averaging about 5 per cent, still above inflation at 4.5 per cent, and the public sector is in the middle of one of its periodic pay spurts with an overall increase of 7 per cent expected this year. The government yesterday accepted pay review body recommendations averaging about 6.5 per cent for 30 per cent of public sector workers, including nurses and teachers. More worryingly, average earnings increases are stuck above 7 per cent, a floor that has not been breached since the mid-1960s. There has, however, been a sharp fall in pay increases since the beginning of 1991. Average pay rises fell from 10 per cent in December 1990 to less than 5 per cent in the same month last year, echoing the fall in the 1980-81 recession. The Confederation of British Industry, the UK employers' organisation, claims that pay in the all-important manufacturing sector is now growing more slowly than in Germany. Settlements fell to as low as 4.1 per cent in the final quarter of 1991, according to its pay data bank. The German steel industry settlement of 6.35 per cent agreed last week was noted with satisfaction by UK employers. And the rise in unit labour costs - increases in earnings adjusted for gains in productivity - fell to 6.8 per cent cent in British manufacturing in the third quarter of 1991, narrowing the gap with west Germany's 4.6 per cent for the same period. That is an encouraging trend, but is largely thanks to divergent economic growth cycles in the two countries and the overheating of the German economy created by reunification. Comparisons of unit labour costs over the past three years, and indeed most of the past three decades, show that annual increases in the UK have usually been between two and three times higher than in Germany. Moreover, the UK's membership of the European Community's exchange rate mechanism requires Britain consistently to match, or even better, the German rates of increase. If UK unit labour costs rise faster than in the main European economies that will create inflationary pressure which, within the ERM, can only be countered by high interest rates and thus unemployment. The job cuts announced last week by Ford UK, which has consistently delivered higher unit labour costs than Ford in Spain and Germany, are a warning. The effect of ERM membership on pay bargaining has been obscured by recession. The test of bargainers' ability to adapt to ERM constraints will come later this year and next as output is expected to recover. Have British employers or unions grasped the magnitude of the task? The signals are mixed. The head of personnel at one of Britain's biggest manufacturing companies says that the ERM and European productivity comparisons will play no part in bargaining. On the other hand, Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, says that the ERM is already playing an important role in negotiations, at least in the export sector. 'Employers are saying that with devaluation no longer an option what happens in Germany is crucial,' he reports. Union leaders such as Mr Edmonds accept that membership of the ERM requires a reduction in unit labour costs and stress that the way out is not low wages but higher productivity. His answer, and the Labour party's, is more training and consultation at work. Mr Edmonds also advocates consultation at a national level between government, unions and employers to prevent competing wage demands and to influence expectations. The CBI remains strongly opposed to such remedies. But Mr Robbie Gilbert, head of industrial relations at the CBI, concedes: 'Many employers have not taken the ERM on board.' The CBI argues that pay will be squeezed because UK economic growth will be slower in the ERM. The brevity of the early 1980s recession meant that pay was scarcely affected. In 1983, with unemployment above 3m, average earnings were almost twice the inflation level of 4.6 per cent. But the CBI is not putting its faith in slower growth alone. It believes that the British bargaining system has been revolutionised in the 1980s and Mr Gilbert suggests that 'we may be on the way to breaking the wage-price spiral'. The optimists, at the CBI and elsewhere, point to the fact that pay did not rise as much as expected while the economy was buoyant and employers competed for scarce labour between 1987 and 1989. They conclude that labour market and union reforms and the more flexible nature of pay bargaining have left a permanent mark. The optimists also point to the fact that employers have cut back on training less than in previous recessions and that skill shortages, one of the reasons for inflationary pay awards, may be less acute than usual in the upturn. An additional reason for hope is that average earnings in the mid to late 1980s were temporarily boosted by a pay explosion for many white-collar and managerial groups, especially in the financial services sector. The fact that this sector is now facing difficulties should act as a brake on white-collar pay for the next couple of years. That is important because it is not the dwindling band of manual workers in manufacturing that has been stoking up wage inflation over the past decade, but white-collar and professional employees. The real gross earnings of male non-manual workers in 1979-89 rose three times faster than male manual workers. Non-manual employees outside the public sector are seldom in unions, so it seems that white-collar wages' drift has been more the result of market forces than union pressure. But even among the relatively highly unionised manual workers in manufacturing few analysts expect a revival of militancy - strikes are at their lowest annual level since 1933 - when the upturn comes. Yet the French experience is a chilling reminder that, even with a revolution in UK pay bargaining, unemployment could remain high. France has held earnings growth below 5 per cent for each of the last five years but still has unemployment at 10 per cent. And, as the pessimists point out, there are several reasons why that pay revolution will be hard to attain: Even if Britain is undergoing a training revolution it will take time before employers no longer have to outbid each other for skilled workers. While few doubt that there was a marked improvement in manufacturing productivity in the 1980s, the trend may have run out of steam in the past few years. Public sector pay, which now usually matches private sector pay, is due for a medium-term boost which will force manufacturers to keep pace. The reason is that private sector reforms, such as performance-related pay, are now being introduced in the public sector. In the short run those reforms may increase, not reduce, labour costs. The break-up of national bargaining in some of the privatised utilities has boosted pay while the 'regionalisation' of pay has worked one way - paying more in the richer south-east but not less in Liverpool. Over the next two years the optimists are likely to be proved right, with wage increases continuing to moderate. 'But,' says Mr John Muellbauer, an economist at Nuffield College, 'it will still take years of wage inflation below that of our competitors to make a dent in our lack of competitiveness.' How many years? 'It took 20 years to build in inflationary expectations and it will take 20 years to squeeze them out,' says the CBI's Mr Gilbert.</p>

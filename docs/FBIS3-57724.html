			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The press service of Russian Union of Industrialists  and Entrepreneurs has denied a report on a meeting between  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and the commanders of a few army  divisions. On 27 January, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS published an  article saying that a meeting took place between Zhirinovskiy  and the commanders of several army divisions at a conspiratorial  dacha belonging to Russia's external intelligence service, which  was being rented by the union's leader Arkadiy Volskiy. The  article claims that the conference was of an antipresidential  nature.    In this connection, the document says, the press service of  the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs believes  it necessary to state that the information given does not  correspond with reality and is of a provocative nature. Neither  Volskiy nor the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs have rented or are renting any dacha belonging to  the external intelligence service, and Zhirinovskiy has never  been in the Union's buildings and held any conferences. The  document also points to the serious moral and political damage  which the publication is inflicting, both on Russia's president  and on the union, and says that the leadership of the Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is sending the relevant  materials to court.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich (Food and Wine): Ah yes, the dreamy, satin-textured '66 - Jancis Robinson recalls a sensational, ground-breaking tasting with expert winemaker Jean-Claude Berrouet IN MY nearly 20 years as a wine groupie I have been to many seriously grand tastings. An over-comprehensive look at the 1959 claret vintage springs to mind. Much more clearly than any single wine, I remember an Irishman whispering as we filed solemnly into a chamber full of tasting samples: 'If only we could actually drink one of these wines with dinner tonight.' At least I remember the glory of the Ch Latour a Pomerol among the vast 1961 tasting I attended (playing hookey from the launch of my own television series in order to do so). Claret is the most common tasting subject because it is a long-lived wine produced in quantity, and submits neatly to being divided 'horizontally' (same vintage, different chateaux) or 'vertically' (same chateau, different vintages). My tasting file is stuffed with purple-spotted notes on such events. But it was not until last month that I came across a tasting of the world's most expensive claret, Ch Petrus, Pounds 800 a dozen bottles in a dire vintage, several thousand in a good one. Perhaps this is partly because the British, so few of whom can afford it, tend to look very, very slightly down their noses at it. It is Pomerol, for a start, a parvenu that affords dangerously instant gratification. No pain is associated with tasting fleshy young Pomerol, which does not suit the masochist brigade reared on tannic young Pauillac and St Estephe. For this reason London is not the most likely place for a Petrus tasting - but I hardly expected to come across one in the backwoods of rural France. In fact, seasoned observers like me do not expect to come across consumer wine tastings of any sort anywhere in France outside the capital. Wine tasting is not the leisure activity in France it has become for British consumers. But here it was, lying in the reception of a smartish hotel in the depths of the French countryside, where the average annual income must be well under FFr100,000 (Pounds 12,000) - an application form for tickets, at FF1850, for a forthcoming tasting of Petrus. Seven vintages back to 1945, if you please. And the very night before I was due to leave. The organiser of this unmissable event, tied in to an auction also held at the hotel which I still kick myself for missing, is Michel Fauveau, who works on Toulouse's huge aerospatial campus. (When I asked him what he did, he told me: 'I observe the Earth'.) An obvious obsessive, he has transformed his obsession with wine into the Club Oenophile du Midi (tel: 61 27 37 69 or 62 24 43 34). The organisation of the event was fascinatingly different from the British norm. For a start, the application form included the question: 'Are you familiar with wine tasting?' which I cannot imagine being asked in Britain. Nor can I imagine Fauveau's British counterpart demanding verbal input, as in the classroom, from tasters who had paid more than Pounds 200 for the experience. And I would not have thought that many Brits would have dared stroll into the tasting room with a cigar, as the auctioneer did. Yet the average age of the 28 assembled tasters (for two bottles of each vintage, a generous serving) was impressively low, partly reduced by a member of the French national football team and his entourage. The tasting was presented by a noted expert, in this case the Petrus winemaker Jean-Claude Berrouet himself, who shares with his employer, Christian Moueix, a sensible view of wine's place in life. He pointed out somewhat ruefully that wine tasting as such is something new in France, something 'tres Anglo-Saxon'. The point of wine, he rightly stressed, is to be drunk, preferably at a table with food. And that was another important national distinguishing mark. You can spend a lifetime at wine tastings in Britain before anyone mentions food, but at this early evening tasting, Berrouet and most other commentators suggested dishes - increasingly specific dishes as dinnertime approached - to go with each wine. With the 1945, in decline and smelling of 'a nice 18th century manoir,' a tableful of local doctors proposed ris de veau aux truffes. It was hard to discern any national variation in taste, but since no activity is more subjective than wine tasting, this is hardly surprising. There were considerable variations between the bottles in the older vintages, but the 1966 that reached the table I shared with Mme Fauveau was a dream: seductive, tannin-free, headily perfumed, satin-textured and much more concentrated than the bottle of the often vaunted 1967. I was also bowled over by the 1982, which is intense and meaty and has many years to go, and the 1962 (made, as Berrouet was careful to point out, when there was not a single oenologist, or qualified winemaker, in the Pomerol region) was also fabulous, tasting provocatively close to its peak. The rich, almost porty 1971 with its notes of chocolate and coffee is another vintage the seriously rich should be thinking of clearing out of their cellars, while the 1975 was a delightful surprise, the vintage's notorious tannins well in retreat. For me, this had been a sensational tasting, breaking new ground in subject and location, but I had to wait just 48 hours before being put in my place. At a double magnum dinner back in London, admittedly designed for seriously rich wine collectors, I met a Belgian who told me that at his Petrus tasting he had not only had all the vintages, but all seven bottlings of the ne plus ultra 1947.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN LAW AGAINST FLAG BURNING  </P> <P> Flag burning -- what a perfect political issue for our times. The fact that few  resort to burning it is irrelevant. For facts don't count for much in a  political process where our leaders engage in a calculated dance of deception.  </P> <P> Politicians wrap themselves in the flag, not so much out of a love of country  as a cloak for self-interest. They know that emotionally charged pictures and  the manipulation of symbols that touch our core beliefs make it possible to  appeal to our emotions and bypass our intellect. And our votes, based on these  non-issues, are marginalized in the process.  </P> <P> So, we face the decade of the '90s with our political dialogue filled with  symbolic messages, packaged for easy consumption, with little or no relevance.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, our environment deteriorates, our society becomes more and more  polarized economically and socially, our economy flounders as it attempts to  compete with Germany, Japan and others, and our government becomes more and  more repressive. What a sad legacy for all those who fought and died for Old  Glory.  </P> <P> ROSE ELIZABETH BIRD  </P> <P> Palo Alto  </P></p>

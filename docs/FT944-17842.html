			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Technology: Japan rocks steady The Great Buddha of Kamakura was little moved by this week's earthquake in Japan. The 40ft statue on the outskirts of Tokyo rests on steel shock absorbers on a granite base, allowing it to move with the tremor. Like the Buddha of Kamakura, many Japanese buildings today have special foundations which absorb tremors and allow the structures to dissipate quake energy by swaying. These devices include bearings made of rubber and steel, or layered steel and rubber between the building and its foundations. This technology is used mainly in structures under 200m high. 'Buildings taller than 30 storeys are able to move with the earthquake,' says Yuichiro Ogawa, who manages Shimizu Construction's structural technology division. The problem for designers now is to deal with the effects of swaying. The 36-storey Kasumigaseki building in central Tokyo, built in 1968, was the first high-rise to include 'soft structure' technology, allowing the building's beams and pillars to vibrate with the quake. Further technological advances have led to skyscrapers more than 200m tall, but their flexibility means that strong winds and typhoons sway them to an uncomfortable degree, causing symptoms similar to seasickness and making high-rises unsuitable for residential use. This has been eased by computerised vibration control systems. Strong winds cause computers to activate a large rectangular weight, supported by four pillars made of layers of rubber which move in the opposite direction to the building's movements. Shimizu's system - the first to be installed in a skyscraper of more than 200m, two years ago - passed its first big test in last week's typhoon, the strongest to hit western Japan this year. Other companies have developed and installed similar systems. Shimizu said that the usual degree of fluctuation was reduced by two-thirds. Occupants of the building's apartments and hotel reported feeling hardly any swaying despite strong gusts of wind.</p>

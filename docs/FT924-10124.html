			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Observer: Personality change UK psychiatrists might do well to gear up for an influx of custom from the National Westminster Bank. Since NatWest Markets was set up earlier this year, from elements including the Blue Arrow-bedevilled County NatWest investment bank, there have been promises of a new corporate identity to which staff are being introduced this morning. It turns out that the specialist consultants hired for the job trawled through every name that has been part of the bank's history in the past 300 years . . . then decided the outfit should go on being called NatWest Markets. But at least they've come up with a new logo: the monogram NWM against a dark blue (yes, blue) background. The reason they didn't just settle for sharing the NatWest Bank emblem is officially that the aim of the exercise is to distinguish NWM's institutional client service from the high-street banking operation. So don't go thinking that those prominent arrow-heads in the clearer's logo have anything to do with it. How do the staff feel about the 'contemporary and self-confident solution'? Straight-talking Martin Owen, who took over as the new outfit's chief executive in June, confesses: 'NatWest Markets is not a name I would have wanted. I would have preferred something more descriptive of what we do - 'Markets' smacks of traders.' Oh dear. Still, that perhaps explains why the identity is to undergo further 'reinforcing' by such means as sticking 'corporate and investment banking' under the NWM monogram. And for anyone who doesn't find that confusing enough in itself, the sad news is that worse confusion underlies it. For example, the County NatWest name has not disappeared entirely. It is to be retained for investment management operations and - wait for it - the corporate finance department. The consultants found that while NatWest staff as well as the media were cynical about the County tag in the wake of Blue Arrow, the clients were happy with it. 'That surprised us as well,' says Owen.</p>

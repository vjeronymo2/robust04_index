			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Rolling-stock plan for London Tube approved The government yesterday bowed to pressure from its own backbench MPs and the business community by approving a competition to find a supplier of new rolling stock for London Underground's Northern Line. London Underground has held talks in recent months with ABB Transportation, the Derby-based company, over the supply of 100 new trains at an estimated cost of Pounds 440m plus a 20-year maintenance contract valued at Pounds 300m. Progress has been blocked by Treasury objections that the proposed deal did not transfer enough of the risk out of the public sector and on to the supplier. This was in spite of support for the deal from the private finance panel established by the government to promote private-sector involvement in infrastructure projects. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced an open competition to find a supplier but stressed that final approval would still depend on a bid meeting the Treasury's requirements. He believed there was a good prospect of this happening. ABB, which is part of the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri group, said it was delighted by the government decision and planned to bid keenly for the project. It had previously warned that failure to win the contract could lead to the loss of 600 jobs at its Derby factory. Although ABB faces competition from other rolling-stock manufacturers, it is completing the delivery of similar trains for the Underground's Central Line so would be spared the cost of establishing a production line from scratch. London Underground will advertise the contract in the European Union's official journal, as EU rules require. ABB said if it won the bidding it could start delivering the trains early next year. London First, the business organisation set up to promote the capital, welcomed the move but said it hoped the Treasury did not regard this as an isolated exception to its normal rules. 'We hope this marks a move towards a more flexible approach,' it said. Rolling stock on the Northern Line is 30 years old, and while reliability has improved in recent months it is known as 'the misery line' by London commuters. The Northern Line announcement formed part of a package of measures unveiled yesterday to improve the quality of life in London. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, announced proposals to make the capital tidier and to make better use of the river Thames, for travel, transport and recreation.</p>

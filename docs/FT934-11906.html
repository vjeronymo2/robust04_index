			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / NZ voters offered six by one, half dozen by the other: An election in which the main parties differ little both in what they've done and what they promise to do WHILE world markets look on admiringly at the pace and nature of New Zealand's economic reforms and push its currency higher, the country's population appears battered and confused by the changes. So much so that, if the opinion polls are any guide, voters look more inclined unenthusiastically to back the known policies of Mr Jim Bolger's ruling National Party than risk further upheaval with Mr Mike Moore and Labour on November 6. 'It's a question of Tweedledum and Tweedledum-ber,' says one well-heeled Wellington resident. An unemployed Maori youth in Christchurch, after spending a morning listening to Mr Moore's plans to alleviate youth unemployment, is blunter. 'I don't have much time for National', he says, 'but what if he (Moore) is wrong? It'll be a bloodbath.' The one economic statistic in everyone's mind is the unemployment rate of 9.9 per cent. It is down from a high of 11.2 per cent last year, but it feels as bad because of the benefit cuts that were enacted in 1991 as part of the country's debt reduction package. Newspapers run stories of a ten-fold increase in demand for Salvation Army food parcels over the past three years. Mr Moore challenges Ms Ruth Richardson, finance minister, to visit the food queues. In political terms, both the main parties are tainted with responsibility for the pain. It was the Labour Party, under former prime minister David Lange, that began the economic revolution, doing away with decades of heavy protectionism, initiating widespread privatisations and advocating monetary prudence. Mr Moore was a part of that regime. After six years, New Zealanders decided they had had enough. But, with the world economy slipping into recession, the new Bolger government simply went further down the free-market reform track. It attacked welfare benefits and replaced the country's 'cradle-to-grave' welfare system with a more targetted one. And it produced labour market legislation - the Employment Contracts Act - which did away with the traditional system of national occupation awards in favour of workplace bargaining with or without unions. If voters think that both sides are to blame for the more unpalatable aspects of the economic shake-up, of the past, they also see relatively little to distinguish their policies for the future. The low inflation target - zero to 2 per cent - is locked in by the Reserve Bank Act, although both Labour and National also offer a public commitment to price stability. National talks of reaching and maintaining economic growth of 3.5 to 5 per cent; Labour wants 4 per cent. It is reckoned to be about 3 per cent now. Both parties, moreover, pledge to reduce the country's debt burden by keeping a tight rein on government expenditure and eventually achieving budget surpluses. Mr Moore's social policy agenda is the more generous - focused on a halt to commercialisation of the health service, increased help for the jobless, and no more privatisations. However, Labour would not re-instate the benefit cuts made so painfully by National, and some of its headline proposals - such as a repeal of the Employment Contracts Act and community work for the young unemployed - do not have an immediate cost. That said, even Labour party members admit that the country would need to see their 4 per cent annual growth by 1996 if everything promised in the manifesto is to be implemented. That, in turn, has allowed National to suggest that the Labour strategy could run the risk of higher taxes - something which Labour has never emphatically denied. For its part, National says that it has ruled out new taxes, although Ms Richardson admits that she has not rejected 'closing loopholes'. Fudge, retorts her opponents. The big card that Mr Bolger has been able to play is timing. Although the jobless figures may be in the forefront of many people's minds - and Mr Moore is using every opportunity to ensure that they stay there - there is evidence that the economy is picking up. Mr Bolger is plainly hoping that the scent of this will deter the electorate from changing course. Expert performance has been strong despite the appreciating currency. This week the September trade figures showed a 4.3 per cent increase in exports, year on year, bringing the total for the last 12 months to a record NZDollars 9.3bn (Pounds 3.5bn). The September trade deficit was significantly reduced from the same month in 1992 and the trade surplus for the year was NZDollars 1.7bn. There are signs, too, that this exported turnaround is at last beginning to filter through to the domestic economy. Home loan rates, for instance, fell to below 8 per cent just after the election was announced and house sales in the three months to September were 22 per cent higher than the previous year. Business leaders, who claim to have relatively little interest in which party wins, given the similarity of their basic economic strategies, also say the outlook has brightened considerably. 'It's generally very positive,' commented Mr Ray Harding, head of the Wellington Chamber of Commerce. 'Everyone's margins were squeezed to hell, and that's reflected in the unemployment levels. But balance sheets are now a little easier, and there are signs of domestic recovery, although that's a relatively recent change.'</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / US miners contribute to 16% fall at Hanson HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 16 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 905m to Pounds 763m, for the nine months to June 30. Last year's figure was, however, boosted by Pounds 129m of exceptional gains from the sales of British Ever Ready and a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries. This time there was only a Pounds 10m asset write-down. Profit before exceptionals fell from Pounds 764m to Pounds 733m on sales of Pounds 7bn (Pounds 6.1bn). Fully diluted earnings per share, reflecting the return to a regular tax charge, slid to 11.5p from 15.7p. The shares shed 3p to 252 1/2 p. Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman, said the group was on target to complete its Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn) acquisition of Quantum Chemical Corporation of the US by the end of September. Its full-year results are expected to show that absorbing Quantum's Dollars 2.5bn borrowings has pushed gearing to more than 80 per cent. The group expects the acquisition to make a positive contribution to earnings in 1993-94. Analysts believe the rise in debt will lead to sales of smaller businesses. The US miners' strike had affected 19 mines owned by Hanson's Peabody subsidiary - accounting for half of the company's capacity. Peabody's profits for the nine months, including a first Australian contribution, fell 32 per cent to Pounds 73m. Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, the group's US arm, said the United Mine Workers of America had agreed to resume negotiations with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association in Washington DC. Hanson benefited from the strength of the dollar against sterling. It was Dollars 1.4935 at the end of June compared with Dollars 1.8920 in the previous year. This is understood to have almost made up the shortfall in profits from the Peabody strike. More than half of the group's profits are generated by Hanson Industries. The results include nine months' contribution from Beazer, the building and aggregates company bought in late 1991. In the three months to June 30, Hanson's profits before exceptionals fell from Pounds 276m to Pounds 266m. Earnings per share were 3.8p (7.2p) and the quarterly dividend is 2.85p. Lex, Page 18</p>

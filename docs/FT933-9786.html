			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / International Company News: BZ investment vehicle targets gas industry THE maverick BZ banking group of Zurich has launched a SFr500m (Dollars 330m) investment company, Gas Vision, to build up an influential portfolio of shares in industrial gas companies. Gas Vision made a dramatic start yesterday, paying SFr330m for an 11.8 per cent voting stake in Aga, making it the second-largest shareholder in the Swedish industrial gas group. Separately, Sydkraft, the Swedish power concern, said it was selling its entire shareholding in Aga in a move which would net some SKr1.6bn (Dollars 199m) at current market prices. Sydkraft bought its stake in December 1988 and said it had always intended to sell the holding within three to five years. Like BZ's two existing operations, BK Vision and Pharma Vision, the new investment company can be expected actively to assert its rights as a shareholder. 'We want to be a major shareholder of very few companies and we hope to add value by asking questions and maybe even making suggestions,' said Mr Martin Ebner, BZ president. He said Gas Vision would not only take stakes in the big international gases groups, such as BOC of the UK and L'Air Liquide of France, but would approach small family-owned companies with a view to floating them or exchanging their shares for Gas Vision shares. BK Vision, which has a portfolio of shares of financial companies, attracted attention in June by initiating a court challenge to a Union Bank of Switzerland decision that could be used to waive shareholder rights. BK is the largest single shareholder in UBS, with a 15 per cent stake. Gas Vision represents a significant diversification for the BZ group, which has previously concentrated its research and dealing expertise exclusively on Swiss equities. Mr Ebner said Mr Jacques Imler, president of Carba, the Swiss gases company, would bring inside industry knowledge to Gas Vision.</p>

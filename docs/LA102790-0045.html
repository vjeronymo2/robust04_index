			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS 18TH SENATE DISTRICT;  </P> <P> HART CHALLENGER HAS RUN OUT OF CAMPAIGN CASH  </P> <P> Republican Carey Rogers is frustrated that her sluggish campaign to unseat  state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) has fallen far short of the cash  needed to capitalize on the growing voter dissatisfaction with incumbents.  </P> <P> "The surveys show that a woman running against a male incumbent has an  automatic 10% advantage," Rogers said.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Rogers, a security alarm saleswoman in Santa Barbara, her  campaign is broke. After nearly $11,000 in expenses, financial records show her  campaign had $130 in cash and $3,500 in debts as of Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Complicating her quest is the massive size of the 18th Senate District with  326,000 registered voters stretching from Woodland Hills in Los Angeles County  north to Santa Barbara County. Furthermore, Democrats hold a commanding edge in  the district, with 21,000 more voters than the Republicans.  </P> <P> Hart has decided to run a low-key campaign. "My opponent has not shown her face  in most parts of the district," Hart said. "We spend as much time and money as  we need to. We haven't had to spend much."  </P> <P> Also on the ballot is Libertarian Party candidate Jay C. Wood, an office  machine salesman in Fillmore who is making his second run against Hart.  </P></p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Khmer Rouge forces attack villages: Peace accord violation leaves 13 dead KHMER ROUGE guerrillas mortared central Cambodian villages yesterday after killing 13 civilians and sending 10,000 fleeing in the worst violation so far of the three-month peace accord, agencies report from Phnom Penh. The attack prompted envoys of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to call for the urgent stationing of United Nations soldiers in the disputed area, diplomats said. The five are Britain, France, the US, China and Russia. Separately, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said in Tokyo that Mr Yasushi Akashi, newly-appointed head of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, was suggesting that Japan send police to help restore peace there. The official added, however, that Japan would not be able to send police under proposed legislation that would allow it to send Japanese troops overseas for UN peacekeeping operations. Under the October peace accord between the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government and guerrillas who fought it for 13 years, the UN authority is to play an important role in keeping the peace and guiding the nation to elections next year. The attacks which violated the ceasefire took place in Kompong Thom province, 150km north of Phnom Penh. Cambodian Red Cross officials said they had registered 9,700 people displaced by the fighting in Kompong Thom since January 5. They reported at least 13 dead and 18 seriously wounded in the heaviest mortar attacks on 25 villages around the district capitals of Stoung and Kompong Svay from January 6 to 7. Whole villages were burned. Cambodian Red Cross trucks delivered 100 tonnes of rice, blankets, plastic sheeting for shelters and other emergency supplies. The new refugees brought to 180,000 the number of people displaced by the war inside Cambodia. Another 370,000 Cambodian war refugees live in camps in neighbouring Thailand. The Khmer Rouge apparently mounted the attacks to hasten deployment of UN peace-keepers to the area, diplomats said. Last week Khmer Rouge chief Khieu Samphan presented the UN with a list of eight areas where his group wanted peace-keeping troops deployed, they said. So far only a few hundred foreign soldiers forming the UN Advance Mission in Cambodia are in place, stationed in Phnom Penh, north-western Battambang province, neighbouring Siem Reap province and other guerrilla areas in the west. The troops now in place are not charged with peace-keeping duties.</p>

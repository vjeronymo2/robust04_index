They blame him for losing the war in  Abkhazia and the total inability to rule the country.    The leaders of these parties also added that Eduard  Shevardnadze should be divested of extraordinary powers  delegated to him by the republic's parliament, which make him  the sole ruler of the country and which, allegedly, hamper the  opposition in participating in the "state's creative processes."</p>

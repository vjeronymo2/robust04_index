			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Markets: Busy week for gilts Gilts traders thought Tuesday's one percentage point cut in UK base rates was very bad news for inflation. This is shown by the behaviour of the market for index-linked gilts, whose coupon and redemption value are linked to the retail price index. Traders will pay more for index-linked gilts if they think inflation is likely to increase. In doing so the price of such gilts increases and the yield falls. The graphs show the real yields to maturity (the annual income plus the capital gain to redemption, expressed as a percentage of the current price), assuming inflation rates of 5 or 10 per cent. The calculations are complicated, but the graph shows how yields fell as traders rushed to buy the issues.</p>

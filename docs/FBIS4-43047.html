			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christopher Rabe: "European Security Policy </F> Requires a Broad Platform"]    [Text] Bonn, 8 June 994 -- At the meeting of the NATO  foreign ministers, which starts in Istanbul today, Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel, with his counterparts, wants to draft a  comprehensive reaction to Moscow's wish for a special status in  its relationship with NATO. In an interview with HANDELSBLATT  and the WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPE, Kinkel stated that he and  his Russian counterpart Grachev held intensive discussions of  the speech Russian Defense Minister Grachev made to NATO. The  first issue -- Russia's important position resulting from a  special protocol in connection with NATO's offer of a  Partnership for Peace -- will be discussed in Istanbul.    The head of the Foreign Ministry clearly rejected all  Russian  ambitions to link a European security system with the CSCE and  the NATO Cooperation Council, and to accord NATO and its  partnership concept less significance. Kinkel stressed: "Our  answer is no. There will be no relations of superiority or  inferiority between the CSCE, the NATO Cooperation Council,  Partnership for Peace, and NATO." Moreover, Russia will not be  granted any formal rights of veto. "The Western European Union  [WEU] will decide independently whom it wants to accept. The  European Union will base its decision on the accession of new  countries on an economic and political analysis, and NATO will  naturally also make its decisions without granting Russia a  right of veto."    It is useful and expedient not to open up new gulfs but to  incorporate Russia in Europe's new security and economic  architecture. Thus, one can fully comply with Moscow's third  wish, which is to intensify the process of consultation.    Russia's stabilization is not only taking place on a  monetary  basis in the form of multilateral and bilateral loans but also  in many other ways through consultation. In this respect,  Kinkel mentioned the banking law, which is being established  with Western support, the creation of general legal structures,  regional consulting activities, and schemes for medium-sized  enterprises. At the same time he admitted that more funds are  bound to be wasted in Russia because of its "enormous size" than  in smaller countries, such as the Baltic states. "However,  could anyone expect the transition from the command to the  market economy to be smooth in a huge country like Russia,"  Kinkel asked.    Kinkel showed understanding for the mistrust with which  Moscow views the establishment of closer relations between the  Central and East European states and Western institutions.  Whereas the Visegrad states (Poland, Hungary, the Czech  Republic, and Slovakia) have already "entered the vestibule of  the European Union [EU], the WEU, and of NATO" because of  association agreements -- the so-called European agreements --  Russia is not likely to be granted access. For this reason, NATO  has offered Moscow a cooperation agreement. Kinkel expressed the  hope that it will be signed at the European summit in Corfu.  The foreign minister described the necessary security  architecture, in which states like Ukraine must also be  included, as a "policy designed to establish a general network."    NATO, which "was and still is a classical defense alliance,"  has received important new tasks in a changed world -- "to keep  and make peace." These new tasks should be the core of the  European security architecture. Kinkel stressed: "NATO must  help meet the need of the Central and East European reform  states for security." NATO continues to be the main element in  the transatlantic relationship.    According to Kinkel, there is a time- and a content-related  aspect to the timetable for the eastward expansion of the EU.  As far as the time-related aspect is concerned, he declined to  mention an exact date. However, the process will probably last  longer than the countries affected and the Germans hope, Kinkel  pointed out. As far as the content is concerned, the Federal  Government plans to involve the Visegrad states and the Baltic  republics to a much greater extent politically at this point  with a view to their full membership at a later date. Also, it  is important for these countries to do their homework. "They  must create legal structures and become economically more  attractive through self-help." Bonn wants to provide assistance  in this respect.    Kinkel is currently not enthusiastic about an enlargement  according to the model of "concentric circles," suggested by  Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer. In fact, he considers  developments in this direction possible at a later point, but he  would prefer an "organic growth" of Europe in the old  structures. Kinkel admitted, however, that the enlargement of  the EU by the East European states will pose considerable  problems. Yet one cannot tell the countries to which closer  cooperation has been offered for several years that there is no  longer a free room in the European home. "We must coordinate  this accession in an organic way with our partners. Germany  will not take unilateral action."    Kinkel believes that, when carrying out institutional  reforms, "the streamlining of procedures in the councils," the  representation in the troika --consisting of the country that  holds the presidency, its predecessor, and its successor -- and  the order of presidencies must be reconsidered. it will be very  difficult to settle these issues because the smaller countries  will rightly react in a sensitive manner. Their interests must  be taken into consideration. Germany in particular has always  done so.    The foreign minister also criticized the varying intensity  of  integration in the European Union. In the common foreign and  security policy, the Union has not yet reached the same broad  development standard as in the economy. Kinkel cited the policy  vis-a-vis the former Yugoslavia as an example. The EU is also  "lagging behind" in the elimination of national border controls  -- that is in the implementation of the Schengen Agreement.  Thus, for Bonn the third major task is the development of legal  and domestic policies as the third pillar of the European Union.  "During the German presidency, we want to focus primarily on the  fight against drug-related crime, money laundering, and the  control of extremist and terrorist groups from non-EU states."    Another major task will be the fight against illegal  immigration and crime involving the smuggling of refugees. In  addition, Bonn will make efforts to harmonize legislation  concerning violent riots -- with a racist background, for  example -- and to develop joint measures against nuclear crime.  The fourth major issue will be to create a Europe of the  citizens.    Particularly in the weeks before the elections to the  European Parliament, Kinkel has noticed "that people are not  happy about the fact that Europe adopts executive decisions  which have no legal basis." In fact, the Maastricht Treaty has  brought a few new laws. The democratic deficit that still exists  must be removed in the future. Kinkel wants to involve the  European Parliament as much as possible during his Presidency of  the European Council.    Kinkel expressed confidence about the upcoming referendums  on  EU membership in the countries of the European Free Trade  Association [EFTA]. "After all the efforts that have been made  in the four EFTA states, the population will probably not reject  membership. Can you imagine that Finland, which is now facing  difficulties because it has lost a large part of its market  because of the disappearance of the bipolar world, will not take  the opportunity of becoming a member of the EU? This is  inconceivable for me." Kinkel is also convinced that the  outcome of the referendum in Austria, which will take place as  early as on Sunday [12 June], will be positive.    Germany's role in foreign policy has so far been  characterized by reservedness. In view of the historical  background, this was the right course, Kinkel pointed out.  After reunification and the restoration of the country's  sovereignty, the world now sees Germany in a different way than  in the past. "The world wants us to step down from the  spectator stand and assume responsibility." Kinkel expressed  the hope that the "big administrative barrier" will be removed  by the Constitutional Court in the summer. In his view, it  should be possible in the future for German soldiers to  participate in UN missions outside the NATO area after a  parliamentary decision. However, Germany must never again pursue  a policy of national unilateral efforts. "If we have drawn a  lesson from history, it is the following: German interests must  naturally be safeguarded, but within the framework of an  integrated policy with the partners." Thus, Germany claims the  position of a permanent member of the UN Security Council.</p>

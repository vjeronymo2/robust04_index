			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 8 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben Berov  announced his proposals for cabinet changes in a telephone  interview for the national radio this morning. Tomorrow he will  hold consultations with the political forces and on Wednesday  [11 May] he will submit at parliament the cabinet's programme by  year's end and the proposals for structural and personnel  changes in the incumbent cabinet.    Prof. Berov said the changes will not affect the Ministries  of Defence, of the Interior and Agriculture. He will propose  that some of the branch committees be closed down, including the  Forestry Committee, whose functions will be taken over by the  Environment Ministry. The Power Engineering Committee (PEC)  will be transformed into a ministry to be headed by now PEC  Chairman Nikita Shervadshidze. The proposals for cabinet  changes also include a new trade minister. According to the  prime minister, a new deputy prime minister without a portfolio  should be named to replace Valentin Karabashev, who recently  resigned. A candidate for this office is economist Roumen  Getchev. All agencies, and particularly the Privatization  Agency, will continue to operate contrary to press reports.  Commenting on press allegations that Justice Minister Peter  Kornazhev will be replaced, Prime Minister Berov said that he  only declared his intention to move at parliament for revoking  the memorandum on the execution of death sentences, to which the  justice minister responded by threatening to resign in case the  MPs second the proposal.    According to Prof. Berov, the figures on the May 4 token  strike called by the Confederation of the Independent Trade  Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB, one of the two major labour  organizations in this country) were substantially exaggerated.  He further said that the future will show how many people  supported the strike and what ends it was after: social or  political, adding that all of KNSB's reasonable demands will be  met.</p>

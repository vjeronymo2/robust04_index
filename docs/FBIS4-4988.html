			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been learned that the F-15 fighter which  crashed after taking off from Kadena Air Base had been flying  eastward shortly before the crash. With Okinawa Highway and  Okinawa City located near the crash site, the crash could have  caused a terrible disaster. A resident who witnessed the crash  has indicated the flight route of the aircraft on a map. As  regards the accident, the Kadena Air Base Public Affairs Office  stated: "An investigation into the cause of the crash is under  way, and there is nothing to comment on at this moment."    Since the military aircraft crashed near residential areas,  Okinawans continued to take angry action on 5 April.    The Okinawa prefectural government takes the crash seriously  and sent Tatsuo Matayoshi, chief of the Public Affairs Office,  to Kadena Air Base on the morning of 5 April to express regret  to Jeffrey Cliver, commander of the 18th Wing, and to ask the  commander to conduct a through investigation into the crash.    On 4 April, the Okinawa City Assembly held an extraordinary  session; on the morning of 5 April, the Kadena Town Assembly and  the Chatan Town Assembly held extraordinary sessions to  unanimously adopt resolutions. In this manner, protests against  the crash are now spreading to cities and towns located near  Kadena Air Base.    On the morning of 5 April, labor and peace organizations  staged emergency rallies to protest the crash on the so-called  "hill where the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is seen" along the  runway of the air base.    Officials from the Okinawa Federation of the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party, the Okinawa Federation of the ruling  Social Democratic Party of Japan, and the Okinawa Federation of  the ruling Komeito have visited the Naha Defense Facilities  Administration Bureau to demand the removal of F-15 fighters, an  investigation into cause of the crash, and the prevention of a  recurrence of the crash.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela shaken by right-wing violence Political uncertainty caused by renewed violence prompted a heavy fall in Venezuela's stock market last month, making it the worst performer in the emerging markets table compiled by IFC, part of the World Bank. The 21.7 per cent fall in dollar terms in Caracas more than wiped out the 9.9 per cent gain achieved in the relative calm of August. Mr Federico Laffan, an analyst at Latin American Securities in London, says that the emergence of a right-wing group which has started a violent campaign against political figures accused of corruption has prompted investors to flee from the stock market. Higher interest rates linked to the introduction of new banking reserve requirements and the resulting tightening of liquidity also prompted the sell-off in equities. Overnight rates have gone as high as 700 per cent while yields on zero-coupon bonds have risen by 370 basis points to 35.3 per cent. The central bank has contributed to the high overnight rates in an effort to dampen domestic demand for dollars in the recent disturbances as well as to relieve the downward pressure on the bolivar. Although the Venezuelan stock market rebounded in the first week of October, what was initially seen as an assassination attempt on President Carlos Andres Perez earlier this week sent the market down again. Mr Laffan says that the market is unlikely to recover in the short term. The political situation remains difficult and the approach of municipal elections at the start of December makes it unlikely that a badly needed tax package will be passed by Congress. By contrast, the elimination of political instability helped Thailand to rise by 13.2 per cent in dollar terms in September. Foreign and local investors were heartened by the formation of a coalition government under Mr Chuan Leekpai, and daily turnover reached record levels of more than Bt20bn (Dollars 793m). Demand from foreign investors has caused the premium on some foreign-held shares over locally-held shares to widen to as much as 16 per cent, from around 5 per cent or even zero two months earlier. The Thai stock market has now entered a period of consolidation after its recent rally and daily turnover has dropped back to less than Bt10bn. But Mr David Bates at Asia Equity expects the market to remain strong, saying that its re-rating has only just begun.</p>

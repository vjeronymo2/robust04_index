			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOPRANO FAITH ESHAM IN LOCAL RECITAL DEBUT  </P> <P> By the time she ended her generous debut recital Monday night in Ambassador  Auditorium, Faith Esham was beginning to sound like the genuine operatic  personality she is.  </P> <P> But earlier, the singer from Kentucky, who has stage credits not only at both  companies of Lincoln Center but from important European centers as well, took a  long while to warm up. In the meantime, she may have mystified some of her  listeners.  </P> <P> Esham's soprano is an instrument of weight and flexibility, attractive sound if  not abundant coloration. Her beginnings as a mezzo may account for the richness  in the first octave, yet the freedom and beauty of her top notes are clearly  native to the voice, not add-ons.  </P> <P> Still, and despite the fact that Esham is a veteran operatic performer -- her  appearance in the Gold Medal series was connected to her winning the Naumburg  Competition in 1985 -- she is not an easily classifiable singer. Her ease at  singing Gilda in New York City Opera's "Rigoletto" in Orange County last week  does not necessarily limit her to a few roles.  </P> <P> Esham's recital, at which she was splendidly and sensitively assisted by  pianist Armen Guzelimian -- substituting on short notice for a sick colleague  -- indicated and underlined her clear versatility.  </P> <P> What was best came last. An expansive performer, Esham closed her program  proper with four heroic Rachmaninoff songs, delivered with a full, lush tone  and generosity of spirit.  </P> <P> Before that, she gave properly intimate, finely delineated performances of  Poulenc's late cycle, "La courte paille," a great work of deceptive simplicity.  A group of Wolf lieder offered outward charms, if no deep insights. But Esham's  well-projected response to the directness of four songs by Aaron Copland  resulted in excitement on both sides of the proscenium.  </P> <P> More muffled in sound and less connected in legato passages, Esham began the  program with Mozart's scena and aria, "Misera! dove son," and a group of five  Schubert lieder that she had arranged into a faux cycle. The songs survived,  but didn't need the help.  </P> <P> Two encores were given: "Les chemins de l'amour" by Poulenc and the spiritual,  "This Li'l Light of Mine."  </P></p>

Under a preliminary contract signed Monday, Arianespace will  launch three satellites in 2001, 2002 and 2005, the EUMETSAT  statement said.    The three Meteosat craft "will offer high performance  meteological coverage until at least 2012," the statement said.    The contracts for the three satellites will be negotiated  separately "to allow EUMETSAT to benefit from a very competitive  and attractive commercial situation," EUMETSAT director John  Morgan said.    EUMETSAT was set up in 1986 by 17 countries and provides  weather satellite services for Europe from its base at  Darmstadt-Eberstadt near Frankfurt.</p>

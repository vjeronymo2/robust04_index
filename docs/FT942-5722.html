			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Toyota to send UK engines to Turkey Toyota, the Japanese car maker, is to export engines from its UK plant at Deeside, Clwyd, to a new car assembly plant in Turkey, which will begin production in the autumn. The supply of engines to the car plant at Adapazari, 100 miles east of Istanbul, will mark the first time that Toyota has exported engines from the Pounds 140m UK plant. The Deeside engine facility began production in late 1992 and chiefly supplies engines to Toyota's Pounds 700m UK car assembly plant at Burnaston, near Derby. Production of the Corolla small family car at Toyotasa, Toyota's joint venture plant in Turkey, is due to start in September. The Turkish company is owned 40 per cent by Toyota, 10 per cent by Mitsui, the Japanese trading house, and 50 per cent by Sabanci, Turkey's second largest industrial group. Production is expected to total 2,000 in the final months this year rising to around 20,000 next year. Toyota said the plant's short-term prospects were uncertain, however, given the present sharp downturn in the Turkish new car market. Toyota's Turkish plant will have an eventual capacity to produce 100,000 cars a year with a significant share of the engines to be supplied from the Toyota plant in north Wales. The Deeside facility currently builds 1.6 litre petrol engines for Toyota's Burnaston car plant, and supplies components - blocks and crankshafts - to Toyota in Japan for 1.8 litre engines. The Deeside plant produced 29,000 engines in 1993, but this is expected to rise to around 70,000 this year. In the six months to the end of March it exported 45,000 cylinder blocks and crankshafts to Japan worth Pounds 2.5m. Toyota said the Burnaston car plant had reached a production level of 400 cars a day or 100,000 cars a year, the planned full capacity in the first stage of the project. Output of the Carina large family car in the whole of 1994 would total around 90,000 compared with production last year of 37,314. Around 75 per cent of production would be exported to other markets in Europe. Citroen, the French car maker, is investigating the possibility of participating in a joint venture in Malaysia. One report quoted a company official as saying that Citroen had put forward proposals to build diesel engines for Malaysian-made Proton cars, Kieran Cooke adds from Kuala Lumpur. Last month Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, visited Citroen's factories in France.</p>

As a rule, Russian statistics  are correlated on economic indicators not with some basic level,  but with the corresponding month or period of the previous year.  Given this approach, the scope of the recession is being sort of  "toned down", whereas the relative constancy of economic  indicators from month to month creates the illusion of  production being stabilized. In fact, however, this constancy  merely testifies to the stabilization of the rates of recession,  not the stabilization of output. This becomes obvious if the  most important economic indicators of recent years are compared  with the corresponding figures of 1990.    Although between 1990 and 1993 recession in all of Russia's  main spheres of production was somewhat less than in the other  CIS countries, it was rather significant on the whole: during  this period industrial output declined by more than two-fifths  and the sphere of services -- by one-third. Moreover, despite  the avalanche-like recession in 1991 and 1992, for the third  year running the reduction of the GDP and the volumes of  industrial output in Russia has been expressed in a two-digit  figure.    The slowing down of the rates of production decline,  however,  testifies, we believe, not so much to the signs of coming  stabilization as to the depletion of the "potential" of  recession as a result of the ongoing "shrinkage" of the initial  basis.    In other words, the reduction of the volumes of production  in  itself predetermines a slowing down of the rates of recession,  which by no means amounts to an indicator of its early  discontinuation with the subsequent change of the vectors of  movement.  <H6>  Forecasts-94 </H6>   The rates of recession will slow down, but the fall of  production will continue. This is conditioned by the steady  lowering of the share of gross investments in Russia's GDP.  According to preliminary estimates, in 1993 it comprised a mere  12-13%. The uncompensated removal of production  capacities is  acquiring a frontal character, that is to say, not only obsolete  capacities are being removed, but even the possibilities are  being undermined for the future growth of production in sectors  which determine the economy's structure the greatest.    This structure in itself is becoming increasingly bulky and  inert to the processes of renewal. From 1991 to 1993 the  specific share of the fuel and energy sector increased from 11.3  to 25.4% and that of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy  -- from  11.2 to 18.6%, whereas the specific position of machine  building ad metal working lowered from 25 to 20.5% and  that of  the light and food industry -- from 32.2 to 17.7%.  Moreover,  the mechanism of sanitizing enterprises and carrying out  bankruptcies, which is one of the most effective means of  improving the economy, has still not been put in operation.    On the other hand, the possibilities of halting the decline  of investment activities in 1994 will be rigidly restricted due  to the failure of the budgetary policy in 1993. A hole in the  budget to the tune of five trillion rubles which "unexpectedly"  appeared in the fourth quarter of 1993 determines the further  reduction of budgetary investments (estimated in permanent  prices) until at least the middle of 1994. However, if the high  rates of inflation have been kept alive, the uncentralized  investments of enterprises and private structure will continue  to remain at a low level. As a result, in annual terms gross  investments will diminish by another 10% in 1994.    It is highly probable that in 1994 the list of  recession-gripped production units will increase in virtue of a  decline in demand and its reorientation to similar but more  competitive imported products. This primarily concerns the  output of cars and color TV sets, the production of which  somewhat increased in 1993. A similar situation already existed  with the production of VCRs whose production increased by  40%  in 1992 but fell by 38% in 1993. As a result, the process  of  redirecting defense industry enterprises to expanding the  production of sophisticated consumer goods may scale down,  whereas conversion as a whole in the next few years will not be  able to become one of the sources for boosting industrial output.    True, some growth in housing construction (up by 5%)  makes  it possible to hope that the volumes of the production of  several building materials (bricks, glass, linoleum,  bathroom-and-lavatory equipment) will either be preserved or  register a very insignificant decline. On the whole, industrial  output may lower by about 10-12% in 1994.    The dynamics of agricultural production will be affected by  the reduction in 1993 of the areas under winter crops which  comprised roughly 20% in comparison with the previous  year. All  other conditions being equal, this may entail a fall of grain  production in 1994 within the limits of 6-8%. In  cattle-breeding a stabilization of production may be expected in  1994 in connection with a rise in the productivity of  agricultural animals. Much, however, will depend on the level of  grain production. If its lowering reaches 10%, it will  hardly  be possible to even hope for the maintaining of 1993 volumes.    The lowering in the main sphere of material production may  have the result that in 1994 the GDP will be reduced by  7-9%  whereas inflation will hardly be lowered to the promised  3-5%  by the close of the year.    In the transitional-type economy the monetary means of  management may temporarily dampen but not vanquish  inflation. However paradoxical, but the task of combating  inflation with purely credit-monetary means is doomed to produce  face-lifting and short-lived effect. The point is that in a  monopolized economy the monetarist policy in itself initiates  stagflationist phenomena. Thus, the monopoly positions of  enterprises easily make it possible to translate the increase of  the interest rate into a growth of prices.    Enterprises respond to the compression of the money mass  primarily with reducing the volumes of output, not by lowering  prices. Moreover, the steadily lowering supply is becoming one  of the permanent factors keeping the prices up. As a result,  inflation acquires an increasingly inert character inasmuch as  all the economic agents learn to indexate prices (overtly or  covertly). All of this necessitates taking a rather sceptical  look at the government's promises to lower the rates of  inflation to 3% a month by December 1994.    In principle it is possible only to bring it down  temporarily  to this level. But this does not mean at all that already in the  next month inflation will not again jump to a two-digit figure  or that there will be no avalanche-like stoppage of production.  In other words, pinning hopes exclusively or mainly on the  credit-monetary levers of regulation given the weakness of  structural-institutional changes may have the result that  inflation will acquire a "jumping" character.    And it is as yet far from obvious which of the evils is the  greatest for the economy: the high but slowly lowering rates of  inflation or the rates of inflation which are quickly changing  in the course of a short period of time. Judging by the  government's statement on the economic policy in late 1993 and  in 1994, the latter variant is highly probable in the year that  has just begun.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia and CIS: Annual Rates of Reducing the GDP, Industrial and Agricultu-|  |ral Production in 1990-1993 (In Average Annual Prices of 1993, in %)       |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year              |Russia            |Remaining CIS Cou-|CIS As a Whole    |  |                  |                  |ntries            |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |GDP                                                                        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991              |-18.2             |-20.0             |-19.0             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992              |-20.6             |-21.0             |-20.0             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993              |-12.4             |-16.0             |-13.5             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industrial Production                                                      |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991              |-18.2             |-20.0             |-19.0             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992              |-20.0             |-21.0             |-20.5             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993*             |-16.3             |-18.0             |-17.0             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agricultural Production                                                    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991              |-9.4              |-12.0             |-10.5             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992              |-20.5             |-21.0             |-20.7             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993*             |-1.1              |-9.0              |-4.7              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |These data have been calculated by SovEcon analyst Boris Bolotin.          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |* Preliminary data                                                         |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

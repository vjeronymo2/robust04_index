			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hana Qim: "The Primaries Have Already Started"] </F>   [Text] Two worn out phrases from the days of the Likud's  war of the camps came back from oblivion last week. Remember  how ministers and Knesset members [MK] used to react when asked  for their camp affiliation? "There are no camps in Likud," they  would say as the war of the camps raged and deals between camps  flourished. "What camp I am in? The Likud camp." Now, that  the political negotiations are back in the headlines, MK Eli  Dayan uttered the two sentences that will from now on describe  the situation of the Labor Party: "I have no group in Labor,"  he said. "I belong to the Labor Party group."    There are no camps in Labor, there are only "groups" or  "ideological circles." Here is yet another example of the  process of privatization the ruling party is undergoing. The  process does not aim at promoting some ideology or supporting  the peace process. It aims at pushing the person or persons  heading the circle into a realistic slot on the next Knesset  list:    The Ma'alot circle of MK Rafi Edri; the New Direction circle  of Minister Shim'on Shetrit (who recently established a "group"  named The Jerusalem Forum); Ra'anan Kohen's Re'ut circle; the  Unification of Ranks circle of Shlomo Buhbut; Rafi Elul's social  lobby group; Mikha Goldman's Next Generation circle; the  Lamerhav circle of Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino, members of which  are 'Imanu'el Zismann and other veteran hawks; the Alternative  circle of Ofir Pinhas who appeals to the party's young members;  The Forum for Political and Social Thinking of Shlomo Ben-'Ami  and Avigdor Ben-Gal who want to be MK's (if not ministers) in  the next Knesset; the Hofit circle of Ori Or and the hawks gang;  The Histadrut Forum of Pini Shumer, a member of the Rabin camp;  the newly founded circle of Minister Moshe Shahal, which last  week convened at the Oil Institute in Tel Aviv; and Minister  Mikha Harish's Leshiluv Circle which is currently inactive, but  there is reason to believe that it will soon be revived under  this or other name. And there are the doves' Kefar Hayaroq and  Mashov circles; Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer is expected to  establish his own circle soon; and Minister Efrayim Sne already  has a "group" and a "circle" is expected to be founded soon.    "You can no longer see the party from the circles and  groups," MK Eli Dayan said grumpily. "I heard there are MK's  who belong to several ideological circles and groups," he said.  Dayan himself is indeed a living example for this: He is  associated with Rafi Edri's circle, with Shim'on Shetrit's  circle, the new Shlomo Buhbut circle, and may soon set up his  own circle.    After Hayim Ramon quit the party, and after it transpired  that Gershon Gelman [head of the Labor list of the Tel Aviv  labor council who signed a local coalition agreement with Likud]  can disregard Yitzhaq Rabin's directives, early preparations for  the primaries for the Labor list for the next Knesset elections  have begun. In an interview with Lili Galili and Amnon  Abramovich for HA'ARETZ, Shim'on Peres made very frustrated  comments about this. Nevertheless, Peres -- with some of his men  behind several of the new circles -- also understands that this  phenomena taking place because of the need to replace the  crumbling organizational infrastructure of Labor.    In a closed meeting with members of his camp, Prime  Minister Rabin described the situation thus: The main problem  Labor is facing today is the fact that Histadrut employees, most  of whom are party members, are about to be laid off and become  unemployed. "Some 1,500 of our men are facing an economic,  existential problem," he said. What is he going to do about the  unemployed party activists? "Believe me," Rabin went on, "when  I was defense minister I fired 3,000 people." In other words,  Rabin will not find new jobs for them because Rabin, just like  Ramon, no longer believes in the outdated organizational  structure of the Labor Party. It can be assumed that the  activists without income will join some of the groups and  circles only to have something to do, and perhaps find a source  of income.    "None of the groups is ideological and none of the groups is  serious," said Minister 'Uzi Bar'am, who today cooperates with  the Mashov and Kefar Hayaroq circles. "People want to prove  they exist because the primaries' race has begun. Hayim Ramon  is everybody's role model. Because he succeeded, they are  trying to show the public what they are worth. All the power  structures of Labor in the local labor councils and the  Histadrut Executive Committee are falling apart. In this  atmosphere of uncertainty, people are beginning to think about  their personal future. I have even heard that some of the MK's  and ministers have begun collecting funds for the primaries."    It is to be assumed that in the coming year the registrar of  non- profit associations will be busy registering associations  established for noble causes which will begin collecting funds  from businessmen for the next Knesset race. One of those  competing for the next Knesset last week said that he had  contacted several businessmen asking for their contribution.  The businessmen asked him whether he was in any way connected  to Hayim Ramon because, they said, they have already invested in  Ramon.    The next Knesset elections will take place in two years'  time, but already now, some 18 months before the party primaries  are held, tension could be easily felt. Minister Moshe Shahal  -- one of the first Laborites to speak about recognizing the  Palestinians and establishing a Palestinian state, even before  Yosi Beilin -- today speaks about the need to "return to the  center of the political map." That is to say that the  primaries might not only have an impact on the frequency of  appearances by politicians on TV talks shows, but also on the  political process.</p>

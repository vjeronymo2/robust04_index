			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SELF PROTECTION;  </P> <P> PREPARING YOURSELF FOR SURPRISE;  </P> <P> WOMEN WITH GUNS;  </P> <P> FEAR OF FIREARMS CAN BE OVERRIDDEN BY THE FEAR OF AN ASSAILANT  </P> <P> Be not afraid of any man.  </P> <P>  Not matter what his size;  </P> <P>  When danger threatens, call on me  </P> <P>  And I will equalize.  </P> <P>  -- 19th-Century motto, Winchester Rifle Co.  </P> <P> Mary Ann Escandon steps up to the starting line, her three-inch heels sinking  into sandy desert soil, a purse slung jauntily over one shoulder, eyes  invisible behind black-tinted sunglasses.  </P> <P> She considers the enemies before her: targets painted to resemble such would-be  attackers as a burly, middle-aged white man, a skinhead with a Mohawk and a  swastika tattoo, and a bare-chested black man.  </P> <P> At the signal, she reaches into a secret compartment of the purse and pulls out  a snub-nosed, .38-caliber revolver. The five-foot, 100-pound Escandon rushes  toward the targets, a flash of fire exploding from the revolver muzzle with  each pull of the trigger.  </P> <P> The bullets sing as they pierce the targets, the sound echoing through the  desert valleys of San Bernardino National Forest, as Escandon strikes the last  of the assailants square in the chest. "All shots are good," an instructor  announces, and Escandon returns to a car where she packs the revolver and  ammunition in a shiny black Lancome makeup bag with a zipper top.  </P> <P> Ten years ago, Escandon described herself as "totally anti-handgun." But with  all the crime these days -- the FBI reports that a forcible rape occurs every  six minutes in this country -- Escandon says she must learn to defend herself  in ways she never imagined.  </P> <P> For instance, she recently found herself spending a chilly Saturday in a remote  public shooting area, participating in a firearms class for women that  rehearses real-life scenarios, such as having to draw from a purse while  wearing high heels. Another scenario involves rolling out of bed and using both  a pistol and a shotgun to mow down intruders.  </P> <P> The rehearsals make Escandon feel more comfortable about using the revolver she  keeps in a drawer of her nightstand.  </P> <P> "I feel so much safer," said Escandon, a Costa Mesa resident whose husband is  often away on business trips. "I feel secure knowing that I have it. I pray I  never have to use it."  </P> <P> Mace, stun-guns, personal alarms, martial-arts training, pistols, even shotguns  -- these are some of the self-defense tactics that women are turning to because  they don't feel safe anymore, according to Cathy Tolley, who organized the  firearms class for women.  </P> <P> Tolley, a registered nurse, is a firearms instructor certified by the National  Rifle Assn. She has informally conducted several classes for women in the last  year, recruiting participants from the standard firearms courses she and her  boyfriend teach.  </P> <P> The one-day class for women included a morning of firearms training in the  living room of Tolley's Anaheim home and an afternoon of shooting in the  desert. Tolley said she designed the all-female shooting class because for many  women, learning to handle firearms "is like going into the men's locker room."  </P> <P> The class also incorporated other self-defense strategies, including the proper  response to wolf whistles ("I would appreciate it if you would keep your  comments to yourself") and how to elude intruders in your own home ("Look for  places to hide, or where your opponent might hide").  </P> <P> But even Tolley, who has eight years of martial-arts training and arms strong  enough to pump a shotgun effortlessly, says the only way she could overpower a  male attacker would be with a firearm.  </P> <P> "A firearm is the ultimate equalizer," Tolley told the class. "No matter how  big the man is, how many drugs he's on, you'll be able to defend yourself. I  believe if all those men knew we were . . . carrying a pistol in our purses,  they'd think twice about attacking."  </P> <P> None of the seven women in the class have had to use a gun against an attacker.  In fact, none said she had turned to firearms training as a result of being  assaulted. Rather, they perceive through news reports that women are  increasingly on the receiving end of violent crimes and that those who assault  women spend little, if any, time in jail.  </P> <P> "No place is safe," said Deborah Benjamin of Anaheim, who keeps a .357-caliber  pistol in her bedroom. "There's wackos everywhere you go. Those creeps know  they can get away with it."  </P> <P> One of Escandon's friends was recently assaulted in the parking lot of a  department store by a crowbar-wielding robber. "A crowbar," she said. "Can you  believe it?"  </P> <P> Amy Clover, a 19-year-old Fullerton College student, said she resents the way  men often size her up.  </P> <P> "I worry not about date rape but about rape, period," Clover said. "The way  some people look at me . . . I can tell what they're thinking. I know what's on  their minds."  </P> <P> Until September, Clover said she had never fired a gun. It was the controversy  surrounding the state Legislature's ban on assault rifles that motivated her to  seek firearms training.  </P> <P> "I've always been paranoid of guns, but once I went to a class it was fun,"  Clover said. "I don't have a gun and I don't plan on getting one right now. I  just wanted to know how to use one."  </P> <P> Lori Jones had done a little shooting with her father and brothers when she was  a child, but when her husband mentioned this year that he wanted to buy a gun  to keep in the house, "I was scared to death."  </P> <P> However, she agreed to take a firearms class and discovered that firing a gun  could be pleasurable.  </P> <P> "I really surprised myself about how much I enjoyed it, particularly the  competitive aspect," said Jones, 30, of Long Beach. "I go to the shooting range  at least once a week. It's a great release of stress."  </P> <P> Jones also found it intoxicating to shoot more powerful pistols such as .38- or  .45-caliber weapons instead of the .22-caliber guns often recommended for  women.  </P> <P> "No one had ever encouraged me to try a more powerful gun," Jones said. "After  the first time I shot a .45, I thought: 'That's amazing. I'm a woman, and I can  handle this.' "  </P> <P> It is legal to keep firearms in the home or a place of business, and last year  28,071 firearms were legally purchased in Orange County, up from 26,823 in  1987, according to the state Department of Justice. Since the state requires  only a one-time notification of a firearms sale, there is no way to tell how  many Orange County residents overall own guns or how many firearms have been  purchased illegally, said Margaret Bourff of the Department of Justice.  </P> <P> Carrying a concealed weapon, however, is against state law unless the gun owner  has a permit. Such permits are rarely issued, except to some public officials  or individuals who demonstrate the need for a concealed firearm. In Orange  County, there were only 225 concealed weapons permits issued in 1988, according  to state figures. The year before, only 10 of the 257 permits issued went to  women.  </P> <P> Shooting someone with a concealed weapon is a felony, and local law enforcement  agencies frown upon teaching people how to do this.  </P> <P> "We can't condone any type of instruction for anything that's against the law,"  said Lt. Richard J. Olson, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's  Department.  </P> <P> Tolley is careful to advise her students of the implications of shooting with a  concealed weapon, including the likelihood of arrest and the possibility of  going to prison. But in Tolley's opinion, "it's better to be judged by 12 than  carried by six."  </P> <P> "I'd take my chances," Escandon said. As for the idea that an attacker will be  able to take her gun away, Escandon said, "I'm not going to let anybody get  that close to me."  </P> <P> Although the women are staunch opponents of gun control, including the ban on  assault rifles, they have been reluctant to disclose their use of guns to  friends and family.  </P> <P> Escandon said that some members of her family still don't know that she started  shooting about six months ago and now owns a gun.  </P> <P> "The attitude of people when they learn you have a gun . . . it's like all of a  sudden I'm this vile person because I have a gun," she said.  </P> <P> Jones said she took her co-workers by surprise when she mentioned she likes to  shoot. "It's been a more positive response than I expected," she said. "You  just have to get people to see that you're buying it for self-protection, that  you're trained and know what you're doing."  </P> <P> Still, the question of killing another living thing, be it a deer, a dove or an  attacker, can be a troubling one for women.  </P> <P> "You don't shoot people to injure them," Tolley told the class. "If you didn't  think it was a killing situation -- kill or be killed -- then you'd better not  shoot somebody."  </P> <P> Toni Bauer, a Garden Grove mother of two, said she has considered whether she  is capable of shooting another person.  </P> <P> "I have no doubt that if someone threatened my children, I could do it," Bauer  said. "But if was just me . . . I don't know."  </P></p>

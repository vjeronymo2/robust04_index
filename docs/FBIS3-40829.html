			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ridha Lahmar: "GATT: What Effects on Tunisia?"] </F>   [Text] Is GATT a genuinely free choice or a "compulsory  choice" for our country? Will it provide us with easier access  to export markets and advanced technology? Will it promote  job-creating foreign investments and partnership projects in  Tunisia? In a word, will Tunisia's accession to GATT and the  concluding negotiations for a final signing of GATT by the big  powers as it was written serve our country's interests and  enable us to achieve the goals of the Eighth Development Plan?    Is there free choice when 117 countries out of 170 have  signed and the international financial community makes accession  to GATT a condition for receiving its development assistance?  With those facts as our background, how should we proceed in  order to ensure that our accession will have the maximum  positive fallout on our economy and our society? It all depends  on our ability to ensure the competitiveness of our firms and  reform the structures of our economy.  <H5>  Dangers, Challenges of GATT </H5>   Tunisia acceded to GATT in July 1990. It is therefore bound  by the obligations set forth in that agreement and enjoys the  benefits it provides. But certain domestic changes and  conditions are essential if Tunisia is to benefit from the  agreement. As a signatory country to GATT, our country has  access to a tremendous data bank concerning world trade:  information on quantities, prices, and the quality of all  products and all destinations make it possible to better direct  the efforts of our exporters and manufacturers so as to produce  better and sell better. This makes it a powerful means of  diversifying our exports in an environment of nontariff barriers  and of customs obstacles that are easier to get around. Also,  belonging to GATT strengthens Tunisia in its disagreements with  the big powers, since it means that Tunisia can have recourse to  often effective arbitration in which it will be able to put  forward the interests of its firms and entire sections of its  economy.  <H5>  GATT and Our Agriculture </H5>   The GATT agreements call for a 21-percent reduction in  direct  and indirect agricultural subsidies over a six-year period. That  will be followed by a reduction in the volume of subsidized  sales of meat, milk, and cereals (all staple products essential  for feeding the population). The world price of wheat, which is  heavily subsidized in the United States, is currently $125 per  metric ton, whereas the price of Tunisian hard wheat is 24  dinars per quintal, or twice as much. Some people have said that  Tunisian cereal production is too expensive for reasons having  to do with productivity, whereas U.S. agriculture, although  highly mechanized and productive, is heavily subsidized. But why  deprive the Tunisian consumer of milk and meat from the EEC,  whose surpluses benefit from particularly large subsidies: who  can compete with meat from the EEC that costs from 12 to 15  French francs per kilogram net, CIF [cost, freight, and  insurance] Tunis?    The fact is that such competition with Tunisian agriculture  is unfair. The danger of GATT, then, is that it will lead to a  short-term rise in the cost of living because it will reduce  subsidies at the source of our imports, and our own production  cannot meet our domestic demand. On the other hand, our exports  will enjoy improved access to foreign markets: sales of olive  oil, citrus fruit, and so on will increase in volume and value,  since the similar European products with which they compete will  no longer be subsidized. That is the framework for our country's  efforts to intensify the irrigated production of fruits and  vegetables, modernize cereal growing, and develop our fishing  and stockraising potential to increase production and the  profitability of farming in order to feed a steadily growing and  ever-more demanding population and improve the food trade  balance. Our agriculture must modernize its structures and  increase its ability to withstand foreign competition through an  increase in added value. The state has done a great deal to  improve the infrastructure, and private operators must assume  their responsibilities and take advantage of the state's  incentives.  <H5>  Our Industry and GATT </H5>   The gradual disappearance of the MFA [Multifiber Agreement],  which provided the rich countries with artificial protection  from the commercial aggressiveness of textiles from the Third  World, will open up the markets in those countries to us. They  are big consumers of all kinds of clothing. But production costs  in our country are too high for us to compete with the four  "dragons" of Southeast Asia (where the hourly cost of manpower  is $2.60, compared to $12 in Tunisia).    Provided that our firms are able to grow and restructure  rapidly, modernize their equipment, and achieve more integrated  production, our salvation lies is specializing in the upscale  end of the market through the use of more capable and skilled  manpower. We find, however, that our industrial firms continue  to be small, family-scale enterprises with financial resources  and especially capital funds that are limited by the refusal to  open up their family capital to the public and other investors,  the reason being their fear of losing majority control on the  boards of directors.    We have few PME [small and medium-size businesses] and no  Tunisian multinationals, but what we do have mostly is  microbusinesses lacking the resources to stand up to the big  international financial groups. It is true that they have  management flexibility, but that is not enough to ensure  competitiveness.  <H5>  GATT and Services </H5>   It is true that we have great potential in the field of  services: tourism, engineering, commercial companies,  advertising firms, banks, insurance, and so on. But we must  restructure our firms so that they will have the size,  managerial staff, and "sales strength" of the big firms as well  as the necessary management and marketing. Our building and  public works industry, which lost 50 percent of its potential in  1986, must modernize in order to export.    There are not several ways to go about it: the only  solutions  are partnerships and a strengthening of capital. Otherwise, we  are in danger of being invaded by large financial groups that  will set up local branches and conquer a good share of the  market. Our company heads must strengthen their potential for  competing locally and for exporting their activities: they need  to look around elsewhere and see what they can do.  <H5>  Safeguarding Our Specific Culture </H5>   In the face of the audiovisual multinationals--the Hollywood  giants that turn out films and fiction thrillers at an  industrial pace and extol sex and violence, we are in danger of  being irrevocably invaded and seeing our children's education  spoiled by the Western media, which have "proven themselves" in  the negative sense of that expression. We must safeguard our  cultural and artistic heritage, which is unique and finds its  source in our ancestral values. We must avoid the artistic and  cultural veneer of the civilization represented by Coca-Cola,  McDonald's, and rock and roll, which has led the youth of New  York's neighborhoods and of the Paris suburbs to the spiral of  delinquency.</p>

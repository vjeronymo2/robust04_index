			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Bradstock falls 7% in tough trading A CONTRACTION in the London reinsurance market and the costs of expansion depressed Bradstock Group in the year to September 30. The insurance broker reported a 7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 8m to Pounds 7.43m. Although earnings per share fell to 8.5p (8.9p), the total dividend is increased to 5.1p (4.75p) via a final of 3.65p. Turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 21.9m), but expenses rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 17.5m). Turnover from broking of direct business was 25 per cent up at Pounds 12.8m, but reinsurance broking revenue fell to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 11.7m), despite underlying growth in original currencies. Investment income fell to Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 3.58m). Mr Robin Gibson, chief executive, said that the departure of a number of Lloyd's syndicates and companies from the London market had increased competition among brokers. 'Every time a reinsurance underwriter goes, someone loses a bit of his business.' Growth in direct business had been fuelled by a strong performance by the group's insolvency business. This specialised in finding insurance for insolvent companies when they were taken over by liquidators. However, costs arising from a new Southend office, devoted to this area, as well as a recent head office move and new premises for a bloodstock broking business had cut into profits. Mr Gibson said that on an underlying basis expenses had grown at a rate of 9 per cent.</p>

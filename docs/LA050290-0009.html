			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CABBIE DRESS CODE  </P> <P> In response to "Taxicab Driver Appearance Guidelines," Metro, April 19:  </P> <P> The Times is quite right, the lot of the city's taxi drivers is indeed tough.  The new dress code requirement, however, will make it brighter by giving the  courteous, well-dressed cabbie renewed self-respect, gratitude from the  taxi-riding public and by all indications higher gratuities.  </P> <P> NATHAN L. CHROMAN  </P> <P> President, Transportation Commission  </P> <P> City of Los Angeles  </P></p>

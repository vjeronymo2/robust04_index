			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: An early bath for some patchy performers - Farewell to the first-round losers Not all their spirits were blithe, but eight teams were saying farewell to the World Cup yesterday. Last night's matches determined whether Nigeria, Bulgaria or Russia would be the last to go, but here is a valediction to the seven who know there is no tomorrow. South Korea proved again that there is something about the World Cup and teams from that tense and divided peninsula. They play their best against the best. In 1966, the North, about whom nothing was known, put three fast goals past Eusebio's Portugal before succumbing. This year, the South, not much more of an open book, nearly pulled the trick in reverse against mighty Germany and had the brass nerve to score twice in the last six minutes to draw Spain. They were as fit as any team here and faster than most. They made chances but were wasteful, though four goals in three games is pretty close to the average. Soccer is a coming sport in Asia, but only a small handful of its stars play outside Korea. Japan, with a professional league now flourishing, and South Korea are favourites to stage the 2002 World Cup. Greece deserve a charitable veil drawn over their performance. Considered in advance the weakest team to come to America, they left with that opinion set in concrete. The easiest explanation is that all their players only play in Greek leagues, not Europe's strongest, and several are quite ancient. But politics also come into it. This is appropriate for the historical home of democracy but less for soccer. Several players complained that their training was constantly interrupted by the need to make public and political appearances with local Greek communities. Being drawn to play Bulgaria was also not helpful; had Turkey qualified, it would have been worse. Of Bolivia, participating after an interval of 44 years, little can be said, beyond noting that they scored a goal (against Spain) for the first time in World Cup history. There was some pretty football on display, especially against Germany, but more is needed if 44 more years are not to elapse. Colombia have not enjoyed a great fortnight. Relations with the US are tense over the alleged narcotics connections of the new president. Far worse, the soccer team - Pele's pick to win it all, a team laden with talent, toughened by the experience of failure in Italy four years ago and no longer needing the erratic talents of Rene Higuita in goal - blew it. The irony is that for long periods in their first match against Romania, Colombia lived up to their advance billing. They played dazzling attacking football and should have won comfortably. Part of the problem is that they played as if they knew that, too. Cameroon's luck ran out in the US. All the familiar characteristics were there: opportunistic attacking, rough-edged defending, post-goal wiggles, rows over money. Though they were no longer an unknown quantity, they still came close to repeating an opening-match ambush, this time against Sweden. But once that match had ended in a draw the Indomitable Lions were in trouble. They finished their group games as they did in Italy: thrashed by a Russian team which had lost their first two games. Roger Milla became the oldest goal scorer in the World Cup finals, serving only to emphasise that this team are over the hill. Morocco have been a contradiction: no points, two goals, beaten by the Saudis, yet one of the revelations of this World Cup. They ran the Belgians ragged, hitting the bar twice but were beaten by one goalkeeping error. Against the surprising Saudis, the Moroccans again dazzled, again failed to turn attack into scores, again lost by one goal. They attacked with flair for spells against the Dutch and again lost by one goal. The gap between the two Arab teams and the Belgians and Dutch in Group F was tiny. Later rounds may confirm that the Moroccans shone partly because the Lowland defences are not very good, but they can draw comfort from the fact that they were able to play two highly-fancied, highly-experienced and highly-paid western European teams as equals. Norway may moan that they are unlucky to be going home after picking up four points. They got no more than they deserved. They were dull and ineffective. For such a small nation with so little soccer tradition they have done well, but the Irish and Italians exposed their limitations. Indeed, part of Norway's problem, particularly against Ireland, was that they seemed constricted by worries. For England fans gripped by Venables fever, it is worth noting that Norway created fewer goal chances against Italy and Ireland combined than against the English in May.</p>

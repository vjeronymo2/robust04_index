			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Letter: UK green card cover can hold its own with European rivals Sir, The letter from our customer, Mr Michael Russell (Letters, April 11), took us to task over green card cover. In fact the Eagle Star policy he holds gives automatic minimum cover in EC countries and since July 1990 this has been extended to give full UK equivalence of cover without additional charge for up to 92 days a year, provided the policyholder advises us beforehand. I do not, as Mr Russell suggests, complain about competition from French companies. However, the freedom of access that European companies enjoy in the open UK markets contrasts starkly with the difficulties that British insurers face in many European markets. As to the quality of competition, if Mr Russell compares the cover and price of his comprehensive, protected bonus Motorstar policy with anything available on the French market, he might think more favourably of UK insurers. Michael A. Butt, chairman and chief executive, Eagle Star, St Mary Axe, London EC3</p>

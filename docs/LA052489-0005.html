			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STILL SOUND ADVICE  </P> <P> In the Bush Administration's most definitive Middle East policy statement so  far, Secretary of State James A. Baker III has called on Israel and the  Palestinians to change the status quo and move toward political accommodation  as a prelude to eventually making peace. On a policy level Baker for the most  part was simply restating what successive U.S. administrations have been saying  for more than 20 years. The difference came in his tone. Speaking before the  American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobbying group that  has had considerable influence on Congress, Baker spoke plainly, almost  bluntly, about the principles the United States supports as part of the peace  process.  </P> <P> To Israel, Baker said the time has come to abandon the unrealistic vision of a  Greater Israel that would incorporate the West Bank and Gaza Strip with their  more than 1.7 million Palestinians. Israel instead must face the probability  that one day it will have to trade land for peace. Given that eventuality  Israeli settlement activity should be halted, and such accommodating steps as  reopening West Bank schools should be taken. The land-for-peace idea, though  anathema to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is, of course, a restatement not only  of U.S. policy but also the Israeli Labor Party's position.  </P> <P> To Palestinians, Baker said the Palestine Liberation Organization should amend  its charter to delete the vicious call for Israel's elimination. He urged  Palestinians at the same time to show that they are serious in their diplomacy,  the clear implication being that Washington so far has not perceived that to be  the case. Violence, he said, will not work. Finally -- and as always, a key  point -- "no one is going to deliver Israel for you." The achievement of peace,  security and Palestinian political rights won't come about through imposition  by outsiders, but only as a result of compromises, concessions, good faith,  direct negotiations.  </P> <P> The Baker speech contained no new ideas. But it was a timely and necessary  reaffirmation of basic policy principles, expressed in a context that makes  clear that the Bush Administration regards the Israel-Palestinian status quo as  unacceptable and increasingly damaging. Washington is again calling on both  sides to bend. That advice is relevant, realistic and sound.  </P></p>

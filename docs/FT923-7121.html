			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / World News In Brief: Maastricht 'no' vote support grows in France Two opinion polls yesterday showed swelling support in France for a 'no' vote on the Maastricht Treaty - but both polls suggest voters will still back closer European union in next month's referendum. One, for the magazine L'Evenement du Jeudi, suggested 47 per cent would vote 'no' - a higher proportion than in previous surveys earlier this month. A second poll, for Daiwa Securities, forecast a 46 per cent 'no' vote. French support for Maastricht stood at about 70 per cent in early June.</p>

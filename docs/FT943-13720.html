			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (26): Reserves fear delays abolition  -The financial rand If there is one thing that South African businessmen detest above all others, it is the financial rand (finrand) - the investment currency for foreigners. At last month's World Economic Forum summit in Cape Town, speaker after speaker reiterated the same demand to the country's financial authorities: the country's exchange controls and its confusing two-tier currency - widely seen as an impediment to foreign investment - must be scrapped as soon as possible. Unfortunately, however, while everyone might agree that the cumbersome restrictions should be eradicated, there is no similar consensus on when such a move should be made - although there is continuing speculation in the market about a possible target date before the end of the year. Nonetheless, both Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, and Mr Chris Stals, Reserve Bank governor, are adamant that the financial rand is not going to disappear any time soon. 'People need to stop speculating and talk about the issue constructively,' stresses Mr Stals. The main reason for the hesitation is the parlous state of the country's foreign reserves which have taken a real hammering over the past 18 months: 1993 saw record net capital outflow of R10.3bn and the first part of this year saw a similar haemorrhage, with a probable net loss of some R3.5bn. Although the outflow has since stabilised, there has still been little sign of capital inflows, and reserves currently amount to only just over a month of imports. Also, decades of exchange controls have created intense pressure among local institutions and individuals to invest abroad. In the short term, the country would almost certainly face massive capital exports following any scrapping of the present system. Combined with the fact that a very large pool of speculative finrands, about R4.5bn is currently in the banking system waiting to be pulled out if the currencies merge, this is a cause for severe anxiety among Reserve Bank officials. 'We need to be aware of the possible consequences (of abolishing the finrand),' Mr Stals says, asserting that whatever the long-term rewards, in the short term massive capital outflows will almost certainly lead to a sharp depreciation in the currency and a very steep rise in interest rates. 'The shock therapy would be a big shock,' he asserts 'I don't think South Africa is ready for such a major restructuring.' Given these problems, Mr Stals and Mr Keys emphasise that three primary conditions have to be met before the financial rand can be scrapped: First, South Africa has to build up reserves that amount to at least three months' cover, preferably more; Second, the discount between the commercial and financial rand, presently about 23 per cent, must narrow to 10 per cent or lower; and Third, the finrand pool presently in the banking system must be cut to about R1bn. It seems that exchange liberalisation is more than a year away at least. And even when reform does take place, it is likely to be done in stages so as to try and limit any downside. But despite this, businessmen continue to argue loudly that the system's demise should come sooner rather than later on the grounds that the government will likely benefit from the element of surprise while being applauded for showing confidence in the strength of the economy. 'We took a hell of a political risk with the transition,' observes a senior banker. 'I think we should grit our teeth and take a similar leap of faith with the finrand.' So far, however, that is one jump that the government seems unwilling to make.</p>

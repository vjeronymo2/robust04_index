			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hosokawa Administration Urged to Return to </F>   Its Original Stance of `Implementing Tax Reductions First'"]    [Text] The government and the ruling coalition parties  decided to scrap the plan to introduce a "national welfare tax"  and implement an income tax cut. It is unusual to scrap an  official announcement by a prime minister. However, judging  from the fact that this is a deep-rooted issue, it is a rightful  decision. It is time for the Hosokawa administration to  recognize the severity of the Japanese economy, which is bogged  down in the worst recession of the postwar era, and rush to  fine-tune economic measures by returning to its original stance  of "implementing tax reductions first."    There were some doubts about the contents of this tax  concept, which Prime Minister Hosokawa announced abruptly, and  about the policy making method. A substantial tax increase will  thwart economic recovery. The announcement to introduce a  welfare tax, which was merely a consumption tax with a different  name, was nothing but an attempt to fool the people. There was  absolutely no reason to change the name. It is not clear how  this concept came about or what kind of decision-making  processes were taken.    We have to say that the recent announcement, which should  have been made only after obtaining the people's understanding,  was an unskillful act. Since the official announcement was  scrapped, the prime minister should do some soul-searching.    On the other hand, we have many doubts about a revised  proposal made by the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ],  which fiercely opposed the prime minister's concept. The  proposal to turn the welfare tax into an object tax will be  linked to freezing revenue from that financial resource. There  is a possibility that no rules will be applied to the use of the  revenue from the object tax. It is necessary to use every  available means to avoid the introduction of an object tax. An  income tax reduction will have no meaning unless it is linked to  a revision of the tax system, which includes a review of the tax  rates. The SDPJ's proposal to turn the consumption tax into a  refundable tax is indeed an easygoing way of thinking.    Following the scrapping of the prime minister's plan, the  government and the ruling coalition parties must first ask  themselves what is expected of the Japanese economy now. It  seems that the Hosokawa administration's debate over the tax  system was being promoted on the precondition that a "tax  increase is a must." It is strange that we hardly heard that the  debate had been held because of details of the income tax  reduction plan. What we should recall is that a large-scale  income tax reduction is needed for the Japanese economy, which  is in a serious recession, before securing a source of revenue.    We have repeatedly said that an income tax reduction  amounting to over 6 trillion yen should be introduced first, as  a pillar of the government's economic package, and that the  consumption tax rate should be raised to six percent when  economic recovery becomes apparent. The amount of this tax  reduction will be about the same as that of the tax increase.  We are certain that the income tax reduction will act as a  measure needed for the time being to recover from the recession  and to revise the ratio difference between direct and indirect  taxes. We need to revise the tax rate difference between direct  and indirect taxes so that we are prepared for the advent of an  aged society.    An introduction of comprehensive economic measures was  delayed due to the deadlocked tax debate. There is a  possibility that the compilation of a budget for fiscal 1994  will be further delayed unless the tax reduction issue is  settled. This delay will have negative impacts on local  autonomies' budget compilation too. We cannot ignore its  psychological effect on industries either.    The Japan-U.S. summit talks are just ahead while both  countries are still divided over the issue of setting numeric  targets for individual fields. Under such circumstances, we are  certain that Japan-U.S. relations will become tense.    Regarding the important tax issue, the Hosokawa  administration should not rely on a rough-and-ready method  again. However, we hope that the same administration will come  up with responsible conclusions that are acceptable to the  people as soon as possible. We hope that the prime minister, in  doing that, will not only listen to the Financial Ministry's  narrow-minded financial theories, but will make a decision with  an eye on the current severe economic situation and on Japan's  future economy. The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has many  politicians who are familiar with the tax system. If it thinks  the Japanese economy is in a critical state, the LDP should stop  criticizing the Hosokawa administration's blunder. It is the  LDP's turn to cross the line of party interests and propose  concrete economic measures.</p>

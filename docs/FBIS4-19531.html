			<p>BFN     [Text] Talks between the prime minister, Ms. Benazir  Bhutto, and the German chancellor, Mr. Helmut Kohl, were held in  Bonn today. The two leaders are understood to have discussed  bilateral relations as well as regional and international  issues. The talks were marked by extreme warmth and cordiality  which are the hallmark of the relations between Pakistan and  Germany.    During the talks, the prime minister is understood to have  put forward a number of proposals for expanding economic  cooperation between the two countries. She also briefed the  chancellor about the latest situation in occupied Kashmir and  reiterated Pakistan's firm belief that the Kashmir dispute could  be resolved only by the grant of right of self-determination to  the Kashmiris. She said Pakistan was ready to enter into a  dialogue with India provided it lifts the siege of Hazratbal  Shrine, puts an end to the ongoing repression, and considerably  reduces the presence of its troops in occupied Kashmir.    The talks continued during the luncheon hosted by the German  chancellor in honor of the prime minister.</p>

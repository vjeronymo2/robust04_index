			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Speaking at polling station No. 4 in Kiev, Leonid  Kuchma today told Western correspondents that 90 percent of the  Ukrainian people are on the brink of poverty. Everyone abroad  seems to think that everything is nice and quiet in Ukraine.  However, the danger of transforming Ukraine into a new  Yugoslavia persists. Kuchma was obliquely criticizing the  United States, which had promised economic aid to Ukraine in  exchange for its nuclear disarmament. For now, all we have  received are words, but not a cent.    Kuchma believes that there is no problem with the Crimea.  The conflict there is a myth used for political purposes, he  said. These words are regarded as a hint on Kravchuk's position.  The former Ukrainian prime minister also said that no one can  order the Russians to leave Sevastopol.</p>

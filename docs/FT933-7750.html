			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling up on rate comment STERLING rose sharply against both the D-Mark and the dollar in London yesterday afternoon, after a UK government minister gave a strong indication that interest rate cuts should not be expected for the time being, writes James Blitz. After falling below the DM2.49 level at the start of the week, the pound stabilised on Tuesday as dealers took the view that a cut in interest rates had already been priced into the market. However, Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the UK Treasury, told British television yesterday that an easing in monetary policy was not to be anticipated. This led to a sharp fall in UK interest rate futures and sterling climbed 2 1/4 pfennigs to close at DM2.5450. A London dealer spoke of a very large commercial order being received from the Far East. The pound was not affected by July's figures for retail sales and inflation, both of which were released yesterday. However, sterling may have gained some momentum from a sharp rise in UK equity markets. US investors may have sought to profit from the rise in UK shares, and the pound gained 2 1/2 cents against the dollar to close at Dollars 1.5125. Sterling's rise may partly have triggered a fall in the dollar/D-Mark rate, as dealers commenced selling of the US currency yesterday afternoon. The Bundesbank's latest monthly report also supported the D-Mark, giving little indication of any prospect of German short-term rates coming down. The central bank said high money growth meant the scope for cuts was limited. The dollar ended at DM1.6825, down about 1 1/2 pfennigs. It finished New York trading at DM1.6800. By contrast, the dollar/yen exchange rate was confined to tight ranges as dealers waited for today's Japanese cabinet meeting, which could bring a response to the high yen. Mr Yasushi Mieno, Japan's central bank governor, said yesterday that the authorities were not considering a cut in the discount rate, although some thought the possibility still existed. The dollar closed steady in London at Y101.50, and at Y101.65 in New York. In Europe, the French franc continued to perform strongly in the wake of Tuesday's easing in French money market rates. The currency closed at FFr3.514 per D-Mark from a previous FFr3.517. There was market talk that the Bank of France was buying foreign currencies as the franc appreciated, needing to make up for the severe depletion of its reserves in the midst of the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. One dealer also spoke of rumours that Belgium and Luxembourg were at odds over whether to continue their common currency area. The Danish krone recovered from an early fall against the D-Mark after Denmark's central bank said it was selling D-Marks to support its currency. The krone was trading at DKr4.0936, having been at DKr4.1200 earlier in the day.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 30, 1994, petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination. The request was granted by the Department on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 4, 1994, the Department received an amendment to the petition alleging that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of pipe fittings from Malaysia. In accordance with section 735(a)(3) of the Act, on August 12, 1994, the Department issued a letter to MMCPNF requesting monthly volume and value shipment data for the period January 1, 1992, through September 27, 1994. The Department has received no reply to this request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by this investigation are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings (``pipe fittings'') having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (``HTSUS''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Investigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The period of investigation is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Best Information Available <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMCPNF did not respond to our questionnaire. Therefore, we have based our preliminary determination on best information available (BIA) pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act, which provides that the Department shall use BIA when a company identified by the Department as a respondent refuses to provide requested information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions for those respondents who did not cooperate in an investigation. According to this methodology, as outline in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings, Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings, from Germany, 54 FR 18992, 19033 (May 3, 1989), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of 1) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or 2) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Allied Signal Aerospace Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 996 F. 2d 1185,1191&hyph;92 (Fed. Cir. 1993).) Because there were no cooperative respondents in this investigation, we are assigning to all exporters, as BIA, the highest margin calculated in the petition, adjusted for methodological errors as explained in the Department's initiation notice. The adjusted rate is 194.7 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Circumstances <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner has alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Malaysia. Section 735(a)(3) of the Act provides that the Department will determine that critical circumstances exist if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the U.S. or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of this investigation, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of this investigation over a relatively short period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

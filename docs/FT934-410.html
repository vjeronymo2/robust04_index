			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Glad tidings of insurance and joy - If disaster strikes over Christmas, Bethan Hutton finds there's a policy for just about every contingency On the first day of Christmas, we all sat down to lunch; But I soon felt an ominous crunch . . . As I was spitting out the sixpence, together with bits of shattered tooth, I heard a strange sound and turned round to see a small, sparkly figure floating in the air. 'I am the good insurance fairy,' she twinkled, and waved her wand. 'Here is a magic dental insurance policy which will pay for emergency treatment, even on Christmas day]' Then she disappeared but, when I looked closer, I found a document on the floor. On the second day of Christmas, we opened some champagne; But the cork smashed some porcelain . . . I was just sweeping up the pieces when the good insurance fairy appeared, fluttering a sachet before my nose. 'Sprinkle this magic powder on the floor]' she said. I did, and there sprang up a roll of parchment, labelled Fine Art and Antique Insurance Policy - all my collection of Japanese porcelain was covered. On the third day of Christmas, cousin Wayne came round to tea; But he tripped up and said he'd sue me . . . Just as I was shutting the front door behind him, the good insurance fairy squeezed past and tossed me a tiny silver whistle. 'Blow this whenever you need help]' she said. So I did, and a legal expenses policy flew through the letter box. On the fourth day of Christmas, the tree began to fall; And crushed Rover chewing a ball . . . As I picked up the 'phone to call the vet, the insurance fairy climbed from the wreckage of the tree, brushing pine needles off her wings, and said: 'If you say the magic words 'pet insurance policy,' all your veterinary bills will disappear.' On the fifth day of Christmas, I drove to see a friend; But a drunk driver smashed my big end . . . The car was a write-off. As I trudged home from the police station I heard a familiar, tinkly voice by my side. 'Never fear, the good insurance fairy is here', she said. 'Rub this magic lamp and see what happens.' So I did, and suddenly a chauffeur-driven car pulled up beside me. 'Step in, ma'am,' the driver said. 'It's all courtesy of your mobility protection insurance.' On the sixth day of Christmas, we saw a pantomime; But came home to the scene of a crime . . . While we were out, someone had stolen all our Christmas presents, leaving only a pile of wrapping paper. There was a rustling noise and the good insurance fairy popped out from under a gift tag. 'Have this fan. It's magic, of course,' she said. I waved it and a whirlwind swept away the paper, leaving in its place a fully comprehensive household contents policy. On the seventh day of Christmas, gales raged around our home; Wrecked a fence and our garden gnome . . . I was surveying the damage when the good insurance fairy landed with a splash in the pond. 'Have you met your frog?' she asked, pointing to a rather ugly green specimen sitting on a neighbouring lily pad. Before my very eyes, it grew and grew and turned into a loss adjuster with a clipboard. 'No problem,' he said. 'It's all covered under your garden insurance plan.' On the eighth day of Christmas, the doctor came to say; I had two babies on the way . . . My visions of financial ruin after paying for two of everything were interrupted by a shimmering figure. 'If you make me their fairy godmother, you can collect on a twins insurance policy - it will pay you lots of money if two babies arrive at once,' the good insurance fairy promised. On the ninth day of Christmas, we gathered round to sing; But mice had chewed every piano string . . . 'Oh dear,' said the good insurance fairy, inspecting the tangle under the piano lid. But she waved her magic wand and, as she vanished, a glitter-dusted musical instrument insurance policy appeared, propped on the keyboard. On the 10th day of Christmas, I began to cough and choke; As our thatched roof went up in smoke . . . A slightly singed good insurance fairy came and perched on my shoulder as the firemen were packing up their hoses. 'This is a magic bean,' she said. 'Plant it outside your window.' So I did and, within an hour, a flourishing vine had grown up. Its leaves were the pages of a special thatched property insurance policy. By the 11th day of Christmas, I could take no more; And collapsed on the living room floor . . . I came round to find the good insurance fairy hovering in front of me, looking concerned, while to one side stood a gentleman in a white coat. 'Don't worry,' she whispered. 'My magic medical insurance policy will cover even psychiatric treatment.' On the 12th day of Christmas, we were due to go away; But I couldn't face a holiday . . . I was regretting the waste of money when the good insurance fairy swooped across the hospital ward. 'Cheer up,' she said. 'The cancellation section of your travel insurance will cover everything.' Reassured, I fell asleep, thinking warm thoughts about friendly, helpful insurance companies. Then, on the 13th day of Christmas, an envelope arrived and, when I opened it, there was a puff of black smoke. An evil-looking spirit emerged. 'I am the bad insurance fairy,' she growled, and handed me a letter . . . 'Dear Madam, We regret to inform you that, because your direct debit mandate was incorrectly filled out, no premiums have been collected for your policies and we were not on risk during the period December 25 to January 5 inclusive. Therefore, all your claims have been disallowed. Yours faithfully, Celestial Insurance Company plc.' The good insurance fairy had been a figment of my imagination - but all the policies really exist, if you can afford them.</p>

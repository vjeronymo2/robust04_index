It  will reinforce the personnel of the 2d Russian battalion which  is part of the UN peacekeeping forces on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina where, once the Russians arrived, it became  possible to conclude the long-awaited peace between the warring  sides.    The dispatch of an additional contingent from the Russian  Army to Sarajevo with equipment and weapons, Colonel General  Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne Troops, said in a  conversation with your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, is being  effected with the knowledge and agreement of the UN Security  Council. This concerns an additional military contingent of our  "blue helmets" numbering 300 men, which has been allocated by a  directive of the Russian president and with the agreement of the  Federation Council in response to a request from Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali to participate in conducting peacekeeping  operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    As the Airborne Troops commander stressed, the presence of  Russian paratroopers from the UN peacekeeping forces is a key  aspect in the implementation of the plan for the political  settlement of the Bosnian crisis, put forward by Russia in the  second half of February. But recently, after Russian  paratroopers mounted posts on demarcation lines and the  collection points of Serbian heavy guns which have been  transferred under control of UN forces, and when mutual  cooperation between the UN and Serbian commands was established,  as is clear from reports coming into the Foreign Ministry and  reports from Colonel Viktor Vorobyev, commander of the  battalion, the command of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina is  making attempts to change the original task for our UN  battalion. The question of giving it appropriate peacekeeping  status is deliberately being dragged out, which is making it  possible to put the Russians in the UN reserve.    At present, the commander of the Airborne Troops reported,  our paratroopers have left a key post across the River Miljacka,  as well as several posts on a likely avenue of tank approach in  the Serb area of Grbavica. The Russians' positions have been  occupied by French "Blue Helmets," which is a violation of the  treaty with the Serb side, and may lead to an escalation of  tension in this area which is explosive as it is. Obviously,  Col. Gen. Podkolzin noted, bringing Russian peacekeeping forces  into Sarajevo, and reinforcing them by 300 servicemen, the first  detachment of whom is now being sent to Bosnia, and also our  intention to send military observers to the area of the airport  of the city of Tuzla, is generating concern in the West that  Russia has taken on an excessively active role in settling the  crisis in the Balkans.    Nevertheless, the commander of the Airborne Troops said in  conclusion, in accordance with the political settlement plan, we  are continuing to send our "Blue Helmets" to Sarajevo. Today's  landing party comprises 100 servicemen: 59 officers and warrant  officers, and the rest -- noncommissioned officers and soldiers  who have performed their compulsory service in the Airborne  Troops and have concluded contracts with the Ministry of Defense.    ...An inspection of the "Blue Helmets" was carried out on  the  airfield near Ryazan. It was conducted by Major General Nikolay  Staskov, deputy commander of the Airborne Troops for the  Peacekeeping Forces. For the first time, before the departure  of the "blue helmets," a blessing ceremony was carried out which  was conducted by clergy from the Orthodox and Islamic faiths  (those going to Bosnia include Muslim soldiers).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Sudeten German congress culminated in  Nuremberg today. Our correspondent Jiri Halousek reports from  there. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] In his speech today Franz Neubauer, chairman  of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft, rejected Czech Prime  Minister Vaclav Klaus's view that Sudeten Germans might be  individually granted -- in some circumstances -- the right to  return to their former homeland. Franz Neubauer said this was  not sufficient as the Sudeten Germans had not been expelled  individually, but collectively.    The congress concluded with a speech by Bavarian Prime  Minister Edmund Stoiber. He said relations between Germany and  Bavaria on one side and the Czech Republic on the other had  developed significantly in the last few years. However, a  political dialogue of the Czech cabinet and parliament with  elected officials of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft was  still missing. Only its introduction would make these relations  really good. This is why Edmund Stoiber proposed to open such a  dialogue next year, exactly 50 years from the end of the Second  World War and the start of the Sudeten Germans' expulsion from  our country.</p>

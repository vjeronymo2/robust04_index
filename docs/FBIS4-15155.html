			<p>BFN     [Text] Sevastopol -- On 5 April, the Coordinative Council  of the Black Sea Fleet Officers' Assemblies received a letter  from the Russian Government's interdepartmental commission for  social matters relating to servicemen and members of their  families. In particular, it expresses concern regarding the  fate of the Black Sea Fleet both by ordinary Russians, who are  their Motherland's true patriots, and representatives of the  Russian Federation's every branch of power.    The letter states that the question of the Black Sea Fleet  was addressed at an interdepartmental conference in February,  attended by officials from Russia's Social Security Ministry,  Foreign Affairs Ministry, and Defense Ministry, whose proposals  on a settlement of the issue of the Black Sea Fleet were  forwarded to Russian Federation Government Chairman Viktor  Chernomyrdin on 9 March. The interdepartmental commission also  noted that under the Massandra protocol of 3 August 1993, the  preparation of an agreement between Russia and Ukraine was  continuing.    The letter points out: "It makes provision for the whole of  the Black Sea Fleet and all its infrastructure in Crimea being  used by the Russian Federation and having Russia's insignia,  with the Russian side making appropriate payments for the half  of the Black Sea Fleet, including its infrastructure, that under  the previous accords was not to be transferred to Ukraine."</p>

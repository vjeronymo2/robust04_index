			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM ponders wounding Maastricht defeat THE GOVERNMENT'S opponents have drawn blood. Last night Mr John Major's government suffered its first defeat on the Maastricht treaty. It was also, incidentally, the first parliamentary defeat since Mr Major walked into Downing Street in November 1990. It was humiliating for the prime minister. It was not fatal - for the treaty or for the government. The passage by the combined forces of the opposition parties and Tory Euro-sceptics of an obscure and, of itself, relatively unimportant amendment to the Maastricht legislation has two effects. The first is to deliver yet another blow to a weak and uncertain government. The ecstatic reaction of the Tory rebels in the Commons chamber when the vote was announced underlined again that Mr Major cannot command his own party. He has a paper majority of 20. But 26 Tories voted against him and nearly 20 abstained. Just two days earlier he had made a strong and deliberately public plea for the unity he needs to restore his authority. His most senior ministers had warned that the government's entire programme - from action to tackle crime to further reforms of the education system - was being jeopardised by the parliamentary logjam over Maastricht. The diehard opponents of further European integration on the Tory backbenches rewarded their leader with an equally public slap in the face. Labour and the Liberal Democrats, though both committed to the eventual ratification of the treaty, decided that they could not pass up the chance of delivering another kick to the government. The second effect of the defeat is to prolong still further the debate on ratification in the House of Commons. Under the arcane procedures of Westminster another chunk of parliamentary time must now be added to the debate among MPs. This report stage will follow the detailed line-by-line examination of the legislation in its present committee stage. The actual substance of the amendment is hardly relevant. It is designed to ensure that British representatives on the EC's new Committee of the Regions will be chosen from elected local councillors. The government had wanted them to be appointees, but was ready to concede if it had thought the main opposition parties would back down. So the corrosive debate will now continue until well into the summer - and perhaps beyond. Only the hardest of the hardline opponents of the treaty believe that it will in the end fall. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, are both publicly pledged to its passage. If the two opposition leaders attempted to renege on that commitment they would split their own parties. Many Liberal Democrats feel deeply uneasy about Mr Ashdown calling one day for the government to speed up ratification and the next voting to delay it. There are 100 Labour MPs who would defy their leaders if they judged they were being asked to wreck the treaty. But Mr Major knows now that the speed of the legislation cannot be dictated by the government. He is totally reliant on the goodwill of the opposition - particularly the Liberal Democrats - to secure his timetable for ratification. Neither Mr Smith nor Mr Ashdown will make life easy. Before last night's vote, MPs had already spent about 100 hours debating the legislation. It will need the same again to complete the committee stage. The new report stage could take another two or three weeks. Then the bill has to go to the House of Lords. The government's business managers will have to dump still more of its domestic legislation if the process is to be completed by July or August. The agony might be prolonged until October. There may be yet further defeats. The opposition parties are committed to the inclusion of the social chapter. Some of the Tory Euro-sceptics now seem so detached from their own party that they may do anything to wreck the treaty. They will be bought off only by the referendum Mr Major has consistently rejected. As he contemplates defeat this morning, the prime minister will draw comfort from the fact that in the end the large pro-European majority at Westminster will give him his legislation. But who now could refer to Maastricht as 'game, set and match'.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget: Kinnock lambasts Tory tax 'bribes' MR NEIL KINNOCK, the opposition leader, said Labour would set out a 'much better offer' to Britain during the election than the tax 'bribes' announced by the government, writes Ivor Owen. He said Labour would publish its alternative Budget next week. Amid cheers from supporters, Mr Kinnock insisted that the great majority of the British people wanted jobs, decent public services, an improved health service, and 'not the bribes the government is offering'. He was jeered by Tory MPs when he would not say explicitly whether his party would reject the introduction of a 20p rate of tax for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. But party officials later said Mr Kinnock had indicated that it would be opposed. As Conservative MPs proclaimed that the new reduced rate would prove a key element in an election-winning Budget, Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, challenged Mr Kinnock to make his stance clear. Mr Kinnock urged him to await the publication of Labour's alternative proposals. When Conservatives continued to demand a detailed answer, the Labour leader retorted that there had been 'months of teases' about the chancellor's proposals and urged them to accept 'in the name of reasonability' that Labour should have another six days to produce its alternative Budget. He described the occupants of the Treasury bench as 'hollow men' who preferred a 'bribery whimper' to a 'recovery bang'. He called on the chancellor to explain why, if he believed that borrowing for tax cuts was an effective means of remedying the recession, he had not followed that policy last year. The Labour leader contrasted the government reliants on a consumer-led recovery with his party's policies designed to promote an investment-led recovery. A Labour government would ensure Britain had a well trained work force and a consistently sucessful and 'socially just' economy.</p>

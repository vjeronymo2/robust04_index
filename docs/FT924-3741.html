			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Markets: Now it's over to the shareholders - The Bottom Line A CHALLENGE was thrown out to shareholders this week with the launch, to much City fanfare, of the final report of the committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury. Some of its recommendations for improved standards in the boardroom might seem remote and irrelevant to private investors. But Cadbury places great importance on their role and says the report sends them 'a message of encouragement.' At its heart is a code of best practice which calls for strong, independent, non-executive directors; the existence of audit and remuneration committees; effective internal controls; and a statement that the company is a going concern. Shareholders will be able to assess how well companies comply because, from June, all will be required by the Stock Exchange to produce a statement in their annual report. They must say if they conform with the code and detail any divergences. Parts of the code also will be verified by the company's auditors. Other parts, and a series of good practice guidelines, will not be scrutinised but will provide a check-list for progressive governance. These include suggestions that there should be at least three non-executives on every board; that non-executive directors should dominate the audit committee; and that the chairman of the remuneration committee should be available at the AGM to answer questions. The planks on which the report is based are to provide sufficient disclosure, so that all those with a legitimate interest in a company have the information they need to exercise their rights and responsibilities while providing checks and balances to prevent undue concentrations of power in the boardroom. Shareholders might question what significance this all has for them. The link between corporate governance and corporate performance is far from clear-cut. Some of Britain's more successful companies have been driven by a dominant chief executive. Others have failed while, on paper, appearing to comply with the letter of the code. Cadbury believes, however, there is a strong economic incentive to get involved. 'I'm sure it will have an impact on the share price,' he says. If nothing else, this will come from the emphasis in the code on effective internal controls - something which, he says, the committee found lacking in many companies. There is also a more direct impact. The code calls for changes to directors' pay. It says there should be greater disclosure, and that increases should be approved by a remuneration committee composed mainly of non-executive directors. There is also a moral justification for taking governance issues seriously, of course: that shareholders have wider responsibilities as owners of the company by law. As a result, they should consider issues other than simply capital growth and dividends, such as the treatment of employees and pensioners. The passive response to the code by investors would be to ensure compliance before buying a company's shares, or to sell existing holdings if there was no sign of improvements being made to meet its requirements. Cadbury would prefer a more active response, with shareholders - most notably the institutions - agitating for change. He suggests tactics such as letters to the chairman, and questions at the annual general meeting. But he is more bullish. 'Individual shareholders have more ability to influence than they perhaps think,' he says. 'If they have a sensible point to make, nobody likes to be in a position to have done nothing about it. Intelligent intervention will have an effect. The code provides you with an agenda. Make use of it and raise the points in it. These are tests against which you can measure an effective business.' Whatever the reasons, successful implementation of the code depends entirely on investors. 'We are relying on market forces to turn our recommendations into action,' Cadbury says. If, when the committee reconvenes in two years, the market is judged to have failed, statutory regulation might be the only alternative.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy has  described the atmosphere at current Ukrainian-Russian talks on  the future of the Black Sea Fleet as "good."    He told a news conference in the Crimean city of Sevastopol  on Thursday [21 April] that there had been no serious  disagreements during the negotiations. "There was some  friction, but Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev put  everything in order," he said.    Radetskyy said each side had made its own inventory of the  fleet, which the two countries plan to divide between them. The  inventories listed different numbers of vessels, but, if the  difference was ironed out by Friday, a joint inventory would be  unnecessary, he said.    Radetskyy said Ukraine had proposed that Russia base its  portion of the fleet at Donuzlav, 100 km (62.5 miles) west of  Sevastopol.    "The delegations had different viewpoints on that. Experts  are now working on it. We are looking for points of contact and  will cut that Gordian knot," he said.    Asked to comment on Russia's demand to base its part of the  fleet at Sevastopol, Radetskyy said, "They cannot make any  demands because they are on Ukrainian territory. The land,  water and infrastructure belong to Ukraine. They can only make  proposals, not dictate their terms." "The infrastructure is ours  and can only be leased to Russia," he emphasized.    He said the two sides were looking for a solution but  "nobody  has yet taken any concrete decision about that or made any  promises."</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Pounds 12m cash for homes 'unused' GOVERNMENT money intended for refurbishing redundant space above city-centre shops is not being used, Living Over the Shop (Lots), a project set up at York University in 1989 to arrange for housing associations to use spare space above shops, said yesterday. The reason was a mismatch between the location of the properties and the location of councils with funds, Lots said. Ms Ann Petherick of Lots said yesterday that 80 per cent of the 600 properties available on the project's database for refurbishment were in towns where there no funds were available. She said most of the Pounds 12m available this financial year from the Department of Environment and the Housing Corporation remained unused. The department has budgeted Pounds 5m for living-over-the-shop schemes this year, Pounds 15m in 1993-94 and Pounds 10m in 1994-95. It said it was quite satisfied with the administration of the funding. 'The cash is based on bids from local authorities, so we are dependent on what they ask for,' it explained. If a council does not use the funds during the fiscal year for which they are requested they revert to the Treasury. Ms Petherick said some of the 80 councils which have funds are struggling to spend them. She suggested that funds should be allocated to properties not to authorities.</p>

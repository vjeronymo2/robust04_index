"The extensive presence of the people here is a clear proof  that the Islamic ummah (nation) is unwilling to ignore the  reality of their own lives under the influence of the  negativistic and discouraging whispers of the enemies," he told  the crowd.    He said that the drop in oil prices was meant as measure to  deal a severe blow to the Islamic republic. "The global  arrogance, by creating the grounds for the drop in oil prices  tried to hurt the Islamic Iran but did not succeed," he said,  "today we produce the necessary raw material for our factories  and foreign specialists (formerly in Iran) have been replaced  with our own specialists."    He added that today Iranian universities were meeting the  needs of the univeristy students and that in the field of  telecommunications Iran was depending more and more on the  indigenous human and technical resources.    He said that Iran was reaching the stage of self-sufficiency  in the area of providing foodstuffs. "The farmers, the  ranchers, the poultrymen and the fishermen of the Islamic Iran  have all been able to meet the nutritional needs of the people  to a great extent," he said.    Elsewhere in his speech Rafsanjani discussed the legacy of  Imam Khomeyni, saying that the legacy of imam served as a  blueprint for the success of the revolution in Iran. "The  nation of Iran is determined to follow the path of our late imam  and will do so with ever-increasing resoluteness," he said.</p>

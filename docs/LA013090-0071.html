			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Alaska Air Group Inc: The Seattle-based carrier's 1989 net income climbed 14%  from 1988 to a record $43 million.  </P> <P> Revenue totaled $917 million, up 13%. For the fourth quarter, earnings plunged  59% to $2.5 million on revenue of $223.3 million, a gain of 14%. The firm,  which is the holding company for Alaska Airlines Inc. and Horizon Air  Industries Inc., attributed the quarterly decline in profit to lower passenger  fares and substantially higher fuel prices. The firm also noted that the Bay  Area Quake and the eruption of Alaska's Redoubt Volcano diminished revenue  while adding to operating costs.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] PHNOM PENH, April 3 (AFP) -- Cambodian co-premier  Hun Sen said Sunday that the government will soon appoint a  governor and devise a development plan for the former Khmer  Rouge stronghold of Pailin, captured by the government in late  March.    "We are going to adminster this town, not just militarily to  prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge, but to develop it as  well," Hun Sen told AFP.    He did not mention whether the government would begin mining  the northwestern Cambodian town's rich seams of rubies and  sapphires, which earned the Khmer Rouge an estimated one million  dollars per month in revenues to finance their guerrilla war.    "This town will be an agricultural development and  industrial  zone because the natural resources in this zone can support such  small factories as sugar cane processing," he said.    The Cambodian government has said previously that it would  honor contracts between the Khmer Rouge and Thai mining and  logging companies, which are located just over the Thai border.    Cambodian troops seized trucks, bulldozers and rock-sorting  equipment owned by the Thai contractors when they captured  Pailin, and diplomats here say the Cambodians are taking their  time "cataloguing" their finds.    Cambodia's deputy interior ministers, Im Chhunlim and Khan  Savoeun, have been given the task of setting up a development  plan and appointing a governor to run the Pailin area as a  special administrative region.    Hun Sen said he envisaged tourist groups traveling to the  area "in a few years, when the security is improved and when  malaria can be controlled."    It was not clear when Pailin's development would begin, when  civilians would be allowed to settle there, or when the governor  would be appointed.    Khan Savoeun was the commander of a regiment of formerly  royalist guerrillas who had been allied with the Khmer Rouge but  are now part of the coalition government fighting the Khmer  Rouge.    He is viewed as having previously maintained the closest of  relations with his former allies, but never actually joined the  Khmer Rouge hierarchy.    Khan Savoeun's troops in the battle-scarred district of  Stoung in central Kompong Thom province were reported by UN  peacekeepers to have aided the Khmer Rouge in breaking the  ceasefire well after the signing of the Paris peace accords  formally ended the civil war in 1991.    He became deputy interior and public security minister  following the UN-run elections in May 1993 as part of a  power-sharing arrangement between the monarchists, led by Prince  Norodom Ranariddh, and the former communists headed by Hun Sen.  The two share the prime minister's portfolio.    Im Chhunlim is a member of Hun Sen's party.</p>

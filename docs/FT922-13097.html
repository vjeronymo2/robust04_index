			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound forges ahead vs D-Mark STERLING dealt a double blow to the remaining UK bears yesterday as it pulled itself off the floor of the exchange rate mechanism and rose to a five-month high against the D-Mark, writes Peggy Hollinger. The UK currency ended the day in London at DM2.9150, three pfennigs higher than Friday's close. Traders said the strong performance was due both to post-election euphoria, and the problems assailing the D-Mark. Most dealers expected the pound to start testing DM2.95 in the short-term. Sterling's inherent strength was likely to continue, according to Dr Mark Austin, economist with HongKong Bank. 'Compared with the rest of Europe there is the combination of political stability and an economy which looks as if it might rebound quite sharply in the short-term,' he said. This outlook would encourage the fund managers who, until now, had deliberately kept themselves light of sterling due to political uncertainty since the begining of the year. Within the European Monetary System, sterling traded places with the Danish Kroner to finish the day at 22 per cent of its permitted swing below the central rate. This was the first time the pound had left the floor of the grid since early November, and prompted speculation of an early interest rate cut. However, most traders suspected that since the political impetus of a rate cut had disappeared, a reduction was not likely within the next couple of months. 'The government will want to save the potential stimulus until it sees if the post-election boom fades away,' said Dr Austin. The D-Mark took severe blows from both the pound's strength and an overnight report from a German think tank that growth would be much slower than expected. Finally, news that the Russian government had offered to resign in a bid to force the Supreme Legislature to change tack on reform was more than D-Mark investors could stand. A flurry of D-Mark selling gave a fillip to most European currencies, including the Ecu which came close to its theoretical level for the first time, said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank. The peseta was let off the leash by sterling's sharp rise within the EMS. It also took heart from Spanish finance minister Mr Carlos Solchaga's statement that an interest rate cut was not imminent. The peseta rose from 62.88/95 per D-Mark to 62.61/63. The dollar also took a boost from the weaker D-Mark, although some of the shine is likely to disappear tomorrow when retail sales figures are published. These are expected to be 0.4 per cent weaker in March, while industrial production is likely to be flat. The US currency rose from DM1.6360 on Friday to DM1.6545 at the close last night in in London.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SLAM: Buzz, the new hyperhip, L.A.-based magazine debuting this month, slams  Yorba Linda as "this nothing sort of burg" that became "home of the library  extolling the ability of one man to make an entire nation ashamed of itself."  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem Mark Schwing brushed away the barbs. "There are always  extremists. . . . People either love Richard Nixon or they hate him."  Writer/commentator Harlan Ellison did include something nice about the county:  San Clemente, which rejected the library, "opted for slow growth and being able  to look in a mirror without seeing the Swamp Thing."

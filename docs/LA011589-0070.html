			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS  </P> <P> Toni Taylor's article on "Problems at Airports" (Dec. 4) prompts me to write  regarding two annoying situations at the Tom Bradley Terminal, Los Angeles  International Airport. Visitors from abroad, including the elderly, very young  and handicapped, often not fluent in English, have to get themselves through  Immigration and Customs.  </P> <P> They then find that they must pay $1 to obtain a baggage cart from the  automatic machine. This requires that they have a $1 bill and that they read  the instructions on the machine. After obtaining the cart they must push their  way through the door of the terminal only to confront a very steep ramp to the  passenger arrival area. Above this ramp is a large portrait of Mayor Bradley  with the caption: "Welcome to Los Angeles."  </P> <P> First impressions are often important and long-lasting. I would suggest that  some of the airport fees, such as the charge to passengers departing the United  States, be diverted to provide free carts for arriving international  passengers. Other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia provide  this service. Why not here in Los Angeles? In addition, an easier way should be  provided to the passenger arrival area from customs. Perhaps a moving walkway  or an escalator?  </P> <P> JEANE M. NUTT  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

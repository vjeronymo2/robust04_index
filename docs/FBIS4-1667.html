			<p>BFN     [Text] On 3 March, Zhao Changfeng, chief procurator of the  provincial people's procuratorate, reported to the deputies  participating in the second session of the eighth provincial  people's congress on the "work report of the Shandong Provincial  people's procuratorate."    Zhao Changfeng said in his report: In the past year, the  procuratorial organs at various levels across the province took  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th party  congress as a guidance; conscientiously exercised the legal  supervisory functions under the leadership of the provincial  party committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, under  the supervision by the people's congresses at various levels and  their standing committees, with the support of the governments,  and closely in line with the central link of economic  construction; strictly enforced laws; paid firm attention to  handling cases; comprehensively carried out the procuratorial  work; and made positive contributions to promoting economic  development and administrative honesty.    Zhao Changfeng said: Last year, we constantly and  persistently unified our thinking with a series of instructions  made by the party Central Committee and the provincial party  committee on opposing corruption and advocating administrative  honesty, strictly enforced laws, firmly attended to handling  cases, attached prominent importance to investigating and  handling major and appalling cases, and made outstanding  achievements. The province accepted 6,034 economic criminal  cases of various categories; put 3,720 economic cases, including  cases of corruption and bribery, on file for investigations and  handling; and investigated and handled 1,769 major and appalling  cases of various categories, showing an increase of 82 percent  and setting a historical record.    Zhao Changfeng said: From the beginning of last year, we  continued to persistently take the struggle against serious  criminal activities and the overall improvement of social order  as another important task for safeguarding social stability and  guaranteeing the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and  economic construction. We resolutely implemented the principle  of "strictly and rapidly handling various criminal activities"  and sternly dealt blows to various kinds of serious criminal  activities. Last year, we accepted the reports on arresting  26,365 criminals submitted by the security organs and arrested,  with approvals, 23,156 criminals, respectively increasing 4.4  percent and 4.5 percent over the previous year; handled 25,359  criminals whose lawsuit cases were submitted by the security  organs; and brought prosecutions against 20,443 persons to the  people's courts through examinations.    Zhao Changfeng said: Last year, the procuratorial organs  across the province strengthened the supervision over the  enforcement of laws and disciplines and comprehensively carried  out civil administration, the work of prisons, accusations, and  appeals. In coordination with the struggle against corruption,  we strengthened the examinations of the enforcement of laws and  disciplines and concentrated energy on investigating and  handling the criminal cases of state working personnel  "violating power" and neglecting functions. We also  strengthened the examinations of prisons; conscientiously  examined and corrected various unlawful activities within  prisons and reformatories, particularly the unlawful activities  of replacing punishment by money and wantonly collecting money;  ensured the accurate implementation of state laws and the  party's policies on reform-through-labor and  reeducation-through- labor; and ensured the strict enforcement  of laws and the management in a civilized manner. We should  attach prominent importance to the trial of civil cases and the  examination of administrative lawsuits and make positive efforts  to handle cases. We conscientiously received and appropriately  handled visitors and incoming letters from citizens and strictly  investigated and handled accusation and lawsuit cases.    Zhao Changfeng said: Over the past year, we persisted in  the principle of "building procuratorial organs according to  laws and sternly administering procuratorial work" and  continuously regarded the building of contingents as an urgently  strategic task. Procuratorial organs helped party committees to  accomplish the elections of procurators at three levels and  strengthened the leading bodies' ideology, organizational  ability, and work style. At the time of positively engaging in  the struggle against corruption, the procuratorial organs at  various levels strengthened administrative honesty. According  to the central authorities and the provincial party committee's  regulations on being honest in performing official duties, the  procuratorial organs conscientiously launched the  self-investigation and self-correction activities; resolutely  eliminated the problems that a small number of units exceeded  their power to handle cases, took part in economic disputes, and  wantonly collected funds and charges; strengthened the  in-service training of cadres and policemen; and upgraded the  cadres and policemen contingents' political integrity and  professional abilities. Under the circumstances where tasks  were arduous and work conditions were comparatively arduous, the  broad masses of procuratorial cadres and policemen demonstrated  extremely good mental outlook, carried forward the revolutionary  spirit of fighting indomitably and making selfless sacrifice,  tempered themselves in the course of waging the struggle against  corruption, and experienced the grim tests of justly enforcing  laws under the market economic conditions. A group of advanced  collectives and individuals emerged.    Zhao Changfeng said: The year 1994 is an extremely important  year to deepen reform. The new situation of reform and opening  up sets higher demands on the procuratorial work. We should  continue to persistently take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guidance;  persist in the principle of taking a two-hand approach and  ensuring both hands are tough; attach primary importance to  safeguarding social and political stability; and further  investigate and handle major and appalling cases of corruption  and bribery, the illegal cases of not strictly enforcing laws,  and the illegal cases involving legal persons; take the overall  procuratorial work situation into consideration by strictly  enforcing laws and firmly handling cases; press forward the work  in a down-to-earth manner; and crate a good social environment  and a good legal environment for reform, opening up, and  economic construction.</p>

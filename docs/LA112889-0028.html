			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS: TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH VENICE'S JONES IS IMPOSSIBLE  </P> <P> Before the start of the high school football season, Louis Jones of Venice High  gave little indication that he would have the type of season he has had.  </P> <P> After playing primarily as a defensive back and wide receiver his previous two  varsity seasons, Jones was moved to quarterback during the off-season before  the start of his senior year.  </P> <P> It turned out to be the best decision Venice Co-Coach Al Dellinger could have  made. Jones has become one of the most dominating players in the City Section.  </P> <P> In leading Venice to an 11-0 record, Jones, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound all-purpose  quarterback, has left opponents wondering if there is anything he can't do.  </P> <P> He has played nearly every skill position, and has been the Gondoliers' kicking  specialist, despite having never kicked before. He has accounted for nearly  two-thirds of Venice's points and has amassed more than 1,500 yards in total  offense.  </P> <P> In accounting for 22 touchdowns, Jones has rushed for 13, passed for six,  caught passes for two and returned a fumble for one. He has kicked a 30-yard  field goal and more than a dozen extra points. He has rushed for a two-point  conversion and is averaging nearly 40 yards a punt.  </P> <P> On defense, Jones usually plays free safety, unless Venice needs him at  linebacker, defensive end or to cover the opposing team's best receiver, one on  one. He has five interceptions, seven forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and  is among the team leaders in tackles.  </P> <P> "If we had to play Venice again, I would have Jones kidnaped before the game,"  Westchester Co-Coach Larry Wein said. "The only way to stop him would be for  him not to show up."  </P> <P> Wein should know because two weeks ago, in the Western League championship game  between the schools, Jones was unstoppable in Venice's 29-27 victory. He scored  23 points, including the winning two-point conversion with 13 seconds left in  the game.  </P> <P> "Jones is the biggest impact player in the city," Wein said. "He makes his team  so much better with his winning attitude. He just has the ability to always  make the big play."  </P> <P> Dellinger, who in 25 years of coaching has worked with several players who have  played professional football, calls Jones his best all-around player, ever.  </P> <P> "Louis does everything so well," he said. "He is a leader and a competitor who  comes into every game ready to play. He is like a throwback from an old  football movie with a triple-threat hero. He is an All-American."  </P> <P> Dellinger says that he did not expect Jones to be so successful this season at  running Venice's offense. Jones was originally scheduled to stand in at  quarterback until sophomore Jason Ehlers matured.  </P> <P> "Jones played quarterback during the summer passing leagues, but we were not  certain that he was going to stay at quarterback," Dellinger said. "But once  the season started, it was clear that he was our quarterback. He is an  excellent runner who throws well enough to be dangerous."  </P> <P> Jones says that his quarterback role turned out different than he had planned.  </P> <P> "I thought I'd be more of a passer than a running quarterback," said Jones,  whose stepbrother, Morris Nettles, played professional baseball for the Angels.  "I'm glad that things turned out like they did because this season has been  like a dream. I never thought that I would have so much success and fun at the  same time."  </P> <P> Venice is a strong contender to win its first City football title. Last  Wednesday, Jones rushed for more than 200 yards in Venice's 28-6 win over  Marshall in the first round of the playoffs and Friday night, the undefeated  Gondoliers will play host to Locke.  </P> <P> In the City's Pacific League, Crenshaw and Dorsey have advanced to the second  round of the 4-A Division playoffs, but it hasn't been easy.  </P> <P> Crenshaw, 7-4, earned its spot the hard way, by defeating Wilmington Banning,  6-0, in a 16-play tiebreaker Nov. 20, and then opened the playoffs with a 27-24  victory over San Fernando, two days later.  </P> <P> In the Cougars' win over Banning -- which halted a Pilot playoff-appearance  streak stretching back to 1974 -- Crenshaw needed a dramatic 79-yard touchdown  catch and run by quarterback Derreck Williams on the 11th play of the  tiebreaker.  </P> <P> "Before the play, we were worried that we would run out of plays," said  Williams, who caught the option pass from tailback Kevin Hicks. "Someone needed  to come up with the big play and I'm glad I was able to provide it."  </P> <P> Against San Fernando, Crenshaw again needed late heroics. With 3:17 left in the  game, fullback Sean Lowery scored on a one-yard run on fourth and goal, then  Hicks added a 35-yard touchdown run to hold off the Tigers. Hicks, who has  rushed for more than 1,600 yards this season, had 137 yards against San  Fernando.  </P> <P> Dorsey's problems have been well documented, from the tragic death of Kevin  Copeland to the early ending of its game against Crenshaw because of gunfire  outside Jackie Robinson Stadium.  </P> <P> Thanks to the leadership of Co-Coaches Paul Knox and Eugene McAdoo, the Dons  are 7-3 and have become a force in the 4-A Division. Dorsey won its first-round  playoff game over Reseda Cleveland, 26-0, with junior running back Lamont  Warren, accounting for all of the Dons' points.  </P> <P> "This has been a very difficult season, in which we have had one major and  three or four minor incidents," Knox said, whose Dons will play Palisades  Friday. "I am real proud of the kids and how they have hung in there mentally.  They all have stuck together and believed in each other."  </P> <P> Friday night, in the City 4-A Division quarterfinals, Crenshaw travels to meet  Woodland Hills Taft and Dorsey will play at Palisades.  </P> <P> Last Friday night, Newbury Park was ousted from the Southern Section Division  II football playoffs by Santa Barbara, 28-7. Even so, the Panthers ended their  7-3-1 season on a positive note.  </P> <P> Before the season began, the team and its coaching staff made a commitment to  take an unannounced drug test during the season. Every player's parents agreed  and in late October, the tests were administered to detect any street drugs.  </P> <P> Panther Coach George Hurley reports that no one tested positive.  </P> <P> "If anyone had tested positive, only he and his parents would have been told,"  Hurley said. "However, since there were no positives, I was told about the  results."  </P> <P> Athletes from 12 states and U.S. military overseas bases will compete in the  11th annual Kinney Cross-Country Western Regional Championships Saturday at  Woodwark Park in Fresno. Bryan Dameworth and Deena Drossin of Agoura High are  favorites to win in the boys' and girls' sections, respectively. Dameworth won  his third consecutive state Division I title last Saturday and Drossin won her  second in the last three years.  </P> <P> The first eight runners in each section will represent the West in the Kinney  National Championships, to be held Dec. 9 at Balboa Park in San Diego.  </P> <P> Prep Notes  </P> <P> In City football playoff action, Ivan Wilson rushed for 196 yards and scored  the winning touchdown in South Gate's 20-19 comeback win over Reseda. . . .

Alvarez is expected to play  against Gardena Friday. . . . Westchester hopes to have tailback Tim Holliday  ready for its game against South Gate, the defending 3-A Division champion and  top seed.

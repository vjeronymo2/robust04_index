Japanese Ambassador to China Michihiko Kunihiro and Zie  Zhenhua, director of China's State Environmental Protection  Bureau, signed the treaty, while Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and Chinese Premier Li Peng attended the  signing ceremony.    Under the treaty, Japan and China will boost exchanges  between experts and exchange information to prevent acid rain,  water and air pollution and disposal of noxious waste.    The two nations will also hold joint seminars and meetings  to  discuss cooperation.    The two sides will set up a joint committee to review the  bilateral cooperation once a year.    China relies on coal-fired power stations for more than 70  percent of its electricity. Burning of coal releases large  amounts of sulfur dioxide believed to cause acid rain.    The treaty will be good for two years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Haruyuki Aikawa] </F>   [Text] Washington, 8 Feb -- Whether an accord can be  reached at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks now hinges on  which side will compromise on the numerical target issue. So  far, neither has made any moves toward compromise. However,  some members of the Japanese group engaged in negotiations in  Washington have begun to share a need for concession. Thus,  hard-line officials -- mainly from the Ministry of Finance and  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry -- have once  again called for caution and warned the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs against giving too much consideration to the United  States.    Regarding the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, a  diplomatic source in the United States said: "If the talks  should break down, our efforts accumulated so far will go down  the drain, and such a situation must be avoided." In this way,  he maintained that due consideration should be given to the  United States. His comments indicate that Japan should make  concessions because the U.S. Congress is now moving toward  submitting a bill on retaliatory measures against Japan. At  the same time, the same source was also aware that the views of  Japanese hard-liners must be taken into consideration, and said:  "I am not saying that Japan should make unreasonable  compromises. But what is important is that the talks must be  brought to an appropriate settlement."</p>

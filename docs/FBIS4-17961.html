			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Excerpts] Brussels, 29 Apr -- Russia and the European  Union are completing their consultations on the partnership and  cooperation agreement, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr  Shokhin told an ITAR-TASS correspondent during his brief  stopover in Brussels on his way from the United States to Moscow.    A number of barriers blocking the progress toward agreement  have been removed, said the deputy head of the Russian  Government. He added however that a meeting between him and  Leon Brittan, deputy chairman of the European Commission, would  be necessary to reach a final agreement on questions of  principle. Among other things, they will discuss trade in  enriched uranium. Russia has proposed compromise solutions,  which will have to be developed into approved texts. If this is  achieved, then the agreement could be initialled while Greece is  still chairing the EC -- that is, before the end of June -- and  it could be signed when Germany takes over the chairmanship.    Aleksandr Shokhin, the official head of the Russian  delegation at the talks in Brussels, was delayed in the United  States by the funeral of Richard Nixon, so that his stay in the  "capital of Europe" has been curtailed to just one night. His  meeting with Leon Brittan will take place in Moscow where the  latter is going on 1 May. [passage omitted]    As it deals with global issues, Russia is striving to build  relations on a partnership basis; it does not merely ask for  help but insists that there should be universal rules,  beneficial both to her and to other countries, said Deputy Prime  Minister A. Shokhin. "This will be the leitmotiv in our contacts  both with the G-7 and with international financial organizations  -- not aid in exchange for reforms but creating general  mechanisms of interaction between partners," Aleksandr Shokhin  stressed.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Prescott attacks privatisation - BR sell-off is rejected MR JOHN PRESCOTT, the shadow transport secretary, yesterday blamed the government's ideology of market forces and privatisation for the deterioration of public-transport systems and the environment. His speech, which ended yesterday's debate on the environment, transport and water with a vision of safer, more reliable public transport and a cleaner environment, was greeted with a standing ovation and the congratulations of Mr John Smith. Reliance on market forces to shape policy and services was attacked by other speakers. 'How much longer are we going to be burdened with a government that is prepared to sacrifice both industry and the environment to market forces?' asked Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union. The conference went on to approve a resolution calling for privatised water companies to be brought back under public control. Mr Prescott did not insist on nationalisation of utilities as a cure for all environmental ills. He said he recognised that centralisation of power did not necessarily guarantee a clear environmental record, and so demanded an environmental charter giving individuals the right to information on the environment. Mr Prescott said the import of toxic waste meant Britain had become 'the dustbin of Europe', but the NEC opposed a resolution calling for an immediate end to toxic waste imports because of other clauses demanding the closure of nuclear power stations and a ban on all imports of coal. Mr Tam Dalyell, MP for Linlithgow, was met with jeers when he spoke in support of nuclear power as the 'greenest' energy form. The resolution was narrowly rejected on a card vote. During the transport debate, delegates from several transport unions warned that they would fight the privatisation of British Rail. 'My union won't stand by and let it happen,' said Mr Derrick Fullick, general secretary of Aslef. 'If trains are unsafe we won't run them.' He continued: 'Anyone interested in buying bits of our rail system or taking out a franchise does so for only one reason: to rape the system and pillage its assets. 'One system for the businessman. The champagne express. Another for the typist. The commuter cattle truck.' Mr Richard Rosser of the National Executive Committee condemned the idea of putting BR 'under the hammer and selling it off bit by bit to the highest bidder'. Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union, said that rail fares would rise 142 per cent because of privatisation.</p>

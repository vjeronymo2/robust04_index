Billy Graham, the Rev. Jesse  Jackson and former President Jimmy Carter, who is an active "born again"  Christian.  </P> <P> The latest poll, conducted in 1989, placed President George Bush first, Soviet  Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, Reagan, the Pope, Graham, Lech Walesa, Donald Trump  and Lee Iacocca, Jackson, and, in a tie for 10th, Carter and Bill Cosby.  </P></p>

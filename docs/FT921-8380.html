			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Misawa takes 13% stake in ailing builder MISAWA, a Japanese property group, is to take a 13 per cent stake in Ishihara Construction, an ailing contractor, for an undisclosed sum, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Misawa's purchase of 5.42m Ishihara shares aims to help reconstruct Ishihara, which is in financial trouble because it guaranteed a large debt for steel-frame maker Kyowa, a company at the heart of a political scandal. Kyowa was declared bankrupt last May with debts of about Y200bn (Dollars 1.6bn). Ishihara had guaranteed Y21bn of Kyowa's outstanding debt and has been obliged to put up three Japanese properties and another in Malaysia as collateral for the debt. The contractor had guaranteed loans totalling Y4.6bn for Ohira Sangyo, a failed property group. 'We consider this purchase an investment in the future of Ishihara, which has good engineers and a good reputation for high-rise building construction,' Misawa said. Ishihara is listed on the Tokyo stock exchange's second section. Misawa is the main shareholder of Misawa Homes, the Japanese home builder.</p>

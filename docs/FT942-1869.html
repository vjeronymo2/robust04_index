			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Designer stubble that got burnt: George Michael lost his court battle - but have music companies won Watching George Michael giving evidence in the High Court in London last October, it was difficult not to like him. He was confident and personable, and Mr Justice Jonathan Parker, the presiding judge, was clearly not immune to his charms. In his 273-page judgment yesterday on the singer's dispute with Sony, the music company, the judge described George Michael as 'intelligent and articulate' and 'refreshingly candid' and said that his evidence had been given 'fairly and honestly'. The judgment contained no other good news for the singer. Mr Justice Parker dismissed Michael's claim that his contract with Sony should be declared an unreasonable restraint of trade and therefore unenforceable. The judge said that Sony had behaved fairly towards the singer. He rejected Michael's claim that the company had tried to 'kill' his last album as a punishment for his refusal to appear in a promotional video. The judgment comes as a relief to the music industry which feared that, had George Michael succeeded, dozens of other artists would have demanded changes to their recording contracts. The relief has been tempered, however, by the news that Michael is considering an appeal. Music companies recognise, too, that the George Michael judgment was based on a specific set of circumstances, which might not apply to other artists and contracts. In addition, sympathy for Sony among music companies has been limited throughout the case. Senior executives at rival companies believe Sony should never have allowed its relationship with one of its leading artists to deteriorate to the point where he decided to go to court. In his judgment, Mr Justice Parker said that one of the problems appeared to be the singer's over-sensitivity. He referred to a concert Michael gave in Toronto in 1991, which the singer described as one of the low points in his relationship with Sony. Two senior Sony executives arrived at the concert by private jet. When the singer looked for them after the concert, he was told they had left halfway through. Michael told the court during his evidence: 'I was very offended by this . . . I felt it was actually a fairly deliberate move.' Mr Justice Parker said he was satisfied the two executives had stayed until the encores. He added: 'Mr Michael has demonstrated a degree of touchiness which I find surprising and which needs, in my judgment, to be borne in mind as the story continues and as Mr Michael's relationship with Sony progressively deteriorates.' Some rival music executives take a different view. If you cannot deal with touchy, sensitive individuals, they say, you should not be in the music business. Most artists go through periods of insecurity. Many feel they are not fully appreciated by their companies, the press or the public. The job of a music company manager is to make sure that these feelings do not grow to the point where the artist can no longer perform. If music companies cannot get on with their successful artists any longer, some executives believe they should consider ending their relationship. To reach this point is widely seen as a failure. To go further and engage in a widely-publicised acrimonious legal battle is regarded by many as worse. One executive said yesterday: 'I never see law suits as being happy. This should never have come to court. These things should be settled on the basis of mutual respect.' Other music companies feel, too, that Sony's victory does not mean the contracts with their artists will now escape scrutiny. Had George Michael won the case, other artists would probably have attempted to alter their contracts. His loss might dissuade some from doing so, but music executives said yesterday there would still be legal challenges in the future. Mr Rupert Perry, UK chief executive of EMI Music and chairman of the British Phonographic Industry trade association, said that while the George Michael dispute had attracted more publicity than previous cases, there had been instances of artists challenging their record companies and winning. In 1989, the Court of Appeal found that the contract between Holly Johnson, lead singer of the group Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and the recording company Zang Tumb Tuum was unenforceable. The court said that the contract, lasting up to nine years, was 'grossly one-sided'. Mr Perry said the law appeared to be evolving. It was too soon to draw any definite conclusions from the George Michael case. Mr Justice Parker made it clear that his decision was based on Michael's relatively powerful negotiating position with Sony, resulting from the high level of sales he had achieved and previous successful attempts to renegotiate his contract. The singer's attempts to alter his contract date back to 1983, when George Michael was part of the duo Wham] He claimed then that his contract, with a company called Inner Vision, was an unreasonable restraint of trade and took legal action. This was settled and resulted in a new agreement with CBS, the US entertainment company. Following the break-up of Wham] in 1986, Michael produced his first solo album, Faith, which was a huge commercial success. Michael then asked to renegotiate his contract, so that he would be treated on a par with other superstars. This resulted in a new agreement, requiring Michael to record additional albums, but improving his financial terms. In 1988, CBS was taken over by Sony. The singer spent that year touring outside the UK, which had favourable tax implications for him. He asked Sony to bring forward payment of money due to him, so that he would receive it during his time outside the UK. The company agreed and paid him advances and royalties of over Pounds 11m. In 1990, he successfully renegotiated his contract once more, further improving his terms. However in February 1992, the singer's lawyers told him he could argue that his agreement with Sony was an unreasonable restraint of trade. Six days later, his accountants wrote to Sony requesting an advance of Dollars 1m due for his next album. Sony paid the advance. The judge said that in August 1992, George Michael repaid the advance. In October of that year he started legal action. Mr Justice Parker said that when the contract moved from Inner Vision to CBS, this was the result of an agreement to end a legal dispute. It would not be right for Michael to attempt to claim the subsequent agreements were unenforceable. He had expert legal advice at all times. Moreover, by accepting the Dollars 1m advance he affirmed his agreement with Sony. In a statement after the judgment was announced, Michael said that the renegotiations of his contract were an attempt to improve an agreement first made when he was 18. He added: 'I was trying to make the best of a bad job.' The problem with a recording contract, the singer said, is that when you sign your first one you are stuck with it. 'There is no such thing as resignation for an artist in the music industry. Effectively, you sign a piece of paper at the beginning of your career and you are expected to live with that decision, good or bad, for the rest of your professional life.' Rival music executives believe that if the singer is not successful in any appeal, he and his music company will have to find a way to live with one another. One solution would be to shorten the length of the contract. Sony said yesterday that it looked forward to continuing its relationship with Michael. The singer has said in the past that he would never record for Sony again. One music manager said that would be the end of George Michael's career. 'Kids' tastes change very rapidly. Nobody can afford not to record for years, except Frank Sinatra, of course.'</p>

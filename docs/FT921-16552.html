			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / UN envoy says Croatia and Serbia agree to peace force THE WARRING republics of Serbia and Croatia have agreed to an ambitious plan for a 10,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force to be sent to Yugoslavia, Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy to the country, announced yesterday. 'I have seen steps taken that have not been taken before - the acceptance of our proposed plan in its entirety by both sides,' Mr Vance said after meeting President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. Mr Vance was in an optimistic mood which contrasted with gloomy remarks he made about peace prospects when he arrived in Yugoslavia on Tuesday. 'The situation is radically changed since I came . . . We have a way to go but we, I think, have made some real progress.' His mission is under pressure to achieve a ceasefire and agree on a timetable for deploying peacekeeping troops before January 15. On that day, the European Community is due to decide whether to recognise those republics seeking independence - Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia - subject to certain criteria on human rights and ethnic minorities being met. If the EC goes ahead, it will change the face of the negotiations. Mr Vance said he could not give an exact date for the deployment of UN forces, explaining he would first have to report to new UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali and the UN Security Council. He said he was trying to arrange a meeting today between Croatian and federal defence officials to discuss details of a truce. In spite of his optimism, Mr Vance has made it clear that the UN will not deploy a 'Blue Helmets' peacekeeping force unless an effective ceasefire has taken hold in the fragmenting Balkan state. Fighting in Croatia, which has scuttled 14 ceasefire agreements so far, continued across the breakaway republic yesterday. Zagreb radio reported the first war victims of the new year, saying three people had been killed in fierce clashes between Croatian forces and the federal army around the coastal town of Zadar. Violent clashes around other villages and towns were also reported.</p>

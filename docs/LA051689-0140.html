			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> GRAND JURY CRITICIZES ANIMAL CONTROL POLICIES  </P> <P> A report from the Orange County Grand Jury has recommended improvements in the  administration of the county's Animal Control Shelter, saying its policies and  authority are confused and its employees rude to the public.  </P> <P> "Officers who deal with citizens lack public contact skills," said the report,  which was released Friday. "Complaints received indicate they sometimes lose  their tempers, become rude and provide inadequate explanations to the public  regarding animal treatment."  </P> <P> The report also said that shelter workers must rely on "informal knowledge" of  proper procedures and that the department's policies are "not clearly stated."  </P> <P> It also said the shelter is operating at a deficit, while it should generate  enough revenue to be self-sufficient.  </P> <P> The grand jury recommended that the county provide better training for the  employees, conduct an audit of the department's finances, establish proper  procedures and distinguish the authority of the county from the state  Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> County shelter officials were not available for comment.  </P></p>

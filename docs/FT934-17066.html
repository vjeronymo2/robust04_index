			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Rates continue to nose down - Annuities THE TABLE shows compulsory purchase annuity rates for those with Pounds 100,000 to invest. The top three rates are shown for various ages. RNPFN annuities are only for those in nursing and allied professions. Peter Quinton, of the Annuity Bureau, says: 'Annuity rates have fallen recently to their lowest level in two decades. Britannia Life, Canada Life, Generali, Laurentian Life, Norwich Union, Providence Capitol, Royal Life and RNPFN have all reduced their rates since September 10 1993. London Life is the only company in the past two weeks to have raised its rates.' Billy Burrows, of the London-based Annuity Direct, adds: 'Predictably, annuity rates are still declining in line with falling yields on medium and long gilts, and there is no sign that these yields will increase in the short term. In today's climate of low interest rates, pensioners need to spend more time planning their pension to avoid being locked into a low pension for life. 'With-profits, phased retirement and Equitable Life's new managed annuity provide good alternatives to conventional annuities. This is because the annuitant is not locked into a low-yielding annuity but will receive a pension with the potential to increase in line with the investment growth of the underlying pension fund. Index-linked annuities will also give good value for money if future inflation tops 5 per cent for any length of time.' Figures by the Annuity Bureau, Enterprise House, 59-65 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PQ (tel. 071-620 4090).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ANNUITY RATES AS AT 29 SEPTEMBER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Compulsory purchase annuity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 50         Annuity   Female age 50        Annuity                      Pounds                         Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equitable Life     8,997.96   Equitable Life      8,373.96 RNPFN              8,698.68   RNPFN               8,210.88 General Accident   8,410.56   Scottish Widows     7,900.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 60         Annuity   Female age 60        Annuity                      Pounds                         Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equitable Life    10,629.96   Equitable Life      9,447.00 RNPFN             10,415.64   RNPFN               9,438.36 General Accident  10,054.92   Royal Life          8,872.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 70         Annuity   Female age 70        Annuity                      Pounds                         Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RNPFN             13,943.16   RNPFN              12,009.12 Equitable Life    13,580.04   Equitable Life     11,652.96 Norwich Union     13,039.00   Royal Life         11,176.65  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Joint life annuity with 100 per cent spouses benefit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 60/Female 50   Annuity   Male 70/Female 60    Annuity                      Pounds                         Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equitable Life     8,139.00   Equitable Life      9,051.00 RNPFN              7,892.04   RNPFN               8,978.28 Scottish Widows    7,706.52   Royal Life          8,534.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All payments are monthly in advance.

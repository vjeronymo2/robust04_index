The application of taxes affects all citizens,  especially Albanians, because the Albanians of Presheva have  many family relations with the Albanians of Macedonia, who have  unjustly been divided by artificial borders. Since the first of  January 1994, the border authorities of rump Yugoslavia demand  10 DM per person and 30 DM per vehicle before leaving them to  pass the border.</p>

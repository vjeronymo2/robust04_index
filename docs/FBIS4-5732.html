Unlike previous trade fairs, this trade fair took  place after the United States lifted its trade embargo against  Vietnam, thus allowing for the participation of giant foreign  companies and consortiums. Some countries had as many as 40  exhibition booths each. After a period of interruption because  of difficulties on their part, the Russian Federation and East  European countries, which were Vietnam's former trade partners,  have returned to the Vietnamese market. They participated in  this fair with dozens of exhibition booths."    We had an encounter with Mr. Aleksandr Araganov, marketing  director of the Voltine Volgagrade company. He told us of the  past trade cooperation between his company and other Vietnamese  trade partners.    He said: "We regard Vietnam as a big trade partner. Earlier  our Voltine company sold many car tire products in the  Vietnamese market even during the period when the U.S. trade  embargo was still in place. The financial settlement between  our company and your country had some difficulties, but both  sides sought to tackle this problem by exporting their goods in  the form of barter trade. Although there are many companies now  advertising their car tire products in Vietnam, we are not  balked at facing such competition because the tires manufactured  by the Voltine company are destined for use by heavy-duty trucks  and agricultural machines."    This was the first time for the United States to participate  in the Vietnam International Trade Fair with large consortiums  and companies such as Coca Cola and the Chrysler Auto  Manufacturing Consortium. Mr. Sirigaba, a representative at the  Chrysler Jeep truck booth, said: "The Chrysler consortium in  particular and other American companies in general were very  pleased to see the U.S. embargo against Vietnam being lifted.  We are also very excited to make a comeback to do trade  business with Vietnam. We affirm that Vietnam with over 70  million in population is an important market."    He went on: "It is regrettable that we have been a little  bit late entering the Vietnamese market when compared to other  countries."    Among those participating in the fair were Japan, China, the  Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The fair, which  was held at the Giang Vo exhibition complex in Hanoi, featured  over 350 exhibition booths which were organized into nine  sections. This year the volume of goods on display at the fair  were three to four times as many as that in last year.    "The U.S.-owned Cola Cola company tried to reduce the price  of its products below production cost for competitive and  advertising purposes. But because of the poor customer-service  attitude adopted by its personnel, the company's products were  not welcomed by customers. Whereas, all the refreshment soft  drinks -- a product manufactured under the joint venture between  Vietnam's (Pecatro) company and the Russian Federation -- of the  Minsk company's booth, were sold out thanks to its guaranteed  qualities and hospitable attitude of its customer service  personnel."    Worthy of note is that "only two hours after the opening of  the trade fair, the booth of the VINACOMEX Import-Export  Construction Company, was able to ink a contract to sell a  shovelling machine worth $210,000. Thanks to the display of  their unique indigenous products, the booths of Thai Binh and  Hai Hung Provinces were also able to attract many some dozens of  foreign trade delegations which came to discuss business  affairs. With the Thai Binh booth in particular, foreign  customers agreed to purchase relatively large quantities of  metal products and bicycle parts."    Many people believed that the results obtained from this  fair  exceeded our expectations.</p>

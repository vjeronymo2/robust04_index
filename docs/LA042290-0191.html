			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> SCRAPE, SPACKLE, SAND BEFORE WALLPAPERING  </P> <P> Take care to invest in the care and cleaning of walls before redecorating them  with new coverings.  </P> <P> First, scrape away peeling paint and sand smooth.  </P> <P> Then apply a spackling compound over scraped areas, cracks or nail holes. Prime  all patched areas.  </P> <P> Flat oil-base painted walls need only washing and light sanding after patched  areas are primed.  </P> <P> Walls painted with low-quality paint need a priming over the entire wall.  </P> <P> Glossy painted surfaces are too slick to hold coverings. Dull them by sanding.  Then, wash with an extra-strong trisodium phosphate solution or a soap and  ammonia mix. Rinse thoroughly.  </P> <P> For papered walls, remove old wall coverings. Newer strippable coverings peel  off readily, but one of these methods may be needed for older coverings:  </P> <P>  -- Scrape paper from the wall with a scraper. Then, remove paste residue with  steel wool and warm water. Rinse thoroughly.  </P> <P>  -- Rent a steamer.  </P> <P>  -- Sponge or spray on a remover sold at hardware stores, following label  instructions. Repair and prepare stripped walls as for painted walls.  </P></p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Unigate helped to 20% rise by acquisitions A ONE-FIFTH rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 50.3m at Unigate, the food and distribution group, was 'a good performance in difficult trading conditions,' chairman Sir Brian Kellett said. However, the rise owed much to acquisitions and one-off items. The group warned that profits growth would slow in the second half. Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive, said promotions by retailers were causing sharp fluctuations in fresh food volume, which made production inefficient and squeezed margins. He said Unigate would work aggressively with retailers not against them. But he questioned whether retailers would benefit from price cutting. 'I would suggest not,' he said. Price cuts had particularly hit low-fat spreads and yoghurts. However, good volume growth had been achieved in desserts. Operating profits from dairies rose by half to Pounds 18.6m as acquisitions, such as Clifford Foods, were integrated. Three dairies had been closed and the group now produced a third more milk. Mr Buckland said the dairy business had a good future, although doorstep deliveries of milk - where margins are higher - were declining at an annual rate of 10 to 12 per cent. Margins on supermarket milk were unsatisfactory, he said, although volumes had risen. Unigate, which has 16 per cent of the liquid milk market in England and Wales, would be 'pleased to buy milk in whichever way dairy farmers wish to sell it,' once the Milk Marketing Board was abolished next year. He was confident the group could buy the amount of milk it needed at the right price under the auction system proposed by Milk Marque, the successor body. During the half there was a cash outflow of Pounds 70.1m, of which Pounds 20.1m represented excess of acquisitions over disposals. This increased net debt to Pounds 172.1m from Pounds 98.2m at the previous year-end, giving gearing of 52.8 per cent. The interest charge rose from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 7.1m, but interest cover was 'healthy' at seven times, Mr John Worby, finance director, said. The rise in debt was partly caused by the cancellation of the sale of Unigate's US restaurant business. Mr Buckland said the aim was to float this in the next 12 to 18 months, but Unigate could make more acquisitions before then. He indicated these could be in continental Europe.

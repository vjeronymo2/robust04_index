			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Honduras poll win for Liberal Mr Carlos Roberto Reina of the centre-right Liberal party has ousted the National party in a landslide presidential election victory in Honduras. With 80 per cent of the vote counted, according to the national electoral tribunal, he was leading his chief rival Mr Oswaldo Ramos of the governing conservative National party by 52 per cent to 41 per cent, the largest margin since civilian government was restored in 1981. The Liberal party was also expected to secure majorities in congress and the municipalities from Sunday's vote. Mr Reina, an urbane 67-year-old former president of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, said as he claimed victory that he would implement a 'moral revolution' in public service. He has promised to attack rampant government corruption, and reform partisan state institutions, including the judiciary and the national electoral tribunal which organises elections. According to a political analyst close to the Liberals, Mr Reina's chances of implementing the reforms will depend on how quickly and effectively he can create his own team and marginalise traditional party barons. Despite accusations from Mr Ramos that he was a communist, Mr Reina, who takes office in January, has said he will continue to honour Honduras's Dollars 3.6bn foreign debt, and the structural adjustment programme with the Washington-based international financial institutions. He said he would, however, add a 'human face' to the programme - which may be difficult in the face of declining foreign aid. The plan was implemented in 1990 by President Rafael Callejas of the National party, who renegotiated foreign debt and paid some Dollars 600m in arrears, began a privatisation programme, and liberalised the economy. Although the economy has stabilised this year and the government is predicting 6 per cent growth, rising prices of basic foodstuffs, a swift devaluation of the lempira, plus an increase in poverty, produced a 'punishment vote' against the National party, say observers. The country of 5.5m people has some of the poorest social indicators in the Americas. Despite a growth in non-traditional exports, including shrimp and melons, it remains captive to the volatile prices of coffee and bananas, which account for almost two-thirds of exports. One central challenge for Mr Reina will be to reform the Honduran army, the dominant political force in recent decades.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Mondale presses Tokyo on rice THE US yesterday increased pressure on Japan to reduce its trade surplus, in the week before a fresh round of trade talks. There was 'fundamental agreement on foreign policy and security issues' between the US and Japan, 'yet it is urgent that we correct the economic imbalance between us,' said Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan. Mr Mondale also urged Tokyo to remove its traditional ban on imported rice and allow foreign rice sales subject to import duties. Japan should accept a proposal in Gatt's Uruguay Round to replace all non-tariff barriers to agricultural trade with tariffs: this would be 'good for Japanese farmers and consumers', said Mr Mondale. The first round of talks in Hawaii last month, to implement the framework trade and economic accord struck last July, in which Japan has undertaken to try to curb its record trade surplus, was only a preliminary. 'Serious negotiations' would begin in Tokyo next week when both sides meet again, said Mr Mondale, speaking at his first press confidence since taking the Tokyo post in August. This comes as Japanese politicians are beginning to show flexibility on rice imports, which already happen in small amounts but are regarded as taboo. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, recently elected premier, still benefits from record popularity ratings, and has hinted that Japan should consider lifting the ban. The question has been given fresh relevance by a bad harvest, obliging the government to allow 200,000 tonnes of emergency imports of industrial grade rice, the first for nine years. But for the time being, the Tokyo government is officially abiding by a unanimous parliamentary resolution against foreign rice and feels under no pressure to discuss rice in Gatt until the EC and Japan resolve their own differences on farm trade.</p>

This document confirms Moscow's readiness to continue  rendering every possible economic assistance and support to  fraternal Kyrgyzstan.    During his talks with Akayev, Kozyrev described Kyrgyzstan  as  one of Russia's closest allies. "I've always said that we are  not alien to each other, although many have accused me of  imperialism for such words," said the Russian minister. "What  can be more normal than stating that we are vitally interested  in each other," he said.    President Akayev said that the new program was aimed at  checking the outflow of ethnic Russians from Kyrgyzstan. He  believes that the Russian foreign minister's current visit will  help support the industrial enterprises mostly employing ethnic  Russians.    Akayev also said that the Kyrgyz defense enterprises  employing ethnic Russians and their Russian partners should have  equal access to raw materials and equipment. "This is not going  to be a one-way street," he said. "If large packages of Kyrgyz  enterprises' shares go to Russia, these enterprises will carry  on, providing thousands of people with jobs," he added. He also  thinks that this would enhance ethnic Russians' confidence.    As an example of the efforts to raise the ethnic Russians'  status he referred to the establishment of a Kyrgyz-Slavic  university in Bishkek which is training 200 students. To quote  the Kyrgyz president, this university "is expected to calm the  Slavic ethnic groups living in Kyrgyzstan, because their  children will be able to receive an education in their native  language."    The program also contains measures to ensure that the  teaching of the Russian language, the language of inter-state  communication in the CIS, is not reduced. "The Kyrgyz people  cannot neglect the great source of Russian culture," said Akayev.    He is convinced that only jointly with Russia can Kyrgyzstan  solve the problems facing ethnic Russians. "We can solve  psychological problems and create an atmosphere of good will,"  he said. However, on its own Kyrgyzstan will fail to solve the  economic aspects of this problem, he concluded.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for  foreign affairs, has said that Jordan's rights to land and water  must be assured. The refugees issue must also be sorted out in  line with UN resolutions, including Resolution 194, the minister  told a delegation of the American Peace Now Group, who were  calling at his office in Amman today. The minister outlined to  the delegation, visiting Jordan in the course of a regional  tour, Middle East developments with special accent on the peace  process and Jordan's key role there. Al-Hasan reiterated  Jordan's abiding commitment to a just, durable, and  comprehensive peace based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242  and 338, the land-for-peace formula, a complete Israeli pullback  from the occupied Arab territories, and legitimate rights of the  Palestinian people on their national soil.    The minister spelled out the burdens placed on Jordan by the  Palestinian question over the past four decades and the economic  difficulties faced by Jordan as a result of the siege of the  Port of al-'Aqabah. On the latter case, al-Hasan emphasized  that this unjustified blocakade must be brought to an end in  light of Jordan's contribution and constructive and positive  approach to the peace process.    The minister outlined to the delegation Jordan's democratic  experience, its pluralistic multiparty system, and its respect  for human rights as an irreversible option advocated by His  Majesty King Husayn.    On their side, the American delegation applauded Jordan's  preeminent and significant contribution to the efforts to make  peace and bring stability and security to the region. They were  impressed by the major achievements made by Jordan and  appreciated the difficulties it has been experiencing. They  also expressed the need to extend assistance to Jordan to help  it play its anticipated role in the peace process and to bring  security and stability to the region.    The meeting was attended by the American ambassador in Amman  and Foreign Ministry officials.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aids epidemic likely to hit African copper supplies THE AIDS epidemic will make a gradual, but unavoidable, impact on copper mining in Zaire and Zambia, two of the world's biggest producers of the metal, suggest the Economist Intelligence Unit in a special report today. In an otherwise fairly optimistic view of world copper consumption, demand and prices, it says: 'Essentially, the danger is that skilled workers, supervisors and managers will die of Aids faster than replacements can be trained. 'The result will be not a sudden collapse in mine output. Rather there will be a slow but steady increase in the incidence of breakdowns, accidents, delays and misjudgements, and output will suffer.' The report shows that copper mine production in the two countries peaked at 1.2m tonnes in 1974 and gradually fell to 850,000 tonnes in 1990. The EIU sees their combined output falling to 600,000 tonnes by 1993 before recovering a little in the following three years. Mr Peter Parkinson, author of the report, says that transport systems in the African copper belt will always be precarious and will also be affected by the Aids epidemic. So the amount of copper in the 'pipeline' will tend to increase. 'The political conditions under which the mines have to operate may also deteriorate. Ironically, (at present) there is some hope for the emergence of more open and pluralistic political systems in both Zaire and Zambia, but there is a clear danger that, as the epidemic fastens its grip, the normal constraints of civil society will tend to give way.' The report points out that Indonesia is emerging to take up some of the slack caused by Africa's problems and is becoming a 'sizeable low-cost producer.' Between 1990 and 1996 the EIU forecasts Indonesia's copper output will jump by 85 per cent to 315,000 tonnes. Mr Parkinson suggests copper companies will take a lesson from their precious metal counterparts and in future attempt to stabilise revenue through long-term forward sales and linked loan techniques. 'This may lead to downward pressure on prices, as has happened with gold and silver, and hence to lower profits and/or continued efforts to reduce costs. In the shorter run this will be of most benefit to the more efficient producers; in the longer run it will be of greater benefit to those with higher ore grades.'

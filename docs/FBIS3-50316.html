This change is  evidenced by a more flexible form given to the "Partnership for  Peace" programme.    During a press conference for Polish journalists on Tuesday  Minister Olechowski said that his talks with Strobe Talbott  designated as deputy secretary of state focused on the situation  in Russia while his meeting with head of the National Security  Council Anthony Lake centred on the "Partnership for Peace"  programme which Poland accepted two weeks ago.    Olechowski informed the Polish newsmen that at the end of  this week a NATO mission will leave Brussels for Poland to  discuss the military, technical and financial details of the  "Partnership for Peace".    Warsaw will be the first central European capital to be  visited by the mission, the minister stressed.    "We have explained (to the American side) that we may not  have the financial resources to fund our military participation  in the programme. Therefore, joint excercises and other  improvement efforts should be an object of common financial  care," Olechowski said.    On the same day, Olechowski met with a representative of the  National Security Council Jane Walker to discuss the possible  European regional initiatives that the United States would be  interested in. He also held talks with leader of the American  Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations  (AFL- CIO) Lane Kirkland.    On Monday evening, the Polish foreign minister attended a  dinner given in his honour by the Breton Woods Institute and the  Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.    In a speech delivered on the occasion Olechowski favourably  assessed the "Partnership for Peace" initiative but stressed  that Poland considered it to be just the first stage leading to  NATO membership.    "The Partnership for Peace obviously increases our security.  It opens the North Atlantic alliance to the East which makes  more realistic our hopes for joining the Western security  structures," he said. He also stressed that the programme  imposed a stronger obligation on partner-countries to protect  democratic societies and their freedoms.    Simultaneously, Olechowski pointed out that countries such  as  Poland which are determined to enter NATO, should be presented  with concrete criteria of joining the alliance as well as with a  timetable of the admission process.    Referring to the statements by President Bill Clinton and  Vice- President Al Gore that the security of the central  European region is directly important for the security of the  United States, Olechowski declared: "We expect the United States  to fulfil this obligation and ensure that Poland and other  countries of the Visegrad group become actively engaged in the  partnership for peace which should systematically and quickly  bring them closer to NATO membership."    "The Americans understand the fears of Poland and the  neighbouring states much better than the Europeans who are self-  assured but lack a vision, Olechowski also declared.    Minister Olechowski also met in Washington on Tuesday with  two influential members of the U.S. Congress, Congressman Dan  Rostenkowski and Senator Sam Nunn.    Rostenkowski is to present to President Bill Clinton the  Polish foreign minister's suggestions concerning Poland's  participation in the "Partnership for Peace."    Nunn who heads the Senate Armed Forces Committee promised in  his conversation with Olechowski to see to it that means for the  "Partnership for Peace" programme be found in the American  defence budget.</p>

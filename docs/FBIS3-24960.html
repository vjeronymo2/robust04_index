			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], has accused the U.S. State Department of  aiming to hinder his possible visit to the United States by  issuing its annual report on the situation of human rights in  Mozambique. Reacting to the report, Dhlakama described it as  artificial and said it comes at a time when the Renamo president  is preparing to visit Washington. Afonso Dhlakama said that the  U.S. State Department report is meant for the U.S. public not to  consider the Renamo leader as a politician. The report  denounces serious human rights violations in areas controlled by  Renamo, namely, the torture, abduction, and killing of people.</p>

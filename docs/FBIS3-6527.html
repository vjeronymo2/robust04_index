Japan sought an increase while the EU asserted that the  quota  should be unchanged from 1993.    In 1993, both sides agreed to cut Japan's exports by 18.5  percent from the previous year to 980,000 vehicles in light of  slumping demand in Europe.    They will try again to reach an agreement Friday, the second  day of the bilateral talks at the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry (MITI), according to the negotiators.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (18): How to spot a troubled company  -Quick ratio The 'quick ratio', or 'acid-test ratio', is commonly seen as cutting to the very heart of a business's viability, for it simply measures its ability to pay its creditors in the short term. Calculation of the ratio is straight-forward and requires the current assets (minus the stock) to be divided by the current liabilities. Ratios of less than 1.0 do not necessarily spell misery. A supermarket, for example, because it sells goods for cash before paying for them, will often operate with quick ratios well below one. In this sector 0.2 is common. Therefore quick ratios should always be seen in relation to others in the same sector and of the same type. A declining trend in a quick ratio may signal trouble ahead. Underlying such a trend might be a rising overdraft; and some sort of statement should therefore be sought out in the annual accounts. It is worth noting that, for this test, creditors falling due within one year should be considered to be current liabilities, although under the requirements of the Companies Act this is not always easy to work out. A drawback to the quick ratio is that it was designed to examine the cash flow of a company at a time when that was often obscured and the information was not in the balance sheet or the profit-and-loss account. Since the publication of Financial Reporting Standard 1, in 1992, companies have been required to include a cash-flow statement, which replaces the much discredited funds flow statement. Now, the information which the quick ratio sought to illuminate is readily available. The real problem with the quick ratio is that implied by its name. Single-ratio appraisals of a company's worth are now frowned upon by the regulators and standard setters unless they are used properly - and never in isolation. Allister Wilson, partner with Ernst and Young, accountants, and one of the authors of the monumental UK GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principals), says the quick ratio is potentially dangerous and should be used with care. Anyone tempted should ask themselves: where is the cash, and where are the creditors? Cross-border problems could undermine liquidity. And the problem with current assets is that, although stock is taken out, other long-term debits can creep in, such as that from a pension fund. Mr Wilson prefers, in this particular case, to use the cash flow over the total debt as a measure of liquidity - with the total debt including off-balance sheet items like lease liabilities. But the warning is clear: 'One ratio means absolutely nothing.'</p>

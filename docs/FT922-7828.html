			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MacSharry seeks 'understanding' on farm policies THE US and the EC could conclude the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks if they tried harder to understand each other's contributions in farm subsidy cuts, according to Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner. That is the issue blocking agreement in the five-and-a-half-year-old Round, but Mr MacSharry believes an agreement 'could be close' - only if the US understood and accepted what the EC was prepared to do in reforming its farm sector. The commissioner's purpose was to lay out the critical issues and identify where there were areas of flexibility, to 'get us over the bar on Gatt', the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is conducting the Round. Mr MacSharry said that willingness of the US and Gatt to exclude the EC's planned compensation payments to farmers for price cuts from the Round's subsidy cuts schedule 'holds the key to an agreement'. The 'final act' of the Round, drawn up last December by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt general director, excluded these payments from its 'green box' for subsidies that did not encourage production and therefore distort trade. The compensation payments, which the EC may approve next week as a central component of the MacSharry plan to reform the common agricultural policy, are conditional on all but small farmers taking land out of production. 'We have given absolute guarantees that they will reduce production,' Mr MacSharry said, adding that they were 'more specific than Dunkel's green box.' 'This is the real contribution the community is making,' the commissioner argued. He said it was politically impossible for the EC to accept the US suggestion that these payments be allowed for six years but then become regressive. Most member states agree with Mr MacSharry, but the UK and Netherlands attach more importance to preventing a Gatt agreement from restricting exports. The Dunkel text requires a 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised exports over six years, as well as a 36 per cent cut in export subsidies. Mr MacSharry said this was 'a fact of life and there will have to be (volume restraint) commitments.' But he said that 'at the end of the day, if people don't want to come off that 24 per cent, there are other avenues which will enable the EC to make its contribution on (restraining) exports.' The other method is so-called 'aggregation', whereby volume cuts would be delivered by sectors rather than products, enabling the EC to cut more, say, on skimmed milk powder and barley, and less on higher-added-value products such as cheese and bread-making wheat. But the US has shown no inclination to allow this edge to the EC's most competitive products. Mr MacSharry accepted that there was no indication that the US was moving towards the EC, but underlined that there were still 'talks on an almost daily basis' between the two sides at all levels.</p>

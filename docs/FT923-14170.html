			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Schering in talks over selling chemical units SCHERING, the German pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, is negotiating with Viag, the industrial company, and an unnamed US group about the sale of its industrial and organic chemicals subsidiaries. Schering said talks were in their final stages and that a decision was expected by early next month. Industrial chemicals contributed DM454m (Dollars 298.6m) out of total group sales last year of DM6.3bn and organic chemicals made up DM440m. Mr Giuseppe Vita, the chairman of Schering, said the group planned to concentrate on pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals in which it had 54 per cent and 28 per cent of sales respectively in the first quarter of this year. In a separate move, Schering also offered to sell its electroplating division which had sales of DM329 last year. Mr Vita said the divisions up for sale had performed successfully in profitable niche markets but that these were too small to warrant expansion. Schering is concentrating the research and development activities of its two US pharmaceuticals subsidiaries at a former Chevron oil company site in Richmond, California. It is also investing a record DM700m this year in new research and production facilities in Germany and North America. Schering, like other companies with production facilities in Berlin, is feeling the impact of reduced federal subsidies for the city such as lower VAT and corporate taxes which are to be phased out by 1994. But the company's high profitability has enabled it to easily absorb the extra costs.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENCY OKS GUIDELINES FOR PRICING OF AUTO INSURANCE  </P> <P> The state Office of Administrative Law gave its approval Friday to regulations  issued last week by Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie that strike down  the use of sex and marital status in setting auto insurance rates. The  regulations also would curtail insurers' use of neighborhood-based pricing and  impose a cap pegged to the consumer price index on annual premium rate  increases.  </P> <P> The approval, which was required before the regulations could become legally  effective, included an amendment that appears to even further diminish use of  neighborhood or ZIP code-based pricing.  </P> <P> The amendment submitted by Gillespie could mean a more drastic decrease in auto  insurance prices for urban drivers, particularly in Los Angeles and San  Francisco, than had been envisioned when Gillespie issued her regulations Dec.  5.  </P> <P> However, a spokesman for California's insurers said Friday that a broad-based  lawsuit to invalidate the regulations is inevitable. The spokesman, Ed Levy of  the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, said the insurers simply cannot  live with a regulation that forces them to lower their prices sharply in urban  areas without permitting them to recoup these decreases by raising their rates  sharply in rural and suburban localities.  </P> <P> Linda Stockdale Brewer, director of the Office of Administrative Law, said her  office had required Gillespie to offer the amendment on the neighborhood-based  pricing question because public comments had indicated that the original  wording of the regulation was unclear.  </P> <P> As always with implementation of Proposition 103 -- the insurance initiative  approved by voters last year -- the matter is highly complicated.  </P> <P> Under the regulations issued by Gillespie last week, insurers are required to  give the most weight in setting auto insurance prices to three factors  specifically mentioned by Proposition 103 -- a driver's safety record, the  number of miles he or she drives annually, and the number of years of driving  experience, in that order.  </P> <P> But, in the regulations as originally worded, Gillespie also allowed the  insurers to use 25 "optional" pricing factors, of which nine could be construed  as substitutes for a driver's home address or ZIP code. At the time, this was  generally interpreted as allowing the insurers to add up each of the optional  factors to a total pricing weight that could easily exceed the three factors  named by Proposition 103.  </P> <P> In other words, if each of the nine substitute factors -- such as a locality's  population density, its vehicle density, its accident frequency or its  litigation rates -- were ascribed a 4% rate, the total weight given to those  factors could amount to 36%, or more than the 25% that might be given to the  safety-record factor named by Proposition 103. This would have minimized  downward price adjustments in the urban areas.  </P> <P> At the request of the Office of Administrative Law, however, Gillespie amended  this late Thursday to indicate that a driver's record, miles driven and years  of experience would have to account for approximately 75% of the price, and all  the optional factors combined could not exceed approximately 25%.  </P> <P> This, if it goes into effect after the 150-day adjustment period Gillespie has  set, could mean radically lower prices in urban areas.  </P> <P> The cap of about 5% on cost-of-living increases in all other areas that  Gillespie set last week was not changed by this week's amendments.  </P> <P> Gillespie's special attorney for the implementation of Proposition 103, Karl  Rubinstein, said Friday that he did not think the amendment was really any  substantial change in what Gillespie had said in her regulations in the first  place, but both insurer and consumer representatives sharply disagreed with  him.  </P> <P> "Of course this is a major change," said Levy, an official of the industry's  most important Sacramento lobby. "It makes it clear that territorial ratings  (neighborhood or ZIP code-based prices) must be subordinated. If there was ever  any doubt we would have to sue, this removes it."  </P> <P> Harvey Rosenfield, author of Proposition 103, agreed with Levy that the  amendment does subordinate the neighborhood-based prices much more than the  original wording of the regulations did.  </P></p>

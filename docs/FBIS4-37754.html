			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Hadi Tu'mah: "The Separatists and </F> This Cheap Lying"]    [Text] Since their condemned separatist movement, the  renegades in Yemen have been making false accusations against  Iraq whenever their subversive movement's link with the Saudi  and Gulf rulers has been exposed, their military situation has  become critical, and their resistance has weakened before the  advance of the unionist legitimacy.    The last of these exposed lies is the claim about the arrest  of five Iraqi pilots who, in fact, are teachers of fine arts and  physical education. Iraqi and Yemeni departments have documents  proving they are nothing more than teachers.    It is clear from the course of events that this absurd claim  coincided with the successive defeats of the separatists and the  emergence of a suspect role spearheaded by Riyadh on behalf of  Washington against the Arab nation and its legitimate  advancement. This confirms the deep involvement of the  separatist clique in the hostile plan of Washington and Zionism  to undermine Arab will and the source of its strength. It also  confirms the failure of the agent clique's suspect plot.    If these are some of the reasons for the separatist clique's  resort to the fabrication of lies against Iraq, the other reason  is the clean Arab stand Iraq has adopted in support of  legitimacy and the unity state, which is a result of the will of  the Yemeni people and all their political parties, including  that of the separatists themselves. Another reason is the mean  and trivial attempt of the separatists to exploit the anomalous  political attitude toward Iraq, due to the mean conspiratorial  role played by the clique of Gulf rulers, the odious attempt on  Yemeni legitimacy, and the attempt to carry out a reactionary  movement embodied by the condemned secession. This imposed Gulf  stand has been condemned by the unionists of southern Yemen,  headed by Muhammad Basandwah.    No sooner had the subject of Saudi military intervention  been  exposed, especially by the Yemeni legitimacy forces' seizure of  80 tanks, than the separatists made up the lie about the arrest  of five Iraqis, and Saudi television showed pictures of these  Iraqis. The Saudi regime and its overlords know better. These  Iraqis are just teachers.    This method of making false accusations and instigations,  despite the aforementioned facts, confirms the miserable  political and moral bankruptcy of the clique of separatists and  those standing behind them. It also acquits Iraq of any charges.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Zhang Libi [1728 4409 1804], </F> Fang Zhaoyin [2455 5128 1377], et al. of the Institute of  Virology, Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, Beijing]    [Text] Twenty-four strains of poliovirus type 1 isolated in  12 different provinces in China were sequenced in the VP1/2A  region (150 nucleotides) by the dideoxy chain termination  method. After comparing these sequences with the Sabin 1  reference strain and with 15 strains from province Taiwan and  other neighboring countries using the gene alignment program  from the PCGene, two dendrograms were constructed. We found six  independent genotypes among the Chinese viruses and 14 genotypes  among the world viruses. This interesting finding strongly  suggested that there were molecular epidemiological  relationships among viruses from China and other countries.</p>

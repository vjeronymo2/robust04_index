			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CORONA AGAIN AT REDEVELOPMENT CROSSROADS;  </P> <P> DOWNTOWN: LEADERS OF THE GROWING RIVERSIDE COUNTY COMMUNITY SEE A NEED TO  ATTRACT ITS NEW RESIDENTS TO THE CITY'S CORE.  </P> <P> When the Riverside Freeway opened almost 30 years ago, it was a boon to  motorists but a blow to downtown Corona, supplanting what was once a bustling  commercial district along 6th Street as the primary route to the coast.  </P> <P> Downtown interests fought back, partly rebuilding Corona's historic core in  time to benefit from the boom of the 1980s, when the city almost doubled in  size as newcomers found it a haven of relative affordability and convenience.  </P> <P> But civic leaders today, wary of early signs of decay and the recent flight of  at least one longtime business, are now suggesting that it may be time again to  redevelop.  </P> <P> While some hope that downtown will regain pre-eminence as the city's retail  center, others want to solidify the gains that attracted banks, real estate  agencies and insurance offices.  </P> <P> Crime has increased in the past five years downtown and there still is an acute  lack of parking. Redevelopment could persuade white-collar businesses to remain  and might also prevent the area from becoming a collection of abandoned  mini-malls and cheap motels, civic leaders believe.  </P> <P> "It's at a point where it could go either way," said Kent Hansen, the immediate  past president of the Corona Downtown Business Assn. ". . . It could be a row  of junk shops or it could be something we are proud of."  </P> <P> Over the past decade, growth has been explosive, with many living in Corona and  commuting to work in Orange and Los Angeles counties. But instead of buying  downtown, many new residents have chosen to shop at regional centers in Orange  County or at new retail strip malls near their own neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The result has been what some residents say is a disjointed city lacking a  central retail business district.  </P> <P> "For many people, they need a sense of focus for their community," said Susanna  Branch, a member of the Corona Historic Preservation Society. "Many people want  our town to have a feeling that it's not just a place to sleep."  </P> <P> The Downtown Business Assn. has asked the City Council to study the entire area  within Grand Boulevard, which forms a circle around downtown and the city's  historic residential neighborhoods.  </P> <P> In addition to redevelopment, the association also has proposed creating a  business- and parking-improvement district to better promote the downtown area,  beautify decaying buildings and provide extra security to blighted areas. Under  the plan, improvements would be funded through a 35% surcharge on business  licenses issued each year. The City Council is expected to take up the matter  in June.  </P> <P> If Corona chooses to redevelop, it would be the second time the city has  attempted to revive its core.  </P> <P> Sixth and Main streets, in the middle of the proposed redevelopment area, were  once the central shopping areas. The streets, crossing in Corona's center, were  home to many small merchants and a major department store, J.C. Penney.  </P> <P> But the area declined with the coming of the Riverside Freeway, and by the late  1960s numerous businesses had moved out of decaying buildings -- many of which  dated to the turn of the century -- and left the downtown area altogether. So  Corona city leaders, vowing to restore downtown as the hub of the city's retail  activity, launched a redevelopment project. The key was the construction of  Corona Mall, an outdoor shopping center spread over two blocks near Main and  6th streets.  </P> <P> But the mall failed to attract a major department store and by 1980 had become  dominated by the offices of lawyers, Realtors and insurers. Half a dozen  restaurants and several dozen specialty shops have remained.  </P> <P> Jim Pauly, then vice chairman of the Redevelopment Commission, said the project  failed to blossom because it lacked the full support of merchants and  politicians. But he insists that the project still managed to prevent a total  disaster.  </P> <P> "If we hadn't done what we had done, we would have lost the whole downtown  area," said Pauly, who co-owns Emerson-Pauly Men's Wear, which is located in  the Corona Mall. "It would have turned into a slum."  </P> <P> Now some feel there's again a threat to downtown. A First Interstate Bank  branch, located just a block east of the Corona Mall, recently announced that  it would move out.  </P> <P> "That became somewhat of a call to action for businesses," said George  Guayante, the city's redevelopment director.  </P> <P> Arne Leavitt, manager of the branch, said the bank simply needs more parking  space.  </P> <P> Other downtown businesses have complained of drug activity and prostitution on  East 6th Street, Police Chief John Cleghorn said. There also have been more  reports of vagrancy and panhandling, and the area now includes several  transient hotels.  </P> <P> Cleghorn said that although such crime isn't rampant, trying to control it has  been frustrating.  </P> <P> "It's a cyclic kind of thing," Cleghorn said. "You crack down and get rid of  the problem and then they are back again.  </P> <P> "It's a typical downtown problem where people don't have a place to go."  </P> <P> Sixth Street boasts several new low-rise office buildings, but many structures  date from the days when Corona was on the main road.  </P> <P> "We'd like consistent, attractive uses," Hansen said. "The core problem is a  mixture of deteriorating business structures and new businesses."  </P> <P> Mayor William Miller said he hopes new redevelopment would focus on  establishing Corona as a center for specialty retail businesses rather than  attempt to capture major chain stores.  </P> <P> "Those are the types of businesses that are going to set us apart," said  Miller, who owns a business in the Corona Mall that specializes in buying and  selling historical documents. "We have got to have something other than  mini-malls and gas stations.  </P></p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Not so secret service I READ recently that the Russian security ministry, successor to the KGB, had been miffed that Anatoli Sobchak, the livewire mayor of St Petersburg, had offered Barbara Hay, the new British consul-general to that city, elegant quarters near the town hall in which to carry out her duties. Local security chiefs claimed that cables carrying government information from the town hall ran under the building in which Ms Hay was to be ensconced. Andrei Korodkhov, the ministry's liaison officer, said that a precedent 'will have been set for the British intelligence service to secure access to classified information using various technical means and devices. This would not be a healthy development.' Anxious to have Ms Hay bedded down in her new quarters with minimum additional fuss, I rang Andrei this week and told him that if he would lay off Ms Hay, I would make it worth his while by radioing him, each week, a wad of intelligence news from London to offset any titbits Ms Hay may glean by plugging, accidentally, perhaps while digging the garden, into the security cables beneath her building. 'It won't always be classified information,' I told Andrei. 'But the items I send may go some way to balancing the flow of intelligence data between our countries.' First I worked out a code, using a British Rail timetable and encrypting my transmissions in five-digit numerical groups transformed - using false addition (2 + 3 = 0) - by a second encryption. As a result, my first transmission to St Petersburg started '91207 49537 73482 10504 . . .' At the other end, in a smoke-filled basement, my bulletin would have been decoded like this: PRIME MINISTER JOHN MAJOR AND CHANCELLOR NORMAN LAMONT ARE ON THE VERGE OF BEING LAUGHED OUT OF OFFICE AFTER OPPOSITION LEADER JOHN SMITH DUBBED THEM THE LAUREL AND HARDY OF BRITISH POLITICS. DO YOU GET LAUREL AND HARDY MOVIES IN RUSSIA? IF SO, YOU WILL REALISE HOW WOUNDED MAJOR AND LAMONT MUST BE. TERMINALLY, ONE IMAGINES. LAMONT EXPECTED TO TOPPLE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, MAJOR BY MID-'93, UNLESS ENGLAND CRICKET TEAM VICTORIOUS IN INDIA THIS WINTER, IN WHICH CASE DISREGARD MID-'93 FORECAST AND SUBSTITUTE LATE-'93. There was more in like vein, some of it quite perceptive. Then I sent off a bit about plans to disband the British Army's German-based 1st British Corp and merge it into a 12-nation, rapid-reaction force to be known as the Allied Command Rapid Reaction Corps: AS WELL AS SUPPLYING THE CORPS COMMANDER AND 30,000 TROOPS, BRITAIN IS PROVIDING A MAJOR GENERAL AS CHIEF OF STAFF - WIDELY TIPPED AS MAJOR GENERAL THOMAS WILLIAM HENRY STUART HAROLD KEITH D'ARCY D'AVIGDOR DE FONTAINE DE BATH AND WELLS, BEST KNOWN IN MILITARY CIRCLES FOR HIS PROPOSAL TO ERECT A CIRCLE OF EARTH FORTS AROUND LONDON TO COUNTER ATTACKS AGAINST THE MONARCHY. Mention of the monarchy reminded me that I ought to update St Petersburg on the Queen's state of mind as she prepares to fill in her first income tax form: QUEEN ELIZABETH II'S GLUM MOOD CANNOT HAVE BEEN HELPED BY NEWS FROM AMERICA ABOUT THE SCREENING OF THE MADE-FOR-TV FILM, FERGIE AND ANDREW: BEHIND THE PALACE DOORS. ACCORDING TO ONE NEWSPAPER: 'PRINCE ANDREW APPEARS TO HAVE BRAIN-DAMAGE. 'ONE FEELS SIX MILES TALLER WHEN ONE IS AT SEA,' HE SAYS.' Finally, I sent this snippet: SIR MICHAEL CHECKLAND, DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE BBC, NOW RECKONS THE CORPORATION'S DEFICIT IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR WILL BE Pounds 3.75BN, DUE TO 'FLAWS IN THE FINANCIAL ALLOCATION PROCESS' AND 'COMPUTER ERROR.' 'IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR RUTHLESS SACKINGS,' SAID SIR MIKE, 'THE DEFICIT WOULD HAVE BEEN Pounds 27.5BN AND RISING.' I informed St Petersburg that any diminution in the output of intelligence data from the BBC would be countered by increased output from my own transmitter. Next week: results of Hawks &amp; Handsaws' Little Rays of Light Across the Planet's Doomed and Pitted Surface competition. Entries were still flooding in last night.</p>

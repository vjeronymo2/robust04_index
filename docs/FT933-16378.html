			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Fashion: Lightweight clothes you can fly away in - Avril Groom recommends smart but comfortable travel wear THAT RARE creature, the truly organised business traveller, is easy to recognise. A female specimen was spotted recently, LA-bound in first class. Straight after take-off she slipped from her power suit into something more comfortable (silk lounging pyjamas) and went aggressively into relax mode - no drink, no food, no fun, just an eyemask and a 'do not disturb' sign. Half an hour before landing she reversed the process ready to zip off the plane, all pistons firing. Most of us are not like that. We find such fuss embarrassing. The navy cotton jersey pyjamas which British Airways now hands out, together with duvets, on its first class sleeper service are, according to one frequent flyer 'gratefully received - for jogging at home', although the airline claims that if one passenger can be persuaded to wear them the others follow suit. Most business travellers make do with an extra outfit which, they hope, their suit-bag will keep uncrumpled. But ensuring that you arrive looking unruffled is difficult. Flights within Europe are too short to allow time for changing, though you could easily be met by a completely different climate. The aircraft itself may be colder, or stuffier, than the weather at either end. If you travel casually dressed, delays and traffic jams may play havoc with your plans to change at your hotel before your meeting. Fabric manufacturers and fashion designers are doing their best to rewrite travel's old maxim. For them it is better to travel comfortably than to arrive - especially if your destination is short on air-conditioning. The secret is in modern high-tech fabrics, such as wool spun so lightly it feels like silk, and in new fibre combinations that mix natural for comfort with man-made for uncrushability. Layer these fibres for maximum flexibility, but stylishly, so that nothing looks like a haphazardly thrown-on afterthought. Companies which court the business market have turned their attention to the needs of the international traveller. Alfred Dunhill always uses natural fibres, primarily fine wool, silk and cotton but, says design director Alan Duddle, 'they have an inherent tendency to crease. We now use very high-twist yarns which crease considerably less, and we are constantly researching ways to produce clothes which are as practical and versatile as they are comfortable'. Dunhill, together with Aquascutum, does a lightweight, unlined cotton showerproof raincoat for travelling. Burberry's version packs into a small pouch. Its crease-resistant, lightweight gabardine interpretation of the traditional blazer, unlined or half-lined, is another good travelling companion. Like Herbert Johnson, they make a collapsible panama hat - you fold it flat along its central ridge and roll up to fit in suitcase or pocket. For adventurous types who may feel that a blazer and flannels is good enough to do business in, Gucci have wool trousers that look like conventional marled flannel but feel like gossamer. This company is a past master at matching fabrics to climate - suits for export to Singapore are specially made in a humid environment. Those who feel happier in a suit can find the most serious of pinstripes in lightweight super-100s wool, as at Ralph Lauren. And Hackett, which likes to give tradition a twist, has persuaded British mill Reid and Taylor to revive 1930s three-ply construction with super-120s wool for a plain navy, mid-grey or khaki single-breasted travelling suit which sells for Pounds 495. Lighter suits can mean an extra layer for aircraft or evening. A fine slip-on or sweater rarely looks out of place. Richard Paine, of high-quality knitwear firm Alan Paine, says cotton-silk or cotton-linen mixes are good for summer travelling, but that light lambswool or very fine cashmere look more stylish and should not suffer even if crumpled into your hand-baggage. For women, the advent of softer style has made travelling easier. Giorgio Armani pioneered a viscose / acetate mix, which scarcely creases, for his famously floppy suits and this fabric, often with a fine rib or herringbone texture, is now mainstream fashion from labels as diverse as Laura B, Rodier, DKNY and Marks and Spencer. Light wool crepe is another high-fashion, uncreasy fabric and man-made fibres also deserve attention. Microfibre from Tactel makes soft, light, showerproofs while polyester is no longer a dirty word as its best-quality versions feel and act like silk - which, incidentally, can emerge quite wearably from a suitcase if it is rolled rather than folded. Always take an extra knit layer, cashmere or a cool, light mix such as Rodier's wool / acrylic Kasha, or a big soft shawl - Louis Vuitton does cashmere / silk travel throws as well as the famous hard suitcases which treat the most delicate garment kindly. If you are going straight to an evening event, travel in something formal but understated, and keep your jewellery handy. But if in doubt, remember it is the smartest-looking passenger who gets the upgrade.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Letter (2): Diesel not least polluting Sir, On April 29 1991, there was in the FT an article headed: 'Smoking diesels blamed as main source of pollution'; on January 22 1992 we learn ('Motor adverts criticised') that the Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints against Peugeot Talbot for claiming that diesel engines would be environmentally 'clean'. Nevertheless, in your Technology pages, we read regularly calls for more diesels; for example on September 5 1991 ('Measures to combat dieseL emissions urged') tax cuts to encourage diesel fuel were urged; or on January 21 1992 ('Diesel cleans up its act'). Assuredly diesels are somewhat cleaner when well tuned, but when are they? M Andre, 38 avenue du Gal del Gaulle, F-94300 Vincennes</p>

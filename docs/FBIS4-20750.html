			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Redha Malek before he resigned as Prime </F> Minister by Omar Berbiche and Ali Bahmane; place and date not  given: "The State Will Emerge From the Storm the Winner"; first  two paragraphs are EL WATAN introduction]    [Excerpt] The negotiations with the IMF, the social  cost of structural adjustment, terrorism, and political dialogue  are the main themes discussed by Redha Malek.    [EL WATAN] The IMF agreement will inevitably have a very  heavy social cost. What does the government plan to do to soften  the immediate effects on the most disadvantaged classes? Are you  going to ask the citizens for additional sacrifices? Will they  be willing to accept them in today's economic situation?    [Malek] If there are sacrifices, they will have to be shared  by all of society, and we will see to it that they are. Both our  social cohesion and the effectiveness of our reforms are at  stake.    We know that the social safety net has been in place since  February 1992, but we can see how relatively ineffective it is  at the moment by the fact that it affects over 7.5 million  people without satisfactorily targeting those who need the most  support.    We must show imagination in order to give it a more  consistent content. That should be reflected in the creation of  jobs and housing assistance for the most disadvantaged.  Incidentally, the increased availability of scarce resources  will be of overall benefit to the resumption of certain  activities, among them construction and public works, and help  bring down unemployment. Along those same lines, the government  has plans for a coherent system of social protection comprising  retirement, early retirement, unemployment benefits, and social  security. Those measures will be implemented in cooperation with  our social partners.    [EL WATAN] During his last visit to Algiers, the director  general of the IMF mentioned the possibility of a standby  agreement for this year. What is the nature of that agreement,  what will be its amount, and what socioeconomic effects will it  have?    [Malek] A standby agreement, also known as a confirmation  agreement, runs for one year and is concerned basically with the  external and internal financial equilibriums.    It deals with matters having to do with the price of goods  and services, the exchange rate, the interest rate, credit  conditions, the budget, trade, and the foreign debt.    Such an agreement precedes the three-year "enlarged  facility"  agreement that is concerned with structural adjustment--that is,  the development of small- and medium-size businesses and the  private sector, the rehabilitation of state-owned enterprises,  development of the banking sector, the efficiency of the social  protection system, and all the measures that strengthen the  national economy's competitiveness with respect to other  countries.    The enlarged facility being granted by the IMF is  accompanied  by programs that must be carried out with the World Bank.    [EL WATAN] The IMF director general questioned your  government on the issue of the government program. That  insistent concern is not felt only by Camdessus; it is also felt  by the social partners who are waiting for your program. Why the  delay?    [Malek] Let us understand each other. There is the  government  program that has an overall character--political, economic,  social, and cultural--and on which we are currently working. It  necessarily takes time. And then there is the "program" that  Camdessus is talking about and which, in IMF language, has  specific meaning. It refers to a set of proposals relative to  the exchange rate, the interest rate, monetary policy, foreign  trade, the budget deficit, prices, and so on. Those are the  matters to be covered by the above-mentioned standby agreement.  It is those proposals--that "program"--that the director general  of the IMF wants to see adopted by Algeria as the expression of  a free choice arising from its desire for reform, not as  something forced on it from outside.    [EL WATAN] There has been talk of a cabinet reshuffle.  Certain cabinet posts remain to be filled. Is the matter being  considered?    [Malek] We are working on it. You may think that we are not  moving very fast. But there is a time for everything. The main  thing is to move forward.    [EL WATAN] Does this mean that the government will remain as  it is after the CNT [National Council for Transition] is  installed? Is yours a long-term government?    [Malek] Government instability carries a high cost; everyone  agrees on that. But that does not prevent some people from  continuing to speculate on the subject. It is as though  instability would serve their purpose. Any pretext that will  encourage a wait-and-see attitude is acceptable to them. We must  get rid of that suicidal way of thinking. And this at a time  when we are faced with serious security problems and when we are  having to confront economic and social problems which, for their  part, will not wait.    [EL WATAN] Exactly what is the state doing to face up to the  situation of violence? Your statement that not everything has  been done to combat terrorism is perplexing. Can it be said  today that those steps are being taken?    [Malek] I merely meant that the state has great capabilities  for making itself respected and that those multifaceted  capabilities must be used more rationally and with more  determination.    To hear certain experts in disinformation tell it, you would  think the state was at the end of its rope and near collapse.  People who think that way are simply confusing their desires  with reality. The Algerian state, the historic achievement of an  age-old struggle, is unshakable. It will emerge from the storm  the winner.    It is true that we are experiencing a tragedy. But the  terrorist crimes being perpetrated daily condemn themselves by  their absurdity--the horrible nature of their barbarity. No  cause and no excuse can justify them. The population as a whole  rejects them. This is something that should be pondered by all  those who, at one time or another, have thought they could make  religious feeling a convenient tool for their ambitions. But the  thing that is perplexing is the strange silence of a certain  element of the opposition regarding terrorism. Can a political  official worthy of the name, whether in power or not, reasonably  keep silent and maintain a wait-and-see attitude in the face of  a phenomenon that is a terrible disservice to the country,  tarnishes its reputation, and humiliates Algeria as a nation?    [EL WATAN] The agreement between the government and the UGTA  [General Union of Algerian Workers] has been denounced in part  by the union, according to recent statements by Benhamouda  regarding the government's failure to live up to its commitments  with respect to the amount of the financial package intended to  pay for the wage increases. Is the agreement being broken?    [Malek] Not at all. We reached an agreement, and we are  sticking to it. So it will be implemented. The wage increases  will be paid, as stipulated, beginning on 1 April, and will be  retroactive to 1 January 1994.    [EL WATAN] The success of dialogue also depends on the  adoption of pacification measures. The HCE [Higher State  Council] announced that new pacification measures would be  adopted as dialogue continued. Is that still on the agenda?    [Malek] Let us give the new presidential body time to settle  in. President Liamine Zeroual will find ways and means for  resuming effective dialogue.    [EL WATAN] What is your position on the rehabilitation of  the  FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] under its current name or another  name and on dialogue between the government and the FIS?    [Malek] That party has been dissolved. There can be no  prospect of going back to square one. We simply say that chances  for dialogue exist with all sincere patriots who distance  themselves from terrorism and recognize that it leads nowhere,  stick to constitutional order, and agree to work within the law.    [EL WATAN] On that subject, what is your comment on the  attitude of the political parties?    [Malek] The parties need to be a little more constructive.  They should take advantage of the transitional period to  contribute to national unity, democracy, and a solution to the  crisis.    [EL WATAN] Some people are predicting civil war for Algeria.    [Malek] Despite the terrorist crimes, the population is  maintaining its attachment to peace and public order.    In those conditions, how can one talk of civil war? The  people talking about it are the one who want it. But once again,  they are wrong.    [EL WATAN] Some states are openly displaying hostility to  Algeria.    [Malek] Algeria harbors no animosity toward anyone. What is  certain is that it does not allow any interference in its  internal affairs and will be able to respond to such  interference with appropriate means, as it has done up to this  point. In that connection, it should be pointed out that despite  the difficulties it is experiencing, Algeria remains attached to  its national sovereignty and rejects all forms of pressure,  regardless of their origin.    I would like to take this opportunity to deplore the  development of systematic disinformation on the part of certain  foreign media with respect to Algeria. It plays into the hands  of subversion and certainly does not help to shed light on what  is really at stake in the current situation.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> A large percentage of the hospitals paid under the Prospective Payment System (PPS) are expected to appeal their capital cost reimbursement because of adjustments made for the purpose of setting their capital PPS rate. Also, there is an expected increase in the number of appeals to be filed for payments made for graduate medical education based upon per-resident amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 6. Provider Payment (Part A Only)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In FY 1995, Medicare contractors are expected to provide payment services to approximately 34,300 health care providers. This represents an increase of approximately 7.5 percent over the number of providers requiring payment services in FY 1994. These payment services include establishing and adjusting interim rates, recouping provider overpayments, and providing consultative services to providers for maintaining and adjusting their accounting systems to ensure accurate data for preparing claims and cost reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will distribute funds in proportion to workload by provider type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 7. Productivity Investments (Part A and Part B)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The costs of implementing new initiatives that are designed to improve the effectiveness of Medicare program administration are referred to as productivity investments (PIs). PIs generally provide start-up funds for new or revised contractor activities. Once these projects are operational, their funding becomes part of the contractor's ongoing costs. The criteria for selecting PIs to be implemented are varied. For example, some PIs are required by statute or regulation. We also fund projects that will improve administrative cost efficiency, such as Contractor Resource Sharing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no single distribution methodology for the allocation of PI funds. After we determine the national cost of a PI, funds are distributed among the contractors. These funds are based on the contractors' cost estimates or through formulas that we derive, which are based on project specifications. Other PI initiatives require equal effort by all contractors regardless of size and, therefore, funds are distributed equally among contractors. Finally, some PIs, such as the Common Working File and Contractor Resource Sharing, are given only to contractors that are involved in the specific projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 8. Beneficiary or Physician Inquiry (Part B Only)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Medicare contractors are the direct link between beneficiaries, providers, physicians, other suppliers, and the Medicare program. It is the responsibility of HCFA and the contractors to provide the most effective and efficient service to beneficiaries, providers, physicians, and other suppliers, and to continue to expand their awareness and understanding of the Medicare program. Funding will continue to be provided to contractors so they may continue to provide toll-free telephone lines for beneficiaries and expand the use of Audio Response Units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In FY 1995, carriers will receive an estimated 40.4 million inquiries by telephone, in writing, or through direct contact. This is an increase of 3.2 percent over FY 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 9. Participating Physicians/Suppliers (Part B Only)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Participating physicians and suppliers are those who agree to accept assignment on all Medicare claims in return for certain incentives or benefits. All physicians must be given an opportunity to enroll or disenroll in the participation program annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For FY 1995, the FY 1994 funding was used as the base and was adjusted in proportion to the workload within the limits of the funding available to HCFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 10. Provider (Physician/Supplier) Education and Training (Part B Only)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The success of the Medicare program depends upon the continuing cooperation of individuals and institutions providing health care services. The funding provided in FY 1995 will allow carriers to perform the activities outlined in the BPRs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 11. Benefit Integrity (Part A and B) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

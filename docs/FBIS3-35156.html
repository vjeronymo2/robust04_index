The sources could not confirm reports that Muhammad Zahlan,  who heads the Palestinian side to the negotiations on prison  release, was refusing to return to the talks next week in  protest against what he saw as the PLO's gradual move towards  accepting the Israeli condition.    Having made progress in reaching agreements on key security  issues and a general framework for a Palestinian police force to  deploy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho under the Sept. 13 autonomy  plan, Israel and the PLO are unable to move forward on the  prisoner release issue, the sources said.    "The Israelis are insisting that no known supporter of the  hardline groups which oppose the autonomy agreement will be  released," said a source familiar with the negotiations held at  the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba.    "The Palestinians have been resisting this, demanding that a  prisoner release come under a general amnesty covering all  Palestinian detainees regardless of their affiliation," said the  source.    Independent Palestinian analysts said PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat appeared to be betting on a mass release of Palestinians  from Israeli prisons to dilute opposition to the autonomy accord.    "'Arafat's comments on Friday have reaffirmed his approach,"  said one analyst. He was referring to a statement by the PLO  chairman during a visit to the Netherlands that he could not  "sign a final agreement without having a guarantee for the  release of all prisoners."    Red Cross figures indicate that 9,000 Palestinians are held  in Israeli jails while PLO officials say the figure is closer to  12,000. Israel puts the number of detainees at 6,000.    Israel has agreed in principle to a prisoner release but  ruled out a general amnesty.    According to PLO sources, more than half of the detainees  belong to groups such as the Islamic Resistance Movement  (Hamas), Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine (PFLP), the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestinian (DFLP) and other factions which have vowed to wreck  the autonomy agreement.    But in line with his strategy to create good will among the  Palestinians, Mr. 'Arafat has been demanding that Israel make no  discrimination among the prisoners.    Sources among the dissident groups also said that despite  their fierce opposition to the self-rule accord, Mr. 'Arafat and  his aides had been insisting that their members also be released  from Israeli detention.    "I do not know whether there was any shift in the PLO stand  last week in Taba, but our information is that 'Arafat is  refusing to accept anything less than a complete prisoner  release," said a prominent figure among the dissidents.    Meanwhile, an independent Palestinian source said Mr.  Zahlan,  a member of the Palestine National Council from the Gaza Strip,  was refusing to return to the negotiations with Israel.    "Mr. Zahlan believes that the PLO is going to accept the  Israeli condition against releasing members of groups which do  not support the autonomy accord," said the source. "As such, he  wants no part of the deal since he would not be able to live  with such a compromise."    The other sources said they were not aware of a shift in the  PLO stand that would prompt such a response from Mr. Zahlan.    "The PLO negotiators (in Taba) have not accepted any  compromise over prisoner release," said the source. "The issue  is very much on the table, and it would be dealt with when the  talks resume" in Cairo on Monday.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC BERKELEY FACULTY PANEL FINDS NO PATTERN OF ASIAN BIAS IN ADMISSIONS  </P> <P> Some policies at UC Berkeley hurt the admissions chances of Asian-Americans  between 1981 and 1987, but there is no clear evidence that the campus purposely  limited the number of Asian freshmen, a faculty report concludes.  </P> <P> "In our investigation, we have found nothing remotely resembling a quota on the  admission of Asian-Americans at Berkeley. Nor have we found statistical  evidence of any significant systematic or long-term bias against  Asian-Americans," states a draft copy of a study by a special committee of UC  Berkeley's Academic Senate.  </P> <P> However, the draft report urges change in the use of foreign language  achievement tests for admissions because there are no such tests in Asian  languages. So UC Berkeley should either stop giving a boost to applicants who  do well in European language tests or the university should develop its own  such test for youngsters who know Asian languages, according to the study.  </P> <P> In addition, the report said the eight-member committee "cannot rule out" the  possibility of anti-Asian intent of both a 1984 policy that raised the  necessary high school grade-point average for entrance to UC Berkeley's College  of Letters and Science and a 1987 increase in mandatory language skills at the  College of Environmental Design. Both policies have been changed.  </P> <P> A final version of the report is to be given to the Academic Senate by the end  of the week and may be slightly different than the draft, officials said. The  committee chairman, anthropology professor William Shack, declined to comment  on the report before it is formally unveiled. The Times obtained a copy of the  draft.  </P> <P> The issue of Asian-American admissions to UC has been politically hot since  1984, triggering previous studies by the UC Berkeley administration and the  state auditor general. The federal government is investigating allegations of  anti-Asian bias at UCLA and Harvard.  </P> <P> Civil rights activists claim UC Berkeley and other schools designed admissions  rules to cut back on the number of high-achieving Asian students out of fears  that they would take the places of too many Anglo students. The new faculty  report has not changed some minds.  </P> <P> When told of the latest report's conclusions, Henry Der, executive director of  Chinese for Affirmative Action, a San Francisco organization that has been  active in the UC admissions field, declared: "It's a whitewash. The evidence of  anti-Asian sentiment is staring them right in the face. . . . Maybe it's asking  too much for a faculty subcommittee to chastise their colleagues or superiors  publicly."  </P> <P> According to the draft report, statistics show a small bias favoring Anglos  over Asians for freshman admission between 1981 and 1987, but only between 11  and 18 more Asian-Americans a year would have been offered entrance at UC  Berkeley if policies had been changed. The numbers are too small to indicate  long-term bias, the report says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grade-Point Requirement  </P> <P> Of the 22,671 undergraduates last semester at UC Berkeley, Anglo students made  up 48.5%, Asians 26.5%, Latinos 11.1% and blacks 7%, with the remainder made up  of other groups or people who declined to identify their ethnic background,  according to a campus spokesman.  </P> <P> Under an abandoned admissions system, the College of Letters and Science at UC  Berkeley in 1984 raised the minimum grade-point average from 3.75 to 3.9 but  did not raise the required minimum scores on college entrance exams.  </P> <P> "Because Asians were more likely to be admitted by GPA and Anglos by test  scores, Asians were comparatively disadvantaged," the faculty report states.  However, that system of evaluating either grade-point average or entrance exams  was dropped the following year for one that combines high school grades, test  scores and other factors.  </P> <P> A decision in 1984 to stop guaranteeing a spot at UC Berkeley to all low-income  students who met overall UC academic standards also hurt Asians more than  Anglos, the study says. But that cannot be proven to be anti-Asian, according  to the committee, which was formed in November, 1987.  </P> <P> Patrick Hayashi, the campus's associate vice chancellor in charge of admissions  and enrollment, said Monday that he had not seen the new study but that he was  pleased with the reported conclusions of the draft.  </P> <P> "It is the kind of reassurance that everyone welcomes, not only the university  faculty and administration but the Asian community too," Hayashi said. He added  that the admissions process is much changed and less secretive than it was in  1984.  </P> <P> In October, 1987, the state auditor general found that Anglos appeared to have  a slightly easier time than Asians in gaining admission to UC Berkeley but  found no pattern of discrimination. An internal campus study earlier the same  year found no evidence of bias.  </P></p>

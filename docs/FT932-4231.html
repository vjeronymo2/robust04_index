			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / People: Henderson Crosthwaite boost for oil coverage Henderson Crosthwaite Institutional Brokers is sticking to its strategy of building a research boutique by hiring Tony Mackintosh to boost coverage of the oil and gas sector. Mackintosh's heyday was in the late 1970's and early 1980's at Wood Mackenzie when he was judged the best in his sector for nine years. He admits that a long time has elapsed since he was a specialist; he subsequently went on to run the research team at Wood Mackenzie, then became a corporate finance director at Hill Samuel before moving, for just nine months, to CL Laing and Cruickshank as head of research and marketing, at which point he disappeared from the City. Since then, he has 'been getting fit after a serious back operation, and being a house husband' while his wife takes an arts degree. Now that she is ready to graduate, 49-year-old Mackintosh is returning to the City, though with 'no grand title' as he feels his way. He joins Charles Hue Williams, a main board HCIB director, who left Kleinwort Benson in 1990 when a bought deal for Premier Consolidated went badly wrong, but who retains a prominent profile in the oil sector. Is there not a danger that the preference at HCIB, which prides itself on its old style partnerhsip feel, for hiring mature and experienced analysts is confused with a readiness to employ a string of 'has-beens'? 'You always had to have a thick skin in the City' Hue Williams riposts, whilst acknowledging there is hard work ahead before the team builds a reputation for being 'the sort of commentators the institutions cannot afford to miss out.'</p>

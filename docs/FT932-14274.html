			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister defends Group 4 service THERE was no reason yet to believe Group 4 Court Services was not up to the job of operating Britain's first private prisoner escort service, Mr Peter Lloyd, prisons minister, told the Commons home affairs committee yesterday. Seven prisoners escaped or were wrongly released during Group 4's first fortnight of running the service in the east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside. Mr Lloyd conceded that the Group 4 operation had got off to a disappointing start and provided a 'field day for cartoonists.' But he believed the principles behind contracting-out escort services, releasing police and prison officers for other tasks, were correct. He would not think the government had taken the wrong course unless similar numbers of escapes continued in the coming weeks. The committee was also told that in addition to his Pounds 125,000 salary, Mr Derek Lewis, the television executive recruited by the government as director general of the Prison Service, will qualify for performance related bonuses of up to 35 per cent of his salary. Mr Lloyd said the formula for calculating the bonuses had not been finally decided.</p>

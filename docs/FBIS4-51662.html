			<p>CSO     [Text] On 18 April, Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) filed for  approval of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to  reduce charges for International Marine Satellite (Inmalsat)  service and expansion of the time zone for discounted calls. The  reduction in service charges were set at 12 to 18 percent with  an implementation date of 1 May. They have decided to reduce  rates based on economies of scale brought on by increased  traffic and hope to gain further increases in utilization based  on lower rates.    The current price cuts and expansion of discounted time  zones  will apply to marine satellite communications services offered  to the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions via Inmalsat and the KDD  Yamaguchi satellite station.    Price cuts will cover an 18-percent reduction for Inmalsat A  which consists of analog telephone and facsimile services,  12-percent reduction for digital Inmalsat B services, and  13-percent reduction for Inmalsat M services involving  miniaturized and lightweight marine vessel station facilities.  As an example, a three-minute call on Inmalsat A services  covering the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions formerly cost  2,700 yen but will now cost 2,200 yen.    As for discounted time zones, they will be expanded from six  to 10 hours for Inmalsat A and B services, and expanded an  additional 10 hours for Inmalsat M services.    KDD first offered marine satellite communication services in  1982 in the form of Inmalsat A services. Its services are now  utilized by 1,300 Japanese vessels.</p>

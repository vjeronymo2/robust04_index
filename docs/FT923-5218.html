			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / SBC chief named in top-level changes SWISS Bank Corporation, Switzerland's second largest bank, said Mr Georges Blum, head of its commercial banking division, would become chief executive next spring. The move is apparently an attempt to tighten management controls and improve the bank's image. Mr Franz Galliker, supervisory board chairman since 1984, will retire and Mr Walter Frehner, current chief executive, will become chairman. SBC said the new appointment was a 'normal change' and did not reflect operational problems. However, in the past few years, the bank has been caught with large loans to companies that have collapsed, including Macy's, the US department store chain, Maxwell companies and Olympia &amp; York in the UK and the Omni conglomerate in Switzerland. Earlier this year Moody's, the US credit rating agency, downgraded its rating of SBC bonds from triple A to double A-1. While the two other big Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse, reported profit gains in the first half, SBC's pre-tax profits fell 7.7 per cent to SFr1.24bn (Pounds 500m) and it warned that provisions for bad loans this year would be larger than it had originally thought. Mr Blum, who as the bank's chief credit officer has had to extricate the bank from some of these difficulties, has a reputation as a tough commercial banker. An SBC spokesman said it was always clear that the next chief executive would be selected from within the executive board and Mr Blum had very broad experience and was 'in the best position'. He said Mr Blum had handled the bank's difficult involvement with the 1988 liquidity crisis in the Co-op retail group in Germany. Mr Blum joined the legal office of SBC in Lausanne in 1961. In 1978, he was sent to the general management in Basle but returned to Lausanne as senior vice-president in 1980. Since 1984, he has been a member of the bank's executive board and headed its commercial group. SBC said that Mr Galliker would remain on the board at least until 1994 when his current term expires. 'Decisions regarding the redistribution of responsibilities within the executive board as a result of these changes will be made at a later date,' it added. SBC changes, Page 18</p>

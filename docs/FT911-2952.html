			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Alan Harper: Fleet Street craftsman - Obituary of a photographer for The Financial Times ALAN HARPER, who died on Wednesday at the age of 34, was a photographer whose approach to his profession was firmly in an established Fleet Street tradition. His attitude was that of a no-nonsense craftsman, interested in the best practical picture in the circumstances, rather than as an artist temporarily slumming. That approach was rooted in his professional background and training. He started his career at a small commercial photographic laboratory before moving to the darkroom of the United Newspapers' London office. In those days, United's newspaper interests were entirely provincial - the office provided a photographic service to the group's newspapers, led by the Yorkshire Post. From the outset, Alan's aim was to be a photographer for a national daily paper, and he moved to the Financial Times in 1981, again as a darkroom technician. He revealed an early ability to get the most out of every negative, and displayed a keen interest in all aspects of the photographic craft. It was therefore inevitable that time would bring an increasing number of opportunities to move out of the darkroom. He became a full-time FT photographer in 1986. Alan joined the paper's camera team at a time when there was still uncertainty about the proper role of photographs in the FT, partly due to the poor reproduction of the presses at Bracken House, then close to the end of their usefulness. His photographic confidence and fluency grew along with that of the paper, helped by the greatly improved reproduction of the new presses at East India Dock, opened in 1988. As scope for imaginative photography opened up, Alan was among the keenest of those seeking to take advantage of the new opportunities to print and display pictures properly. He was best known, among his colleagues, for a fascination with political photography. A series of memorable pictures of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, as her administration drew to a close, capture both her undiminished zest for the fray and the photographer's equally striking determination to outstrip his previous efforts in each successive portrait. A second area of particular success was set-piece photography, where the challenge was not one of pushing shoulders with rivals from other newspapers but of thinking his way round technical obstacles. Colleagues recall a picture of Canary Wharf taken from the British Telecom Tower (reproduced above) as a technical achievement of the highest quality; and readers will perhaps remember a striking photograph of the new bridge that forms the Dartford crossing of the Thames in east London, published earlier this month. Colleagues describe a modest, extremely energetic man, with a mischievous determination that kept him permanently cheerful. He leaves a wife and young daughter; and two older daughters.</p>

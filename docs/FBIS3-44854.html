			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA reporter Li Haitang: "`Basic Law' </F> Essentially Ensures Democracy for Hong Kong People]    [Text] Beijing, January 9 (XINHUA) -- The "Basic Law of the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region" (SAR) will guarantee  Hong Kong essential democracy in the interest of the Hong Kong  people.    The essence of democracy is to let the people have the right  over their own interest and happiness, and the top interest of  the Hong Kong people is to maintain the region's prosperity and  stability.    Only the Basic Law can satisfy the wish and demand of the  compatriots in Hong Kong, and this is common knowledge among the  people.    However, three months after Chris Patten was appointed  governor of Hong Kong in June 1992, he put forward a "political  bill", claiming to assume a moral responsibility for Hong Kong's  democratization.    In the past one year and more, Governor Chris Patten has  clung to his bill, taking no heed of the agreements and  understandings reached between China and Britain and the  Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong.    People can hardly understand such practice by Chris Patten.  Britain has governed Hong Kong for over 150 years during which  it has never advocated democracy.    Why does the British side suddenly remember to give  democracy  to Hong Kong people when it is soon to end its rule over Hong  Kong?    The Chinese side has reiterated time and again that over 150  years of British rule over Hong Kong, the center of differences  between China and Britain on the Hong Kong issue is not  democracy, but of whether acting in good faith.    Democracy is an important symbol of social progress, and the  Chinese Government has always given support to democratic reform  in Hong Kong.    It is China which first proposed to implement a pattern of  democracy of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong and let the  Hong Kong people to enjoy the democratic right of "high  autonomy" in Sino-British talks in 1982.    Later, China spent four years and eight months to formulate  "the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  (SAR) of the People's Republic of China", which advocates the  principle of "gradual and orderly progress for Hong Kong  democratic reform".    In the world, all things have their own development rule and  need a process of emergence, development and maturing. The same  is true with the establishment of a democratic system.    For example, Britain and the United States spent 200 to 300  years to realize their modern democratic reforms.    The democracy of Hong Kong cannot be fulfilled in one day.  If things are done against the law of development, that would  lead to turmoil and affect social stability. And further more  that will not be conducive to the Hong Kong's investment  environment.    Such a situation is surely not desired by the Hong Kong  people.    Based on this, the Basic Law proposes that in the first ten  years after 1997, the year for China to resume its sovereignty  over Hong Kong, it will carry out both direct and indirect  elections, and in 2007 a general election will be held according  to a legal process.    The process of democratic reform in Hong Kong stipulated in  the Basic Law has given full consideration to the wish of the  Hong Kong people and is in keeping with the development law of  democracy.    During the discussions of the Basic Law, the central  government had listened extensively to opinions from various  circles in Hong Kong.    The announcement of the Basic Law has won praise from people  in Hong Kong, the mainland, and the world as whole. Even the  British Government spoke highly of the law.    Among all the developments, Governor Chris Patten dished out  his "political bill".    People who know the history of rule by colonialism can see  the real purpose of Chris Patten is to help a group of  pro-British persons to power, especially those who wish to  challenge the central government, so as to make the government  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region powerless.    By doing so, Britain can reach its goal of continuing the  colonialist rule over Hong Kong in another form.    The same old tricks had been used in some British colonies  in  Asia, Africa and Europe. The majority of the Hong Kong people  are able to see through those tricks.    It is known to all that during the five years of drafting  the  Basic Law, China had carried out a very open and democratic way  of discussions on all issues, especially on the method of  selection of the chief executive of the government of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region and the forming of the  Legislative Council.    The selection method for the chief executive of the Hong  Kong  SAR and forming of the Legislative Council are open and just,  and are supported by the Hong Kong people.    In contrast, the "political bill" of Governor Chris Patten  is  not open and democratic.    Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong in June 1992 and dished  out  his "political bill" in September.    Besides deliberations with the British Government, the bill  was announced without consultation with the majority of the Hong  Kong people.    In the transitional period before 1997, more and more Hong  Kong people will see through the real purpose of the British  authorities in Hong Kong and work jointly with the people from  the mainland for the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.</p>

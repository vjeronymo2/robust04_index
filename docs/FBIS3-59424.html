			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.G. and N.C.: "Macedonia-Serbia: How We </F> Demarcate Borders"]    [Text] In contrast to the borders with Albania, Greece, and  Bulgaria (which were ratified by international treaties to which  Macedonia was not a party), the determination of the border  between Macedonia and Serbia took place in the postwar years,  under conditions of "building socialism," when territorial  problems between brotherly republics were of secondary  importance, when all of us lived in an atmosphere of "the bright  future," when "the United States and England would become  proletarian countries," and all borders would be erased.    In contrast to "high-level policy," the demarcation of the  boundaries on the ground had very practical consequences. The  border between Serbia and Macedonia was contested in almost  every segment on the basis of the usual criteria for determining  a border (geographic proximitity of a region to the center,  national affiliation of the inhabitants, the desire of  inhabitants to belong to a particular district, the economic  ties of a village to a particular center). The freshest issue  in the memory of the Macedonian reader concerns the polemics  over the Sveti Prohor Pcinjski monastery, which was on the  territory of the People's Republic of Macedonia [NRM] according  to maps made immediately after World War II but was later  attached to Serbia (although the government of the NRM had a  contrary view and on several instances sought reasons for the  monastery to belong to Macedonia).    In 1946, on the initiative of the prime minister of the  government of the People's Republic of Serbia, Blagoja Neskovic,  the federal government directed an official note to the  government of the People's Republic of Macedonia in which it  offered its view of disputed territory in the Kumanovo-Skopje  sector, the Kozjak-German sector, General Jankovic, the Sar  cement plant in General Jankovic, the Sveti Prohor Pcinjski  monastery, and other places. In response to this note, the  government of the NRM requested the views of the district  people's council in Skopje. The opinion of this council (dated 6  September 1946) was that the local council in General Jankovic  (together with an additional 11 villages) should be separated  from Kosmet (Kacanik srez [district]) and should be attached to  the NRM (the Djorce Petrov okolija [district], the Sveti Prohor  Pcinjski monastery (just the monastery) should be separated from  the NRS [People's Republic of Serbia] (Presev srez) and should  be attached to the NRM (Kosjak okolija), and the village of  Nerav and half of the village of German (Krivo Palanka okolija)  should be separated from the NRM and should be joined to the  NRS. In the explanation, it was said that the local council in  General Jankovic (with the villages of General Jankovic,  Seliste, Palivodenica, Rezanci, Goranci, Pustenik, Krvenik,  Divci, Strinjak, Djurdjev Dol, and Mekjovci) was tied  administratively to the Kocanik srez, but "such an  administrative connection with Kocanik was a condition based on  an established belief among the Shiptars [Albanians] from these  villages (immediately after the Liberation) if they were  attached to the NRM, that it would be more `difficult' for them,  or that they might be `mistreated' by the Macedonians, and so  forth. And now that they realize that there is nothing to fear,  they have changed their minds about it and want to belong to the  NRM." Apart from the psychological motives, the okrug  [district] council, in its deposition, tried to find objective  reasons as well: the economic proximity of the area to Skopje,  the geographic gravitation to the NRM, the origins and residence  of the workers in the mine and the Sar cement factory.... As far  as the monastery of Sv. Prohor Pcinjski is concerned, among the  reasons for it to belong to the NRM, it was mentioned that  almost the entire property formerly belonging to the monastery  was within the territory of the NRM, but the most important  reason was its significance in the history of the Macedonian  people.    The report of the presidium of the People's Government of  Macedonia was almost identical. It was sent to the presidium of  the government of the FNR [Federal People's Republic] of  Yugoslavia, and was dated 12 September 1946 and signed by Vice  President Ljupco Arsov.    Much has also been said about the statement of 19 November  1952 by Boro Pekevski, the then director of the Institute for  Statistics and Records, which was subordinate to the government  of the NRM, concerning the manner in which the border between  Macedonia and Serbia came into existence. According to Pekevski,  Blagoja Neskovic insisted several times that the case of the Sar  cement plant in General Jankovic should be re-examined (that  plant was under the administrative jurisdiction of the  government of the NRM). Accordingly, in December 1947, the  secretary of the federal control commission, Lepa Perovic; Boro  Pekevski; and the secretary of the Oblast [district] People's  Council for Kosovo-Metohija, Djoko Pejakovic, visited the region  and held discussions with the chairman and members of the MNO  [Macedonian People's Council] in General Jankovic; with the  director and members of the board of directors of the Sar cement  plant, and with some of the workers and local inhabitants. The  joint report to the federal control commission suggested that  the territory of General Jankovic, with several additional  villages, be part of the NRM and that the plant and so forth  remain under the jurisdiction of Macedonia. The extent to which  these suggestions were honored can be seen in the fact that,  soon thereafter, the federal government decided that the plant  should be removed [from the NRM's jurisdiction] and belong  territorily to the Autonomous Kosovo-Metohija Oblast, that is,  to Serbia.    The most typical case of demarcating the border, however,  arose with the demand of the villages of Germna, Neeav, Ogut,  Metezevo, and Podrikonj in the Kriva Palanka okolija to belong  to Serbia. The initiative for this rearrangement came from the  famous Stamenko Stosic, a prewar representative (who was elected  in 1931, 1935, and 1938) and a representative in the people's  assembly of the People's Republic of Serbia after the war.  Probably because of his origins in these villages, Stosic  divided the local population, convincing some people that the  neighboring villages were Bulgarian, but that they were Serbian.  The villagers were persuaded that if they opted for adhesion to  the Pcinje srez (with its center in Trgoviste), they would be  able to purchase leather sandals on the free market (and not by  using ration coupons), that they would not pay excise taxes or  fees for pastures, and so on. And one day, a free market for  rubber sandals was organized in Trgoviste just for the  inhabitants of German and Nerav, using their connections and  funds. The results of this propaganda could be seen in the first  postwar census in which the older members of a family identified  themselves as Macedonians, while the younger ones declared  themselves Serbs.    In January 1948, Stosic officially requested the adhesion of  these villages to Serbia with the explanation that the local  population spoke Serbian, wore Serbian clothes, and followed  Serbian customs. Commissions were formed to examine this  question, and the highest of these was the federal commission  whose members included Lepa Perovic, Radovan Stijacic, Milovan  Butanovic, and Boro Pekevski. According to the commission's  report dated 16 March 1948, only the village of Nerav and part  of the village of German gravitated more toward Trgoviste  (before the war, Trgoviste was also within the Krivo Palanka  okolija), but the language, customs, and dress in these villages  were identical with those of other villages in the Krivo Palanka  area.    Such examples, of course, are numerous, and even witnesses  from that time acknowledge that the determination of the border  was conducted mainly through psychological prescriptions,  propaganda, and persuasion in some villages that the inhabitants  would profit economically if their area were tied to the market  in another region.</p>

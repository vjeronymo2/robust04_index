			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SINGER'S CATTLE AREN'T A HIT  </P> <P> Randy Owen, lead singer for the country group Alabama, says that when he shows  the cattle he raises, livestock judges do not seem to give his entries equal  consideration.  </P> <P> "Many don't take us seriously," Owen said. "They think I'm doing this as a  hobby."  </P> <P> Owen, whose cattle were competing this week in the prestigious Southwestern  Exposition and Livestock Show and Rodeo, said he was raised a cowboy.  </P> <P> "I couldn't afford to show cattle when I was growing up, but now that I've got  a chance, I make a point of trying to make it to shows we are in," he said.  </P> <P> The 40-year-old Owen's polled Hereford heifers did not win any major prize  money or award ribbons Wednesday.  </P></p>

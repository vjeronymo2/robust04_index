			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Fiat confirms sharp profits drop FIAT, Italy's biggest private-sector company, yesterday confirmed its profits had fallen sharply in 1992 and described the year ahead as remaining 'critical'. Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, said in a letter to shareholders that the group's industrial activities, which account for more than 80 per cent of its sales, had remained in profit at the operating level. However, margins are believed to have fallen to about 0.2 per cent of sales against 1.1 per cent in 1991. The group's key car business, hit by rising competition and recession, is believed to have made a loss, although no official figures are available. In a summary of the group's problems, Mr Agnelli refered to a cocktail of recession, monetary turmoil, high interest rates and Italy's domestic economic problems. Group pre-tax profits are likely to fall to around L800bn (Dollars 542m) against L1,690bn in 1991. The figure has been boosted by substantial extraordinary earnings, the biggest of which is a L700bn contribution from the sale of Fiat's 25 per cent stake in Alcatel Italia, the telecoms group formed largely from its former Telettra subsidiary. Official profits figures  -and news of the dividend - will not be released until May. The group's continuing commitment to investment and research and development  -which reached a record 14 per cent of sales last year - has had a heavy impact. Fiat's net financial position worsened to a deficit of L3,800bn at the end of last year, compared with a L270bn deficit at the end of 1991 and L2,510bn at end-June 1992. Group turnover increased 4.6 per cent to L59,100bn thanks to the first full-year's contribution from the Ford New Holland tractors and heavy trucks business. On the cars side, sales fell to L26,886bn from L27,506bn, reflecting the 114,700 drop in unit sales and the reduction of margins.</p>

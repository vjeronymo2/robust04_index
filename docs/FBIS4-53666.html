			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 20 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S.  officials met for the second straight day Friday [20 May] but  still came up short of a deal to jump-start stalled trade talks  on ways to increase foreign access to key Japanese markets.    The two sides agreed to make another try Saturday.    "There has been progress in mutual understanding," said a  Japanese official involved in the negotiations.    The negotiations, which lasted five hours Friday, were aimed  at breaking a three-month deadlock in the so-called "framework"  talks that has badly strained bilateral trade ties.    While officials declined to comment on what transpired  across  the negotiating table, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  underscored the importance of the meeting by personally  attending part of the "exploratory talks" between subcabinet  officials.    Representing the Japanese team were Vice Minister of  International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu and Deputy  Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi.    The U.S. delegation consisted of two principal Japan trade  negotiators, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene  Barshefsky and Presidential National Economic Council Deputy  Director Bowman Cutter.    Like their Japanese counterparts, U.S. officials involved in  the talks were equally tight-lipped.    "You know I can't talk," said a U.S. official when asked for  comment.    Cutter, however, sought to project an air of conviviality  after emerging from the morning session.    "We had a good and cordial conversation, and we will meet  again," Cutter told reporters.    The trade talks, which are closely watched on financial  markets as a barometer in the state of relationship between the  world's two largest economies, ruptured in February at a meeting  in Washington between President Bill Clinton and then Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who succeeded Hosokawa in late  April, and Clinton agreed last week to work out a common "basis"  for restarting the framework talks before they meet at the group  seven summit in Naples in early July.    One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the  primary cause for the rupture of the negotiations at the Feb. 11  U.S.-Japan summit -- is the idea of setting "objective criteria"  to measure imports to Japan.    In what is known as a "results-oriented" approach, the U.S.  has insisted on using "numerical indicators" to ensure that a  trade agreement with Japan translates into increased foreign  sales in the Japanese market.    Tokyo has vehemently objected to the idea, saying it amounts  to government-managed trade.    Among the industry sectors covered under the "framework"  accord are Japanese Government procurement for medical and  telecommunications products, trade in autos and auto parts and  the Japanese insurance market.    The U.S. wants Japan to open its market wider to foreign  goods and stimulate domestic demand in order to reduce its vast,  and growing, trade surplus.    The U.S.-Japan trade imbalance was underscored by fresh U.S.  Government data Thursday that showed the U.S. trade deficit with  Japan jumped 25 percent in March to 5.80 billion dollars.    The U.S. trade gap with Japan came to 15.04 billion dollars  in the first three months of this year, well ahead of the  comparable period last year which stood at 13.3 billion dollars.</p>

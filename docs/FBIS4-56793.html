			<p>BFN     [Text] The Antonio Guiteras Electric Plant in Matanzas,  currently undergoing maintenance, will come on line on 7 May  before the peak hours of electrical demand. This information was  reported by plant manager Jesus Valdez Torra.    Valdez Torra advised that since 5 May, maintenance has been  conducted around the clock to conclude repairs to the boiler,  the gas recirculation system, the generator, and other auxiliary  equipment. The approximately 120 maintenance workers of the most  efficient plant in the country are working hard to promptly  conclude repairs following 124 days of continuous operation. To  date, the plant has produced approximately 500,000 megawatt  hours for the National Electric System. It easily fulfilled the  first quarter's program and by December would have produced over  2.2 million megawatt hours.</p>

Could you sense  where the show was headed when Rivera started off with: "What went wrong with  the McMartin trial?"  </P> <P> Nothing went wrong with the McMartin trial, except for the judge not demanding  that the jurors keep their mouths shut afterward.  </P> <P> KENNETH TRITES, San Pedro  </P></p>

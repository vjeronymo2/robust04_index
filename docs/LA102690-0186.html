			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINNESOTA CANDIDATE WILL STAY IN RACE, DESPITE SEX ALLEGATION  </P> <P> Jon Grunseth, the gubernatorial challenger in trouble over reports he swam nude  with teen-age girls in 1981, announced late Thursday he will stay in the race  after planning earlier to withdraw.  </P> <P> "I came here tonight to withdraw from this race," Grunseth told about 100  supporters.  </P> <P> "But there has been just an incredible outpouring of love . . . and prayer for  this family that has overwhelmed both Vicki (his wife) and me. We are going to  press forward no matter (what)," he said.  </P> <P> A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier that Grunseth would  withdraw on the condition that the party's 325-member state central committee  name his successor on the ballot.  </P> <P> Grunseth kept reporters and anxious supporters waiting for hours as he huddled  with advisers far past 7 p.m., the time he set for a news conference at which  he had been expected to announce his withdrawal from the race.  </P> <P> Grunseth had been running close to Democratic incumbent Rudy Perpich before  Oct. 15, when two women charged in sworn statements that Grunseth encouraged  them to join him in a nude swim in 1981, when they were 13 and 14.  </P> <P> Grunseth, 44, denied the allegation but had been under increasing pressure from  his party to quit the race. He had consistently vowed to remain on the ballot.  </P> <P> The source in the Grunseth camp said Grunseth would throw his support to Cal  Ludeman, a Tracy farmer and former state legislator who was the Republican  candidate for governor in 1986.  </P> <P> Ludeman scheduled a news conference for later Thursday in the same Bloomington  hotel, but it was never held.  </P> <P> The Grunseth partisan said Grunseth did not want to automatically hand the GOP  spot on the ballot to Arne Carlson, who launched a write-in campaign on Monday  after losing to Grunseth in the Sept. 11 primary.  </P> <P> Grunseth, who considers himself a moderate-conservative, had said Carlson, a  leader of the moderate wing of the party, is not acceptable to him as the  party's candidate.  </P></p>

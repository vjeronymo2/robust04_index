			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRITY ADVOCATES FOR POLITICAL CAUSES  </P> <P> If one has the guts and the drive to determine the relative worth of a  political issue, regardless of who is for or against it, he doesn't need to  swallow the celebrities' pitch.  </P> <P> Celebrities are media creations who live in airy fantasy. It's only when one  realizes that there are as many air-heads among the consuming public as there  are among "celebrities" that the subject even deserves attention.  </P> <P> LAWRENCE M.

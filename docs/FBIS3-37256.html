"It's such an  approach that we're guided by in building relations between  Tatarstan and the Russian Federation."    Mr. Shaymiyev said problems of Tatar-Russian relations are  central to the republic's political life. He stressed that the  treaty on delimiting the subjects of supervision and mutual  delegation of powers by Tatar and Russia state power bodies is  based on the coordination on the two constitutions and  unconditional respect for human rights, irrespective of  nationality, sex, and religion.    "...an absolutely new, hitherto unknown in practice document  is coming into being," pointed out Mr. Shaymiyev. "It  highlights the competence of Russian and Tatar state power  bodies and will evidence Russia's reformation and renewal on  democratic principles and become a guarantor of Tatarstan's  statehood."    Touching upon his January meeting with Russian President  Boris Yeltsin, Mr. Shaymiyev said the sides agreed on the  completion of preparations of other intergovernmental agreement  concerning foreign economic activity, the combating of crime, as  well as budgetary, taxation, military, and banking problems.</p>

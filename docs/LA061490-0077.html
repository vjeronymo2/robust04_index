			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> HARSH RHETORIC BRINGS A WARLIKE ATMOSPHERE TO MIDEAST;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: TOUGH WORDS REFLECT CONCERN ON BOTH SIDES AS INCIDENTS INCITE  FURTHER ALARM.  </P> <P> Whipped by tough words from Arab hard-liners and the installation of a new  rightist government in Israel, a prickly wind is pushing through the Middle  East.  </P> <P> Gusts of inflammatory talk are building, and the rhetoric is warlike and blunt.  According to Western diplomats in the region, the rhetoric reflects genuine  concerns on both sides.  </P> <P> "What is coming is not a limited danger but a danger of destiny," Syrian  President Hafez Assad declared earlier this week, calling for Arab solidarity.  He spoke of conflict and said the Arabs will win on the strength of their  numbers.  </P> <P> "Israel is still advanced over Arabs technologically and could inflict on them  human disasters in the case of war," Assad told his Parliament. "But Arabs,  with what they own, can exchange the disasters in the same way. . . . Because  the Arabs have . . . depth (in population), which Israel lacks, the exchange of  disasters would have more weight on the Israelis."  </P> <P> The tension began tightening three months ago when Israel's national unity  government shattered over deep differences on peace talks with the  Palestinians. Weeks later, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened to "burn  half of Israel" with chemical weapons if his country were attacked.  </P> <P> Since then, dangerous episodes have incited further alarm. A deranged Israeli  civilian shot to death seven Palestinian workers near Tel Aviv in an unprovoked  attack, spurring an outburst of violence in Israeli-occupied territories. Then,  in a brazen response, guerrillas of a radical faction of the Palestine  Liberation Organization tried to raid Israeli beaches; the attack was thwarted  by Israeli forces who killed four of the raiders.  </P> <P> On top of it all came the steady immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel, stirring  Arab fears of a bolstered enemy.  </P> <P> Anxiety and aggressiveness are clear even to outsiders in the Arab countries.  </P> <P> "I've picked a good time to go," a retiring Western diplomat told a recent  visitor to Amman, Jordan, expressing fear that the Middle East is moving  towards another of its periodic wars.  </P> <P> Said an American arms salesman who travels widely in the region: "It's getting  goosey out there. I haven't seen it this bad before. The Arabs think Israel  needs a war, and they're getting hostile as hell."  </P> <P> A statement Monday by the PLO on the guerrilla raid, received in full text here  Tuesday, termed the climate an uncertain "state of no-peace, no-war" and  claimed that the PLO has opted for peace.  </P> <P> But the statement also fanned the talk of war, saying, "Everybody knows that  the (new) Israeli government is preparing to launch a new war, to escalate its  oppression and massacre of Palestinians, to attack the Arab countries and to  expand its settlement of our occupied land."  </P> <P> Added Faisal Husseini, a pro-PLO activist in East Jerusalem: "I think it is a  government of war, and I think the decisions of such a government will be a  decision of war."  </P> <P> But Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister of the new government, rejects the Arab  chorus that his is a war Cabinet. He told reporters: "We will definitely work  with all our power for peace. . . . Our call for direct talks is not an empty  declaration but a real and sincere appeal to our neighbors to turn their backs  to hostility and war and proceed to the negotiating table. "  </P> <P> Under the policy guidelines of the new government, however, Arab calls for an  international peace conference are not acceptable, nor is the Palestinian  demand for sovereignty over the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.  </P> <P> "It would be crazy on our part to agree to any concession in the area which is  the soft belly of the land of Israel when around us we have a hostile ring that  has unprecedented military power," the prime minister said, adding that he will  continue Jewish settlement of the territories.  </P> <P> Shamir's political nemesis, Shimon Peres, who led the Labor Party out of the  national unity government, belittled the prospects for peace under the new  regime. "Its composition and guidelines are not bringing peace," he remarked.  "It has no ability to change, has no joy of hope. It is a sad government for  its members and a sorrowful government for Israel."  </P> <P> War scenarios abound in the Middle East:  </P> <P> Israel, threatened by advances in military technology by hostile Arab nations  -- particularly missile-delivery systems -- orders a preemptive strike to knock  out the systems. Iraq, mentioned as a likely target, has vowed to retaliate  with its own "weapons of mass destruction" if Israel attacks with similar arms.  </P> <P> The potential collapse of the U.S. dialogue with the PLO and the rise of  radical leadership in the organization leads to stepped-up guerrilla attacks  across Israeli borders, prompting an Israeli response.  </P> <P> Determination to put down the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories  prompts an Israeli military operation to push the populace out of the West Bank  and into Jordan.  </P> <P> An outbreak of fighting between Arab enemies -- Syria and Iraq, for instance --  drags Israel into the conflict.  </P> <P> Military analysts say the next Middle East war will be the worst, with all  combatants now maintaining missiles and high-performance fighter-bombers, and  Israel and several Arab states reported to have chemical warheads. Bringing  firepower on a distant target would take a matter of an hour or less.  </P> <P> And ultimately, Israel is reputed to have nuclear warheads as well. The  prospects for the loss of civilian life in such a conflict would be high.  </P> <P> "We are not interested in any wars, in any confrontations with our neighbors,"  Shamir told Israel Radio before the formation of his government.  </P> <P> The Arab leaders say the same.  </P> <P> "We remain committed to work alongside all local and international forces to  realize a just and comprehensive peace in the region. . . ," proclaimed  Monday's PLO statement.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the Middle East is clearly in a dangerous passage. The  pressure-release of peace talks -- or even talks about talks -- under the  formula supported by the Bush Administration appears dead. Shamir rejects the  tacit PLO involvement in such talks. His favored proposal -- to make peace with  Israel's Arab neighbors one by one, following the example of Egypt -- has so  far stirred no open Arab interest.  </P> <P> If the U.S. dialogue with the PLO collapses over the Palestinians' refusal to  specifically condemn last month's abortive beach raid, Yasser Arafat's  organization could become a loose cannon again. Regional tension and war talk  are likely to continue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> For a long time, the United States and the Soviet Union controlled the arms  race in the Mideast because they provided most of the weaponry. But in recent  years, they have lost control as their regional influence declined. Now, many  Mideast nations have their own arms industries. Israel, Iraq, Syria, Saudi  Arabia and Iran all have ballistic missiles. Israel is believed to have nuclear  and chemical weapons. Iraq and Syria have chemical weapons, and Iraq could have  nuclear weapons within the decade. Egypt is believed to have revived its  chemical arms program. And Libya also may be producing poison gas.  </P></p>

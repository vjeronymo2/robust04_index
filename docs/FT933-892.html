			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Market reforms 'cut BBC costs' THE BBC'S controversial producer choice policy has been endorsed by an evaluation committee including external consultants, Raymond Snoddy writes. A report to be published next month will conclude that the policy, which gives producers the freedom to buy services in the outside market, has been successful in cutting costs. The one criticism is that the new trading units in the corporation, which has a licence fee income of about Pounds 1.5bn a year, have generated too much paperwork. In future producers will be encouraged to rationalise transactions. The study shows that there has not been a large exodus to the outside market by BBC producers. Before the scheme was implemented on January 1, BBC management forecast that an average of 15 per cent of BBC work would go to outside suppliers. The total has been lower. Producers of long-running programmes, for example, have tended to negotiate long-term deals covering use of BBC studios.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 27, BNS -- NATO and countries cooperating  with NATO held a meeting on May 25 in which Russia said it  wanted to displace its army troops stationed in Kaliningrad to  Russia's north-west region, Latvian Defense Minister Valdis  Pavlovskis said Thursday [26 May] at a press briefing after  returning from the meeting.    Pavlovskis said that the agreement on conventional weapons  in  Europe, signed when the USSR existed, does not allow to displace  troops in such a way; therefore Russia raised the question  during the NATO meeting.    The participants of the meeting decided that this issue  could  not be considered at the meeting. Nevertheless, the Nordic  states' representatives were against Russia's proposal and they  advised Russia to displace the troops from Kaliningrad to  Russia's central regions, said Pavlovskis. In return, Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev answered that Russia lacks money  to dispalce troops that far and sustain them there.    Pavlovskis stressed that Russia said it was willing to join  NATO's Partnership For Peace program without dictating any rules.    Pavlovskis noted that Denmark plans to include 40 Lithuanian  soldiers in its army, who, after having finished a special  training program, would take part at NATO operations in Bosnia  together with Danish forces.    Besides, participants of the meeting said they supported the  formation of the Baltic Peacekeeping battalion, and they  discussed political changes and security problems in Europe.    After the meeting, the Baltic sea states' defense ministers  met to discuss the cooperation between the Nordic and the Baltic  states.    On Thursday morning in Brussels, the meeting of the Baltic  states' representatives took place. They coordinated one more  time the Baltic states' stand in the first conference of the  Nordic and the Baltic states' defense ministers, scheduled to  take place next week in Visby.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS ARE LEFT IN TOUGH SPOT;  </P> <P> WITH MINTON OUT, THEY CAN'T STOP INDIANS FOR ABBOTT  </P> <P> Greg Minton said it was "my damn spot," but because of a strained tendon in his  right elbow, Willie Fraser got the call.  </P> <P> With the score 1-1 and Indian baserunners on second and third in the eighth  inning Wednesday night in Cleveland Stadium, Fraser unleashed a wild pitch that  gave Cleveland a 2-1 victory in front of 11,211.  </P> <P> A few minutes later, General Manager Mike Port and Manager Doug Rader told  Minton that he had been placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to June  23.  </P> <P> "I didn't exactly lose it in there, but I certainly didn't agree with their  decision," Minton said after the meeting. "What they said made some sense,  logically, I guess. But I'd rather be pitching. I threw some today and my arm  felt fine."  </P> <P> "They said they need me to pitch in 30 games in the second half of the season,  but that was my damn situation tonight. That's what they pay me a ton of money  for."  </P> <P> The same injury -- a strained flexor tendon in his right elbow -- caused Minton  to miss nine weeks at the beginning of the 1988 season. He hurt the elbow again  Friday night while warming up in the bullpen when he tried to snap off a slider  without warming up enough.  </P> <P> Cleveland team physician John Bergfeld examined Minton before Wednesday's game  and told the Angels that he should not touch a baseball for at least three or  four days. Minton will be eligible to come off the disabled list in 10 days.  </P> <P> "It's in exactly the same place that kept him out in '88, so for six days,  we're not going to compromise it," Rader said.  </P> <P> "He has virtually no pain and it bothers him to go on the DL, but if he injures  it again, we're talking about eight weeks minimum."  </P> <P> Minton has five saves and a 1.84 earned-run average -- and Wednesday night was  a classic case in point.  </P> <P> Starter Jim Abbott pitched a strong 7 2/3 innings, giving up only four hits.  Tony Armas hit an eighth-inning home run into a strong wind and the Angels had  a shot at winning their fifth consecutive game.  </P> <P> Abbott got the first out of the bottom of the eighth and then gave up a  ground-ball single to Felix Fermin. Jerry Browne, who scored the game's first  run in the first inning when the Indians got two singles and a walk off Abbott,  followed with a line-drive single to center. Danny Sheaffer then hit a roller  to third that resulted in the second out, but the runners advanced to second  and third.  </P> <P> Fraser had the count at 1-and-1 on Joe Carter when he bounced a forkball that  eluded catcher Lance Parrish, and Fermin sprinted home with the winning run.  </P> <P> "I was trying to throw a strike down," Fraser said. "It was just a bad pitch,  period. There's nothing else to be said about it."  </P> <P> Parrish, however, had considerable comment.  </P> <P> "I've blocked that ball lots of times before," Parrish said. "I'll take the  blame. I definitely should have blocked it. I should have anticipated that and  gotten down and out on it faster."  </P> <P> Rader blamed the Angel offense. Left-hander Scott Bailes (3-3) hit the outside  corners against the right-handed Angel hitters all night.  </P> <P> "We just can't seem to get over the hump with those guys (left-handed finesse  pitchers)," Rader said. "We're very vulnerable to those types of pitchers. His  stuff looks fat and we were overswinging instead of just redirecting the ball  up the middle and into the gaps."  </P> <P> The Angels had better luck with closer Doug Jones, who pitched the ninth inning  and picked up his 18th save in 21 opportunities. Dick Schofield led off the  inning with a single to left and two outs later, Wally Joyner's single put  runners on first and third. But Brian Downing lined out to shortstop to end the  game.  </P> <P> Abbott made 94 pitches, 63 of them strikes.  </P> <P> "He was pitching really well, obviously well enough to win," Parrish said. "I  didn't think anyone could hit it out in this wind, especially to the opposite  field, so we were pitching a lot of guys up and away."  </P> <P> The strategy worked as seven Indian hitters flied out to right. But when Abbott  neared the 100-pitch mark and his deliveries began to sail high, Rader decided  he had to make the move to Fraser.  </P> <P> "(Abbott) did a fantastic job," Rader said. "You love to see him pitch like  that. We just didn't score and then we gave them the win in the ninth."  </P> <P> Said Abbott: "It was a tough loss for me and the whole team. It's difficult to  lose when you're in a pennant race, no matter how early it is, and especially  the close ones."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Brian Downing's ninth-inning walk Tuesday night was the 1,000th of his career,  making him one of five active players to reach that milestone (Darrell Evans,  Dwight Evans, Keith Hernandez and Willie Randolph are the others). "Two years  ago, when I figured I only had a few years left in my career, that was one of  my goals," Downing said. "But the only time I ever go up there thinking about  trying to get a walk is if it's the ninth inning and we're a couple of runs  down. When I'm leading off, I do try to make a pitcher throw 25 to 30 pitches  to me during the course of the game, hoping that will benefit us in the last  third of the game." Downing also said all those walks are partly due to his  hitting style. "I look for specific pitches," he said. "A lot of guys just look  for the baseball, but I can't hit that way. I'm not good enough." He is,  however, good enough to have a .297 average with 13 extra-base hits in June.  </P> <P> Claudell Washington, who has missed three games because of an infection on his  left shin, said the swelling has gone down but the pain has not subsided. "It  feels fine in the morning when I first get up," he said, "but if I walk a  block, it hurts. Right now, the treatment is just to elevate it and stay off  it. It's getting better. I don't think I'll be out more than a day or two  more." . . . Tony Armas extended his hitting streak to 82 days with a single to  center in the third inning Wednesday night. The streak dates to April 8, but  spans only nine games. It also includes two stints on the disabled list  totaling 65 days. Armas is hitting .423 with three homers and five RBI during  the "streak."  </P></p>

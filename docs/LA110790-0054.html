			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAR PLOWS THROUGH WALL OF DMV OFFICE;  </P> <P> ACCIDENT: DRIVER WAS GOING TO TAKE TEST TO RENEW HIS LICENSE. DOZENS DIVE FOR  COVER AS HE AND SIX OTHERS ARE INJURED.  </P> <P> A 72-year-old man waiting to take a driving test Tuesday accidentally plowed  his car through a wall and into a Department of Motor Vehicles office in Canoga  Park, injuring himself and six others, authorities said.  </P> <P> None of the injuries, including those to the driver, John Anderson of Reseda,  were life-threatening, authorities said. DMV officials said about 80 employees  and customers were in the office at the time. Damage was estimated at $40,000.  </P> <P> DMV Investigator Steve Torres said the accident occurred about 10 a.m. in the  DMV office at 20725 Sherman Way after Anderson, who has an unblemished driving  record dating back to 1948, pulled his car into a line for those taking driving  tests.  </P> <P> As Anderson moved his car forward, it lurched out of control, Torres said. The  car made a wide circle, hit a hedge and jumped a curb before smashing through  the brick wall of the one-story building.  </P> <P> The car pushed aside file cabinets and furniture, sending those in the building  scrambling for safety. The vehicle stopped beneath an eye exam chart and a sign  that reads, "Report Here for Drive Test."  </P> <P> Anderson said he lost control of the car when the accelerator jammed.  </P> <P> "I was pulling up to my spot to wait and the throttle stuck," Anderson said. "I  put on the brakes. What I should have done is turned off the ignition, but I  guess I panicked."  </P> <P> Anderson was visibly shaken and slightly bruised but declined medical  treatment, DMV officials said.  </P> <P> Louella Traub, who works at the eye exam desk, said she "saw the wall coming in  and thought, 'Oh my God, a car is coming through.'  </P> <P> "I got up and jumped. I made a dive out of the way."  </P> <P> Traub said she bruised her leg in her dive for safety. The desk where she had  been working was smashed and pushed 10 feet by the car.  </P> <P> Jean Kolterman, manager of the DMV office, said she was in a conference room  when she heard the screeching of tires and hurried to the public area as the  car crashed into the office.  </P> <P> "I came out and the car drove right past me," she said. "Everything here can be  put together again. We're just . . . very blessed that no one was killed."  </P> <P> The incident is being investigated by the State Police, who have jurisdiction  over state office buildings. Anderson was not cited for any driving violation,  but officials said the investigation is continuing.  </P> <P> Those hospitalized were Beatrice Archers, 71, who was dragged beneath the  vehicle, and Ham Nguyen, 49. Both were reported in stable condition Tuesday.  Archer was at Humana Hospital West Hills and Nguyen at Kaiser-Permanente  Hospital in Woodland Hills. Others injured included DMV employees Traub, 61;  Elaine Moschin, 55; Don Swearingen, 52, and Gail Kahn, 37, who suffered bruises  or cuts but were not hospitalized, authorities said.  </P> <P> DMV spokesman Bill Gengler said the office will remain closed until at least  Thursday.  </P> <P> Anderson said he had come to the DMV office to renew his license. DMV  regulations require drivers over 70 to take an eye examination and written test  for license renewal.  </P> <P> Anderson was also required to take a driving test because, when he tried to get  his license renewed earlier, he was told he needed glasses.  </P> <P> As work crews began cleaning up the mess, Anderson was having second thoughts  about motoring.  </P> <P> "I don't care if I ever drive again." he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Tracey Kaplan contributed to this report.  </P></p>

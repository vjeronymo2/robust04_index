			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Bemused and bewildered: The reaction to British sound and fury Perhaps the single most significant indicator of German reaction to the latest storm in Anglo-German relations is the fact that Bild Zeitung has barely commented at all. The mass circulation newspaper (4m-plus readers nationwide), which prides itself on having its finger on the pulse of the German in the street, has so far not deemed it worthy or relevant enough as an issue on which to wage war. It was not so back at the time of impending unification in 1989 and 1990, when Britain's fears of a united Germany, intemperately expressed by the then Mr Nicholas Ridley, turned into a raging slanging match between Bild and the British tabloids. This week the newspaper has done no more than mockingly report in a down-page story that 'Germany-bashing' is the latest sport in Britain. It lets the headlines in the Sun and the Daily Star speak for themselves. Not that Germany is immune to the criticism it receives. Concern over the international image of the country and its people is a full-time national occupation. The damage to Germany's image wreaked by the skinhead attacks on asylum-seekers in the east has caused an agonised debate. The insensitivity of an anniversary to commemorate the launching of the V2 rocket was also spotted - not thanks to any British protest - as a terrible mistake. And yet the verbal onslaught being doled out by Mr Norman Lamont and his Treasury spokesmen is being watched with something more like pained bewilderment, and largely without response. It is a very one-sided war. The row has revealed more about the continuing culture gap that exists between Britain and Germany, in spite of years of close co-operation in the European Community, than about fundamental differences of view. On the one hand, German officials, not least Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, appear to be naive and ignorant about some of the more aggressive practices of the Anglo-Saxon media, and the super-charged state of the British political debate. Their attempts to justify their actions have instantly been twisted into broadsides and onslaughts in the conflict. As for the British, they still prove congenitally incapable of understanding the fiercely independent stance of the Bundesbank, and its refusal to take orders from Bonn. What is often perceived in Germany as a tense debate between Bonn and Frankfurt is interpreted back in Britain as a conspiracy. German commentators have closed ranks in defence of the Bundesbank, an institution which enjoys far more popular respect than the government itself or any other post-war establishment. 'It is true that the Bundesbank is not the inventor of diplomatic tact,' the conservative newspaper Die Welt said yesterday. 'But one thing it is not: lacking in solidarity. That is why it cannot allow the myth to be created by British politicians that sterling was brought down with a roll of German dice. 'It is absurd to say that the fall of the pound was stage-managed by the Bundesbank. It was determined by the markets.' That is the German consensus, and no amount of sound and fury from Westminster and Whitehall will shake it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 14 Jun (EFE) -- The total embargo  along the Dominican border with Haiti will be impossible to  maintain for much longer, said Dominican Foreign Minister Juan  Aristides Taveras Guzman. He has added that neither the OAS nor  the United Nations have made any move to send resources to  change that.    Taveras has affirmed that the possibility of these  international organizations helping the Dominican Republic to  defray the cost of keeping 15,000 troops deployed along the  Haitian border has not been discussed.    Dominican authorities hope the Haitian situation will be  resolved soon because it is almost impossible for the country to  withstand the cost of the military deployment for much longer.  The troops have been in the area since 26 May.    The foreign minister added that his government has requested  technical assistance to help supervise what he called the "good  job" his country is doing to prevent violations of the trade  embargo, which the international community has imposed on Haiti.    He cited the recent OAS General Assembly, saying: "We are  the  last ones to want an embargo violation, and we have supported  all of the resolutions issued to that effect. Furthermore, we  just made a firm and definitive statement at the recent foreign  ministers meeting in Brazil asking for everyone to stop  scrutinizing and criticizing us."    Directly addressing the Haitian problem, he said the  situation has affected the Dominican Republic more that any  other member of the international community. The Dominicans  have had to pay a high price for the Haitian problem and,  therefore, believe the criticism against them should cease.    Taveras said his country is still waiting for the list of  products that will be allowed to cross the Haitian border.  Dante Caputo, OAS and UN representative, has promised to  provide the list of items on humanitarian aid.    The foreign minister has discarded the possibility of  military intervention in Haiti "for the time being." Such an  operation would seek to dislodge the military leaders there and  restore constitutional President Jean Bertrand Aristide to power.    Taveras said the international organizations are determined  to use every possible peaceful, diplomatic, and political means  to resolve the Haitian crisis. He affirmed that if such a  military operation were to occur, it would be a multilateral  effort.    The United Nations, the OAS, and several countries have  criticized the violations that have occurred before 26 May along  the Haitian border. The embargo became totally effective 24  hours after a meeting between Dominican President Joaquin  Balaguer and U.S. and OAS representatives.</p>

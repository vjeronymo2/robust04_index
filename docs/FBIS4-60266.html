			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi to </F> the chairman and secretaries of the Jamahiriyah cleanup  committees on 18 May; place not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] As I have already told you the Cleanup Bill is a  very important law. Its importance lies not only in the fact  that it is a deterrence which will bring about justice and  prevent any deviation and corruption. Its real importance lies  in the fact that it is an affirmation of the democratic system,  the people's authority, and a real application of the jamahiri  theory. It will also help the society to correct itself if and  when it deviates. If the political power is a dictatorship,  like most political systems in today's world, society's fight  against deviation and its will to correct itself can only be  expressed through violence, that is, a revolution against the  political system. [passage omitted]    And here lies the importance of the Cleanup Bill: Now the  Libyan people can, when it feels that there is a deviation or  even a corruption, meet at the basic people's congresses and  issue the necessary legislation which will eliminate any  deviation and correct any direction.    We should meet democratically and calmly at our basic  people's committees in a comfortable manner and issue the  necessary laws and decisions which will correct any deviation,  regardless of its seriousness. And that is what has actually  taken place: The Libyan people felt that there have been  deviations by individuals, which could be far reaching, and  decided that such a matter warranted the intervention of the  people's authority to carry out a correction. The Libyan people  passed, through the people's congresses, the Cleanup Bill, which  has given rise to the cleanup committees.    As far as I am concerned I think that such a step was a  historical and a very important one in the application of the  theory. Without democracy and without the law we will be at the  mercy of adventures; democracy will be jeopardized and all our  gains will be threatened by undemocratic and illegal initiatives  by some selfish individuals which will lead to further serious  deviations.    Therefore, to protect freedom and gains, the democratic  project must be a legal one. It is only a democratic one if it  is based on the people's authority. The law must be issued by a  people's authority. And this is what actually has taken place.    The Cleanup Bill is an opportune law. It is here because  every citizen has felt the need to enact such a bill.    It is for the first time that a bill has stipulated that  public property is sacred, protected, and safe, and that no-one  should harm it or exploit it illegally. This new legal doctrine  did not exist before; only private property used to sacred. The  latter was, however, a right concept which has been abused.  [passage omitted]    Public property, the property of the whole people, was not  sacred until this moment... [pauses] ... until this bill is  enacted. No one used to talk about public property. Public  property used to be ownerless, a matter which opened the doors  for theft and the appetite of thieves.    Now the Libyan people can dot the i's and cross the t's by  meeting at the people's congresses and enacting this law with  its free will and stating that public property is sacred and  protected. It must not be exploited and should only be used in  accordance with the stipulations of the law. This used to be  said about private property which used to belong to  entrepreneurs, profit takers, usury takers, and greedy people.    Once the Cleanup Bill is enacted, everyone should thereafter  bear in mind that public property, which belongs to the whole  people, is sacred. Anyone who harms it should have his hand  amputated in accordance with the law because he is a thief.  [passage omitted containing indistinct portion]    If there is one thing that the Libyan people have done which  confirms the authority of the people, preserves achievements,  supports freedom, and bars the way to any conspiracies and  deviations, it is the Cleanup Bill. This is a democratic  achievement.    Of course this law considers illegal gain to be theft and  theft means cutting off the hand. Hands will indeed be cut off  after this law is implemented. As they used to say, those who  lived in the town before you, if someone weak committed theft,  they would apply the hadd punishment [loss of hand] to him.    But if a nobleman committed theft, they would let him go.  No. Those whose hands will be cut off will be noblemen and  those who are not noblemen. All people are alike whether noble  or not. Establish your building on justice so that the building  does not fall down on you. No-one should think that he is above  the law which prescribes the amputation of the hand. Any  citizen of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah will  be affected by this law. [passage omitted]    Of course this law is a very serious law. It reaffirms the  true people's authority. It also reaffirms that corrections are  being made in accordance with the laws in force. It is a very  serious one, however, because it encompasses everything [words  indistinct] and applies to everyone. [passage omitted]    This law is double-edged: if you register the things you  have  stolen you will be brought to account, and if you do not  register them you will be brought to account twice, a double  theft: First, you stole and second you hid what you stole, and  this is considered as second theft. [passage omitted]    Had it not been for this bill there would have been a  revolution against a revolution. However, thanks to this bill  and to the Libyan people's free will there is a revolution  inside a revolution.    Because the matter is so serious, we are trying to give  some respite to the Libyans, who did not expect this law to be  enacted, did not think that anyone would make them accountable,  and did not think that their hands would be cut off one day.  [words indistinct]. I would like to say here that before we  [word indistinct] and we start cutting off the hands of those  thieves, who have been fiddling with public property, we should  try to give them a warning. God says no one should be punished  before a warning has been sent to him. We are giving them a  good respite which is also a warning that hands will actually be  cut off.    This warning and good omen I am giving will last for the  period of launching the cleanup committees and announcing its  officials. This time we will alert people but after that the  cleanup bill and the cleanup committees will be in force  constantly. There will be no warning, what is permitted is  clear and what is prohibited is clear. [passage omitted]    Whoever takes the initiative and registers anything he has  hidden will not be subjected to [words indistinct] by the  cleanup committees. So if someone takes the initiative and  immediately registers everything he possesses, he can be assured  and should not fear anything. Some people might tell you, now  that you have registered your possessions you will have to talk  to Mu'ammar al- Qadhdhafi later. Do not worry, go on and  register, say indeed I have three farms of which only one is  registered and I want to register all of them. When you  register the three of them and you are questioned afterwards by  the cleanup committees and the people's court on the way and in  which you had acquired the three farms, there will be two  possibilities. Either you acquired them in a legitimate in  which case they will remain yours, or if you acquired them in an  illegal way, then the farms will be taken from you without your  hand being amputated provided your are abiding by the [words  indistinct]. [passage omitted]    If they discover goods with you which you have not declared,  then you will be considered as a thief and your hand will be cut  off. You will lose the goods and your hand will be cut off as  well. But if you go straightaway, declare your goods, say that  you have hidden things, a hidden factory, farm or home, or  hidden money or animals and you say: I want to register them now  and ask me how I got them. In this case, even if you had  acquired things in an illegitimate manner, your hand will not be  cut off, and I am responsible for this. They will bring you to  account, and perhaps they will recover the goods from you  without hand cutting. This is if you take the initiative of  declaring everything you own. This is number one, and let he  who listens tell whoever is not listening. He who takes the  initiative of paying the due excise duties and taxes which he  was avoiding will not be asked questions and will be cleared of  accusation. [passage omitted]    All the Libyans who know [words indistinct] lazy, [word  indistinct], making evasive tactics. As of today, he will  considered as [word indistinct] of a revolution, so as to be  able to escape from the accusation of theft and [words  indistinct]. This is number two. Number three concerns  applicants for a licence [to trade]. Anyone engaged in any  activity without a license, and [word indistinct] the cleanup  committees, is regarded as a thief because he engages in an  activity which brings him an income, but he does not pay excise  duty or tax, and anyone not paying excise duties and taxes is  considered as a thief and the retribution is the severing of a  hand. This includes those selling in the streets and [words  indistinct], let alone other actitivities. Those called  suitcase traders or middlemen need a license. What I am saying  is this: Anyone engaged in an activity which he deems useful,  including charlatans who claim to make amulets to cure people  from being possessed by the devil, should have a licence for  which he pays tax. [passage omitted]    Anyone who is engaged in a trade at home or in the street  without a license, anyone transporting goods likely to be bought  or sold on a vehicle, any economic activity, small or big,  without a licence will lead to those engaged in them being  considered as thieves, in accordance with the law [words  indistinct], and his hand will be cut off. To be saved from the  severing of his hand he should from today obtain a license.  [passage omitted]    In the end, whoever takes the initiative and confesses to  carrying out an activity forbidden by the cleanup law, do we  forgive him or not? [passage omitted]    If they confess before the cleanup committees reach them, we  will pardon all the people who are currently selling dollars and  dinars in the black market. [passage omitted]    But if someone continues to deal in the black market, or in  smuggling or things which we do not currently know about -- but  he knows them -- but if we find them, it will be considered a  case of theft and his hand will be amputated. [passage omitted]    Someone might come and say: Before you arrest me and  amputate  my hand, you should know that I have been doing this job [words  indistinct]. This will then be a [word indistinct] confession,  he will be considered a wise, responsible man who repented; this  repentance will [word indistinct] what preceded it and as a  consequence this person will not be questioned by the cleanup  committees. Apart from this case, this law is like a sword.  [passage omitted]    The secretary of the General People's Committee for Justice  says it will be preferable to allow a deadline sufficient to  give people the chance to repent, t6o give back their ill-gotten  possessions and settle their situations. [Addressing officials  at the meeting] So, issue an announcement and allow the deadline  you consider to be reasonable and sufficient. Very good and all  the best of success.</p>

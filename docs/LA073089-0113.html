			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> GLACIAL ICE FALLS, WAVE DROWNS SPECTATOR  </P> <P> A Finnish tourist standing on shore drowned when a huge block of glacial ice  dropped into a lake and caused a wave that swept him into the frigid water,  local news reports said.  </P> <P> The 34-year-old victim, who was not identified, was on land about 20 feet from  the edge of a small, deep lake when the wave hit him on Wednesday, the  Dagbladet newspaper reported on Thursday.  </P> <P> A large group of tourists was watching when Svartisen, a glacier near the  northern Norway town of Mo I Rana, dropped chunks of ice into the ocean, the  newspaper reported.  </P> <P> "The Finnish tourist was . . . about 35 meters (112 feet) from the glacier  itself. He probably lost his balance when the mass of water hit him," acting  sheriff Terje Storroe of Rana said.  </P> <P> Sightseers fled the wave that crashed onto the shore and watched helplessly as  the tourist was washed into the lake, Dagbladet said.  </P> <P> "It would have been madness for anyone to have tried to swim out to him in that  icy water," Storroe said.  </P></p>

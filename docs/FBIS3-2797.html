Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 12 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan said on  Saturday [12 March] that the implementation of the Fair Trade  Law has opened a new era of law and ethics for the Taiwan  economy.    Addressing the opening ceremony of a three-day international  seminar on fair trade at the Taipei International Convention  Center, Lien noted that the Fair Trade Law has become an  important part of Taiwan's strategy to promote economic  liberalization and internationalization.    Fair competition will help ensure that all walks of life  benefit from the results of economic development, and fair  rules, which are the basis of economic ethics, will pave the way  for fair competition, he stressed.    The premier expressed the hope that discussions at the  international forum will help promote the planning and  enforcement of Taiwan's fair trade policies, thereby effectively  safeguarding a fair trade order for domestic enterprises.    Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the cabinet-level Fair Trade  Commission, said that Taiwan's Fair Trade Law has had positive  impact on regulating the domestic trading order since it took  effect in February 1992. The commission is sponsoring the  seminar.    Guests present at the opening ceremony included Finance  Minister Lin Chen-kuo and legislators C.C. Lin, Y.C. Hung, C.C.  Lo, and W.P. Chiang.    Gerhard Schricker, director of Germany's Max Planck  Institute, delivered the keynote speech on "maintaining  competition" following the ceremony.    Twenty officials, scholars, and experts from the United  States, Germany, Britain, Italy, Sweden, Japan, Australia, and  the European Union are joining 200 of their Taiwan counterparts  at the forum.    Participants will focus on such topics as monopolies, unfair  competition, international conciliation, and enforcement  cooperation.</p>

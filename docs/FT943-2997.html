			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / ITC to readvertise licence for Channel 5 The Independent Television Commission yesterday took a formal decision to readvertise a licence for Channel 5, a new terrestrial television channel. A number of corporations have expressed interest in bidding for what some see as the last important broadcasting opportunity using existing technology in a large European market. The commission said it could not give precise figures for Channel 5's population coverage since the government had decided to reserve channel 35 - one of two channels designated for Channel 5 - to the further development of digital terrestrial television. The effect of the government decision was to reduce the minimum coverage for Channel 5 from 74 per cent to 52 per cent of the population. However, with additional frequencies identified by ITC engineers this could rise to a maximum of about 70 per cent. The new frequencies will need national and international clearances. In addition digital simultaneous broadcasting could increase coverage further to between 80 per cent and 95 per cent. Applicants will have to submit a business plan for the maximum potential coverage. They will then have to provide plans for lower possible coverage - 60 per cent or even 52 per cent. Possible applicants are CanWest, which is backed by large quoted British companies, the Virgin Group, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees television, NBC and a group linking Time Warner, MAI and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. The licence, to be awarded by competitive tender, will be advertised on November 1 with a closing date six months later. This would imply that Channel 5 would not launch until well into 1996. When the ITC first advertised the licence in April 1992 there was little interest and the one applicant - a Thames Television consortium - was rejected mainly because of poor investor commitment.

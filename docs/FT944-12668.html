			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Kashmiris hold Britons hostage A Kashmiri militant group in India was holding three Britons hostage yesterday and threatening to behead them one by one unless the Indian government freed 10 jailed separatist guerrillas. Police said they captured one militant and injured another in a shootout at a militant hide-out in Ghaziabad, near New Delhi. The police freed a fourth hostage, an American, who was being held there. The American, Bela Josef Nuss, said he was abducted from a guest house in New Delhi and told by his captors about the seizure of the three Britons. Police said they were not certain whether the Britons were also being kept in Ghaziabad. The Britons were named as Paul Benjamin Ridout, Christopher Myles Croston and Rhys Partridge.</p>

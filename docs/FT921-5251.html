			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television Can you bring yourself to watch the first episode of The Big One on C4? This new comedy series with Mike McShane and Sandi Toksvig (whose name, like Trebor, should surely be read backwards) has been so insistently trailed that I have already developed a mild hostility towards it. McShane and Givskot are known from 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?', the improvisation show from which an endless succession of very variable comedies is spinning off. She is the small, very funny, one and he is big and rather less funny. In The Big One he plays a successful and tidy American writer who comes to stay with her, the unusccessful and untidy English writer (8.30). That is followed by the opening episode of a 4-part adaptation of Mary Wesley's English family saga The Camomile Lawn (9.00). It follows the fortunes of five cousins, from the summer of 1939 when they gather on the lawn behind their aunt's Cornish house, to 1984. Paul Eddington and Felicity Kendal star and the direction is by Peter Hall. The last in BBC2's interesting, if patchy, documentary series about Spain, Fire In The Blood looks at Barcelona, one of Europe's most fashionable cities, and the venue for the 1992 Olympic games.</p>

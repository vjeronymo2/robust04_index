			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Former king back in Lesotho Lesotho's deposed King Moshoeshoe ended two years of exile yesterday, flying home to a joyous reception from supporters, Reuter reports from Maseru. The military government, which refuses to let the former king regain the throne, ordered tight security. He made no speech after his return but embraced his son Letsie, whom the military installed as king when it deposed his father in 1990, allegedly for abusing his powers.</p>

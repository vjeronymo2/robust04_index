			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- Taipei travel agencies are  preparing a boycott of tours to Mainland China in protest over  the rude and unjust handling of a boat accident which left 24  Taiwan tourists dead.    The entire tour group and eight mainlanders died in a  suspicious fire during a cruise of Thousand Island Lake in  Zhejiang Province March 31. The disappearance of the money  carried by the victims and the mysterious nature of the deaths  point to foul play.    News of the mishap was supressed for two days and all  reporters have been barred from the site where the charred  corpses are being stored.    Announcing the boycott, Hsu Chin-jui, chairman of the Taipei  Association of Travel Agents, said travel agents are indignant  at the insensitive and rude treatment afforded victims'  relatives by mainland authorities.    The mainland authorities rejected all requests by the  relatives including to see the ship where the accident occurred  and to ship the corpses back to Taiwan for burial or cremation,  he said.    Hsu added that the boycott will begin soon after association  members decide on a date.    President of the Republic of China [ROC] and Kuomingtang  Chairman Li Teng-hui, commenting on the incident, said Wednesday  [6 April] that the ruling party should express its grave concern  about the accident through proper channels.    Li called for appropriate handling of the victims remains  and  adequate assistance for their relatives.    Meanwhile, opposition legislator Chen Shui-bian suggested  that Taiwan designate Mainland China a "high risk" area and urge  people to avoid travel there until mainland authorities  satisfactorily explain the incident.    Legislator Chou Po-lun also called for an across-the-board  cut in communication with the mainland until authorities there  present acceptable reparations for a recent spate of incidents  involving Taiwan tourists.</p>

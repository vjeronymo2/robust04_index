			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Chazan] </F>   [Excerpts] Nairobi, May 26 (AFP) -- Battered and bedraggled  Rwandan soldiers started fleeing the embattled capital Kigali on  Thursday [26 May] as rebels appeared on the verge of taking the  city despite an agreement to open ceasefire talks, military  sources in Kigali said.    A special United Nations envoy meanwhile said the rebel  Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) had agreed to open discussions  about a ceasefire with the army on Monday, a UN spokesman said.    The army has already agreed to the principle of a ceasefire  to allow the UN to fly desperately needed food and medicine to  the survivors of a six-week bloodbath in which up to half a  million of Rwanda's seven million people are estimated to have  been butchered.    "The commanders of both sides have accepted the proposal of  the special representative of the secretary-general to open  ceasefire talks," spokesman Abdul Kabia told AFP by telephone  from Kigali. "These talks will be held in Kigali and will start  Monday. The top commanders will not come, but will be  represented at staff level by their deputies," Kabia said.    Kabia said an army brigadier and a rebel commander would  attend the UN-mediated meeting.    But UN military sources and diplomats said that with the  rebel takeover of Kigali imminent, and demoralised government  soldiers short of ammunition and starting to join a massive  exodus of terrified civilians from the capital, the discussions  may come after the effective end of a three-year civil war.  [passage omitted covered in referent items]    The UN military sources meanwhile reported that army  commanders and some ordinary soldiers were starting to join  thousands of terrified Hutus streaming out of Kigali on foot.    "Rumours that the city is about to fall are spreading and  people are scared of retaliation for the killings of Tutsis,"  said a UN official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The  official estimated that a rebel victory was "a few more days  away."    Minority Tutsis dominate the rebel movement, led by Rwandan  exiles who fled to Uganda to escape ethnic massacres in the  runup to independence from Belgium in 1962.    Kabia, speaking by telephone from Kigali, said the RPF had  agreed to meet army commanders Monday to discuss a ceasefire.    But a senior Western diplomat familiar with Rwanda said the  battle-weary government forces "could simply be forced to  surrender." "They're short of ammunition, their morale is low,  their government has run away to a town outside the capital, and  they're scared of taking the blame for the massacres," a UN  military source in Kigali said.    The rebel agreement to discuss ceasefire terms nevertheless  signalled a breakthrough for Riza, but the rebels still oppose  the planned deployment of 5,500 UN peacekeepers in Rwanda and  demand a maximum of 2,500.    The UN, condemned by aid agencies for withdrawing all but  400  of its 2,500 soldiers from Rwanda after president Juvenal  Habyarimana's death in an alleged April 6 rocket attack on his  plane, is struggling anyway to muster the planned new force.  [passage omitted]    Riza was to leave Rwanda on Friday to review another heavily  criticised UN peacekeeping operation in Somalia's anarchic  capital Mogadishu, where the failure of tens of thousands of  foreign soldiers to end factional fighting has dampened  enthusiasm for another perilous mission in Africa.

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Murdoch abandons NY Post to its fate MR Rupert Murdoch yesterday abandoned his efforts to buy the financially crippled New York Post  - a move which seemed likely to spell the end of the 192-year-old tabloid, America's oldest continuously published newspaper. News Corporation, the media empire headed by Mr Murdoch, said it had been unable to agree cost savings needed to guarantee the paper's survival in negotiations with the paper's 11 unions. The Post has been operating for four months under the protection of the bankruptcy court and News Corporation has been managing the business since March 29, pending negotiations with the court on a purchase price. However, on Tuesday News Corporation served notice on the court that it would walk away from the management contract at 4pm yesterday unless the unions agreed to the cost-cutting concessions it had been demanding. Mr Patrick Purcell, president of its News America Publishing subsidiary, announced shortly after 4pm that the concessions had not been forthcoming and 'News Corp has no choice but to cancel our management agreement. It is a sad day for all of us.' Staff were told no paper would be published today and they should clear their desks before the Post building was padlocked. Asked whether News Corporation might reconsider its position if the unions suddenly caved in, a spokesman for Mr Murdoch said: 'News Corporation, they're gone.' The fate of the Post will now be decided in the bankruptcy courts. Unless an alternative buyer emerges, which seems unlikely, the court will have little choice but to liquidate the business. Mr Murdoch was hailed as a last-chance saviour when he took over management of the Post in March after months of uncertainty over the paper's finances and ownership. The paper is still losing money heavily - over Dollars 300,000 (Pounds 200,000) a week, according to News Corporation  - and the demise of New York's smallest but raciest tabloid would give breathing space to its rivals in this overcrowded market, the Daily News and Newsday.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Old theme, new variation - The Prudential's latest offering Life assurance-linked savings policies such as endowments have been criticised by almost everybody - except those selling them - as expensive, inefficient and inflexible ways to save. Yet, that has not stopped the life companies, their sales forces, tied agents and commission-driven independent financial advisers (IFAs) from carrying on selling. Now, at last, the UK's largest life insurer has come up with a new variation on the old endowment theme which goes some way towards answering the main criticisms. The new Prudence savings account, from the Prudential, is a with-profits savings vehicle but there are several important differences between it and conventional with-profits endowment plans. These include: No fixed term. Savers are not tied to the standard terms of 10 or 25 years. Contributions can be regular monthly amounts, or occasional lump sums, or both. Regular savings amounts can be increased or decreased at any time so long as they stay above the Pounds 30 minimum. Contributions can be suspended if personal circumstances change - for months or years, if necessary. The only condition is that if, after 10 years, the account contains less than Pounds 1,000 and regular contributions are not being made, it will be closed down. The life assurance element is minimal, so single or childless people are not forced into paying for large amounts of unnecessary life cover. A separate, flexible term assurance policy is available if wanted. Partial withdrawals can be made if savers need access to the money - they do not have to choose all or nothing. There are drawbacks, though. Withdrawals are discouraged heavily during the first five to 10 years; inside this period, charges may mean you do not get all your money back. And if you have saved less than Pounds 3,000, there could be a withdrawal fee of up to Pounds 180. With-profits funds invest in shares, property, and fixed interest securities, so long-term returns should be better than a building society. But the actual returns paid to savers are at the discretion of the company actuary, rather than linked directly to stock market growth. Interest is paid in the form of annual 'bonuses'. Initially, these will start at 4.75 per cent, going up to 5.75 per cent on amounts over Pounds 4,000 and 7 per cent over Pounds 6,000. While these rates are no better than those available from building societies, there is also the possibility of additional bonuses on withdrawal or death. The company reserves the right, however, to make 'market value adjustments' when you withdraw large amounts. This means it can reduce the value of your investment if it misjudged the level of bonuses awarded earlier, or the market has fallen recently. Charges are slightly more transparent than with conventional endowments - there is a 6 per cent initial levy on contributions - but others are deducted from the fund before bonus levels are set, rather than being stated and fixed openly. The actuarial involvement makes the overall charging structure opaque, and costs generally will be higher than for more straightforward investment vehicles. Prudence is designed to appeal to unsophisticated or extremely risk-averse small savers. As such, it is a definite improvement on conventional life assurance-linked savings plans. But it will not attract more sophisticated people willing to take an active interest in their investments. Even if they only have small amounts to save, they should go for more direct equity-linked investments, such as unit or investment trust savings schemes, which provide better returns with lower costs and even greater flexibility.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GUTHRIE DECRIES 'FEAR OF MUSIC'  </P> <P> Folk singer Arlo Guthrie says it's ridiculous to put labels on records warning  that the lyrics may be offensive.  </P> <P> "The fact that people can spend their time thinking about all that stuff when  there are disasters going on all around us is kind of silly, I think," Guthrie  said.  </P> <P> He added, "The fear of music is more harmful than bad music."  </P> <P> Guthrie, the son of folk legend Woody Guthrie, is known for his hits "Alice's  Restaurant" and "City of New Orleans." He was scheduled for a concert tonight  at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> In May, the Recording Industry Assn. of America unveiled a voluntary "parental  guidance" label for recordings that might be deemed objectionable because of  lyrics dealing with such themes as sex, violence, suicide or drugs.  </P></p>

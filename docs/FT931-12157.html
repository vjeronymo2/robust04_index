			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs and fraud office in Maxwell deadlock THE Serious Fraud Office and the Commons social security committee failed to reach agreement last night on how to proceed with planned public hearings into the theft of funds from Maxwell company pension schemes. The SFO requested earlier this week that hearings arranged by the committee be called off because some of those due to appear at them could be material witnesses in criminal proceedings. The SFO had argued that disclosure of some information could lead defendants to argue that they had been denied the opportunity of a fair trial. In a two-hour meeting late yesterday, MPs on the committee put five options to the SFO for dealing with the hearings. They expect to receive their response in time to take a final decision the week after next. One option is to hold all the hearings in private. The MPs told the SFO that some of their forthcoming hearings will not be affected by the SFO's concerns. They emphasise that the decision about how to handle the hearings will ultimately be for them rather than the SFO. The SFO's views will be taken into account, though.</p>

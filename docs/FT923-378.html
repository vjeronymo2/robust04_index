			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Prisoner release touches sensitive nerve in S Africa 'I FELT happy watching him burn,' Mr George Skosana said on his release from prison, one of 154 South African political prisoners freed over the past four days in what the government says is an attempt to foster reconciliation. Mr Skosana was recounting the crime for which he was sentenced to death in 1987: the burning alive of a police informer in Pretoria in 1986. He says he would do it all again, as part of the struggle for political freedom in South Africa. Chilling comments such as these from 29-year-old Mr Skosana highlight the political sensitivity of the prisoner release programme, agreed at the weekend between President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC). Under the agreement, 150 ANC political prisoners have already been freed, with a further three - the most celebrated among them - released on parole yesterday. Between them, they have committed some of the most frightening political crimes in South African history, including the car bombing of a Durban beach-front bar in which three white women died. The bomber, Mr Robert McBride, left prison yesterday pledging to work for reconciliation - but noting that he would take up arms again 'if the situation becomes the same as in 1985,' when the ANC was banned and its activists ruthlessly hunted down by police. Mr McBride often made clear before his release that he regretted the deaths caused by his action. In a memo written in prison, he talks of his remorse: 'I personally will live for the rest of my life with the memories of those who died. . .I can never expect the families of those who died to forget, nor can I expect them to welcome my release. But reconciliation is not about forgetting our pain, it is about forgiving.' His release has provoked numerous phone complaints to the Department of Correctional Services, and radio talk shows in the days leading up to his release carried calls from many whites angry at his release. But far more furore appears to have been generated by the release yesterday of Mr Barend Strydom, nicknamed 'white wolf', the only right wing prisoner to have been freed so far. He is a self-confessed racist who killed seven blacks in a shooting spree on Pretoria in 1988, as part of the right wing's 'third freedom struggle'. Mr Strydom's crime gained notoriety, quite apart from its brutality, because he smiled while carrying it out. He told the court during his trial: 'During the shooting, the wounded did not appear to realise the gravity of the situation. I smiled. I see myself as a friendly person. It was difficult to suppress my laughter. I smiled and carried on.' Even more controversial will be government plans to grant amnesty to serving security force officers who have never been charged but who are believed to have committed politically motivated crimes. The ANC argues that this must be done by a multi-party interim government.</p>

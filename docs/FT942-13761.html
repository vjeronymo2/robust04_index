			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / South Korean premier quits: International News Digest Mr Lee Hoi-chang, South Korean prime minister, resigned yesterday and was immediately replaced by his deputy, Mr Lee Yung-dug. The unexpected resignation revealed a rift in the leadership of South Korea's civilian government, currently under pressure from the row with communist North Korea over Pyongyang's alleged development of nuclear arms. The outgoing Mr Lee, who took office last December, caused a political stir on Thursday when he said he wanted to increase his control over state affairs. News reports said Mr Lee had been at odds with some of his cabinet members over national policies. He is the second prime minister to resign since Mr Kim Young-sam came to power in February 1993 as the first civilian president in more than three decades of military-dominated politics.</p>

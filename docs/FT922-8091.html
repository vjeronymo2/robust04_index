			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pearlstine to resign from Dow Jones MR NORMAN PEARLSTINE, executive editor of The Wall Street Journal and the man who launched the newspaper's European edition 10 years ago, is resigning from Dow Jones, the media group that owns The Journal, to start his own media company. Mr Pearlstine, 49, joined Dow Jones in 1968 as a reporter in The Journal's Dallas bureau, and in 1976 became the first managing editor of The Asian Wall Street Journal, based in Hong Kong. In 1983, after directing the launch of the paper's European edition, Mr Pearlstine returned to New York to become a vice-president of The Journal and managing editor of the US edition. Last year he was named executive editor and took on responsibilities such as the launch of SmartMoney, a personal business magazine that is a joint venture between Dow Jones and the Hearst group. Mr Pearlstine will leave Dow Jones on June 30, but he will remain a consultant to SmartMoney and to Dow Jones on book and television projects in which he has been involved. Mr Paul Steiger, who became managing editor of The Journal in 1991, will take responsibility for The Journal's news department. Mr Peter Kann, chairman of Dow Jones, said he regretted Mr Pearlstine's decision to resign, but that 'the entrepreneur in any of us' could understand it.</p>

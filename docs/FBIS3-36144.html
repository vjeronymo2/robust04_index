Russian Presidential Administration  Launches Perestroyka"]    [Text] The new Constitution has once again raised the  question of authority. The Fundamental Law requires that it be  concentrated primarily in the hands of a president. The  president, apparently, does not object. Still, can this  objective be achieved without a strong and qualified staff -- at  least as qualified as, say, the government's? After the  successful adoption of the Constitution there has been only one  answer to the question: the presidential staff should be  brought "in line."    They say that at least two reorganization plans competed in  the Kremlin lobbies. The author of the first plan was Viktor  Ilyushin, the second one was drawn up by Sergey Filatov. As  soon as Sergey Filatov gave up his deputy seat to stay on in his  office, however, it became clear that it would be he who will  evidently head the presidential administration's perestroyka.  At present not only has Sergey Filatov prepared a plan for this  restructuring, but certain provisions of it have already been  implemented. Yeltsin, however, has yet to approve its general  concept. So, what is it that Sergey Filatov is going to propose  to the president?    In the first place, he suggested that the president's  information support should be dealt with in a more thorough  fashion. To this end, two analytical centers -- for general  policy and for socioeconomic policy -- will be merged into one.  It is not yet clear who will head the new center. One thing is  clear, however: Neither Anatoliy Rakitov, nor Petr Filippov, who  headed the former analytical structures, are considered among  candidates for the new post. The single analytical service will  bring together all information flows: government and Federal  Assembly documents, reports from the ground, and also mass media  publications. At the same time the so-called "situation room,"  in which information will be processed by special software, will  start operating.    Aside from the information service, a center for drawing up  presidential programs (possibly under Nikolay Malashev) will be  set up.    It is also proposed to expand the powers of the service in  charge of relations with the territories and the control  administration. There is a plan whereby the control  administration will set up its local branches.    Another service will deal with parties and public  organizations. It cannot be ruled out that it will be set up on  the basis of Georgiy Satarov's Sociopolitical Center. A  structure on international problems is also in the works.    To all appearances, the president will want to increase his  own control over personnel in various echelons of power,  including through setting up appropriate services within his  administration.    But for the time being these are only blueprints... But why  has Yeltsin not okayed them yet? The president has already  approved the post of his representative at the Federal Assembly  and appointed Aleksandr Yakovlev to the office. The first step  "to bring the staff in line" has thus been taken. What remains  is to wait for the next one.</p>

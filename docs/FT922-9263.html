			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises 3.1 per cent to recapture 18,000 level Tokyo A STRONGER yen and firmer bond prices encouraged buying by foreigners and investment trust funds, and the Nikkei average rose 3.1 per cent, regaining the 18,000 level for the first time since April 6, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed 532.22 higher at the day's best of 18,410.88. The index started the session on a weaker tone, slipping to a low for the day of 17,653.75 on profit-taking and arbitrage-related selling. Volume expanded to 400m shares from 280m as foreigners and investment trusts sought blue chip issues. Late afternoon index-related buying by dealers also boosted activity. Advances overwhelmed declines by 928 to 101, with 104 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks moved ahead 35.27, or 2.6 per cent, to 1,374.70, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 4.14 to 1,106.61. Traders said the rise reflected a brighter short-term outlook. However, many market participants remain cautious ahead of the corporate earnings reporting season for the business year to March. Mr Chris Appleton at Baring Securities said: 'The worst previews for the year to March 1992 seem to have been factored in by the recent selling, and people will focus on forecasts for the year to March 1993.' Many institutional investors remained inactive in spite of the rally. 'We have already bought at lower levels,' said a fund manager at Dai-Ichi Life. Blue chip high-technology issues gained on foreign buying. Sanyo Electric, the most active issue of the day, advanced Y47 to Y498 on bargain hunting. Domestic investors were also encouraged by reports that the company will enter the solar cell market. Foreigners also sought Bridgestone, the tyre maker, which appreciated Y40 to Y1,220. Speculative issues rose on continued buying by short-term traders. Okamoto Industries, the condom maker, put on Y40 to Y1,280 and Meiji Milk Products Y19 to Y865. Teac, the electronics maker, which has been recently traded actively on the 'US recovery' theme, lost ground. The issue fell Y40 to Y1,050 after Japan Securities Finance, the sole lender of margin stocks to brokers, warned it would restrict loans of Teac shares for margin selling. Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone rose Y13,000 to Y646,000 on reports that financial authorities were studying measures to support the issue. The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended Lec, the kitchen and bathroom-ware maker, amid reports that it had filed for court protection under the bankruptcy law. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 479.13 to 20,754.82 in volume of 25.5m shares. The index rose on late dealer buying and index-related activity. Roundup THE worsening political crisis left Bangkok closing at its lowest level this year, while the overall picture in Pacific Rim markets was mixed. BANGKOK fell further after the prime minister attacked the opposition for mounting protests against his government. The SET index dropped 6.90 to 710.72 in turnover of Bt5.05bn. HONG KONG gained ground on bargain hunting. The Hang Seng index rose 48.38 to 5,629.58 in turnover of HKDollars 3.7bn. HSBC Holdings advanced HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 45, but Henderson Land declined 20 cents to HKDollars 18.40. SEOUL weakened on fears of debt repayment problems affecting smaller companies. The composite index fell 8.51 to 603.34 in Won356.2bn turnover. Daewoo Heavy, Korea Air and Samsung Aerospace were all stronger after their consortium won the bid to launch South Korea's first satellites. TAIWAN lost ground as turnover fell to its lowest level since last October. The weighted index shed 0.96 to 4,481.29 in turnover of TDollars 10.8bn, down from TDollars 17.6bn.

The composite index lost 0.90 to 603.56. Declines led rises by 162 to 63.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Mhuia] </F>   [Text] (Xai-Xai)--Afonso Dhlakama has once again accused  the electoral registration teams (in Sofala, Tete, and Gaza) of  favoring the government.    "They bring two photographs -- one of Chissano's and another  of mine -- and then say: `Those who are going to vote for  Chissano step to this side, and those voting for Dhlakama step  to that side.' Those who will vote for Chissano are the first to  be registered."    That accusation was made yesterday at an informal news  conference during Renamo's [Mozambique National Resistance] Gaza  provincial conference, which Dhlakama is chairing. According to  Dhlakama, Renamo made a mistake by approving the section of the  Electoral Law that entitles government to establish registration  teams.    Dhlakama said right now the struggle is "political" and not  an "armed one," adding that Renamo is getting ready for the  "second victory," the "first phase of which is the registration  of voters." He said Renamo members should be encouraged to  regard civic education "as an immediate step."    He told MEDIAFAX: "We have never prevented registration and  civic education teams from entering our areas. It is a  government ploy to prevent people living in Renamo areas from  being registered, because the government knows that they will  vote for Renamo. In fact, we are forcing the government to  register people under Renamo control."    Dhlakama, who says he is involved in a preelectoral  campaign,  criticized Chissano for campaigning for Frelimo [Mozambique  Liberation Front] in his capacity as head of state. Chissano  has been declaring "days off so that managers and students  attend his rallies; factories have been closed down." He added:  "That is a violation of the Rome accord."    At the Renamo conference, delegates asked for financial  assistance and transportation. Renamo "is going to give them  bicycles, motorcycles, and money for bus fares." No automobiles  will be provided "because we lack them for every district."</p>

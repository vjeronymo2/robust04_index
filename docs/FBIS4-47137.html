			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor M. Kyriyenko, doctor of economic </F> sciences: "The Three I's of Leonid Kravchuk: Inconsistency,  Indecision, Indeterminateness"]    [Text] It is no longer a secret for anyone that Ukraine is  on the brink of an unprecedented economic crisis, which in terms  of its consequences and losses is tantamount to a great war. The  inept former parliament and a president who procrastinates for  years have brought this about. Instead of creating the necessary  conditions to develop production and ensure an improvement in  the welfare of the population following the proclamation of  independence, the president and the power structure have done  everything in order to cause in the country economic chaos and  an extraordinary crisis, the like of which nobody in the world  has experienced. There has been a lot of twaddle under the  leadership of the president; actually, everything has been done  in order not to approve a new democratic Constitution, which  would have set the direction for building the state and codified  the supremacy of the people, rather than the bureaucratic power  structure. The people remain deprived of their rights and  reduced to despair and misery in an independent Ukraine under  President L. Kravchuk, just as they previously were under  Stalin's and Brezhnev's rule.    Now that the holding of the 26 June presidential election is  drawing nearer, the president and his entourage are doing  everything so that the election will not be held. The president  understands that a new stage of building the state is coming  which calls for a new strategy and tactic and for a renewal of  the confidence of the people. They are in mortal fear of the  election, which will amount to the verdict of the people for the  woes and misery that they have brought down on the people. The  political "dodges" of the president were revealed to the fullest  extent in a conversation with journalists during his visit to  the editorial office of the newspaper KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, in  other presentations, and in his address to the new parliament.    On 20 February of this year, Leonid Makarovych announced his  decision not to take part in the next presidential election on a  Radio Liberty program. The president stated: "My participation  in the election is infeasible, as is the election itself."    The predominant motif in all presentations of the president  is: The election should be postponed until a new Constitution is  adopted and until the powers of the president and the government  are defined. This begs the question: Who prevented the president  from recommending that the parliament develop and approve a new  Constitution, using the mandate of people's confidence, which  the president to my mind does not justify? Was there not enough  time?    There was time. In the process, the president could have  displayed the kind of determination he did in order to destroy  the USSR in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, referring to the people's  mandate and the Independence Declaration.    The president has started to worry about the  constitutionality of the election. If we proceed from the need  for the new parliament to restore the absolute sovereignty of  the people, rather than the power structure, the election will  be constitutional in nature. The election will affirm the  superiority of the power of the people who have been reduced to  starvation and poverty, the people whom some are already calling  "brutes." Each candidate for president will present his program,  which will outline the key state-creating democratic provisions  that will later be contributed to the development of a  democratic Constitution of the independent state.    As President L.M. Kravchuk was signing the Election Law, he  believed that this law was not for him: "This was unacceptable  for me." "As I signed the law, I knew what I was doing, but even  then I made the decision for myself: It was not for me.... It  was required by strikes and political demands." [preceding  statements by Kravchuk given in Russian in the original] Such is  the attitude of the president toward the law. The will of the  people may be frivolously toyed with. None other than the  president has talked repeatedly about the creation of a  rule-of-law state in which the law should be complied with by  each citizen, from the president on down to the lowly clerk.    The president is intimidating the parliament with the fact  that the entire responsibility will devolve to it if it confirms  the decision of the former Supreme Council, because that  parliament does not exist anymore. It is not a secret to anyone  that L.M. Kravchuk wishes to keep himself as president and his  bankrupt bureaucratic-administrative system as long as possible.  Leonid Makarovych maintains that a president with unknown powers  may be elected, whereas differing interests of diverse regions  of Ukraine exist, which may bring about a confrontation.    To my mind, the people will be able to assess the programs  of  all candidates for president through the election--programs that  could unite the fundamental interests of the people of Ukraine  in the east and the west, and in the south and the north alike.  The early election of the president and local councils on 26  June will allow the people of Ukraine to reveal their genuine  will and give them an opportunity to elect such a president and  such local organs that will be capable of making Ukraine into a  civilized state.</p>

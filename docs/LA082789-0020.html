			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'REAL BOOKS' FOR CALIFORNIA CLASSROOMS: SCHOOLS ALSO NEED REAL-WORLD SOLUTIONS  </P> <P> We are in the midst of a revolution -- a quiet, intellectual revolution  spinning out dramatic insights into how the brain works, how we acquire  language and how we construct meaning in our lives . . . . -- The 1987  California English Language Arts Framework  </P> <P> The literature-based reading program being introduced in California schools  this fall, reflecting a revolutionary trend in schools nationwide, will  fundamentally alter the way children learn to read, write and spell.  </P> <P> On the bright side, literature-based instruction heralds a renaissance of the  love of reading. The colorful new readers are filled with classic literature  instead of prose hacked out at publishing houses -- progress, by anyone's  standard. After a six-year transition, all readers may become obsolete.  Classrooms of the future will be filled with what youngsters call "real books."  </P> <P> Parents may be surprised to find no spelling or grammar texts in their kids'  backpacks. Phonics and skill instruction will once again take a back seat,  along with paper-and-pencil drill, objective tests and detailed record-keeping.  </P> <P> California's new English Language Arts Framework, cornerstone of the program,  is a broad philosophical document. In practice, interpretation will vary from  district to district, teacher to teacher.  </P> <P> Ideally, the classroom of the future will be an active place where reading,  speaking and writing are the main occupations. Traditional reading groups --  high, medium and low -- are on the way out. Children will read self-selected  books, books chosen by the teacher to meet individual needs and "core  literature," selected by district committees. They will respond to reading  through a wealth of language-related projects.  </P> <P> The new wisdom is that reading skills should be taught in context, only as  needed; likewise for grammar and spelling, 50% of which will optimally be  culled from readings and student writing. Any loss in continuity from year to  year is deemed negligible next to the benefit of making skills relevant.  According to the latest research, mastering spelling words in isolation has  little relation to becoming a good speller; grammar is best absorbed through  listening.  </P> <P> These reforms represent a swing of the pendulum away from the hyper-rationalism  of the '70s, when behavioral scientists tried to take the guesswork out of  teaching by quantifying reading into hundreds of small, measurable skills,  ushering in one of the most tedious and compulsive eras in schoolhouse history.  Long-term results were disappointing -- and little wonder, since skills had  become an end in themselves.  </P> <P> A pivotal 1985 national study, "On Becoming a Nation of Readers," revealed that  70% of the reading period in elementary classrooms was being spent on rote  "seatwork" -- filling in blanks and circling or underlining answers on  mind-numbing skill sheets.  </P> <P> The backlash now sweeping across the nation is founded on a radically different  assumption: Given meaningful experiences in reading and writing, the majority  of children will become fluent readers without intensive, skill-based  instruction. Just as figure-eights and compulsories do not constitute ice  skating, mastering a sequence of skills does not necessarily add up to fluent  reading. Thus, the new framework states that while some phonics is necessary in  the primary grades, children learn to read primarily by reading.  </P> <P> As anyone who has marveled at a preschooler reading a favorite storybook will  tell you, children who love books and hear stories frequently can acquire  reading naturally, just as they acquire language.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, many teachers are concerned that the pendulum may swing too far.  They argue that skill-based instruction in phonics, reading comprehension,  spelling and grammar are essential to a balanced language-arts program. Because  children have more than one learning style, effective teachers include varied  strategies in their bags of tricks.  </P> <P> In a way, the issue boils down to a conflict between two learning modalities of  the human brain. The '70s were dominated by a linear, analytic style  characteristic of the left brain. The current program leans toward a holistic,  whole-word approach. Most teachers tend to be eclectics, recognizing that both  modes of learning are native to human intelligence and thus have a place in the  classroom.  </P> <P> One controversial feature of the program requires that all students be exposed  to the core literature, whether they can decode it or not. For years,  individualized instruction -- assigning books according to ability levels --  has been standard practice. Now, flying a banner called "equal access,"  proponents argue that all children need an opportunity to grapple with  age-appropriate books and themes. Teachers and peers may read aloud to low  students, who will learn by "following along."  </P> <P> Interpretations vary on how much classroom time should be spent on whole-group  reading. There is also debate on what innovative techniques teachers can use to  meet individual needs of students without assigning workbooks and readers at  their functional level.  </P> <P> One thing is certain. Never has a program demanded more from teachers, who are  gearing up to make literature-based instruction work. Extensive retraining  would be desirable, but in some California districts, in part due to budget  deficits, in-service training has been insufficient. California's new framework  is idealistic in the best sense: It seeks to help students "unlock the doors of  language and discover the best that human beings have thought, written and  spoken." Since the benefits of producing "a nation of readers" are profound, in  this age of TV, movies and video games, there is all the more reason to pause  at the outset and take stock.  </P> <P> A global reading program in a state as diverse as California is best  incorporated with balance and moderation. A renaissance is needed, not a  revolution. Educators can ensure its success by embracing innovative strategies  while still maintaining a commitment to structure, defined skill objectives and  academic continuity.  </P> <P> Nor should Sacramento delude the public that pedagogic reforms will solve the  crisis in our schools. The mediocre results of even excellent state programs is  proof that methodology isn't the issue. Broken families, poor discipline,  poverty, transiency, apathy and lack of follow-through at home, a multilingual  population, low funding for education and the resulting overcrowded classrooms  and underpaid teachers are the real issues.  </P> <P> These conditions undermine the best methods and the best teachers. In this  context, new teaching methods and texts can have little effect without  attention to real-world solutions: smaller classes, more help for  limited-English speakers, clear-cut standards for grade-level promotion, home  involvement, tougher use of review and dismissal procedures to remove weak  teachers and administrators, better pay to attract top educators to California,  a uniform statewide curriculum to meet the needs of a transient population and  common-sense teaching strategies.  </P></p>

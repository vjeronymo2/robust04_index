			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / International Company News: Gota slides to deficit of SKr2.1bn GOTA Group, Sweden's fourth largest bank, has unveiled a deficit of SKr2.1bn (Dollars 351.8m) for last year, following a sharp rise in bad debt provisions. The loss compares with a profit of SKr1.18bn in 1990. In 1991 the provisions jumped to SKr3.77bn, which amounted to 4.6 per cent of loan volume. This contrasts with SKr982m of bad debts for the previous year, equal to 1.1 per cent of loans volume. 'It is a very weak result,' admitted Mr Gabriel Urwitz, chief executive. He refused to make any forecast for this year, saying 'that depends too much on how the Swedish economy grows and it is too early to say anything about that'. However, he was able to draw comfort from the assistance being provided for the group from its largest shareholder, Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish insurance company. Last December it provided a SKr1.5bn emergency loan when Gota revealed it expected a Skr1.4bn operating loss. This boosted Gota's capital ratio to 11.2 per cent. The worsening bad debts stem partly from loans to the ailing finance company, Gamlestaden, last autumn. Gota's net interest income fell to SKr3.33bn last year from Skr3.81bn in 1990.</p>

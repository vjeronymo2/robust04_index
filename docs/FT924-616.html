			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: C3W seeks withdrawal of HTV's licence One of the unsuccessful bidders for the Wales and the West ITV franchise has formally called on the Independent Television Commission to revoke HTV's licence. C3W which passed the quality threshold but was outbid by HTV sent the formal application to Sir George Russell, the ITC chairman, on the grounds that HTV would not be able to fulfil its programming obligations. The new franchise period starts on January 1. HTV bid Pounds 20.5m a year to retain its broadcasting licence and like most ITV companies has been hit by the recession. It has also been suffering from a drift of advertising to London and the south. C3W is backed by Associated Newspapers and Flextech, the cable television companies. The consortium has also been recently joined by Chrysalis, the independent record and broadcasting group. Earlier this year White Rose Television made a similar move against Yorkshire but it was thrown out by the ITC. The ITC is likely to take a similarly robust view of the C3W attack on HTV. ITC officials believe that according to broadcasting legislation a company only has to have its business plan passed once by the ITC. An existing ITV company is already proving that it is capable of broadcasting and that it is only when it has actually failed to fulfil its programme obligations that the ITC would move against it. The ITC has the power to impose fines, reduce the length of a company's franchise and even remove the licence.</p>

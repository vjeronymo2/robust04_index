			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> PHILLIES EXTEND MANAGERS' PACTS  </P> <P> Philadelphia Phillies Manager Nick Leyva and General Manager Lee Thomas have  received contract extensions through the 1992 seasons.  </P> <P> The team did not disclose financial details of either contract, but The  Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Leyva's was worth $500,000.  </P> <P> Phillies President Bill Giles said he was extremely pleased with Thomas, who  initiated a wholesale reorganization of the franchise after coming to  Philadelphia in June, 1988.  </P> <P> Thomas took over a last-place team that won 65 games in 1988 and 67 last year.  Through trades, free agent signings and development of a few players from a  very thin farm system, the Phillies are playing .500 baseball this season and  are only nine games out of first in the NL East.  </P> <P> "I'm excited because I know that soon this club is going to be a very good  club," Leyva said.  </P></p>

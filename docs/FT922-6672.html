			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei remains resilient in arbitrage-led trading SCATTERED buying propped up share prices yesterday as investors remained inactive ahead of the earnings results of leading companies, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 16.36 to 18,691.29 after a day's low of 18,552.99 and high of 18,760.74. Trading was slow due to a lack of corporate news, with arbitrage-related activity leading price movements. Volume shrank to 270m shares from 320m. Declines led rises by 583 to 409, with 149 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 3.19 to 1,391.32, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.18 up at 1,103.76. Traders said prices were showing resilience in spite of the lethargic activity. A trader at Baring Securities said sentiment had turned as investors felt that prices had bottomed out. 'A month ago, the market would have fallen 600 points on a trading day like this,' he added. However, most market participants believe that the current resistance level of the Nikkei is at 19,000, and some are looking to sell once the index rises to that point. Dealers continued to target speculative issues on short-term trading. Mitsubishi Kakoki, the most active stock of the day, fell Y60 to Y1,130 on profit-taking. Ebara, the industrial pump maker, was sought as an environmental share, gaining Y20 to Y1,560. Isuzu Motors advanced Y15 to Y310 on rumours that a leading US car maker was increasing its stake in the company. Sankyu, a transport company, climbed Y13 to Y563 on a strong earnings outlook. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, put on Y100 to Y10,300 after reporting a two-fold rise in pre-tax profits for the last fiscal year to Y33.5bn. The market was also heartened by its forecast of a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the current year to March. Leading consumer electronics groups were weaker. Matsushita Electric Industrial, which posted a 39 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y363.4bn, was off Y10 at Y1,370. Sony, which saw a pre-tax profits drop of 44 per cent, slipped Y50 to Y4,310. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 96.30 to 21,251.85 in volume of 15.3m shares. Small-lot profit-taking depressed Ono Pharmaceutical by Y110 to Y6,200, and Nintendo, the video game manufacturer, dipped Y100 to Y11,400. Roundup STRONG exceptions in a generally easier Pacific Basin region were provided by Hong Kong and Bangkok. HONG KONG soared to a record high in heavy trading, buoyed by lower interbank rates and an influx of capital from Thailand. The Hang Seng index shot up 111.85 to 5,865.61 as turnover swelled to HKDollars 4.6bn from HKDollars 3.9bn. Property counters were the star performers. Hong Kong Land advanced 30 cents to HKDollars 11.90 and New World 40 cents to HKDollars 18.50. BANGKOK closed sharply higher as investors were reassured by the intervention of the king in the political situation, and by the relative calm following the days of civil unrest. The SET index surged 60.30, or 9 per cent, to 738.67 as turnover reached Bt4.8bn, against Bt4.7bn. Many blue chips rose by their 10 per cent daily limit. AUSTRALIA focused on a weak banking sector, which tumbled after news late on Wednesday that Westpac had made a loss of ADollars 1.7bn in its fiscal first half, when analysts had expected a small profit. It ended down 17 cents at ADollars 3.72, after a day's low of ADollars 3.58. The All Ordinaries index was a slight 0.6 up at 1,682.6 in turnover of ADollars 309m. NEW ZEALAND fell on concern over how Australia would perform after the Westpac news. The NZSE-40 capital index moved in a narrow range before closing 0.34 down at 1,547.09. Turnover jumped to NZDollars 36.3m from NZDollars 19.4m. SINGAPORE declined in quiet trading. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 5.06 to 1,467.81 in SDollars 96.6m turnover. MANILA closed at a 1992 peak. The composite index advanced 18.60 to 1,376.80 in turnover of 156m pesos. PLDT rose 20 pesos to 1,110 pesos. SEOUL lost early gains as sentiment turned negative. The composite index was down 6.08 at 573.83. KUALA LUMPUR finished softer in light trading after an early attempt to add to Wednesday's gains failed. The composite index shed 1.23 to 592.86. TAIWAN's weighted index rose 3.67 to 4,563.67 in turnover of TDollars 35.8bn, after TDollars 30.1bn.</p>

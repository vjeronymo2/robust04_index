Radio Velkaton, based in Velika Kladusa, the centre of the  Muslim autonomous province of West Bosnia (APZB), reported on  Sunday that troops loyal to fundamentalist leader Alija  Izetbegovic were not chosing means in an effort to enter the  territory held by APZB forces. According to the same source,  there are dead, wounded and captured on both sides.    Radio Bihac, held by Izetbegovic's supporters, said that  forces loyal to APZB President Fikret Abdic unsuccessfully  attempted a number of infantry breakthroughs on the night of  June 25-26 and Sunday morning. The APZB was proclaimed in 1993  on the basis of the outcome of a referendum held in the Cazin  Krajina, which is predominantlx populated by Muslims. Shortly  after, President Abdic, a successful local businessman, signed  peace accords with the Bosnian Serbs and Croats.    There followed an outbreak of fighting between APZB troops  and troops loyal to Izetbegovic. Several hundred people have  been killed in the inter-Muslim fighting.</p>

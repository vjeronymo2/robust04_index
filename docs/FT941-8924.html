			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Share options not incentive to perform Sir, Monday's articles on the subject of executives' share options provide a fascinating collection of political point-scoring, opinions and views, but do not address the essential point. Interestingly, Richard Gourlay commented, in relation to the electricity company executives who stand to make significant option gains, that in all cases the share prices have more than doubled and profits have sharply increased ('Brown says share options cost Pounds 100m in lost tax'). So shareholders, far from being victims of share options, have also done extremely well] Only Anne Simpson, of Pensions and Investment Research Consultants, comes close to the real issue in Lucy Kellaway's article ('A fairer slice of the pie'), by arguing - rightly - that share options are a poor means of motivation. Executives' pay should encourage managers to improve the performance of their businesses. Pay for performance is, clearly, the right approach; relying on share options to provide the link is not. Attaching performance targets to the exercise of options ignores the inescapable truth that, in any event, the option gain is dependent on the share price on the day of exercise. Options are a route into the equity, not an incentive to perform. Let's get away from focusing on the amount of executives' pay and concentrate on the way they are paid. If the methodology represents a good deal between management and shareholders - go for it. PF Norris, director, MM&amp;K Remuneration, 1 Bengal Court, Birchin Lane, London EC3V 9DD</p>

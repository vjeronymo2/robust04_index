			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Lithuania's pressure cooker - A look at attempts to improve standards at the Ignalina nuclear power plant The factories which built the equipment for the world's two biggest nuclear reactors stand empty along the road through Lithuania's national forest. Disused construction cranes peer over the birch trees, pointing the way to the Ignalina nuclear power plant. Their job is not finished and probably never will be. Two RBMK, light water, gas-cooled or 'Chernobyl-type' reactors were built at Ignalina before public unrest and environmental pressures stopped work on the third plant in the mid-1980s. A fourth was planned, but not begun. Since Lithuania's independence two years ago, alarm over safety at the Soviet-built power station has prompted western countries to increase their safety efforts. The work is being led by Sweden, just across the Baltic Sea. The Swedish government has paid SKr70m (Pounds 5.8m), with another SKr53.2m due next year to improve the reactors and train workers ahead of a total shut-down, likely to be some years off. Much of the Swedish aid addresses the safety concerns voiced by the plant's management in a report last February by the International Atomic Energy Agency. These can be met by hardware purchases such as a better steam pressure relief system. ABB Atom, the nuclear energy division of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, has been contracted to provide a robotic tool to descend into the reactor cavity's high-radiation areas and improve the steam pressure relief system. In the chain reaction that heats water to boiling point, fuel rods containing uranium dioxide are used; the mixture of steam and water goes to a steam separator and then to the turbines, producing electricity. The danger is that if too much radioactive steam is released, the reactor cavity  -about twice the size of those in the west - could burst. Normally, when pressure valves break, the steam is channelled to a condensation pool. But Ignalina can only withstand a rupture of four valves, below western norms. If more break, there is a risk of contamination. So ABB Atom will help install a new pressure relief pipe connecting the reactor cavity to a condensation system. Even bigger than the risk of contamination, however, is that of fire. Its consequences, the IAEA says, could be 'severe'. Vattenfall, Sweden's state power company, has contracts to provide extinguishers, masks, a fire and hydrogen alarm system and improve the sprinkler system to prevent overheating. But none of this equipment can be delivered until the Lithuanian parliament approves a law under which the country accepts liability for nuclear accidents. This is expected to happen next year. However, other projects are running more smoothly. Engineers from another ABB unit, ABB Tekniska Rontgen-centralen, are performing tests at the reactors, including inspection of the 1,661 water-cooled fuel channels. It has developed an ultrasonic scanner to spot welding defects in the channels' upper sections. These cracks pose no immediate threat. But, says Peter Schaub, an ABB engineer: 'All defects are dangerous in a nuclear power plant. We have to help the plant people understand that defects are not acceptable.' The scanner has detected hundreds of so-called 'weld root defects', which have been fixed. Yet the whole process could take years. Cracks develop over time and frequent inspections are needed. Thus the plant only operates one reactor at a time, allowing inspectors work at the other. There have been many changes at Ignalina since 1986. Control systems have been upgraded, fuel channels loaded with extra absorbent rods to enable them to withstand more heat and shut-down speed accelerated. To minimise risk even further, the plant only operates at 1,300MW, below its capacity of 1,500MW. 'We've done everything to prevent another Chernobyl,' insists Viktor Shevaldin, the plant director. But not everyone shares this optimism. Two Danish Euro-MPs touched off a flurry of disquieting press reports in Copenhagen about Lithuania's 'Chernobyl-to-be' by vividly describing safety problems at Ignalina and calling the ABB Atom efforts inadequate. Certainly, the decade-old plant, with its gigantic twin reactor and turbine halls, looks far older than its years. Paint is peeling and machinery seems outdated. A radiation monitoring machine for workers has not been turned on. A 1cm crack in the cooling system almost caused a significant accident last year; faulty valves, similar to those held responsible for the 1991 accident at Sosnovy Bor near St Petersburg, were inexplicably found in the reactor this summer. A turbine cooling pipe broke last month. Structurally, the problems are serious. The Swedish moves are only the first in the improvement programme at Ignalina. Tord Sterner, vice-president for nuclear services at ABB Atom, says other necessary work includes the installation of an emergency feed water system, modernisation of the control systems and the updating and replacing of more equipment. Yet there are limits to what can be achieved. Unlike western plants, for example, the reactor building cannot be encased to help withstand a potentially disastrous steam release during an accident. 'You cannot make it as safe as European reactors because that's the way it was built,' says Morten Sondergaard, an EC Phare (aid for eastern Europe) programme consultant at the Lithuanian ministry of energy. Away from the reactors, spent fuel is stored inside water pools, which are almost full. Germany's Gesellschaft fur Nuklear-Behalter has won a contract to put the spent fuel in dry storage containers designed to last 50 years. The Lithuanian government is today expected to approve the contract with GNB, which outbid Ontario Hydro of Canada. Another problem is security. A 7m-long, spent fuel shell, full of radioactive material, disappeared from the plant this summer. Also causing concern since the break-up of the Soviet Union is morale among Ignalina's 5,000 employees, mostly Russian. Lithuania has granted them citizenship, but the IAEA and Shevaldin fret about the trickle of migration back to Russia. Closing the plant would solve these problems. Initially, western governments thought the reactors could be decommissioned quickly. Then they realised what this would cost. 'You can demand that the plant be shut down,' says Jan Nistand, director of the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate, which handles the Swedish bilateral aid programme. 'But only if you have alternatives to offer.' There are few. Without Ignalina, most Lithuanians, already with no hot water, would live in the dark. The plant supplies 85 per cent of the country's electricity needs. No other country in the world depends so much on nuclear power. Moreover, half of the electricity produced in Lithuania is exported to neighbouring Latvia, Belarus and Russia's Kaliningrad region. Facing similar pressures, the Ukrainian parliament has reversed its earlier order to close Chernobyl by the year's end. Decommissioning could cost as much as building a new plant. As a result, western governments prefer to fund short-term patching-up operations to put them at ease before shut-down; the Swedish inspectorate expects this to be possible in eight or 10 years, when the pressure tubes will have to be replaced. Only Sweden has a substantial bilateral programme at Ignalina - or, indeed, at any Soviet-era nuclear power station. Instead, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development co-ordinates multilateral aid for the former Soviet bloc's problem plants. It is considering a grant to purchase equipment for Ignalina. At Ignalina, Shevaldin has few kind words for the EBRD. 'The Bank won't give us the money directly. It'll stay somewhere in the west. We'll never see it. Only with Sweden do we have real work'. He also brushes aside any talk of shut-down and asserts - contrary to the view of western experts - that Ignalina will be open another 30 years, the life expectancy of the younger reactor.</p>

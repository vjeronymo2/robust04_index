			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Lenders on war footing - A look at mortgage rate moves NATIONWIDE Anglia's surprise decision this week to cut its mortgage rate by 0.7 of a percentage point has raised hopes that other lenders will follow suit soon, providing a much-needed boost for the property market. There is already considerable speculation that there will be a further cut in the base rate next week. This is because the Retail Price Index, which is due out on Friday, is expected to show a sharp drop in inflation, from 8.2 per cent to perhaps 6.1 or 6.2 per cent. Such a fall in the RPI could trigger another half percentage point cut in the base rate, from 12.5 per cent to 12 per cent. Nationwide Anglia's new rates come into force today for new borrowers, but existing borrowers will have to wait until July 1 before their mortgage bills are cut. The rate for borrowers with mortgages of over Pounds 120,000 will be 11.25 per cent, and for loans of between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 120,000 the rate will be 11.75 per cent. For mortgages below Pounds 60,000, the rate will be 12.25 per cent. The cut may mean bad news for savers, however. Nationwide has admitted that its savings rates will have to be reduced by the summer but has given no commitment as to how big the cuts will be. It is still unclear whether other banks and building societies will also reduce their rates. A spokesman for the Nationwide said: 'I think it is only a matter of time before we are joined.' However, many of its competitors have ruled out a cut in their rates until there has been a further cut in the base rate. A spokesman for the Halifax building society, the largest mortgage lender, said: 'we intend to stay competitive but this move has no real effect until July 1 which is some way off and it gives us time to consider the market impact.' It seems likely that they will wait for a base rate cut before making a move. The clearing banks reacted similarly and most said that they have no plans to follow the Nationwide's move immediately unless there is a mortgage rate war. A spokesman for Barclays said: 'we will have to wait and see what happens to base rates. We responded to the last base rate cut with a cut in mortgage rates.' Midland is not ruling out a mortgage cut but is currently reviewing its position. Abbey National, which has already cut its mortgage rate twice since February, said it had no intention of following suit. 'If base rates come down we will have to consider changing our mortgage rate but that is very hypothetical. We are not just going to follow the Nationwide in a knee-jerk reaction . . . they are gambling on a further Bank of England base rate cut.' A spokesman for Alliance &amp; Leicester said 'we have certainly not made a decision to move down. For the time being the Nationwide move is clearly a one-off.' However, he admitted that it was important for the Alliance &amp; Leicester to remain competitive. Woolwich said: 'we certainly intend to move our mortgage rate down again when base rates come down.' However, it ruled out any cuts before a base rate move. Already some of the smaller lenders have reacted to the Nationwide Anglia's mortgage rate cut by offering discounts. Town &amp; Country building society is offering a 0.55 percentage point discount on new mortgages, so the new basic mortgage rate will be 12.4 per cent. Citibank Mortgage, a centralised lender, is offering a 1.5 per cent discount, available until January 1992 for new borrowers taking out loans from Pounds 10,000-Pounds 150,000. The new rate will be 11.45 per cent which makes it cheaper than the Nationwide's mortgage for smaller loans. There is also strong competition to offer discounts for first-time buyers which the lenders regard as an important way in which to stimulate the housing market. For example, among the banks, the rate for first-time buyers with Lloyds will be 11.2 per cent from May 17, an offer which runs until March 31, 1992. Barclays are offering a rate of 11.45 per cent for first-time buyers, which is capped until April next year - in other words, the rate will not move above this level, but is free to move lower.</p>

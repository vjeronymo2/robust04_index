			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Puzzle over two Nadir witnesses QUESTIONS continue to surround the credibility of the two witnesses who claim to have been behind allegations that Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, attempted to bribe his trial judge. A number of doubts remain as the attorney general yesterday rejected calls for a public inquiry into the conduct of the police investigation into the allegations. The calls were repeated yesterday by Mr Nadir, Mr Michael Mates MP, and Mr Anthony Scrivener, Mr Nadir's barrister. In a statement released on Tuesday the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that Mr Michael Francis and Ms Wendy Welsher had triggered the original police investigation. Mr Francis has a criminal record. Ms Welsher is known to have handled a valuable painting claimed by Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy. Both are now believed to be in northern Cyprus, where Mr Nadir fled after illegally jumping bail in May. Officials involved in the case yesterday questioned why the two witnesses were now staying so close to Mr Nadir if they had - as they now claim - fabricated the evidence to support suggestions that he had attempted to bribe Mr Justice Tucker. If the witnesses did make up the evidence - which they now allege was done at the prompting of senior police officials - they could face severe penalties for perverting the course of justice. The police have rejected any suggestions that they were involved in such a conspiracy. One possible motive for their alleged involvement would be that the Serious Fraud Office believed Mr Justice Tucker was too sympathetic to Mr Nadir. It was Mr Nadir, however, who appealed to the divisional court to change the judge in March this year in response to concerns that his trial may have been prejudiced by the allegations. The original allegations of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice were first made in open court during a hearing on Mr Nadir's case in November last year by Mr Robert Owen QC on behalf of the Serious Fraud Office. The investigation was taken up by the Metropolitan Police which, according to the Crown Prosecution Service, delivered a report on November 5 this year which contained no 'credible' evidence to support the allegations. Documents circulated by Mr Nadir during the summer reproduce what is claimed to be the only evidence of the conspiracy, a piece of paper signed by Safiye Nadir, Mr Nadir's mother, and Bilge Nevzat, his sister, agreeing to guarantee payment of Pounds 3.5m to Mr David Kent, a pseudonym for Mr Francis. This is supported by a letter saying the SFO was notified of the document on October 1 1992, with allegations that the money was to be paid to Mr Justice Tucker following Mr Nadir's successful departure from the UK. One question for the police - emphasised by both Mr Scrivener and Mr Nadir yesterday - is whether this was sufficient to justify making the allegations in court.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: News management Mr Rupert Murdoch's contrarian thinking has served his shareholders well. But his ambitions to create a differential voting structure at News Corporation go unhealthily against the grain of investor opinion. UK companies, such as GUS and Whitbread, have recently felt compelled to enfranchise non-voting shares. Continental European companies, too, are busy simplifying voting structures. The Australian stock exchange would hardly enhance its reputation by condoning the reverse. The precise motivation for the plan is murky although there may well be a defensive intent. With a market value near ADollars 20bn (Pounds 8.6bn), News Corporation would appear impregnable. Yet, in bidding for Paramount, both Viacom and QVC have shown that some relative minnows have ambitions far above their stations. It seems more probable that Mr Murdoch simply does not want his family's 32.7 per cent shareholding diluted further. This could well have some bearing on as-yet-unknown succession plans. It could also prove crucial if many new shares were issued as part of any strategic alliance or grand expansion. With News's shares trading on a lofty rating, the temptation to fund acquisitions with equity is overwhelming. After all, News is painfully familiar with the perils of bank debt.</p>

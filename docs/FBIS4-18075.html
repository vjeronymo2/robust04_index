			<p>BFN     [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The talks between He Guangyuan,  Chinese minister of the machine-building industry and  electronics, and Baden-Wuerttemberg Economics Minister Dieter  Spoeri (Social Democratic Party of Germany) focused on  cooperation between the Mercedes-Benz AG and the Robert Bosch  GmbH (both Stuttgart) with Chinese companies. The Stuttgart  ministry reported on Wednesday [30 March] that diesel engines,  passenger cars, car electronics, and injection pumps are at  issue. Spoeri also promised accompanying help for the projects  on a federal level.    According to its own information, Bosch is negotiating with  six to eight Chinese firms on participation and cooperation,  among other things, in the field of gasoline and diesel  injections and generators. The negotiations are expected to be  concluded before the summer. Mercedes did not want to comment  on the projects.</p>

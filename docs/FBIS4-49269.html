			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister Paias  Wingti of Papua New Guinea (PNG) said today that the mutual  visits and meetings between leaders of PNG and China are of  importance to the development of bilateral relations.    Wingti made this remark in a meeting with Tian Jiyun, vice  chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), who  was leading a NPC delegation on a visit to the South-Pacific  country.    Wingti pointed out that both China, with a population of  over  one billion, and PNG are situated in the Asia-Pacific region,  and China has the major influence in the world.    Tian, who praised Wingti for his efforts to further increase  friendship between the two nations, expressed his appreciation  for PNG's adherence to the "one China" policy.    The two leaders also exchanged views on furthering the  bilateral economic and trade cooperation and predicted an upbeat  prospect for the expansion of trade and economic and  technological cooperation between the two countries.    Meanwhile, PNG Acting Governor-General Bill Skate also met  Tian Jiyun on Monday [2 May]. He told Tian that he would  continue to make efforts in enhancing friendship between the two  nations.    Tian said that both China and PNG are the developing nations  and that the two nations have shared the common interests in  safeguarding peace and promoting prosperity in the region and  improving the living standards of their own countries. He also  said that the Chinese Government and NPC are willing, together  with the PNG Government and Parliament, to usher the bilateral  ties in a new stage.    Tian left Port Moresby this afternoon for Australia to  continue his South-Pacific trip.</p>

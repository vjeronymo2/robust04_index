			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Richards Group profits halved Having suffered badly from the recession, Richards Group has decided to pursue a strategy which will reduce independence on the UK construction sector. A new 'sand laundering' service is to be introduced to the UK foundry industry, the steel supports system is seeking additional business from the oil and petrochemical industries, and a significant sales effort is being made by steel supports in continental Europe. The group's latest results, for the half year ended June 30, reveal a drop in turnover from Pounds 6.75m to Pounds 5.54m and a halving of the pre-tax profit to Pounds 256,000 (Pounds 505,000). Earnings per share dropped to 2.29p (4.48p) but the interim dividend is held at 1.65p.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Italy takes the offensive in battle for its currency: The government has stirred even the most somnolent back-benchers with its latest effort to streamline economic decision-making MR GIULIANO Amato, the Italian prime minister, has taken a leaf from the military text-books: when out-numbered, surprise is the best form of attack. In proposing on Wednesday that parliament approve a law delegating to the cabinet wide powers in the event of an economic emergency, Mr Amato has stirred even the most somnolent back-benchers. Yesterday, the 54-year-old Socialist prime minister had to deploy all his considerable talents to explain his intentions. The partners in the government coalition - the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals - swung behind him as parties. But individual party members voiced misgivings, while the opposition Reconstructed Communism declared the move an 'attempted coup d'etat'. Nevertheless, Mr Amato's move has placed on the table an issue which parliament can ignore only at the nation's expense. The government says existing legislative procedures are out of step with the rapid decisions necessary at a time of financial turbulence. Italy faces a foreign exchange crisis. The lira has hovered at its floor in the European Monetary System for two months and the discount rate has been raised since last week to what is seen as an unsustainable 15 per cent. This situation has been triggered by scepticism in the financial markets about the ability of any Italian government to carry out tough measures to reduce a huge debt and improve public finances, to bring the country into line with its European partners. Part of the scepticism derives from the record of successive Italian governments who have ducked unpopular measures despite promises of mending their ways. But the markets are also worried about the time it takes the government to turn policy into legislation. For instance, the law allows parliament three months to debate the annual budget, and parliamentary procedures allow amendments, which can emasculate the original proposals. Italy's coalition governments with narrow majorities (the Amato government has a 16-seat majority in the Chamber of Deputies) also mean that special interest groups can enjoy disproportionate influence. The procedures themselves are time-consuming. Debates in commission and full house are repeated in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Thus the emergency economic package designed to raise an extra L30,000bn was announced on July 10 and the government used a vote of confidence to push it through in record time, but even so, it took a month. The situation is more dramatic now. On July 10 the government announced its intention to reform pensions, public health, local administration and the civil service as the centre piece of money-saving in its 1993 budget. Mr Amato is hoping to obtain parliament's approval for delegated authority to provide the details of these reforms; but parliament still has to approve the outline reforms. Until this is done, the budget cannot be properly prepared, and this has to be presented to parliament by the end of the month. The current state of nervousness, compounded by worries over the French referendum on Maastricht, has forced the government to behave like a conjuror pulling rabbits out of a hat. This lay behind the cabinet decisions on Wednesday to try to appease the markets with a plethora of measures and intended measures. These included the selling-off of Credito Italiano, one of the top five commercial banks, and Nuovo Pignone, the heavy engineering subsidiary of ENI, the state oil concern. Equally, the absence of sufficient evidence from Italy's body politic to confront tough decisions was reflected in yesterday's performance of the lira, which again touched its floor against the D-mark in the ERM. Yesterday, Mr Amato told the Senate he was aware of their concerns that the emergency powers should not be to the detriment of parliament's sovereignty. He proposed 15 representatives of each house should form a monitoring committee in the event that the law be approved and invoked. Further, he insisted that it would be for the governor of the Bank of Italy, as an impartial observer, to decide when circumstances merited the government invoking emergency powers. But he warned that the inter-dependence of international economies meant Italy had to respond to fast-changing events with speed, otherwise 'there could be real damage affecting employment, raising prices, labour costs, inflation - effects which only can be avoided by measures which are introduced immediately'. At present, the Bank of Italy is the sole institution with such powers of quick response, but these are limited to monetary and foreign exchange intervention. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, yesterday was cautious in assuming the role of arbiter thrust upon him. Mr Ciampi, who has been outspoken in calling on politicians to endorse an effective economic policy, suggested a collegiate structure might be more appropriate to judge when the government might invoke emergency economic powers. Mr Amato's logic is hard to dispute and even if the proposal is rejected, he has succeeded in rudely reminding the politicians what is at stake. With its existing parliamentary mechanisms and internal party bickerings, Italy has few tools left to avert a sustained and worsening foreign exchange crisis. On the other hand, if the measure is approved, it will be one further nail in the coffin of the traditional exercise of party power in Italy and could encourage greater technocratic government - an example which the two months of Amato government have already set.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROCKS UNDER BRIDGES DISPLACE THE HOMELESS  </P> <P> As a result of working as a volunteer at the Friendship Shelter for the  homeless in Laguna Beach, I have become aware that miracles do happen.  </P> <P> Because residents receive temporary housing, food, job training skills,  counseling, money management, genuine caring, many residents graduate into the  mainstream of society to jobs, and to their own apartment or room. One recent  graduate had been on the streets for 11 years.  </P> <P> They bank their job earnings to acquire first and last months' rent. The  director, the Rev. Colin Henderson, does a masterful job of enforcing strict  house rules, at the same time helping each resident with his needs.  </P> <P> HAZEL LAFLER  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL HEALTH SECRETARY LOUIS SULLIVAN  </P> <P> I have just read the interview with Sullivan for the third time.  </P> <P> I was unable to believe what I was reading in his responses to the questions.  </P> <P> Seat belts and no smoking. What a fantastic leadership position. Also, no salt.  Also many small businesses would sink with the oppressive need to cover their  employees with some insurance for health. Oh, I am in pain.  </P> <P> National health insurance is offered worldwide in industrial nations, but not  here. Why not? The federal government does certain things well; others that it  doesn't . . . that we have fundamentally a system that has been very  successful.  </P> <P> Go tell that to the people that have to rely on the county and federal  deliverance systems. They are in full failure.  </P> <P> I've written to Dr. Sullivan. So what. I've now written The Times -- so what?  </P> <P> I am at my wit's end to comprehend how far we have fallen as a nation of real  compassion.  </P> <P> Here's to Dr. Sullivan's charity hospitals. Woe is me.  </P> <P> LORETTA CHILJIAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

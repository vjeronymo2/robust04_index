			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T to take Dollars 400m stake in McCaw AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph is to buy 14.5m shares in McCaw Cellular Communications as part of a previous agreement that will ultimately give AT&amp;T one-third of McCaw's shares, AP-DJ reports from New York. AT&amp;T will buy the newly-issued Class A shares of McCaw for Dollars 27.625 each, for a total of about Dollars 400m. The purchase provides an up-front cash infusion for debt-heavy McCaw. The investment is being made under a previous commitment exercisable by McCaw while the two companies work toward a definitive agreement for AT&amp;T's stake in McCaw. Yesterday's purchase also gives AT&amp;T the right to name one director on McCaw's board. The purchase is separate from the broad strategic alliance the two companies announced last November. At the time, AT&amp;T said it would buy a total of 47.6m shares at an average price of Dollars 42 a share, for a total of about Dollars 2bn. AT&amp;T also plans to purchase British Telecom's stake in McCaw for about Dollars 1.8bn, bringing its total investment in McCaw to Dollars 3.8bn for the one-third stake. AT&amp;T and McCaw said the larger transaction was still being negotiated, and there were no assurances that a final agreement will be reached. Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks group, and Coca-Cola Enterprises have begun talks on opportunities for the latter to become a bottler in international markets. Coca-Cola Enterprises distributes about 53 per cent of Coca-Cola's US bottle and can volume and is 44 per cent owned by Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola was not immediately available for comment. Coca-Cola Enterprises, which handles the domestic bottling market, said that it was excited at the growth potential in the international market-place. Coca-Cola Enterprises said the chairman, Mr Donald Keough, would retire on April 20, one day after the company's annual meeting. Mr M. Douglas Ivester, senior vice-president of Coca-Cola, has been nominated for election through the proxy process to Coca-Cola Enterprises' board.</p>

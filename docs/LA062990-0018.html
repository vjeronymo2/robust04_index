			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOME HELP AT HOME  </P> <P> In the streets of Iran, where once there were thousands of Iranian citizens  chanting slogans such as "America Is the Great Satan" and "Death to America,"  we now find thousands of them suddenly homeless, hungry and dying in the  streets.  </P> <P> We Americans are asked to put our political differences aside and view this  situation strictly as a humanitarian issue.  </P> <P> I find it difficult to believe that the dispensing of funds and medical  supplies to Iran could possibly be viewed as anything less than a political  act.  </P> <P> However, I do believe there is a significant humanitarian issue here that  should be raised. If there are funds and medical supplies available to be used  for humanitarian aide, then it should first be used to help the thousands of  those who are homeless, hungry and dying in the streets of America.  </P> <P> JOHN WOODS  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

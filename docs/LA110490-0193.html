			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RICHMOND;  </P> <P> JUDGE INVESTIGATED FOR DATING WITNESS  </P> <P> A Municipal Court judge is under investigation after admitting she secretly  dated a police officer, whom she later married, while he was a key prosecution  witness in a drug case she handled.  </P> <P> The Commission on Judicial Performance is investigating Judge Irene Takahashi,  said Municipal Judge Julie Conger, who is now handling the drug case. Takahashi  said she did not reveal her affair with El Cerrito Officer Michael Ramirez as  she should have before an October, 1989, preliminary hearing. Takahashi said  her failure to disclose the relationship deprived two defendants of their  constitutional right to a fair and impartial hearing.  </P></p>

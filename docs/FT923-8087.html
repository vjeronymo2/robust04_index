			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: Trade set to inch up US political agenda INTERNATIONAL trade, above all Nafta, is an issue which has never quite taken off in this year's long primary and presidential campaigns. Yesterday's signing of the agreement threatens to change that, for the moment at least. President George Bush will be able to proclaim Nafta as another example of his international statesmanship, conveniently obscuring the fact that his administration has been unable to bring to pass a successful conclusion of the broader Uruguay round of trade negotiations. Coming on top of recent summits with the Russian and Israeli leaders and with Middle East peace talks about to resume here, the image of a president on top of foreign affairs can be presented to offset the lack of solutions to what is happening in the Balkans and with Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Yet the biggest plus for Mr Bush may be in the extent to which Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic opponent for the presidency, is caught on a political hook on which he can only wriggle. Yesterday Mr Clinton issued statements almost identical to his last pronouncement on Nafta two weeks ago. He reserved judgment on the treaty itself, pending study of its details and whatever emerges from Congressional hearings. But he repeated that he would support it 'so long as it provides adequate protection for workers, farmers and the environment on both sides of the border.' He added that 'we must have strong transition strategies that ensure workers benefit from a more open world trading system.' Mr Clinton has been trying to reduce the Democratic Party's dependence on those of its constituent parts, such as organised labour, which have long been associated with outright protectionism. To this end, he began his quest for the White House by supporting the Nafta goals and the 'fast track' approach to it, whereby Congress can only vote on the agreement, not amend it. The failure of Mr Clinton's Democratic opponents, and of Mr Patrick Buchanan on the Republican side and Ross Perot, the defunct independent, proved protectionism had only limited political appeal in the primaries. But as the Nafta negotiations have moved to a climax, opposition to it, concentrated in the Democratic Party, has become more focused and vocal. In particular it has brought back to the fore Congressman Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who ran for the Democratic nomination four years ago on a blatantly protectionist platform. Some of Mr Gephardt's criticisms of Nafta have reportedly been run past Mr Clinton. Mr Clinton still felt free two weeks ago to condemn 'the outdated rhetoric of both the free traders who are oblivious to workers and the environment and the protectionists who ignore the benefits of expanded world trade.' He associated Mr Gephardt with the same sentiments. This is a fine line to walk and further qualification of his earlier stand invites not only Republican attack. In a recent editorial entitled 'a test of Mr Clinton's backbone,' the New York Times wrote that he 'will have to choose between the protectionist policies of old and his own campaign promises.' In theory Mr Clinton can wait, since Congress will not vote on Nafta until next year. He may try to confine himself to promising to change what he does not like if he becomes president. His opposition and the media are unlikely to allow him that luxury.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: Group to pay premium for SME stake The Italo-Swiss consortium that won the contest to buy the Italian state's controlling stake in SME, the supermarket and restaurant group, will pay a premium of more than 20 per cent for the shares. Iri, the state holding company which controls SME, revealed on Friday that the consortium had offered L4,847.4 for each SME share, against a market price of just under L4,000. That values the whole company - which now owns only the GS supermarkets and Autogrill restaurants business - at L2,200bn (Dollars 1.4bn). The consortium is led by Edizione Holding, the Benetton family's holding company, allied with Mr Leonardo Del Vecchio, who heads the Luxottica spectacles group, Movenpick, the Swiss hotel and restaurant group, and Crediop, the investment finance subsidiary of the San Paolo di Torino banking group. The consortium, which must keep GS and Autogrill together for five years, will buy 32 per cent of SME from Iri then launch a public offer for a further 32 per cent. Some of Iri's residual stake will be sold to the consortium and the rest to ordinary investors.</p>

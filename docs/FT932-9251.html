			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Classic deal from a formidable competitor - The move fits the mould of GE Capital snapping up assets from distressed sellers BAILING out GPA Group is a classic deal for GE Capital. It underscores why the financial services arm of General Electric of the US has become such a formidable competitor at home and is rapidly becoming one in international markets. Its record of strong profits growth over the past decade and its powerful capital base have allowed it to snap up assets from distressed sellers at favourable prices during the waves of recession hitting sub-sectors of the US financial services industry. The GPA deal fits this mould. Provided several potential stumbling blocks can be surmounted, it will allow GE Capital to buy 43 aircraft from GPA for Dollars 1.35bn (Pounds 870m) with an option to acquire between 60 and 80 per cent of GPA's equity over the next four years at an undisclosed price. GE Capital stressed yesterday that the aircraft were all less than three years old, met modern Stage III noise standards and would only be acquired with leases in place. While many crucial aspects of the deal remained under wraps, GE Capital's track record in striking hard bargains suggests that it will prove financially good for the company, as well as having important strategic benefits. The US company is the main financial services arm of General Electric, which has interests ranging from aircraft engine manufacturing to the NBC television network. GE Capital, together with two other GE financial services companies - Employers' Reinsurance and Kidder, Peabody, the brokerage house - form GE Capital Services with Dollars 155bn of assets. GE Capital on its own, which comprises 23 niche businesses such as ship container leasing and car purchase financing, has assets of Dollars 93bn, making it one of the largest non-bank finance groups in the US. Originally set up to provide credit to buyers of GE-made equipment, it grew rapidly in the 1980s into areas traditionally dominated by commercial banks, helped by a looser regulatory framework than the banks and the ability to piggy back on its parent's strong credit rating. Some other industrial companies followed a similar route, but several of them, such as Westinghouse, were badly stung by financial services - particularly commercial property - and have now withdrawn from the field or sharply scaled down their operations. GE Capital has prospered thanks to its strong management, focus on market niches, extremely efficient credit controls, and a cautious approach to the 1980s commercial property boom. The diversity of its businesses has also helped smooth out problems in individual markets. Aircraft leasing, for example, accounts for less than 8 per cent of its assets, even after the GPA deal. The agreement will, however, substantially increase the size of GE Capital's already big aircraft leasing operations, mainly run under its Polaris leasing company, with a fleet of nearly 500 aircraft. Some 80 per cent of the existing fleet meets the stringent Stage III noise regulations and GE Capital says some 95 per cent of the fleet is currently being utilised. If GE eventually acquired majority control of GPA it would create the largest aircraft leasing company in the world, well ahead of California-based ILFC, a subsidiary of the AIG insurance group. As GPA's plight indicates, aircraft leasing has been an extremely tough business during the airline recession of the past two years - though GE Capital claims to have enjoyed 'very positive, favourable results.' The US airline business, which accounts for most Polaris leases, is beginning to show signs of a cyclical upturn, and GE is banking on the global industry eventually following suit. The GPA aircraft being acquired by GE Capital are leased to international, rather than US carriers, and will give a big boost to the US company's global presence. Building up an international business is one of the group's most important strategic thrusts. It entered Europe at the start of this decade by buying up the finance operations of UK stores chains Burton and House of Fraser and has followed this with a series of acquisitions in both continental countries and the UK, including the Pounds 71m current agreed bid for TIP Europe, the British-based trailer rental company. It is also beginning to establish a presence in Asia, having agreed over the past year to make investments in various financial services operations in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>

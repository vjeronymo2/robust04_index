			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Walt Disney expands in video games Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday joined other film studios diversifying into video and computer games by launching an interactive entertainment division. Mr Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive, announced the creation of the division, which will co-ordinate Disney's activities in the games and educational software markets at its headquarters in Burbank, California. Disney has in the past licensed the rights to develop video games from its cartoon and film characters to other companies. However, it recently devised the successful Aladdin and The Lion King games in conjunction with Virgin Interactive Entertainment, part of the Viacom group. Last month it launched two CD-ROM products: the Aladdin Activity Center and Disney's Animated StoryBook. The group is now expanding its Disney Software subsidiary into an interactive division to accelerate its move into games and educational software.</p>

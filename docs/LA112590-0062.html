			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> A QUICK WAY TO NUKE WORLD CONSENSUS;  </P> <P> IF IRAQ'S ATOMIC CAPABILITY IS HELD OUT AS A PRETEXT FOR WAR, WHAT ABOUT  ISRAEL'S?  </P> <P> In any prospective plunge towards war in the gulf, President Bush has been  inhibited by two factors: the lack of any U.N. mandate for the use of force  beyond the sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the firm stance of  domestic opinion in the United States, which is strongly opposed to any  escalation.  </P> <P> In their recent international tours, Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker  have been striving to rally support for a new U.N. Security Council resolution  permitting military action to evict Iraq from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Bush and Baker can claim some success in their efforts. For some of the  desperately poor African nations serving their tours in the 15-member council,  straightforward bribery seems to have sufficed. This, too, may have been a  factor in the minds of the Soviet leaders looking for aid in the grim winter  ahead. Both Mikhail Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze,  offered language suggesting that they might go along with a new Security  Council resolution. In Cairo last Friday, President Hosni Mubarak seemed to  soften his previously clear insistence that Egyptian troops could not be used  for any purpose beyond defense of Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> There is less to boast about when it comes to major capitalist powers. German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl insists that his government is opposed to the use of  force. Japan, terrified of another bout of Japan-bashing, is saying as little  as possible, but remains clearly opposed to force. (The French are, as usual,  talking out of both sides of their mouth.)  </P> <P> A new Security Council resolution on the use of force against Iraq could come  to a vote this week. Its language, clotted with cautionary subordinate clauses,  hedged with sibylline provisos, could still allow Bush to boast that he has the  mandate he desires. Such claims should be regarded with caution, since in the  resolutions already passed by the Security Council in this crisis there has  been a considerable gap between the texts and the construction placed on them  by the U.S. government.  </P> <P> But simultaneously there has been the hunt for domestic consensus, and here  Bush has faced an entirely different problem. Unlike his predecessors in the  White House since the end of World War II, he has not been able to invoke the  Red Menace as pretext for military action. Since it is impossible to cite the  real reasons for armed intervention -- control of oil, supervision of "world  order" by force or the threat of force -- Bush has fallen dismally short in  offering the nation a persuasive rationale for going to war.  </P> <P> There are signs that the White House may now be seizing a path of opportunity  out of its difficulties. It is one fraught with peril.  </P> <P> In polls displaying Americans' opposition to war, the only point on which they  seem as strong as Bush against Iraq is that a nuclear arsenal under the control  of Saddam Hussein is a matter of legitimate concern, even to the point of  intervention. Bush may be seeking to make this his pivot for the consensus that  every politician and editorialist is urging him to find.  </P> <P> But if Iraq's presumptive nuclear arsenal is the animating factor in any march  to war, then Kuwait becomes irrelevant. Saddam Hussein could order his troops  out tomorrow and the situation would not change, except that any international  consensus would immediately dissolve.  </P> <P> Not merely the Arab nations would remind Bush of the following: As recently as  April, Saddam Hussein called for the removal from the Middle East of all  weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological and nuclear -- only to have  his call dismissed by Washington and Tel Aviv. Iraq was one of the earliest  signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and under that treaty's  provisions has accepted inspections of nuclear facilities that might be of  military significance. It recently invited another such inspection.  </P> <P> These inspections are not conclusive, and suspicions were aroused by the  interception at London's Heathrow Airport of equipment bound for Iraq that may  have been destined for use as nuclear "triggers." But the answer is plainly  more rigorous inspection under the terms of the non-proliferation treaty.  </P> <P> Similarly shattering to any international consensus, particularly in the Arab  world, would be the fact that an unquestioned nuclear power in the region is  Israel, which has always refused to sign the treaty.  </P> <P> Weighing against both of these White House strategies -- the Security Council  route and the manipulation of domestic opinion -- there remains the sensible  present policy of sanctions, on which there is genuine consensus and which over  the months will take their proper toll.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Shandar, correspondent: "Superfluous </F> Plant-Breeders?"]    [Text] Because they failed to pay their electric bills on  time the production sections of the Plant-Breeding and Genetic  Institute had their power shut off by the Odessa Electric-Power  Company. Unstable financing had driven the creators of new  strains and hybrids of agricultural crops into an impasse. The  production requirements are scarcely half-met, and the earnings  of the institute's staffers are extremely low.    This situation could be rectified somewhat if various  agricultural enterprises were to pay back to the institute the  approximately 2 billion krb [karbovantsy] owed in debts, and if  the institute managed to sell some 4,000 choice varieties of  seeds for spring crops. Such seeds, which used to be snapped up  instantly, are now lying idle because the state has no money  with which to buy them.    The scientists, who have been brought to a halt by the  above-mentioned lack of funds, have been forced to gather up  their own research and plant-breeding work and seek out ways to  exist within commercial structures, as well as in other states.  Over the course of the last few months close to 40 scientific  and technical staffers have left the institute. Doctor of  Agricultural Sciences V.D. Navolotskyy has also submitted his  resignation. He is a prominent plant-breeder, whose varieties of  barley are being grown on an area of approximately 5 million  hectares in our country and abroad. Veniamin Dmytrovych will be  working in Russia, where he will be paid several times what he  used to make here in Ukraine....</p>

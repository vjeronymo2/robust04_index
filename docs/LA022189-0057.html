			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OFF-DUTY DEPUTY SHOT IN FIGHT WITH SUSPECT  </P> <P> An off-duty sheriff's deputy was shot in the hand during a struggle with a  suspected auto thief who police said tried to grab the deputy's pistol early  Monday outside a Woodland Hills condominium complex.  </P> <P> Kevin Russell, 32, a five-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department, was on his  way to work about 5 a.m. when he saw two men jump over a security fence in the  22100 block of Burbank Boulevard, said Los Angeles Police Det. Phil Quartararo.  The men, who were carrying flashlights, tried the door handles of a Porsche and  a Cadillac limousine in the parking lot of the condominium complex, Quartararo  said.  </P> <P> Russell identified himself as a sheriff's officer and ordered the men to stop,  Quartararo said.  </P> <P> The men ran. Russell chased one of them and cornered him in the courtyard of  the complex near the pool, the detective said.  </P> <P> Russell and the man struggled over the officer's gun, which went off and  injured two of Russell's fingers on his left hand, Quartararo said.  </P> <P> Russell, with the aid of two condominium complex residents, held the man until  police came, Quartararo said.  </P> <P> Police arrested Bryan Albert Bernard, 20 of Panorama City on suspicion of  assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer. He was being held in West  Valley police station in lieu of $15,000 bail.  </P> <P> Russell underwent surgery, which saved both fingers, Monday morning at  Northridge Hospital Medical Center. He was in good condition, according to  hospital spokeswoman Leslie Wither.  </P></p>

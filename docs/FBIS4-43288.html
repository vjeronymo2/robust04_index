			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Turkey's troubled balance of payments  position worsened in the first quarter of the current year as  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller continues to promise to produce a  balanced account by the end of the year as part of her economic  recovery program.    The current account deficit soared from $925 million in the  first quarter of 1993 to $1.135 billion in the corresponding  period of this year, an increase of 22 percent, official figures  revealed on Thursday [9 June].    The Central Bank said that the current account deficit  widened despite a smaller foreign trade gap. It said Turkey's  foreign trade deficit in the January-March period dropped from  $2.207 billion last year to $1.814 billion this year, a decline  of 17.8 percent.    Net unrequited official transfers declined from $183 million  to $89 million. Direct foreign investment went down from $94  million last year to $51 million this year, a fall of 45.7  percent.    Turkey's foreign debt repayment amounted to $1.940 billion  in  the first quarter of this year, compared with $1.736 billion  twelve months ago.</p>

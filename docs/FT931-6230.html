			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Names in action to recover losses MORE THAN 2,000 Lloyd's Names are to issue writs against their agents today, kicking off one of the largest actions in English legal history in terms of the number of individual plaintiffs and defendants. The 2,145 Names - individuals whose assets support the Lloyd's market - are seeking to recover Pounds 396m in insurance losses. The Names were members of Gooda Walker syndicates 164, 290, 298 and 298, which specialised in 'spiral' reinsurance, in which syndicates and London market companies reinsure each other's exposure to high-level catastrophe loss. Advised by Wilde Sapte, they are suing 67 members' agents who placed them on the syndicates. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, which is organising the action, said the average loss by each Name is Pounds 184,877. But he added: 'Some individual members have lost up to Pounds 1m. Some of these were underwriting at Lloyd's on the basis of a bank guarantee secured on their family home and had no other substantial assets.' Mr Deeny, an accountant and rock music promoter, said that many of the Names involved are old-age pensioners who 'now face total ruin'. The action group has raised more than Pounds 4m from its Names to fight the action, which could begin in commercial court next year. A final result may take many years, however. The main action is focused on allegations of negligent underwriting, but litigation on other issues and against other parties is being considered and further proceedings may be issued shortly. Mr Deeny said that the official Lloyd's loss review report into the Gooda Walker syndicates revealed a 'picture of almost incredible incompetence'. He described the 'spiral' as a 'financial timebomb which has brought disaster to Names on the Gooda Walker syndicates'.</p>

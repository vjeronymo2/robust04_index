			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Chelnokov: "Armed Opposition Abandons </F> Underground"]    [Text] The political amnesty announced recently has  essentially absolved the sins of the participants in the events  of last fall. But those who built the barricades in central  Moscow, fired shots from Kalashnikovs, and broke into the  "Ostankino" television center have not been consigned to the  archives together with the prosecutor's files. And probably far  from all of them have acknowledged their guilt, still less come  to terms with defeat.    Some "defenders of the Constitution" were released from  prison, others emerged from underground where they had spent  nearly six months hiding from the law enforcement organs. I  wondered: Who are these people and what do they want now?    The amnesty has so emboldened some of them that they agreed  to meet with the correspondent of the "ideologically alien"  IZVESTIYA.    Colonel Aleksandr M. set as the main condition for our talk  that his identity be kept anonymous. That, he gave me to  understand over the telephone, was the directive "from above."  Of himself he said only that he had graduated from the Lvov  military-political school and taught at the Lenin  military-political academy. He was coordinator of the "Officers  Union" for the Moscow military district. He is easily  recognized on a videotape made during last year's May Day  demonstration by the opposition forces. In the White House he  commanded a large subunit of "volunteers" who hid in a  settlement near Moscow until recently.    They had prepared for my arrival. In the apartment where I  was taken by a sturdily built boy called Gleb, several  "defenders of the White House" were waiting and there was a pile  of video cassettes on the table. "The official press is lying  when it says we were the first to shoot at `Ostankino,'" a  colonel dressed in camouflage with the merit badges of the  airborne troops began the talk.    "Why did you go to take `Ostankino' at all?" I asked. "This  was an action you knew to be futile: Even after purging the  television center of `Vityaz' you would hardly have been able to  broadcast."    "You cannot imagine the euphoria which possessed thousands  of  people at the time. For me it was the happiest moment of my  life," one of the underground members replied.    The frames of the video report dispassionately recorded the  prelude to the bloody tragedy. The deputies, emerging from the  dark White House smelling of faeces (the lighting and sewerage  system had been turned off for many days) called for history to  be made. "Russia is with you!" they roared into the  microphones. "Yeltsin's criminal regime is expiring. We shall  see it into its grave!" And the crowd went to its slaughter.    The road was opened, a green light from Krasnopresnenskaya  embankment to Ostankino. The armored personnel carriers  followed a parallel course, with blue eyes smiling from under  the tank drivers' hard hats and fingers making the "V" sign:  "Vivat!"    Those taking part in the meeting demanded that "tele-vision"  be brought to book and a truck rammed the door. People with  assault rifles tried to repel the angry crowd from the building.  A man in a camouflage jacket sat down not far from the  entrance, with a grenade thrower ready.   <H5>    Man with the Grenade Thrower </H5>   I recognized this man. He miraculously survived that  carnage. A grenade blast threw him onto a concrete flower tub.  It may be considered that he got off lightly: He had bruising  and a grenade fragment wound to his hand. I met with him when  he had been discharged from hospital.    Radio engineer Nikolay Abramenkov remembers better than  anyone the absurdity of the "Ostankino" forced march. And he  even tried to persuade General Makashov of this but "obeying the  oath" he had taken outside the White House he went to the  television center as part of the "Sever" special group. Here  they were already breaking the glass windows through which could  be seen reflected the special militia members armed to the teeth  and the fighters of the "Vityaz" special subunit.    And when the general, having set off for talks with the  "other side," asked for "cover," Abramenkov unthinkingly picked  up the grenade thrower. And it was not important that the  30-year-old reserve officer did not know how to use the weapon  -- "the main thing was to intimidate the special militia." He  did not hear the radio conversations under way meanwhile among  the "Vityaz" officers: "Do you see that grenade thrower?  "Where, where?" "At the entrance. We must take him out." A  single shot rang out and in a few minutes loops of tracer  bullets were tearing through the crowd....    In 1987 Abramenkov graduated from the Moscow  radioelectronics  institute. He worked at a mailbox [secret defense industry  enterprise] and "rose" to the post of senior engineer. At the  same time he matured in the social field: First he was a  communist youth league organization secretary and then headed a  party committee. In 1990, when "the project was closed because  of conversion," he was obliged to engage in the production of  "radio consumer goods" at a firm in the capital.    On 22 September, the day his son was born, he returned to  Moscow from Smolensk. And learning of Yeltsin's edict no. 1400,  he immediately went to the White House. He saw his son only a  month later. "Why did I go there? To ensure they finally  stopped selling the country. I saw plants standing idle in  Smolensk while all around dealers were growing rich through  speculation. It was time to put an end to the anarchy."    "But protesting against `anarchy' is one thing, taking an  assault rifle and grenade thrower in your hand is quite another.  Did you realize you would have to shoot people?"    "For the first two days I was on the barricades at the White  House. Then I joined the `Sever' group. When virtually the  entire guard left Rutskoy, we were asked to help him. We were  issued weapons 30 September and the group was subordinate only  to Rutskoy and General Makashov."    A special airborne forces officer to whom I showed the  photograph of Abramenkov with the grenade thrower was taken  aback: "We do not even use grenades of this type. We have the  latest model."    "Where did you get the grenade thrower and ammunition?"    "It was taken from outside the city hall building. There was  also a spray gun lying around there, which was picked up before  the city hall was seized by Barkashov's supporters, who probably  thought it was a weapon. And a man aged about 40 dressed in a  militia uniform brought two grenades and handed them over. It  looks as though it was all specially set up to provoke us but it  was only later I guessed that.  <H5>  Number After One, Two! </H5>   The "Sever" group consisted of 12 men. Abramenkov would seem  to be lying when he says that he joined it directly from the  barricades. They took only tested people because, as became  known from a reliable source, "Sever" was formed back in March  1993 and not without the participation of "Nashi" member  journalist Nevzorov. The group carried out the most dangerous  tasks and that is why the losses were so great: Two members  were killed and several seriously wounded. Some members had  fought in the trouble spots of the former Union.    Those who came to the White House spontaneously and at the  bidding of their hearts joined the "first Moscow volunteer  regiment named for the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet." The  regiment included a cossack battalion, two battalions of  volunteer forces, and a subunit of the "Officers Union" -- in  all about 1,000 men aged 18 to 60.    The gunmen of the Russian National Unity under the command  of  Barkashov himself were in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet  armed forces under the fourth motorized rifle battalion. Like  the first Moscow special cossack squadron and the  above-mentioned "Sever" group, they were directly subordinate to  the directives of "defense minister" by invitation Achalov.    Yesaul [cossack captain] Vladimir Kurochkin, the owner of  the apartment in which my meeting with the underground defenders  of the White House took place, was deputy ataman of a cossack  squadron. This subunit numbered slightly over 100 men, mainly  from Siberia, the Urals, and South Russia.    The passport of a USSR citizen was grounds for receiving an  assault rifle. As was an application to the congress of  people's deputies and Supreme Soviet asking to be considered a  Russian patriot. Those who signed it swore an oath of loyalty  to the "only legitimate" organs of power of the state and were  considered servicemen.    In the long hours of deathly quiet the armed opposition  marched along the asphalt paths and stood watch. It can be seen  on the video recording how the opposition wallowed in the floods  of misinformation coming from the White House balcony. The  "defenders of the Constitution" did not know that the "reliable  report" on the spontaneous transfer of yet another division to  their side had been prepared by a few deputies "to strengthen  their fighting morale."    The special militia members looking out of the armored  personnel carriers were taunting them: "What's the matter with  you, boys, we are with you." Barkashov's supporters were  already whispering of storming the Kremlin. The airborne forces  were meekly eating sandwiches made by women who were Communist  Youth League members in the thirties. Engineers in camouflage  were sticking ballpoint pens into the muzzles of the militia's  assault rifles. Hurrah, our boys are coming, they shouted,  seeing the approach of yet another convoy of armored vehicles  which after a few hours would tear the crowd to shreds with  large-caliber machineguns.    There was a set expression of perplexity on the faces of the  dead: "How stupid, we were only a step from victory...." The  survivors were cut down by salvos from the "stinking special  militia who have betrayed Russia."    The rebels left the barricade not as a crowd but in  detachments of insurgents who had sworn loyalty to a power which  no longer existed.    Actually, I was told by Yesaul Kurochkin, they had not come  to the White House to defend Khasbulatov or Rutskoy personally  but rather to oppose "Yeltsin's criminal regime."  <H5>  "Third Force" </H5>   "What was it you so disliked about `Yeltsin's regime?'" I  asked my interlocutors. "At least there are no wars in Russia,  there is food in the stores, and no one is yet dying of hunger.  And look what is being down on the outskirts of the former  Union...."    "For a long time now the country has been controlled not by  Yeltsin's clique," Colonel M. a former political worker, sought  to enlighten me, "but by a third force. It is no accident that  during his trip to Russia Nixon met with members of the  opposition. The third force is now seeking someone on whom to  gamble after the fall of the existing regime."    "Do you consider this `fall' to be inevitable?"    "Having issued his edict on the dissolution of parliament,  Yeltsin put himself outside the law. And time is now working in  our favor."    "But what about the political amnesty and the memorandum on  accord?"    "The amnesty was issued for those accomplices of the  criminal  regime who are up to their elbows in blood. They were thus  given the chance to go voluntarily. Otherwise civil war was  inevitable. In my view the idea of concluding the memorandum on  accord between the executioners and the victims is stillborn.  The opposition will conclude it only after Yeltsin's voluntary  resignation. All these Yeltsins, Kaufmans, and Rozenfelds who  have found a cosy spot at the top taking cover under Russian  surnames must go and the sooner the better for them."    The colonel's intentions are serious and as far as I know he  is by no means alone in his thoughts and intentions. Somewhere  deep underground a staff of armed forces named for the abolished  Supreme Soviet is operating. Aleksandr M.'s deputies are almost  constantly on the move "establishing contacts with fellow  thinkers in the provinces."  <H5>  Opposition's Weapon </H5>   The losses of manpower during the October events were not as  great as the opposition members are inclined to think. Colonel  M., who had seven battalions under his command 3 October, for  instance, could recall less than 10 men killed from his subunits.    But the opposition is losing its fighters in peace time.  Last winter Russian National Unity activists Denisov and Kostin  were arrested, as was "Sever" group commander Fridlender.    From Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs  operational reports:    1. Aleksandr Kostin. Born 1961 in Voronezh Oblast. Was  resident in Anninskiy Rayon, in Arkhangelskaya village, has  previous convictions, is regarded a particularly dangerous  recidivist. Arrested in Voronezh for mugging a taxi driver in  Voronezh.    2. Aleksandr Denisov, from Buryat Autonomous Soviet  Socialist Republic. Sentenced in Rostov-na-Donu in 1992 for the  illegal possession of a weapon to corrective labor, from which  he escaped. Has worked in militia organs in Estonia. Arrested  in Tallinn in early 1994.    3. Sergey Fridlender, born 1967, from Lithuania. Was  resident in Kobrin City, in Brest Oblast. Went to St.  Petersburg in 1988. Since May 1992 has worked in the fifth  detachment of the Russian Federation Finance Ministry  paramilitary guard. Arrested 29 December 1993 in Kobrin on  suspicion of the murder of two people.    According to available information the murders were  committed  with an assault rifle taken from the White House arsenal. In  all the Supreme Soviet was assigned about 2,000 guns. To this  day over 400 of them, mainly Kalashnikov assault rifles, have  not been found. After Barkashov's supporters had seized the  city hall building, 146 official-issue pistols and assault  rifles were taken away. Only slightly more than 10 were  returned. I am reliably informed that on the evening of 3  October the more farsighted "White House defenders" used every  available means to take away dozens of guns from the "last  bastion of democracy." It is not hard to guess that these  weapons of the opposition will be fired many times yet.    But my meeting with the underground members continued. On  the video recording four boys are carrying the body of a young  woman to somewhere to one side of the White House. She is  stripped naked and her mane of dark hair is trailing on the  ground.    Meanwhile Colonel M. told me:    "We broke out of the White House on the night of 4 October.  Broke out is the word, because we could not surrender alive.  There were about 200 of us and we left through the central  exist onto Krasnopresnensakaya embankment and were about to move  to the right, toward the international trade center, when  suddenly we came under sniper fire. Then we moved rapidly  toward the city hall. We broke through three cordons calmly,  without a single shot. The special militia pretended not to  notice us. We ran across some waste land, crossed a  construction site, and then divided into groups of 10-15 and  went in various directions. We walked through the city, dirty  and unkempt -- it was immediately obvious where we had come from  but no one tried to stop us. That stinking special militia  seized those who had no weapons, not those that were needed.  All those who had to got away.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MARAD Response: With respect to the export program, MARAD has determined that the requirements in the third sentence of paragraph (a)(2)(i) and the provisions of sections 298.32(a)(6) and 298.32(b)(5)(ii), relating to foreign equipment and materials, should be amended. These provisions were inadvertently left unamended in the regulations in 1986. With one important exception, foreign components will no longer be excluded from the Actual Cost of a Vessel. The exception is that foreign components of the hull and superstructure of any Vessel, including an Eligible Export Vessel, are excluded from Actual Cost; this will ensure that significant Vessel construction and reconstruction that is financed by the United States will be performed by U.S. yards. MARAD will still need to be apprised of the use of foreign components and will not exclude them from Actual Cost, recognizing that many components are not available in the U.S. market or are not available in a cost or delivery competitive basis. MARAD will allow the value of such foreign components in the hull and superstructure to be used as owner-furnished equipment in meeting the equity requirements of section 298.13(a)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD declines to adopt the proposal that it not require applicants to submit supporting data, such as labor costs and worker hours, regarding a construction contract where the contract is competitively bid. Generally, shipyards must prepare backup data to assure against doing business at a loss. Hence, in virtually all circumstances, the supporting data are already available, which are all that MARAD is reviewing. Further, as guarantor, MARAD needs to make an independent determination that the costs reflected in the Obligations are fair and reasonable, and has a statutory responsibility to ensure that it is guaranteeing no more than the statutory limit of allowable costs. A competitively-bid contract may reduce the likelihood of MARAD's guaranteeing inflated contract prices, but MARAD does not regard that procedure as an adequate safeguard. Without conducting its own analysis of the cost of the project, MARAD would not be able to determine whether (1) it was impermissibly guaranteeing ``soft costs''; (2) subsequent changes and extras were fair and reasonable; or (3) the contract price exceeded the fair and reasonable cost of the Vessel, despite the competitive bidding process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the comment that paragraph (a)(3) should be harmonized with paragraph (g) with respect to the treatment of subordinated debt as equity, MARAD believes that the rule could be improved with the addition of language cross-referencing the two provisions. Accordingly, it has added directly after the word ``debt,'' in the penultimate sentence of paragraph (a)(3), a reference to the discretion of the Secretary, provided in paragraph (g) of this section, to allow subordinated debt as equity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Peru's austerity plan at risk as minister quits: Economic management thrown  into chaos by President Fujimori PERU'S economic management was thrown into turmoil yesterday with the resignation of Mr Carlos Bolona as finance minister and President Alberto Fujimori's dismissal of the central bank's governing board. However, Mr Jorge Chavez, governor of the central bank, said he would not submit to the president's orders. 'It is my duty to defend the autonomy of the central bank. Mr Fujimori will have to remove me by force.' At the Finance Ministry, Mr Bolona's aides said he had presented his 'irrevocable' letter of resignation to the president but that Mr Fujimori had not accepted it. Mr Bolona was not available for comment. He is the second member of the cabinet to resign since Mr Fujimori seized dictatorial powers two weeks ago. Mr Alfonso de los Heros resigned as prime minister on the night Mr Fujimori closed down Congress and the judiciary and installed a military-backed 'emergency government'. Mr Bolona's decision to quit follows a fruitless trip to Washington last week in which he failed to convince the US Treasury, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank to resume economic aid to Peru. He was told there would be no help forthcoming until Mr Fujimori restored democracy. Creditor nations and the IADB have frozen more than Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 840m) of debt relief and development grants in condemnation of Mr Fujimori's palace coup. Peru now faces a balance of payments crisis, as it needed foreign aid to clear its debt arrears with the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral agencies. Mr Bolona's resignation may also signal that Mr Fujimori is preparing to abandon an IMF-inspired austerity programme that had placed the government's finances in order and curbed inflation from a monthly 60 per cent two years ago to about 5 per cent now. Mr Fujimori is under pressure to raise military expenditure and adopt more populist economic measures to retain the loyalty of the armed forces and the majority of poverty-stricken Peruvians who supported the coup. Mr Fujimori last week pledged more than Dollars 20m to improve Lima's sprawling shanty towns and promised industry a Dollars 200m credit line to help jump-start the economy. The armed forces on Monday reaffirmed their support for Mr Fujimori in an effort to stifle a bid by the disbanded Congress to set up a rival government. Congress yesterday swore in Mr Maximo San Roman, the former vice-president, as the head of Peru's 'constitutional government'. This leaves Peru with three men claiming the presidency - Mr Fujimori, Mr San Roman and Mr Abimael Guzman, leader of the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas, who is known as 'President Gonzalo'. Mr San Roman's investiture will pose a diplomatic problem for a delegation of the Organisation of American States now visiting Lima. The OAS is on a peace mission to try to reconcile Mr Fujimori and the disbanded Congress. It will also attempt to persuade Mr Fujimori to adopt a rapid timetable for the restoration of democracy. In an attempt to mollify international opinion, Mr Fujimori has announced that municipal elections will go ahead as planned in November. He has also called for a national dialogue, to begin on May 1. Congressmen have already rejected his proposal, saying they will recognise only Mr San Roman as the constitutional president of Peru.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 60m Canadian rail tunnel MOTT MACDONALD, based in Croydon, has been appointed by Canadian National Railways to design the new St Clair River rail tunnel between Canada and the US in conjunction with HATCH ASSOCIATES of Toronto. Requiring an unusually large diameter of 9.5 metres to accommodate double stack container freight, the two kilometre long tunnel will replace the 101 year-old existing link which cannot be enlarged owing to insufficient space beneath the river. The single-bore tunnel will be lined with precast concrete segments and driven by an earth pressure balance tunnelling machine through soft glacial clay with only five metres of cover to the tunnel crown beneath the river bed. Adding to the technical complexity, the project is to be built to a tight fast-track programme, with construction scheduled to start at the end of this year and finish by the autumn of 1994. The role of the Hatch-Mott MacDonald joint venture will include design and construction management of the approach junctions, open-cut portals and the new tunnel. Jacobs Associates of San Francisco will be responsible for cost estimating and soils evaluation will be done by Golder Associates of Canada. O'Brien-Kreitzberg will assist with project management.</p>

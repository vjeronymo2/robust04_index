			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with B. Ufimtsev, deputy chief of the South Urals </F> Railroad, general director of Yuzhuralzheldorsnab, by A.  Loginov, GUDOK special correspondent: "In a Ferment of  Bartering"; Chelyabinsk-Moscow; date not given]    [Text] Today, when debts and mutual non-payments,  amounting to millions and billions of rubles, have become not  the best sign of the times, a reasonable question arises: just  how, under these conditions, can one solve the problem of  material-technical supply for transport as a whole and for its  individual mainlines?    Our correspondent interviewed B. Ufimtsev, deputy chief  of the South Urals Railroad, general director of  Yuzhuralzheldorsnab, on this subject    [Loginov] Boris Petrovich, in giving a report on supply  matters at the road's technical-economic council last year,  judging by the notices in the railroad newspaper, you noted that  difficulties are arising today, not in obtaining resources, but  in obtaining the funds to acquire and pay for them.    [Ufimtsev] Well here, let us agree, I didn't say anything  new. Many countries of the world, including the United States  and Japan, are making wide use of barter deals and mutual debt  clearing. Indeed, our country practiced this even earlier, in  the days of centralized supply, except that this was done "at  the top," whereas now, with the transition to the market, one  has to do it oneself -- on the scale of the roads, divisions and  their subdivisions.    Remember, the union's MPS [Ministry of Railways] had a  Material-Technical Supply Main Administration (GUMTO) with the  chief of the main administration holding the rank of deputy  minister. Later on, this structure ceased to exist (as did the  intersectorial Gossnab [State Committee for Material and  Technical Supply], etc.). As far back as 1990 they began to set  up a marketing service. At that time I was appointed chief of  this service and commercial director of the South Urals  Railroad. True, in those days, the tasks were somewhat  different: at that time there were not enough resources, and  therefore they had to be "procured" through additional road  services, leasing railcars, etc. In a word, this experience has  come in handy today.    A necessary digression. On listening to the tape  of the interview, in preparation for publication, I could not  help remembering the economic postulates presented to us in our  student years: commodity-money-commodity. The classic formula of  "Das Kapital" by K. Marx, to which we have, it seems, been  cycled today in our commodity-money bedlam. It is as if there is  more and more money -- our old wooden stuff and various  currencies, but everywhere you hear about the shortage of cash,  of "live" money for clearing accounts. For this reason (and  other, attendant ones), a real muddle has arisen in the economy.  Meanwhile, the author of "Das Kapital," in the section about the  cost of circulation, says:    "1. One of the main items of circulation costs is the money  itself, since it itself has a cost. Money is saved by means of  credit in a three-fold way: A. For a considerable number of  transactions, money is not necessary at all."    We will not dwell on the last two points in the A, B, C  triad, although it would be useful for us, and for our economic  reformers today to know about those points, which were well  known over a century ago. Let us therefore return to the present  problems, the solution of which has gone according to the  Marxist "recommendation" that money is not needed for a  considerable number of transactions between partners.    With the vanishing of the system of centralized allotment of  funds, unfortunately, no full-valued commodity exchanges that  would be capable of satisfying supply and demand have so far  appeared, because of the disparity of prices and all possible  commercial, tax and other jacked-up demands. Now the railroad  workers, particularly their supply structures, have realized:  they cannot survive on their own under these conditions, they  have to unite. I asked my collocutor about this.    [Ufimtsev] The South Urals became a member of the first  eight-road association created on the network, which included  the Sverdlovsk (initiator), Kemerovo, Moscow, Northern, Gorkiy,  Kuybyshev and Volga mainlines. The regions that they serve  produce many of the things that they need. Let us say, on the  South Urals -- metal, on the Kuybyshev -- petroleum products,  the Kemerovo -- coal, etc. Last year our road, through barter  operations alone, acquired 1.5 billion rubles' [R] worth of  resources. Moreover, on the basis of contracts with other roads  and with enterprises of our own region (and not it alone) and by  reciprocal offset, we acquired R13.7 billion worth of resources.  This naturally eased the financial situation of the road, whose  debt to customers was reckoned in tens of billions of rubles.  After all, you have to pay people wages -- this should be done  in banknotes.    [Loginov] But does it turn out that you also pay them with  barter? For example, on the Orsk Division, I heard that they are  "issued" in both motor units and refrigerators, produced  locally. A friend of mine complained: her husband (true, he does  not work in transport) had not received his wages for several  months, but on the other hand, he regularly gets, as a partial  offset for them... sausage. So it is possible, she says, for  them to live.    "We have this sort of independent market, we have to dodge  around in various ways," my collocutor smiled. Later on, after I  visited the Orsk Division, I wondered how the barter wages were  being accepted, and I heard that things were not all that bad.  Let us say, that same motor unit and refrigerator cost the  recipient of the "substitute wage" several thousand rubles less  (!) than on the trade network, after the price is jacked up in  various ways. The railroad workers, in obtaining goods for  mutual offset and settlements (essentially at production cost),  avoid the money "sticking to" the grasping hands of businessmen,  and sell the goods cheaper.    I recently read, in the newspaper SELSKAYA ZHIZN, an item  with the sensational heading, "Fertilizer from... a Locomotive."  Its topic is the fact that many chemical enterprises in the  region of the Gorkiy Railroad owe it a tidy sum for transport.  The railroad workers, in settlement, began to take the debts in  fertilizers, and, in order to have "live money," to sell them to  the local kolkhozes, sovkhozes and joint-stock companies. In  all, they concluded contracts for the supply of 90,000 tonnes of  nitrogen fertilizers. These fertilizers cost the farmers 15-20  percent less.    The Nizhegorod Oblast administration contributed its bit to  this transaction, when it allotted the peasants R3 billion from  its budget to buy fertilizer, and another R1.5 billion to the  Nizhegorodselkhozkhimiya Joint-Stock Company. This means that  the railroad workers had no particular problem in selling the  fertilizer. Not to mention the fact that they did not fail to  transfer some of it to their own subsidiary farms.    In short, the market has begun to act according to its own  particular laws. Zheldorsnab is no weaker because of this, but  on the contrary --has become one of the leading services on the  railroads. It fulfills, on the one hand, its own basic function  -- supply, self-provision of resources for the road, without  trusting in, as it used to, help and allotments from above (MPS,  Gossnab, etc.). On the other hand -- it carries out clearing  accounts and the sale of excess resources. Here there is simply  an interweaving of supply (in the traditional meaning) and  commerce.    I note: my chat with the general director of  Yuzhuralzheldorsnab differed somewhat from an ordinary  interview, and Boris Petrovich Ufimtsev differed from the class  of directors who evade the dry presentation of facts and  figures. This is just the result of what has been done, but how  can more be achieved, how can tomorrow's result be predicted and  planned (!) under the conditions of the market leaps? When  industrial production and transport continue to drop, and prices  to rise. When today's millions and billions are no match for  tomorrow's. All the same, there is always a starting point --  the beginning from which we can and must begin again.    Last year, he reflects, his service, as has already been  noted, "obtained" resources amounting to a little over  one-and-a-half dozen billion rubles. That's quite a good deal.  The contents of the road's financial "purse" would not have made  it possible (without barter) to allot such funds.    He well knows, though, that the mainline's needs are much  greater. And they must be satisfied. The divisions and their  subdivisions were given the assignment of weighing everything at  the sites: the total sum of requests for resources in 1994 was  about R78 billion. It is unrealistic to count on funds like this  being found in the road's cashbox. It was therefore proposed to  that same technical-economic council for the railroad that 60  percent of the material resources be acquired through barter  with other railroads. Part of them would go for the needs of our  railroad, and part for barter and sale....    This is the basis for planning -- not up-in-the-air  planning,  but real planning, albeit with market "nuances".... "Last year,"  said B.P. Ufimtsev, "because of the shortage of rails, ties and  other things, we could not cope with the plan for capital repair  of the line. Now we must fill in the gaps. How? We have  concluded a contract with the metallurgists of the Urals: they  will pay for future transport with metal, and we will send R6  billion worth of it to Novokuznetsk, and we will get rails from  there."    In this way, the railroad workers of the South Urals  Railroad  and their partners by association will appear in several  hypostases: transporters, buyers -- employers, consignees....  Naturally, since I am a journalist, a number of questions  occurred to me.    [Loginov] Today the price of metal is one thing, tomorrow --  it will leap....    [Ufimtsev] Six billion holds good as the starting price at  the moment of concluding the deal, and indexing proceeds at the  moment a certain batch of metal or other materials is shipped.    [Loginov] But the transport tariffs will also leap -- won't  they "eat up" the rails, ties, and the rest?    [Ufimtsev] You can't avoid this, the rise in tariffs is  caused by the rise in prices for energy resources and for  everything that transport needs. It cannot be otherwise. But  what goes for the railroad's needs is supplied at favorable  rates.    [Loginov] Another thing: the huge products list of supplies  (about 40,000 item descriptions) and the price leaps -- all this  requires rapid, if not instantaneous reaction. How can you  succeed in managing it, in handling it? After all, judging by  what you have said, your staff is comparatively small.    [Ufimtsev] We have begun to form a system. By decision of  the  technical-economic council, the road's IVTs [computer  information center] is gathering data on the goods being  produced in the region. With this data bank in the computer  memory (it can be lost in paper technology), special computer  programs can be worked out which make it possible to obtain the  necessary information quickly and to make corrections. This is  not only on the scale of the South Urals Railroad administration  and the road association administration, but also at the sites  -- on the divisions and subdivisions of the mainlines. Having  created this computer information network, we can go to a new  level of material-technical supply control.    [Loginov] Will this approach make it possible to get out of  the present market chaos?    [Ufimtsev] No doubt about it. It is naive to suppose that  the  wild, uncontrolled market can put everything in its place by  itself. The civilized market is -- and I know how it is  organized -- a very strict economy, planned development and  discipline in the mutual relations of the partners. These  components will not permit the wild burst of non-payments which  has reached catastrophic proportions in our country. There is no  place for chaos, when 98 percent of the partners are working  according to a contract system. This is the plan, clear-cut and  mutually coordinated, and deviations from it are severely  punished, according to the terms of the contract. Only two  percent is so-called economic freedom. The rest is the study of  supply and demand, and marketing. Everything is counted out and  weighed on the scales of the economy. Not as it is in our  country -- on the off-chance, by grabbing, by prodding....    [Loginov] Boris Petrovich, before I talked to you, I heard a  flattering reference to the fact that the railroad workers,  apparently from your department, were organizing a trade fair of  Chinese commodities in Chelyabinsk. Is this also part of the  commercial work?    [Ufimtsev] This is somewhat different. Actually, in addition  to supply, we are also engaging in foreign economic activity. We  have a contract of intent, documents for the development of  joint ventures, etc. In this case, however, the organized sale  of Chinese goods, obtained in barter for our surplus, is the  contribution of the Chelyabinsk Division of the road.    This is a topic for a separate conversation. We go out on  the  foreign market when we do not find anything that we have "at  home." Or we find it, but -- it is not as good.... For example,  the special "Gudok" work clothing for engineers -- jacket and  trousers. We buy them at a plant in St. Petersburg. But the  Chinese suggested that they make a consignment of this clothing:  with natural fur (we use synthetic), made more accurately, and  for a cheaper price. The engineers prefer the Chinese "Gudok" --  a market is a market.    [Loginov] As far as I know, we are stumbling on the market  in  our relations with our near abroad, particularly with Kazakhstan.    [Ufimtsev] Paradoxical as it may seem. After all, until  quite  recently we had no border barriers: part of the Orenburg  Division was wedged into Kazakhstan, and vice-versa -- the West  Kazakhstan Railroad was in Orenburg Oblast. Indeed, even now the  Petropavlovsk Division is included in the South Urals Railroad,  so as not to break up the Central Siberian mainline. For that  reason we sometimes cannot provide "our" division with spare  parts, because of customs and other barriers, even though their  delivery belongs in the category of technically necessary,  duty-free transport. There is an intergovernment statute on this  score, but just imagine -- we still stumble.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   As if "by order," a telephone conversation comes to my mind.  It reflects one of the paradoxes of our time.... Railcars loaded  with edible salt, extracted at Sol-Iletsk, which is in Orenburg  Oblast, arrived for processing and shipment to consignees at the  nearby Iletsk Station of the West Kazakhstan Railroad. But they  held them up here, demanding that customs duty be paid. Ufimtsev  had to explain in simple terms that this was transport necessary  for technical reasons, specified by so-and-so....    After all, this is the salt, the whole point of our lack of  coordination and woes.</p>

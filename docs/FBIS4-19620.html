			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Failure in Gorazde"] </F>   [Text] Last weekend, the crisis about Gorazde, which was  declared a "safe area" by the United Nations, reached a chaotic  and dangerous phase. According to reliable sources, Serb tanks  were only a few hundred yards from the center of the city last  Sunday night.    The attempts by the United Nations, NATO, and the Russians  to  end the Serb offensive launched against Gorazde on 30 March were  a total failure as a result of a series of miscalculations,  internal disagreements, and clumsy attempts at military action.    General Michael Rose, UN Commander in Bosnia, initially  underestimated the meaning of the Serb offensive. Then the Serb  assailants were unexpectedly encouraged by the United States.  Defense Secretary Perry and Chairman, Joint Chiefs, General  Shalikashvili stated that the impending fall of Gorazde would  not be a reason for the United States to launch air strikes.    A week and a half ago, Secretary Christopher and President  Clinton corrected that view, but Gorazde was already on the  verge of falling. At General Rose's request, two NATO bombings  followed. They were not important from the military point of  view, but it was hoped that they would have a psychological  impact.    However, this impact was largely undone by Russian President  Yeltsin's disapproving reaction to the NATO action, in spite of  negotiator Churkin's subsequent diplomatic attempts to urge the  Serbs to withdraw. The latest result of these efforts was last  Sunday afternoon's agreement on a Serb withdrawal to 3 km  outside Gorazde, and the stationing of 350 UN military personnel  there.    However, the Serbs make fools of their Russian friends just  as easily as they do NATO and the United Nations. Karadzic and  General Mladic intimidated the latter and labelled them as  enemies. They even shot down a NATO airplane last Saturday. The  fact that the subsequently requested air support was not given  completes the international community's failure. The impression  of panic at the United Nations is strengthened by Yashushi  Akashi's inexcusable statement last Saturday, that UNPROFOR  should perhaps withdraw from Bosnia altogether.    Loss of face for NATO, panic at the United Nations, the  whole  situation is very alarming. Even worse is that Gorazde's  failure has undone the sobering effect which the Sarajevo  ultimatum had on the Serbs. Karadzic has regained both the  military and diplomatic initiative.</p>

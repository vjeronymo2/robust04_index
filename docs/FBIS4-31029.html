			<p>BFN     STATE ASSETS PRIVATIZED: By the end of last year, only 15  percent of the state assets of 430 billion forints (HUF) held by  the State Property Agency (AVU) and the State Holding Company's  HUF1,400 billion had been privatized, according to a recent  report by the independent research organization Kopint-Datorg.  Last year's income from privatization was HUF77.9 billion,  slightly up on 1992's HUF74.6 billion. Of the 1993 income,  however, the proportion of foreign investment was only  one-third, as compared to 55 percent in 1992, and the cash  element in the total income figure fell from 85 percent to 55  percent. Preferential payment forms (for example, privatization  leasing) accounted for 45 percent of the total income in 1993,  compared with only 15 percent in the previous year. The report  states that preferential payment schemes have created problems  for companies privatized in this way; creating uncertainty over  their future and failing to provide secure long-term successful  operations. State assets to a book value of HUF152.8 billion  were privatized between 1990 and 1992 and the privatization  income in this period was around two-thirds of book value. The  book value of privatized state assets last year was HUF127.8  billion, but the privatization income was only 55 percent of  this figure. The continued operation of state- owned companies  is becoming increasingly expensive and company assets worth  HUF67.2 billion were sold off in 1993. AVU expenditure on  various guarantees amounted to HUF5.7 billion in 1993 and this  amount is projected to rise to HUF15 billion in the 1994  Property Policy Guidelines. Although AVU expenditure on company  reorganization and guarantees is classified as the  redistribution of privatization revenues, Kopint-Datorg argues  that it is paradoxical that privatization incomes are in effect  being use to increase the state's control over state-owned  companies. (Budapest MTI in English 1406 GMT 3 May 94)    NATIONAL BANK BALANCE: The Hungarian National Bank (MNB)  closed last year with a balance-sheet total of HUF3,468.8  billion, 29 percent up on the previous year. MNB revenues of  HUF236.3 billion and expenditures of HUF223.4 billion resulted  in pre-tax profit of HUF12.82 billion, which was HUF3.9 billion  more than last year. After-tax profits were HUF2.5 billion.  The above figures were published at MNB's general assembly on  29 April. The bank's results are closely linked with Hungary's  economic situation. Last year's processes exhibited differences  from the original plan, with a fall in exports and a 9 percent  rise in domestic consumption. After a decline lasting years,  industrial output increased by 4 percent; agricultural  production continued to decrease, reaching 6 percent; gross  domestic product fell by 0-2 percent. Last year the MNB and the  government devalued the forint in five stages, by a total of 15  percent. The international basic balance, that is the balance  of the current account, net borrowings, repayments, and working  capital investments, showed a surplus of $755 million in 1992,  and $2.2 billion in 1993. At the same time, the current account  last year dipped $3.5 billion into the red. In 1993, foreign  resources of $4.4 billion were mobilized through 16 bond issues,  and $2.3 billion working capital arrived in the country, with  the total amount considerably exceeding debt-repayment  obligations. The country had net debts of $14.9 billion at the  end of 1993, an increase of $1.7 billion from the previous year.  Hard- currency reserves amounted to $6.7 billion late last  year. The gross national debt went up by $3.1 billion in one  year, to reach $24.6 billion by the end of December. (Budapest  MTI in English 1528 GMT 29 Apr 94)    INVESTMENT BANK PROFITS: The Hungarian Investment and  Development Bank (MBFB Rt) held total assets last year of  HUF20.5 billion, registering pre-tax profits of HUF667 million  and after-tax profits of HUF460 million, according to its March  2 annual general meeting (AGM) report. These figures are around  50 percent up on the 1992 figures. MBFB could have paid a 5  percent dividend from 1992's profit reserves and last year's  profit, but the AGM decided instead to allocate 50 percent of  the 1993 profit to general reserves and the other half to profit  reserves. The bank's total assets are expected to rise to HUF44  billion this year, with credit outlays of over HUF16 billion,  eight times more than in 1993. The bank is to become  increasingly involved in the long-term financing of major  projects, mainly in the construction and building materials  industries, and in infrastructure development projects. To  enable it to do this, MBFB plans to take out long-term credit on  HUF12 billion from foreign banks. The State Holding Company (AV  Rt) has raised the bank's reserve capital by HUF2 billion to  HUF12.2 billion. AV Rt now holds 55.73 percent of the bank,  with the SPA holding 21.18 percent and the State Development  Institute (AFI) 22.94 percent. (Budapest MTI in English 1041  GMT 3 May 94)    BNP-KH-DRESDNER BALANCE: BNP-KH-Dresdner Bank (BKD) closed  last year with a balance sheet total of HUF15 billion and a  pre-tax profit of 454 million forints (HUF). The bank had an  after-tax profit of HUF377 million, of which HUF200 million was  set aside for the payment of dividends. BKD had interest  revenue of HUF1.949 billion, paying out HUF1.417 billion  interest leaving net interest revenue at HUF532 million. Other  income was almost HUF600 million. Total operating costs were  HUF593 million. Of the remaining after- tax profit, the bank is  to pay HUF109 million into general reserves and HUF67 million  into capital reserves. The bank's stock of loans amounted to  HUF4.874 billion in 1992 and HUF5.305 billion last year. BKD's  stock of state securities grew from HUF494 million in 1992 to  HUF2.244 billion. BKD was established at the end of 1990 by  Banque National de Paris (37 percent), Dresdner Bank AG (37  percent) and Kereskedelmi Bank Rt (26 percent). The bank has  registered capital of HUF1.14 billion and capital reserves of  HUF333.3 million.

The new shares will be  offered to Hungarian private investors and to Hungarian and  foreign corporate investors. No oversubscription will be  accepted. The issue price will be HUF1,300 or its equivalent in  U.S. dollars at the central bank mid-rate on May 2. The issue  is managed by Talentum Rt. The shares are expected to be  introduced on the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) shortly after  their issue and are likely to be later floated on foreign stock  exchanges. Alongside the share issue, Goldsun will also offer  convertible bonds to a total face value of HUF10 million. The  convertible bonds will have face value of HUF100 and will be  issued at par. Each bond entitles the bearer to an option on  the purchase of one registered ordinary HUF1,000 face-value  share at a price of HUF1,500 in the first week of November 1995.  If the option is not used, the bonds may be redeemed at face  value. The convertible bonds, which will not be introduced on  the BSE, will be available to Hungarians and foreigners.  Goldsun Hutoipari Rt, the legal successor of Zalaegerszegi  Hutoipari Kft, was established as a shareholders' company (Rt)  on December 1 last year with founding capital of HUF764 million.  The American investment company, Shamrock Capital Investors III  Inc bought 51 percent of the Zala company from the State  Property Agency in April 1992 and purchased the remaining 49  percent a year later. Sunfrost, Israel's largest refrigerating  company, bought 50 percent of the company last October.  Goldsun, which ranks second or third among Hungary's eight  major frozen food companies, had a sales income last year of  HUF1.4 billion. Exports to western Europe account for 54  percent of all sales. Sales are expected to reach HUF1.642  billion this year and the income from work under commission  contracts will be HUF103 million. The company is exempt from  profit tax until 1996 and will enjoy a 60 percent tax allowance  up to 2001. Last year, Goldsun received a $5.2 million  development loan from the EBRD, HUF2 million of which was used  in 1993. (Budapest MTI in English 1355 GMT 29 Apr 94)    GRAIN HARVEST FORECASTS: This year's grain harvest is  expected to be around 6 million metric tons, including a wheat  harvest of 4 million metric tons. Last year's wheat harvest was  3.032 million metric tons, which represented an average of 3,060  kilos per hectare. Wheat was sown on an area of 992,000  hectares. In 1993, the total harvest of cereals -- grains and  maize -- was 8.389 million metric tons, with maize accounting  for 4.012 million metric tons. Last year maize was harvested on  an area of 1.131 million hectares, an average yield of 3,550  kilos per hectare. Cereal crops were sown on a total area of  2.742 million hectares last year. The relatively wet spring  means that this year's cereal (grains and maize), harvest is  expected to reach 11 million metric tons. As the domestic  market generally takes 8.5-9 million metric tons, there is  expected to be a surplus for export. It is estimated that the  area sown with maize this year is 1-1.2 million hectares and a  maize harvest of around 5 million metric tons is forecast.  (Budapest MTI in English 1413 GMT 28 Apr 94)    GAMBLING: Gambling accounted for one-fourth of payments by  state firms to the central budget in 1993 (HUF6.7 billion). The  total revenue of HUF24.4 billion acquired by gambling organizers  is less than 1 percent of Hungary's annual total domestic  income. The operation of casinos continues to be the most  profitable branch within the industry, with a major decline in  the demand for Bingo and raffle tickets. According to estimates,  75-80 percent of the population has gambled in one form or  another at least once. Of them, every third is an active  punter, placing regular bets. The most popular games, for  instance, football lottery, the lottery, Bingo, and racing, are  state monopolies. At present, some 250 firms organize gambling,  but the state sector continues to dominate gambling. This is  mainly due to the lottery and football lottery monopoly of the  Gambling Co., which has an equity of HUF1.8 billion. Of the 17  casinos operating nationwide, the firm operates nine, and also  has 12 slot-machine halls, and issued six various raffle tickets  in 1993. Bingosport Plc. is the other state-owned gambling  firm, but the number of its Bingo halls fell from 18 to nine in  1993. No bookmakers operate in Hungary, although a private  venture opened 14 such offices, based on the English model, but  was forced to shut down due to heavy losses. The raffle ticket  and game market also declined: While there were 26 raffle  ticket issuing companies in 1992, their number was only 19 last  year. The operation of casinos continues to be the strong part  of Hungarian gambling; five new casinos were opened in towns  throughout the country in 1993. This year, another two casinos  are to open where betting is possible in forints. (Of the 17  casinos in Hungary at present, only three accept bets in  forints, the other 14 require foreign currency.) The number of  slot-machines in Hungary has shown a steady increase since 1992,  with about 4,000-5,000 throughout the country. Although a law  bans these, the authorities are unable to enforce the ban as the  maximum fine that can be imposed is only HUF30,000. Gambling  brought in revenue of HUF24.4 billion in 1993, which is not even  one percent of the country's total domestic income. However,  gambling accounted for more than one-fourth of payments by state  firms (various taxes and contributions) to the central budget in  1993. Apart from this, as concession fees, an additional HUF443  million was levied on gambling organizers. According to surveys  in 1993, the majority (some 70 percent) of gambling organizers  ended the year with a loss, or were just able to break even.  Even the largest state monopoly firm, the Gambling Co. produced  losses of HUF182 million in the first half of the year, but  managed to end the year without a loss. Analysts say that  besides heavy tax burdens, the operational costs of gambling are  extremely high. Apart from the general taxes levied on  entrepreneurs, gambling organizers also face additional  deductions of 44 percent. (Budapest MTI in English 0815 GMT 29  Apr 94)    FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING: Trading on the inter-bank  foreign-exchange market is calm, with no signs of any forint  devaluation expectations for the near future. Banks have not  responded to the first-round Hungarian election results with any  major forex purchases. (Budapest MTI in English 1149 GMT 10 May  94)    AVU CONTINUES PRIVATIZATION: The State Property Agency (AVU)  Board confirmed after its meeting on 11 May it would continue  the privatization process but would concentrate on closing  transactions already in progress. New tenders are expected to  be evaluated starting in August. Privatization will not be  accelerated and the AVU will try to avoid making strategic  decisions. Its most important aim is to maintain and increase  the reliability of the process, the board said. (Budapest MTI  in English 1625 GMT 11 May 94)    CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT: The current account deficit stood  at $573 million at the end of February, compared to $378 million  at the end of January, according to the Hungarian National Bank.  As a result of a $910 million surplus in the capital account,  the country's balance of payments showed a $337 million surplus  in the first two months, as against a $853 million surplus in  January. The trade balance deficit grew from $389 million in  January to $536 million in February, with exports amounting to  $1.146 billion and imports totalling $1.681 billion. In  February, exports amounted to $540 million and imports totalled  $687 million, resulting in a deficit of $147 million. Direct  foreign cash investment amounted to $20 million in February,  compared to $88 million in January, while long-term capital  inflow was $1.578 billion, an increase of $102 million from  $1.476 billion in January. Hungary's international reserves  stood at $7.333 billion, slightly down on $7.539 billion in the  preceding month and compared to $6.736 billion at the end of  last year. Total direct cash investment amounted to $5.661  billion at the end of January, up from $5.575 billion at the end  of December 1993. Foreign debt totalled $26.078 billion at the  end of February, as against $25.698 billion in January and  $24.560 billion at the end of last year. (Budapest MTI in  English 1111 GMT 11 May 94)    NBH REPORT: The 1993 monetary and budget policies had to be  corrected, since economic trends were in several respects  different than expected, says the Hungarian National Bank's  (NBH) annual report. One difference is that the increase in  industrial production in 1993 resulted not from exports, but  mainly from a significant rise in domestic corporate demand.  Corporate demand was not counterbalanced by a decrease in the  budget deficit, leading to the rise in domestic demand. The  foreign trade balance and that of current payments have been  showing a monthly deficit since the third quarter of 1992.  Additionally, deposit interest rates have significantly fallen  as a result of over-liquidity in the banking system, a condition  intended to allow market interest rates to adjust to the slowing  rate of inflation. This, however, has discouraged savings. The  decrease in the deposit interest rate was followed by a smaller  decrease in the lending interest rate only a few months later.  As a result, the amount of bank loans has hardly risen, and the  interest margin has increased over the year. At the same time,  the central budget financing offered a safe investment  possibility to banks. High lending interest rates inspired  prospering companies to take out foreign loans. Corrective  measures carried out by the central bank over the year aimed to  boost savings and increase the competitiveness of Hungarian  products in foreign markets. These measures included the rise  in central bank interest rates in June and September, the bank's  urging the Finance Ministry to raise interest on state  securities, and the devaluation of the forint by a total of 15  percent in 1993. The impacts of these measures, however, could  not have been felt in 1993, except for the fact that the savings  rate stopped falling by the end of the year. Banks' foreign  debts decreased by a total of HUF6.2 billion in 1993. The  direct capital inflow and foreign loans taken out by companies  equaled the current account deficit. There was a slight  increase in business deposits and a steep one in their debts.  This resulted in, unlike in 1992, entrepreneurs becoming net  debtors to the banks with net debts of HUF54.7 billion by the  end of 1993. Direct foreign loans taken out by companies grew  by $700 million over last year. Net personal savings showed an  increase of HUF146.3 billion in 1993, a lower figure than  expected, and savings were increasingly deposited outside the  banking sector. Net outstanding claims of banks to the budget  increased by HUF38.2 billion. Total domestic loans increased by  HUF16.3 percent, with loans granted to private individuals  rising by 14.6 percent, and those granted to companies by 18.5  percent. Net debt of the consolidated state budget significantly  rose in mid- year; however, it exceeded last year's figure only  by 3.5 percent at the end of 1993, mainly as a result of the  privatization of the telecommunications company MATAV in  December. In 1993 broad money increased by 16.1 percent while  nominal GDP went up by 18-19 percent. Over the previous three  years, nominal GDP increased by a lower rate than broad money.  The velocity of money rose by 2 percent. (Budapest MTI in  English 1556 GMT 4 May 94)    COMPUTER MONITOR ASSEMBLY: Philips plans to establish an  assembly plant for computer monitors in Szombathely, west  Hungary. The plant is expected to start operating in September  and will produce 800,000 monitors a year when it reaches full  capacity in 1996. The project has the support of the regional  Labor Office and the local council, with the Labor Office to  grant a 20 million forint (HUF) loan and the council granting  the company a tax exemption. The plant is expected to provide  about 230 new jobs. (Budapest MTI in English 1619 GMT 5 May 94)    PHARMACY PRIVATIZATION: The State Property Agency (AVU) is  to invite tenders for the privatization of 61 pharmacies on 6  May. The asset value of the pharmacies, including their  residential real estate, ranges between HUF1.3 million and HUF21  million. The pharmacies' current stocks will not be included in  the tenders but successful bidders will be able to buy these  from regional pharmaceutical centers under a deferred payment  scheme involving a preferential interest rate. Hungarian  pharmacies generally have a stock turnover period of one month.  Other sources put the value of each pharmacy's stocks at  between HUF1 million and HUF25 million. The pharmacies were  separated from the regional pharmaceutical centers so that  bidders could offer payment with E-loans ("existence" loans) or  compensation coupons. Because of the long-running dispute  between the AVU and local councils over the ownership of the  pharmacies, half of the income from the privatization of the  pharmacies will go to foundations that support pharmacies. The  AVU is expected to invite bids for the sale of a further group  of pharmacies in June. (Budapest MTI in English 1639 GMT 5 May  94)    SLOVAKIA OFFICE: The State Property Agency (AVU) opened its  second office abroad in Komarno, Slovakia. Hungary's  compensation laws affect almost 2 million people in 16  countries. Run by BBS Invest Ltd. of Komarno, the office will  also have a branch in Moldava nad Bodvou. Both offices will  provide up-to-date information for any Slovak citizens who are  eligible for compensation in Hungary. The first AVU office on  foreign soil opened in Miercurea-Ciuc, Romania, one and a half  months ago. (Budapest MTI in English 1941 GMT 4 May 94)    WINE QUALITY BILL: The Ministry of Agriculture prepared its  bill on grape and wine production bearing in mind the need to  put the laws in line with European Union rules. The law will  guarantee the designation of the place of origin (that is  quality consistency), and will introduce an origin protection  system as a guarantee for the financial interest of producers.  The law would also oblige private wine producers to become  members of so-called self-administrating "wine-growing  communities" that will be licensed as authorities. Following the  change in political system, lands, vineyards and forests were  reprivatized, and the interests of producers made it necessary  to meet market demands, mainly to fully observe equality  guarantees. At the same time, producers themselves also want a  return to their own, ancient institutions. (Budapest MTI in  English 0745 GMT 5 May 94)    NEW MORTGAGE BILL: A new law under preparation would extend  mortgages to personal, movable property. The bill is expected  to go before the new parliament this fall. The mortgage law  could significantly contribute to the further development of the  credit system. A team from the London-based European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) worked out the mortgage  model that Justice Ministry officials used to prepare the new  legal measure. The bill was put together so as to conform to  Western European legal measures on credit guarantees. Under the  bill, the mortgage would extend to profits from land (for  instance, produce). A new element is that mortgaged property  would not, in all cases, need to be used by the owner until the  loan is repaid. For instance, rented apartments inhabited by  tenants, rather than the owner, can be mortgaged. Any item that  can be possessed can be mortgaged: securities, money,  transferable rights, claims, and shares in economic  partnerships. An important change is that mortgage rights can  also be enforced through execution, not merely through court  proceedings. There have been cases in the past when the  property used as a guarantee for the raising of a loan was  mortgaged only after several years, because of lengthy court  proceedings. Under the bill, the debtor and the creditor can  agree on the joint sale of the pledged property. In order to  prevent the same object being mortgaged more than once, a  suitable registration system must be created. The bill contains  several versions for personal, movable properties. Accordingly,  the territorial chamber of commerce, the trade directory, the  local council, or notary would be in charge of keeping records.  (Budapest MTI in English 1000 GMT 5 May 94)    GERMAN BUSINESS ADVICE: Small and medium-sized businesses  will be able to gain start-up help from a German-supported  advisory system to be established shortly. This follows the  signing of a cooperation contract between the leaders of the  National Association of Industrial Bodies (Iposz) and the  Directorate for the Rationalization of the German Economy (RKW).  The German Ministry of Economics commissioned the Deutsche  Ausgleichsbank to grant 1.8 million German marks to finance the  setting up and operation of the economic coordination office.  The office will choose advisers by the beginning of June.  Representatives of new businesses or ones established not longer  than three years ago may receive six days of advice of which  half the fees will be paid by the German program. The  coordination office will be operated until June 1995 by RKW, and  after that by Iposz. (Budapest MTI in English 1638 GMT 6 May 94)    BOOK PUBLISHING PRIVATIZED: The book publishing industry has  been almost completely privatized. While the country's  publishers have lost markets, money, and experts due to the  systemic change, they have acquired new talent, impetus,  self-organization, and lobbying techniques. State patronage is  also helping the publication of books today. The number of  books published nationwide has dropped from 113 million in 1989  to 80 million by 1994. The number of titles published in a year  has also declined: from 13,500 between 1991 and 1993, to 12,500  currently. Privatized book publishing had to start out from a  capital- deficient situation. Publishers and dealers still lack  capital. Book wholesalers first gather orders from retailers  throughout the country, and then forward these to the  publishers, ordering only the number of books for which they  have concrete clients. They then add their costs to the price.  (The price gap between wholesale book trade and retail trade is  40 percent.) Privatization of book selling has not yet been  completed. The situation is more favorable in publishing. The  top 25 publishers are old Hungarian firms, previously taken over  by the state, and now accounting for 60 percent of the market.  (Budapest MTI in English 1045 GMT 10 May 94)    EXCHANGE RATES: Over the past year, the Hungarian forint  (HUF) lost 17.9 percent of its value as against the U.S. dollar.  From May 13, 1990 to May 13, 1994, the forint rate against the  dollar declined by 58 percent, as a comparative analysis of the  National Bank of Hungary (MNB) exchange rates shows. Last year  the forint rate dropped by the greatest extent -- 20.4 percent  -- against the Swiss franc. (The four-year decline was 54.9  percent.) Four years ago the MNB sold a Swiss franc for 47.17  forints, a year ago for 60.7 forints, and now it sells for 73.1  forints. As compared to the German mark and the Austrian  schilling, the forint lost 13.5 percent of its value last year,  and 55.5 percent in four years. Four years ago, the MNB paid  HUF66.12 for a dollar, HUF40.21 for a mark, and HUF5.71 for a  schilling. Twelve months ago a dollar equalled to HUF88.62, a  mark HUF55.06, and a schilling HUF7.82. (Budapest MTI in  English 1453 GMT 13 May 94)    CONSUMER PRICES: According to April 1994 figures, consumer  prices rose by 1.2 percent in the last month. The increase over  the past 12 months has been 17.3 percent, the Central  Statistical Office said. The January 1994 increase in consumer  prices was 3.2 percent, declining to 1.4 percent in February,  and to 1 percent in March. The 1.2 percent rise in April was  primarily due to market conditions and to locally increased  charges for piped water, sewage, and district heating. Last  January's inflation rate was 6.8 percent, dropping to 1.7 in  February, and down to 0.8 percent both in March and April. In  the past 12 months, the highest rate of inflation occurred this  April. The average annual increase in the consumer-price index  -- assessing the figures for the preceding twelve months -- was  17 percent this January, 16.6 percent in February, 16.8 percent  in March, and 17.3 percent in April. For an average Hungarian  family living in an urban area and consisting of two adults and  two under- 15 children, the minimum subsistence-level monthly  income rose to HUF51,100 (approx. $510) this April, which is  HUF12,780 per person. The minimum subsistence-level monthly  income for a family has risen by a total of HUF500 since  February, which is an increase of HUF130 per capita. (Budapest  MTI in English 1225 GMT 16 May 94)    BONDS IN AUSTRIA: The Hungarian National Bank (MNB) launched  a 1 billion Austrian schillings bond issue in Austria on 18 May.  The bond issue was lead-managed by Creditanstalt-Bankverein and  underwritten by 12 banks. The seven-year bond bears a 9 percent  interest. This was the second foreign bond issue of the central  bank this year. The MNB issued bonds to a face value of 2.5  billion Luxembourg francs (125 million German marks) in  Luxembourg in March. The MNB plans to raise $2 billion through  bond issues on the international capital market this year of  which $1.4 billion has already been realized. The MNB raised a  total of $4.5 billion through foreign bond issues last year.  There were two issues of bonds to a total value of $1.1 billion  at the end of last year, with payment in January 1994. Hungarian  securities sell well on the Austrian money market. Preparations  for issuing MNB bonds in yen and German mark are under way.  (Budapest MTI in English 0823 GMT 18 May 94)    SMALL INVESTOR PROGRAM: Hungarian citizens can purchase over  HUF100 billion (about $1 billion) worth of bonds until the end  of 1998. Within the framework of the Small Investor Shareholder  Program (SISP), launched this April, stakes in 70 state-owned  companies are to be offered to the public over a nearly  five-year period. The SISP only includes companies fit to be  introduced onto the stock exchange. This way, 10-20 percent of  the companies' stake can be sold to private investors. The  State Property Agency (AVU) has found as many as 70 state-owned  companies suitable for joining the SISP. Over a five- year  period, small investors can have access to a total of HUF100-  200 billion worth of stakes. Customers can pay either in cash  or by compensation coupons and no coverage is required from  them. Bonds can also be purchased on loan to be repaid in  instalments over a five-year period. The SISP began with a  trial phase in April, offering the bonds of four companies  involved in trade, hotel and food industry, amounting to a total  value of HUF4 billion. Following first assessments results,  public service and pharmaceutical companies will also be  included in the second phase. More than half of the new owners  utilized the opportunity for loans, and many paid with  compensation coupons. Recent polls show that people are  satisfied with these bonds as investment and utilize the  possibility of paying in instalments, as these loans are  interest- free. (Budapest MTI in English 0951 GMT 16 May 94)    STATE OWNERSHIP: The government modified its earlier  decision  on long-term state ownership. The change affects the state's  holdings in AB-Aegon Insurance Rt, Penzjegynyomda Rt, Szikra  Lapnyomda Rt, Postabank Rt, Borsodferr Rt, and Szerencsejatek  Rt. The State Property Management Corporation (AV Rt) will now  retain only a single "golden share" in the insurance company  AB-Aegon Biztosito Rt and in the banknote printing company  Penzjegynyomda Rt. It was earlier planned that 5 percent of  AB-Aegon and a 25 percent plus one vote stake in Penzjegynyomda  Rt would remain in long-term state ownership. Penzjegynyomda had  shareholders' equity of HUF2.024 billion, with registered  capital of HUF1.82 billion at the end of last year, of which the  Hungarian National Bank (MNB) held 50.1 percent, with AV Rt  holding the remainder. As a result of a HUF600 million equity  increase earlier this year, the MNB has increased its stake by  12.1 percent. Forthcoming technical developments at the  printing company will be financed by the MNB through a further  equity raise. AV Rt will now retain only a 25 percent plus one  vote stake in the printing company Szikra Lapnyomda Rt instead  of the originally planned 50 percent plus one vote. The  printing company has registered capital of HUF1.8 billion. Some  of the shares freed will be offered in exchange for compensation  coupons. The state will now relinquish its entire holding in  Postabank Rt. It was originally planned that the state would  hold 20 percent of the bank, but as AV Rt does not plan to  contribute to a planned HUF2 billion equity raise, the state's  stake would have fallen anyway to 16 percent. Postabank, which  has registered capital of HUF6.5 billion, has the most extensive  branch network in Hungary. The state will now retain only a 25  percent plus one vote stake in the steel company Borsodferr Rt,  which was recently established with registered capital of HUF50  million. It was earlier planned that the company would be  wholly state-owned. (Budapest MTI in English 1156 GMT 13 May 94)    AGRICULTURE FORECAST: A recent Agriculture Ministry report  expects that 1994 will be a year of stabilization in the  agricultural sector, with rising production following last  year's drastic decline. Agricultural production is forecast to  rise by between 5 percent and 8 percent overall. Although crop  production is expected to rise by 14-20 percent, no increase in  livestock production is expected. Food industry output is  expected to grow by 3-5 percent. Autumn wheat has been sown on  more than 1 million hectares and this year's total grain crop,  including maize, is expected to be over 11 million metric tons.  It is estimated that agricultural production will account for  16-18 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year and  for at least 25 percent of all exports. One in five people  works in the agricultural sector. Last year, agricultural  exports were worth $2.6 billion as compared to $2.2 billion in  1990, $2.7 billion in 1991, and $2.8 billion in 1992. Up to the  end of last year, land to a value of 27 million golden crowns  had been sold through compensation land auctions and the number  of those acquiring land exceeded 320,000. This year's central  budget allocates HUF57 billion to agricultural support, with  HUF10 billion to finance agricultural production and HUF7.5  billion to finance an ongoing reorganization program. The  amount available through the Agricultural Development Fund is  HUF6 billion and HUF2 billion has been allocated to  infrastructural development. (Budapest MTI in English 1559 GMT  17 May 94)    FAKES CAUSE LOSSES: Although distributors of forged products  now face a fine of up to HUF20,000, instead of the previous  HUF5,000, they still cause losses measurable in millions of  dollars to companies manufacturing and selling quality goods.  Among the ex-socialist countries Hungary has become the largest  outlet for forgeries, mostly due to a lack of adequate  legislation. The Industrial Property Rights Association (IPRA)  and firms suffering damages from the trend -- mainly sportswear  manufacturers -- have repeatedly proposed amending the  misdemeanor law that does not allow confiscation of goods.  Legal retail trade in Hungary last year amounted to HUF1,500  billion, with illegal distribution reaching HUF500 billion,  according to the Consumer Protection Inspectorate. It is  estimated that black marketeers make profits of HUF200 billion  from unpaid duties, value added tax (VAT), and personal income  tax. (Budapest MTI in English 1526 GMT 16 May 94)    BUENOS AIRES EXHIBIT: The four-day independent Hungarian  economic exhibition held in Buenos Aires with support from the  Ministry of International Economic Relations was termed a  success by Hungarian officials. The exhibition featured 17  Hungarian firms, mainly recently privatized small and  medium-sized companies, which presented their products, along  with delivery and cooperation possibilities. Argentine business  groups showed considerable interest in the exhibition. Official  talks were held on expanding bilateral economic ties. The  Argentinian business leaders were interested in production  cooperation, joint ventures, and Hungarian capital investments.  The latter would mainly be in agriculture and the  food-processing industry. A demand emerged for participation in  the privatization of the Hungarian milling industry. In the  course of official talks, the two sides agreed to speed up talks  aimed at reaching an agreement on abolishing double taxation.  Based on Hungarian results in the creation of a market economy,  the Argentines consider Hungary a possible bridgehead in central  and Eastern Europe. It was also announced that a chief  commissioner to coordinate and prepare Argentine participation  in the 1996 Budapest World Expo would shortly be appointed.  (Budapest MTI in English 0946 GMT 13 May 94)    BUSINESS WITH AUSTRIA: According to International Economic  Relations Minister Bela Kadar, the change in Hungary's  government will not affect the development of increased  Austrian-Hungarian economic links. Hungary hopes the June 12  Austrian referendum regarding EU entry will turn out positively,  because Austria's EU membership would clearly have a beneficial  effect on Hungary. After last year's stagnation, bilateral  business ties have begun to develop rapidly. Hungary now ranks  first among Austria's trading partners in the region, and fifth  worldwide, ahead of the United States and Britain. This trend  meets the mutual expectations attached to the EFTA agreement.  In the first quarter of this year, Austrian exports to Hungary  rose by 15.1 percent, to 4.4 billion schillings, while Hungary  exported 12.4 percent more goods to Austria, reaching a total of  2.6 billion schillings. (Budapest MTI in English 1420 GMT 17  May 94)    JAN-MAR ECONOMICS: Central Statistical Office (KSH) figures  show an increase in the number of economic organizations over  the first three months of this year, an approximately 1 percent  rise in prices per month, falling unemployment, and a greater  foreign trade and central-budget deficit. In the first quarter  of 1994, 4,699 economic organizations were founded, including  1,042 with foreign interests. Investments increased by 1.6  times more than in the first three months of last year,  calculated at current prices. Industrial production continued  to increase -- by 9.4 percent -- after last year's upswing.  Energy use was down 5.7 percent on the first quarter of 1993,  partly due to the mild winter. Consumer prices rose by 1  percent from February to March, and by 1.2 percent from March to  April. The number of unemployed fell by 19,600 in March, to  611,000 -- 87,000 more than at the same time last year. In the  period under survey, imports grew by 31 percent and exports by  25 percent, resulting in a trade deficit of 78.6 billion  Hungarian forints (HUF), 1.5 times that of last year. The  current account showed a deficit amounting to $573 million for  the first two months of this year, 35 percent up on the previous  year. Gross national debt had risen to $26.1 billion and net  debt to $16.2 billion by the end of February. The January-March  deficit of the central budget was double the 1993 first-quarter  amount, exceeding HUF86 billion. (Budapest MTI in English 1223  GMT 20 May 94)    PRICES RISE: Industrial prices rose 0.8 percent in March and  were 9.1 percent up on March 1993, the Central Statistical  Office reported. Domestic producer prices rose 7.8 percent in  the 12 months up to the end of March. Calculated in forints,  export prices rose 13.2 percent in the same period. However, the  rise in export prices was entirely due to the 16 percent  devaluation of the forint in the period and export producer  prices fell by around 3 percent calculated in foreign exchange,  the report adds. Domestic sales prices in the industrial and  agricultural sectors rose overall by 9.2 percent in the 12  months up to March. At the end of March, producer prices,  domestic sales prices and export prices, calculated in forints,  were all 3.5 percent up on December 1993. Industrial producer  prices rose by 1.8 percent in January and 0.9 percent in  February. The 12-month increases were 8.1 percent in January  and 8.7 percent a month later. Domestic producer prices were 6.8  percent up in January and 7.5 percent higher in February  compared to the same months of 1993. On a 12-month basis,  export prices, calculated in forints, were 12.4 percent up in  January and 12 percent higher in February. Domestic sales  prices in the industrial and agricultural sectors were up 8.1  percent overall in January and 9.0 percent higher in February  than in the corresponding months of 1993. In March, public  utility sales prices were on average only 1.7 percent higher  than a year earlier, with a 15.9 percent rise in the price of  water, and electricity prices remaining unchanged. Within the  9.9 percent average increase in producer prices in the  manufacturing sector, prices of chemicals rose by 5.3 percent  while those of food, drinks and tobacco rose by 15.2 percent in  the 12 months up to the end of March. (Budapest MTI in English  1721 GMT 20 May 94)    FARM MARKET EXPECTATIONS: According to the Ministry of  International Economic Relations, the market for Hungarian  agricultural produce is expected to improve following the coming  into force of the GATT agreement in July, 1995. Export prices  for agricultural produce are expected to increase by 10 percent  over the medium-term. Export revenue is expected to increase by  a maximum of $100m a year. This is equivalent to a 5 percent  rise in agricultural exports based on the current $2 billion  worth of agricultural produce exported a year. Hungary has  already met some of the requirements of the GATT agreement,  including abolishing subsidies. Other requirements could be met  without major problems. An analysis of the agricultural  regulations connected with the GATT agreement is expected to be  completed soon. Agricultural subsidies will be calculated  according to GATT standards in next year's budget, with  parliament expected to ratify the GATT agreement this autumn.  This will follow the building in of bilateral and free trade  agreements with the EU, European Free Trade Association (EFTA),  and Central European Free Trade Association (CEFTA) countries.  (Budapest MTI in English 1427 GMT 24 May 94)    ENERGY CONSUMPTION DOWN: Total energy consumption was 383  peta-joules (PJ) in the first four months of 1994, 5 percent  less than in the same period of 1993, preliminary figures from  the State Authority for Energy Management and Energy Safety  show. The lower figure was the result of higher average  temperatures and a fall in industrial energy consumption in the  first four months of this year. Total consumption of electricity  was 12,343 gigawatt hours (GWh) in the first four months, 3  percent down on the same period of 1993. In the same period,  total available energy sources were 386.0 PJ, 0.5 percent down  on the same period of last year. Of the total, 197.0 PJ came  from domestic production and 189.0 PJ from imports. The  proportion of domestic sources was 2.7 percent less than in the  first four months of 1993. The proportion of coal and other  coal derivatives fell from 16.2 percent (62.9 PJ) in  January-April 1993 to 14.8 percent (57.2PJ) in the same period  of this year, while that of oil and gas grew from 66.9 percent  (259.6 PJ) to 69.4 percent (266.0 PJ). Energy exports totalled  21.0 PJ in the first four months of 1994, 5 percent more than in  the same period of the last year. The country's total energy  reserves are estimated to have stood at 154 PJ at the end of  this April, 25.2 percent more than a year earlier. (Budapest MTI  in English 1559 GMT 19 May 94)    HIGH DOMESTIC DEMAND: A high demand market has come about in  domestic trade over the last few years, mainly as the result of  import deregulation and expanding enterprise, according to the  Industry and Trade Ministry. Seventy percent of consumer  products can now be imported without any restrictions. In other  areas, such as capital investment goods (fixed assets), the  proportion is even higher. However, the share of foreign  capital in domestic trade is lower than the overall average,  standing at 17 percent. Privatization of domestic trade has  been successful. Over the last few years, the number of legal  commercial enterprises has risen from 2,000 to 27,000, and the  number of private entrepreneurs from 40,000 to 240,000. There  are still 65 commercial firms operating as state companies.  However, 14 of them are under liquidation or have gone  bankrupt. All in all, proprietary and organizational  transformation has yielded significant results: The value of  retail trade in 1993 was HUF1967.4 billion, up 2.8 percent over  the previous year when taking the 121.9 percent retail trade  price index into consideration. The figure is up 25.3 percent  when calculated at current prices. At the end of 1993, there  were 10,700 Hungarian economic organizations in which foreign  investors held a stake; overall foreign investment amounted to  somewhat more than HUF116 billion. (Budapest MTI in English  1148 GMT 24 May 94)    FOREIGN ACCOUNT CHANGES: The government amended the  regulations on the use of forint trade accounts held by  foreigners. As of June 1, non-Hungarians will be able to  convert their forint accounts containing income from payments by  Hungarian importers for foreign goods into foreign currency.  The change is expected to encourage foreign companies to carry  out foreign trade deals in forints and represents a further step  toward the convertibility of the forint. Prior to the current  amendment, foreigners could use their forint accounts only to  buy Hungarian goods or services, including goods for export.  Although non-Hungarians have been able to open forint accounts  for two years, few have in fact done so and the amounts involved  were usually negligible. The alteration of this situation was  the main reason for the government's decision. The Hungarian  National Bank (MNB) and the government consider encouraging  foreigners to hold Hungarian bank accounts, either in foreign  currency or in forints, an important element in the development  of the economy. The government also intends to stimulate the  forint money market and in this respect it is of special  importance that as many foreigners as possible accept forints as  payment. The current government amendment, however, only  affects money transfers related to foreign trade deals and  capital transfers are still subject to foreign exchange  controls. (Budapest MTI in English 1334 GMT 20 May 94)    MINSK-MADE BUS: The first Ikarus bus fitted in Belarus was  recently introduced into Minsk's public transport. Belarus --  due to financial problems and the lack of currency -- had not  been buying buses from Hungary in the previous four years,  although it would need at least 3,000 new buses per year to  renew its present stock. Therefore the Ikarus Rt welcomed  Minsk's decision on setting up an assembly workshop in order to  reduce costs and create jobs. The Hungarian Ikarus Rt and the  Belarusian Amcodor joint-stock concern are planning to assemble  at least 50 Ikarus buses this year. They also intend to  increase the proportion of Belarusian parts fitted into the  buses, expecting it to reach 80 percent in a few years' time.  At present, 70 percent of Minsk's public transport buses bear  the Ikarus emblem. (Budapest MTI in English 0756 GMT 24 May 94)    EBRD LOANS: The European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development (EBRD) has since 1991 approved 15 major Hungarian  projects and three smaller ones, mainly for industrial,  agricultural, and infrastructural development, with a total  value of $642.2 million. Hungary headed the list for the EBRD  loans granted in 1993: Hungarian banks and companies received a  total of 418.3 million European currency units (ECU) (ECU 1 =  approx. $1.15). The first industrial loan approved by the bank  in 1991 was an allotment of ECU 5.1 million to assist in  restructuring one of Hungary's largest printing houses: Petofi  Press of Kecskemet (Central Hungary). The loan has since been  repaid. That same year, the Microsystem Co. -- at that time  considered to be one of the largest private computer technology  firms in Hungary -- received a loan from the EBRD. Microsystem  has since gone bankrupt. In 1992 the EBRD provided assistance  to a total of 30 projects, three of them in Hungary. The most  important of these was the ECU 65.4 million loan to General  Motors for construction of an Opel car assembly plant in  Szentgotthard (western Hungary). The plant is already operating  and is considered one of the largest Hungarian investments of  the last four years. (The total value of investments in the  project was $250 million.) In 1993, the Kner Press Co. of  Gyomro (central Hungary) received a loan of ECU 9.37 million,  and Zalaegerszeg Refrigerating Industry Plc. of south-west  Hungary was granted ECU 4.66 million. The EBRD also approved a  blanket loan through three Hungarian commercial banks totalling  ECU 65 million to develop agricultural ventures. The  revaluation (and the nearly 40 percent increase in equity) of  Egis Pharmaceuticals in Budapest was considered a sensation in  the privatization of Hungarian pharmaceutical companies, as the  EBRD purchased 30 percent of the company's shares at a value of  ECU 26.52 million. The bank purchased shares in Fusion Invest  for ECU 3 million, and assisted the construction firm RZB/CEAL  with a loan of ECU 0.9 million. In addition, it purchased ECU  6.25 million worth of shares in the Hungarian-French owned  Accor-Pannonia Hotel. That same year, the EBRD and the Budapest  Wholesale Market Co. arranged a novel loan agreement, in which  the bank provided a loan of ECU 5.9 million to develop Hungary's  agricultural wholesale trade-center in such a way that the  municipal government agreed to act as guarantor for repayment.  This year, the first EBRD loan was awarded to a  Hungarian-French industrial company -- ECU 3 million -- for its  infrastructure and environmental-protection development  projects. The EBRD is participating as a shareholder in the  Vienna-Budapest motorway construction project by providing  credit, accepting loan guarantees, and acting as the loan  manager. The EBRD also participated in the Hungarian Foreign  Trade Bank's international bond-issue. It was the first  issuance of Hungarian securities abroad in which the state was  not the repurchasing guarantor. In the future, Hungary hopes  that the EBRD will help support the growing number of small and  medium-sized businesses in the country, and assist in the  development of the money-market, mainly by working through the  country's banking sector. Hungarian experts believe a concrete  proving-case for this could be the granting of loans to set up  Eximbank, which is specifically oriented toward boosting  exports, based on a government resolution.

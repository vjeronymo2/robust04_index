			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Volodimir Chakalin: "Konstyantyn Morozov: `I </F> Count on Voter Support'"]    [Text] For some two months, Konstyantyn Morozov did not  meet with journalists. For the first time in two years, he took  a vacation. On 5 December, after finishing his vacation, he  addressed an appeal to the president and the commander in chief  of the Ukrainian Armed Forces requesting permission to resign  from the Armed Forces.    Therefore, he appeared before the audience in civilian  clothes. He was elegant and cheerful. Only his sad eyes showed  what he had lived through since he was dismissed as Ukraine's  first defense minister. In my mind, he is living through a  tragic moment in his life: He was the first to swear allegiance  to Ukraine and has done a lot to help build our independent  Armed Forces, and he could do even more if he were to stay.  However, this is not his personal tragedy but a tragedy of his  colleagues who believed in him and came with him to the Defense  Ministry.    This meeting with the ex-defense minister was organized by  the Association of Students "Hurt." This move is the first  political action of "Hurt." It is symbolic that Konstyantyn  Morozov met with students first: They were the first to support  the independence of Ukraine.    During his meeting with Kiev students, Konstyantyn Morozov  told students about his activities as Ukrainian defense minister  and discussed issues of national security. For more than two  hours, he answered students' questions. Of course, the first  question was: Why did you retire? Morozov said: "I always  answer for all my actions. However, when the government was  dismissed, I understood quite well that the acting Supreme  Council will not nominate me to the post of defense minister  because I opposed our CIS membership. In addition, I had my own  viewpoint on the problems of the Black Sea Fleet. Hence, my  resignation. Our president has approved my step."    Morozov stated that he was pressed by the Cabinet of  Ministers and received written threats from special security  organs. He provided an example of how his attempts to combat  corruption in the Armed Forces were obstructed. For example, a  Cabinet of Ministers decree had established a commercial  structure within a long-range aviation unit. Regular monitoring  of that unit revealed many financial violations and abuses of  the law. The defense minister had issued an order halting the  activities of this commercial structure within the Armed Forces.  However, the new defense minister started his activities by  repealing Morozov's order.    The public asked Konstyantyn Morozov about the fighting  condition of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the nuclear arms  issues, and prospects for restructuring Ukraine's Armed Forces.  The ex-minister confirmed to the audience that the Republic's  nuclear warheads are in a state of combat readiness. Answering  a question on if a civilian should be named defense minister, he  said: "In my opinion, sooner or later Ukraine will have a  civilian defense minister."    Speaking about his plans, Morozov explained that he has  received a lot of proposals from various political parties and  movements to run in the upcoming Supreme Council elections. The  ex-minister has not yet made a final decision to represent a  specific political movement, but he is going to run in Kiev.</p>

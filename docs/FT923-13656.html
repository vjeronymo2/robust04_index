			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Letter: Opera was a fine piece of farce Sir, I have just had a chance to read, belatedly, the criticism of Il Viaggio a Reims, to which Max Loppert audaciously put his name (Arts, July 6). Mr Loppert's admiration for the opera appears to be restricted to its abstract form, that is to say to the 'notes and words' on the page. Perhaps he would have been happier to remain at home reading the libretto and imagining how the opera would be performed in the ideal world. Then his idea of a 'light-as-air comedy' would not have to be 'transmogrified into a tacky hotel caper'. However, it is John Cox's job to transfer a work from the page to three dimensions and it is unfortunate that his endeavours seem to have caused Mr Loppert and his friends so much pain. I find it difficult to believe that Il Viaggio should be construed primarily as a 'vision of human peace, concord and harmony . . .'] While this element is certainly present, much more present is the element of festivity. Mr Loppert winces at its transformation into 'bone-achingly tedious farcical sketches' and suggests that these lacked originality; indeed that the hooped petticoat gag, the St Trinian's schoolgirls in specs with bowls of flowers gag, etc, appear in most operas. I like farce. The rest of the spectators also seemed to like it. I was most of all surprised by the singer's acting ability. How rare it is to see a singer act well and much of the humour came from this quality. As for being one-dimensional, I can only say that the superimposed modern themes were treated with an admirable irony and ambiguity. Punters in need of laughter, refreshment and a purging of the spirit should attend. Mr Loppert should seek out other means. Martin Mills, 6a Benbow Road, London W6 0AG</p>

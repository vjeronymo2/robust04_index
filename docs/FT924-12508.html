			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Smuggled uranium may be bomb-grade GERMAN investigators believe black-market uranium seized last week was weapons-grade material despite claims to the contrary by a minister, Reuter reports from Munich. Prosecutors are awaiting a laboratory analysis of over 2kg of uranium which was seized near Munich on Friday, the second time in a week German police turned up radioactive materials apparently stolen from stocks in the former Soviet bloc. Mr Klaus Topfer, environment minister, said at the weekend the Munich uranium was too weak to be used in a nuclear warhead. Scientists have said at least 20kg was needed for a bomb. The Munich chief prosecutor, Mr Heinz Stocker, told reporters he hoped to have a final analysis of the uranium by late this week. Uranium 235, one isotope of uranium, must be concentrated to be used as an explosive or as fuel for a nuclear reactor. Prosecutors said they were still uncertain about where the uranium had come from. Seven people were detained across southern Germany at the time, including two Czechoslovak nationals.</p>

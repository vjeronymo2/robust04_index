			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Obstacle to airline plan removed Canada's competition watchdog yesterday removed a key obstacle to the proposed alliance between Canadian Airlines International and American Airlines by allowing the Canadian carrier to pull out of a computerised reservations system which it shares with Air Canada, its chief rival. The competition tribunal gave the airlines a last opportunity to negotiate the dissolution of their partnership in the Gemini network. But if they fail to agree by December 8, a procedure spelt out by the tribunal will be applied. Under this arrangement, the partnership would be terminated in November 1994. Covia, a unit of United Airlines, is also a shareholder in Gemini. AMR, American Airlines' parent company, has proposed injecting CDollars 246m into Canadian, in return for a one-third equity stake. A key condition of the deal is that Canadian move from the Gemini reservation system to AMR's Sabre network. Air Canada and Covia have strongly resisted Canadian's efforts to withdraw from Gemini, arguing that such a move would leave Sabre with a virtual monopoly of Canadian airline reservations. As an alternative to the AMR deal, Air Canada has proposed buying Canadian's overseas routes and leaving the Calgary-based airline as an exclusively North American carrier.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Taiwan will be anxiously watching South Africa's  first multiracial votes next week, knowing they can mark the end  of Taipei's relations with its biggest diplomatic partner.  South Africa is the largest of the 29 nations that recognize  the Republic of China on Taiwan.    Mainland China has said it wants to establish relations with  Pretoria once South Africa holds all-race elections on 26 to 28  April. On Tuesday, Taipei's semi-official Central News Agency  said President Li Teng-hui will attend the inauguration of the  new South African president on 10 May. Tu Lin, director of the  ROC [Republic of China] Foreign Ministry's African Affairs  Department said Taipei is trying its hardest to maintain its  relations with the future South Africa. Nelson Mandela's  African National Congress [ANC] is widely expected to play a  major role in any new South African government. The ANC has  also said it wants to normalize ties with Peking, and the South  African embassy in Taipei is not sure what is going to happen.</p>

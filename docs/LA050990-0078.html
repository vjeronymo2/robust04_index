			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FIELDER HOMERS, TIGERS LOSE AGAIN  </P> <P> The Detroit Tigers, desperately in need of a right-handed power hitter after  winning only 59 games last season, lured Cecil Fielder back from Japan.  </P> <P> Fielder, who spent parts of four seasons with Toronto, hit 38 home runs in 106  games. The Tigers are paying him $3 million for two years.  </P> <P> Although Fielder appears to be earning his pay, the Tigers are still losing  most of the time.  </P> <P> Fielder improved his major league leads to 12 home runs and 28 runs batted in  Tuesday night at Milwaukee, but the Tigers lost to Milwaukee, 7-5. The Tigers  have won only nine of 28 games.  </P> <P> Rob Deer and Paul Molitor hit home runs, and the Brewers (16-8) increased their  lead in the East to two games.  </P> <P> Fielder's home run in the second inning gave the Tigers a short-lived lead.  </P> <P> "The year I spent in Japan was awesome," Fielder said. "I didn't have to press  like I did when I was with the Blue Jays and being platooned. I knew I would be  there no matter what. I'm a relaxed player now."  </P> <P> Manager Sparky Anderson expects Fielder to hit at least 30 home runs.  </P> <P> "He does have confidence after that year at Japan," Anderson said. "The way he  hits the ball to right-center, they can't hold him under 30.  </P> <P> "He's going to strike out a lot. One thing I like about him is that he'll keep  swinging. He doesn't let strikeouts bother him."  </P> <P> Kansas City 10, Texas 5 -- Nolan Ryan went into this game at Arlington, Tex.,  with a 4-1 record, and American League hitters were batting only .150 against  him. But Gerald Perry's first grand slam led to the earliest departure by the  43-year-old right-hander in five years.  </P> <P> Ryan retired only two batters. He gave up three hits, six runs and walked four.  In his previous outing, Ryan gave up five runs in the first inning. Before that  he won his first four starts.  </P> <P> "It was the best I warmed up all year, but I couldn't throw my fastball for  strikes," Ryan said. "It's disappointing not to do your job."  </P> <P> Ryan still needs six victories for 300 in his career.  </P> <P> The Royals' Mark Gubicza ended a four-game losing streak, giving up four runs  in seven innings.  </P> <P> Oakland 5, New York 0 -- The Athletics, after winning the World Series last  year, really didn't need much. But when Storm Davis signed as a free agent with  Kansas City, management decided another starting pitcher was needed.  </P> <P> They picked up Scott Sanderson, a 33-year-old right-hander who became a free  agent after an 11-9 record with the Chicago Cubs.  </P> <P> Sanderson improved his record to 4-1 with a strong performance at Oakland. He  gave up six hits in 6 1/3 innings, and Gene Nelson retired the last eight  batters to get his second save.  </P> <P> Mark McGwire, who had been hitless in 18 at-bats, singled in two runs in the  first inning and the Athletics went on to improve their record to 20-6 with  their eighth victory in nine games.  </P> <P> The Yankees are 2-11 against right-handers.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Toronto 1 -- Ron Kittle hit two home runs, and relief pitcher Bobby  Thigpen worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth inning at Toronto.  </P> <P> John Cerutti retired the first two Chicago batters on two pitches. But he  walked the next batter and Kittle hit a home run. The White Sox have outscored  their opponents, 25-2, in the first inning of their 23 games.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays loaded the bases in the eighth and Thigpen took over. He struck  out pinch-hitter Junior Felix and John Olerud and disposed of Rance Mulliniks  on a fly ball. Thigpen breezed through the ninth for his seventh save.  </P> <P> Minnesota 6, Cleveland 5 -- Gary Gaetti singled home the tiebreaking run in the  seventh inning at Minneapolis after the Twins overcame a five-run deficit.  </P> <P> Reliever Juan Berenguer (2-0) held the Indians hitless for 3 2/3 innings and  Rick Aguilera pitched a perfect ninth for his sixth save.  </P> <P> Seattle 2, Boston 1 -- Harold Reynolds doubled home the winning run with one  out in the ninth inning at Seattle.  </P> <P> Bill Swift (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the victory.  </P></p>

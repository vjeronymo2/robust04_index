			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Shooting breaks out in Angola as tension mounts HEAVY SHOOTING erupted in the Angolan capital Luanda yesterday as tension mounted between anti-riot police and armed soldiers of Unita, the rebel movement defeated in the country's first democratic elections. The shooting caused panic in the city centre and raised fears of a violent showdown between the government and Unita, which has alleged that the elections were fraudulent. The gunfire came hours after a car bomb exploded at dawn near the Turismo hotel where several senior Unita officials were staying. The bomb blasted out windows as high as the sixth floor. At least two civilians were killed, apparently caught in crossfire, and several people were injured. Anti-riot police in flak jackets set up roadblocks across Luanda. The international airport was cordoned off but later reopened. The incidents occurred as a United Nations Security Council crisis mission arrived in Luanda to help salvage the Angolan peace process. The team flew on to hold talks with Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, in his southern stronghold of Huambo. In four separate areas of Luanda, Unita soldiers fired machine-guns and grenades at police. Shooting was most intense in a piazza in the city centre where the car bomb had exploded. After the car bomb blast, Unita troops took hostage 12 anti-riot policemen. They were later released in a UN-arranged exchange for 35 Unita party militants arrested by the ruling MPLA before the elections. A Unita soldier was injured by shots fired from a passing car outside the hotel where the bomb exploded. Other clashes took place in the suburbs of Rosa Pinto and Gamek, near the UN compound. A ceasefire was agreed later in the day and UN officials stepped in to calm tempers. About 50 Unita soldiers were arrested. The shooting reflects rising tension before the announcement of final election results expected today or tomorrow. Mr Savimbi has alleged massive electoral fraud but election investigators have so far found evidence only of irregularities and mistakes. These, they say, are largely explained by the ignorance of officials carrying out democratic elections for the first time in a war-shattered country the size of France, Spain and Germany combined.</p>

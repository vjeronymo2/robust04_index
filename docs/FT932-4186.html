			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Amersham Intl advances to Pounds 26.3m - Management culture more attuned to focused customer base AMERSHAM International, the health science group based on the handling of radioactive substances, increased profits by 27 per cent in the year to March 31 as higher margin business accounted for an increased part of sales. Mr Bill Castell, chief executive, said the group had made progress towards changing a management culture that had been 'cynical and reactive' to one more attuned to developing specific markets and a focused customer base. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 26.3m on sales of Pounds 269m (Pounds 274m). Earnings grew 28 per cent to 30.4p (23.7p) and the proposed final dividend of 9.5p raises the total by 8 per cent to 13.5p. Life sciences - the largest division which sells reagents to medical and pharmaceutical research establishments - produced sales of Pounds 98.9m (Pounds 92.7m) and operating profits of Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 20.9m) after a 24 per cent increase in research and development spending. Growth in the US and the UK contrasted with flat markets in continental Europe and Japan. Healthcare, which is dominated by low margin generic products, produced sales of Pounds 95m (Pounds 83.8m) and operating profits of Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 100,000m). Ceretec, used in brain scanning and one of the three proprietary developments which could transform the division's fortunes, continued its rapid growth, with sales of Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 14m). Metastron, used in handling prosthetic cancer, and Myoview, used in cardiac imaging, are behind Ceretec but in the launch phase. The industrial quality and safety assurance division, which provides services like non-destructive testing of aircraft wings, produced operating profits of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 4.6m) on sales of Pounds 43.8m. The group moved from a small net debt position to net cash of Pounds 2.6m. Cash flow was strong - Pounds 23.6m before investment in fixed assets, acquisitions and restructuring costs. COMMENT Amersham International has transformed itself from a company led by scientists to a management exploiting its science base. Previous errors in currency hedging and product development have been corrected. Indeed, the new hedging regime means that Amersham did not see the benefit of devaluation at all last year. This year, however, the fall in the pound will increase profits by about Pounds 8m. Joint marketing of its healthcare products, such as the co-promotion of Metastron with Zeneca, allows the company to use the heavyweight sales forces of larger healthcare companies to open up new markets. Profits should reach Pounds 40m this year, putting a strong recovery stock back to a market rating, which looks cheap. Yet the management is running a complex portfolio and there must be concern that they can keep all of the plates spinning. On current form, however, they deserve the benefit of the doubt.</p>

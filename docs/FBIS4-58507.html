			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Transport and Communications </F> Minister Dr. Ahmad Murtada Ahmad by Ra'd Abu-Kamil: "Continuous  Engineering and Technical Efforts To Pinpoint and Solve  Telephone Problems"; first five paragraphs are AL-THAWRAH  introduction]    [Excerpts] There has been a great deal of talk about the 14  Tammuz (al-Talibiyah) Switchboard, but the reality is different.  Exaggerated issues were raised and written about regarding the  switchboard after it was rebuilt and put into operation. True,  there are some problems with the operation of the switchboard.  The communication departments and officials assume  responsibility for this. But most of the problems are  essentially due to the difficult conditions through which our  struggling country is passing, such as the unfair economic  embargo imposed on Iraq, which has caused the suspension of all  imports. Other problems are due to the subscribers themselves.    Still, communication department officials have not stood  with  their hands tied. These strugglers have accomplished brilliant  creative feats that we highly respect. They represent new  technological creativity in very complex fields. The engineers  and technicians of the Communications Ministry displayed skills  worthy of every Iraqi's pride.    The instructions of struggler leader President Saddam  Husayn,  may God preserve and protect him, on Iraqi prudence and  creativity have had a great effect in prompting the strugglers  of the Ministry of Transport and Communications to be creative  regarding the switchboards and communications equipment in the  country. They creatively cannibalized some parts and modified  others to help restore most communication systems in the country.    Regarding the 14 Tammuz Switchboard, we heard many  complaints  after the announcement of the rehabilitation of the switchboard.  The general complaint is that there is no dial tone in the  phones. Others say telephones are often disrupted.    To learn about this and to learn the truth about the matter,  to obtain more practical details on how the switchboard  operates, and to learn about the measures taken by the Ministry  of Transport and Communications and about the minister's  personal interest in the subject, AL-THAWRAH conducted this  interview with Dr. Ahmad Murtada Ahmad, Transport and  Communications Minister. We also accompanied him on a field  tour of the switchboard.    Dr. Ahmad Murtada Ahmad began the interview by saying: The  previous switchboard, that is the 14 Tammuz Switchboard, was a  crossbar type with a capacity of 20,000 lines. It was  commissioned in 1976 and was not expandable. That switchboard,  along with several other targets -- communication centers,  switchboards, and microwave and coaxial stations -- came under  enemy attack during the unfair 30-state aggression. The  switchboard and its annexes were completely destroyed    The minister continued: The switchboard was rebuilt in two  phases: first, the switchboard's building was reconstructed;  second, an electronic switchboard was constructed in two months  and put into operation on 23 November 1993 with a capacity of  27,000 lines and the possibility of further expansion. This  electronic switchboard replaced the old switchboard which, as we  said, was totally destroyed. Intensive efforts were made by  ministry teams, which worked day and night to reconstruct this  switchboard.    I told the minister: Let us begin from this point. How was  the switchboard reconstructed and operated?    [Murtada Ahmad] Engineers, technicians, and workers in all  departments of the Ministry of Communications launched a  struggle campaign to confront the unfair economic conditions  facing our struggler country due to the odious blockade. They  rolled up their sleeves and, guided by the instructions of  struggler leader President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve and  protect him, turned his instructions on Iraqi prudence and  creativity into reality. They relied on repairing and modifying  destroyed equipment and adding their own skills in this field.  Thus the switchboard was finally installed by an unusual  process, due to the lack of proper equipment. This situation  resulted in some disruptions during the modification process.    [Abu-Kamil] So, some disruptions occurred during the  modification process due to lack of proper equipment. Hence the  delay in operating some of the telephone lines?    [Murtada Ahmad] Yes. But there are other reasons that  delayed the operation of several other telephone lines, such as  faulty cables and wires in the telephone network, which was out  of use for more than three years; loss of a great deal of  information about subscribers; transferring telephones to new  addresses, and faults in the subscribers' own telephone  equipment. Despite all that, some 18,750 telephones have been  been restored to service.    [Abu-Kamil] You said some unusual processes were used to  activate the switchboard, due to the circumstances of the  blockade. What are the usual processes followed in operating  electronic switchboards and how did you circumvent these  processes?    [Murtada Ahmad] The usual processes followed in installing  and operating electronic switchboards essentially depend on  subjecting new equipment to quality control tests for a period  of time to prove they are functioning well before installing  them in switchboard centers, in order to forestall any  subsequent problems. When we rebuilt the 14 Tammuz Switchboard,  we did not have new equipment to use in the switchboard. We  also did not have the equipment to carry out quality control  tests. We had to resort to other methods, such as obtaining  equipment and parts by repairing or modifying damaged or  destroyed equipment. This led to the emergence of the problems  during the actual operation of the switchboard. The ministry's  team of engineers and technicians are making extraordinary  efforts to pinpoint and resolve these problems. Efforts are  being made to provide better telephone service, despite the  circumstances of the blockade and the lack of necessary spare  parts. [passage omitted]    After this interview, I accompanied the minister to the 14  Tammuz Switchboard. It was around 2200 hours at night. The  visit to the switchboard was not included in the program of my  meeting with the minister. However, the minister asked me to  accompany him in order to watch the switchboard at work.  [passage omitted]    The minister ran through the daily record of complaints from  subscribers and checked the number of telephones that were  repaired. Then he personally called the telephone users that  were actually repaired that day. He selected 10 telephone  numbers at random and began calling them to make sure that the  repair work had been done. He spoke to subscribers and asked  about service in general. After making sure that those  telephones had indeed been repaired and restored to service, he  met with the employees and issued his instructions on providing  the best service to subscribers. The minister checked the work  of the switchboard and its employees. He was told employees had  worked day and night for several days.    Our visit to the switchboard was on 9 April 1994. On that  day, 450 complaints were recorded and 350 of them were dealt  with by 2300 hours. [passage omitted]</p>

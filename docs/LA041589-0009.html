			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESERVATION OF OLVERA STREET  </P> <P> The commentary by Vivien Bonzo, president of the Olvera Street Merchants Assn.  (OSMA), regarding the merchants' concerns related to the proposed development  reminds me of the civic leader who would expound vociferously that all children  in his town should have shoes but deliberately omitted saying that the shoes  would be made in his factory.  </P> <P> A point that is never revealed in the Olvera Street issue is that OSMA  instigated and brought about the Molina bill. AB 1955 is the legislation that  established law and the requirement for Los Angeles to accept bids on that  portion of El Pueblo known as Olvera Street. Ironically, this is what is  threatening the merchants.  </P> <P> It was interesting to see that Ms. Bonzo has admitted that "Olvera Street  belongs to all the people." It should be made known to her that all the people  are the millions of residents of Los Angeles, and not just the few merchants  who have attempted to control and manage the street during her tenure. It has  been the attitude of OSMA members that only they know what is best for Olvera  Street.  </P> <P> The merchants of Olvera Street are divided. There are a few who follow OSMA.  Another group formed, the Business Leadership of Olvera Street (BLO) -- our  group includes both large and small merchants. The third group are the  merchants who are standing by to see what happens.  </P> <P> OSMA is not the only group concerned with the effect of big money, overzealous  developers, and special interests changing the face of Olvera Street. BLO was  established to promote the advancement of Olvera Street and to preserve its  history and culture. Councilman Alatorre points this out in his view and  relates reality when he states, "While we endeavor to sustain the participation  of many merchants whose businesses are an integral part of the street, we must  create an economic package to furnish the capital needed to renovate and  revitalize the street."  </P> <P> PETER MARTINEZ  </P> <P> President, BLO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Citicorp Canada president to retire MR RICK COPELAND, president of Citicorp's Canadian subsidiary, is taking early retirement, apparently as a result of the bank's large exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Toronto-based developer. A Citibank spokesman said Mr Copeland was leaving 'to pursue other interests'. He will remain until a successor is named. Sources within the bank said staff had been given the news earlier by Mr Copeland's New York-based superior, Mr Alan McDonald. Citibank Canada has an exposure to O&amp;Y, both in its own capacity and as an agent, totalling about CDollars 800m (USDollars 666.6m). Citicorp's operations in other countries have also been heavy lenders to troubled real estate developers, including the UK property group, Mountleigh, which collapsed last week. Citibank Canada is the second largest foreign-owned bank in Canada, with assets of CDollars 5.5bn on January 31. However, even before the O&amp;Y problems, its performance had been lacklustre. The bank earned CDollars 5.1m in the first quarter, giving a return on equity of only 4.2 per cent. The full extent of losses from O&amp;Y is likely to be more apparent in results for the second quarter, which ended on April 30. Citicorp said in a recent submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission it had written off USDollars 101m of loans to O&amp;Y and classified the remaining USDollars 279m as non-performing. Mr Copeland, 50, has worked for Citicorp since he graduated in 1967.</p>

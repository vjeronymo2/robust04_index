			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Control over the  expansion of credits will continue even though the financial  situation nationwide is stable, a People's Bank of China [PBC]  official said today.    This decision of the central bank was taken in view of  soaring prices, said Vice-President Dai Xianglong of the bank.    As some state-owned enterprises are facing increasing  financial difficulties, banks will extend loans for operational  funds on a case-to-case basis while continuing to tighten the  control over investment in fixed assets, Dai added.    Speaking at a national conference now in session here, the  bank official described China's financial situation as  "generally good" while "problems do exist."    By the end of March, he noted, three billion yuan had been  withdrawn from circulation in the spring festival shopping  spree, meaning that the total amount of newly issued bank notes  in circulation was 25 billion yuan less than a year ago.    In the first quarter of this year, savings deposits by urban  and rural residents throughout the country was 117 billion yuan  more than the same 1993 period. Bank deposits by enterprises  last month was 26 billion yuan more.    Also in the first quarter, banks and rural credit  cooperatives extended an additional 15.7 billion yuan in  agricultural loans, 3.8 billion yuan more than a year ago. Key  construction projects "have had better-than-expected access to  funds," he said.    Meanwhile, the PBC vice-president warned that investment in  fixed assets, taken as a whole, was still "too large" and  inflation "was showing no sign of improvement."    "We must remain cool-headed," he said, asserting that the  central bank would continue focusing on stabilizing the currency  to ensure "an appropriate rate of economic growth."</p>

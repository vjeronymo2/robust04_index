			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Square D defers annual meeting a second time SQUARE D, the Illinois electrical equipment maker that is fighting off a takeover bid by France's Groupe Schneider, yesterday postponed its annual meeting for a second time. The meeting is now scheduled for June 21, rather than May 24. The company said the meeting was rescheduled 'so that the substantial legal issues surrounding Schneider's offer and related proxy solicitation can be resolved and shareholders can be informed.' It also set a record date of May 23. A record date is the deadline for those who want to vote at the annual meeting to acquire shares. In addition, Square D said it had agreed to a request from Schneider that it put back a hearing date before the US District Court of the Southern District of New York on its allegations that Schneider's slate of nominees for the board of directors would violate US anti-trust laws. The hearing, originally scheduled for May 9 was fixed instead for May 16, or such other date as the court decided, the company said. Another federal court hearing, set for May 13, will weigh Square D's claims that Schneider has violated confidentiality agreements with it.</p>

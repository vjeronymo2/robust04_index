			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa met  this evening with leader of the North Somalia National Movement  'Abd-al- Rahman Nur and the delegation accompanying him  currently visiting Cairo. Nur said that they discussed the  situation, particularly in northern Somalia.    He said that the delegation is working for rapprochement  between the north and south, despite the fact that there are  elements that are calling for division. He noted that the  delegation asked for the postponement of the reconciliation  conference, which was scheduled to be held in Nairobi at the end  of this month, to have sufficient time to explain the current  situation in northern Somalia. He explained that all the  factions that have been contacted have approved the postponement.    He affirmed that Egypt is playing an important role to  achieve national reconciliation in view of its good relations  with Somalia. Most factions have total confidence in the  Egyptian role and hope that the Egyptian efforts to achieve  national reconciliation in Somalia will succeed.    Foreign Minister Musa reaffirmed Egypt's position on Somalia  and emphasized the importance of achieving national  reconciliation and a solution based on the Addis Ababa  resolutions that will protect the interests of all parties.</p>

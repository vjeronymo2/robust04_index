			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (7): Why what you see is not what you get - Forward pricing Martin MacConnol Nobody enjoys buying goods 'sight unseen' - which explains why some aspiring investors are deterred by the forward-pricing system most unit trust funds now adopt. Forward pricing means that what you see is not what you get. If you are buying or selling units today, you will not receive the price listed in the current FT for forward-priced units (denoted by an 'F' in the listings). Instead, the price you will receive is determined by the next valuation of the fund after you place your order (most unit trusts value their units once a day). All this has the immediate look of a system which probably helps the fund manager but not the investor. For instance, if you spot a rising market and wish to buy into it, your money will get you less than you might have hoped for - since you will only receive units at the rate of the next valuation. Similarly, if your units are going through the floor, they will have sunk even further by the time you sell - because, again, their worth is determined at the next valuation. So why do most unit trusts use forward pricing, rather than the alternative 'What you see is what you get' historic system (denoted by an 'H' in the FT listings)? Forward pricing gives existing investors more security. On any one day, only a small minority of people are likely to be either buying or selling units in a particular unit trust. Most will still have their money in the pot, and it is their interests the fund manager is thinking about first and foremost. With historic pricing, the assumption is that, on any given day, the fund manager should be able to buy or sell units at the price listed in that day's paper - ie, at yesterday's price. But prices move, and if the fund manager is committed to historic pricing it could cost the overall fund to pay yesterday's value for units. Fund managers are confident that forward pricing is the more realistic way of valuing units. You can even insist on having units forward priced by those funds which still use the historic system. For some people, forward pricing simply contributes to the confusion that surrounds unit trusts; and much is being done to make them more comprehensible to the ordinary investor. Newspapers are no longer required to publish the cancellation price (the lowest price at which the fund will buy back your units). Also, the prices at which you can buy and sell units are now listed clearly as 'buying' and 'selling' prices in the FT, instead of under the old-fashioned and oblique 'bid/offer' titles. Next year, even this refinement is likely to be superseded. It is expected that unit trusts will be given a single price that refers to both buying and selling, in a further attempt to make them easier to understand.</p>

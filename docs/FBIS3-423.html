			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   Call for International Mediation Welcome -- Johannesburg THE  CITIZEN in English on 4 March in its page-6 editorial welcomes  Mangosuthu Buthelezi's call for international mediation to  resolve the constitutional impasse. "To our mind, the  government should accept mediation, and the ANC [African  National Congress] should consider delaying the election for a  short period" to achieve an inclusive settlement.  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Right Wing `Myopic Blunder' To Withdraw Election  Registration  -- "The Afrikaner Volksfront's [National Front -- AVF] decision  to overrule the grouping's provisional registration for next  month's election is a myopic blunder which could have grave  consequences both for South Africa and the right-wing cause  itself," notes a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in  English on 7 March. By repudiating Viljoen, "the AVF has shown  that it is a deeply divided organisation. It has done further  harm to its cause by implicitly dissociating itself from the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party], which registered provisionally for the  election only a couple of hours before Viljoen." "History is  likely to judge the AVF's decision to opt for the boycott route  harshly. Had the Freedom Alliance contested the election as an  electoral alliance -- an option which Viljoen made possible by  registering the AVF as the Freedom Front -- it might have  succeeded in forcing the NP [National Front] into third place  after the ANC and itself. As the second most powerful bloc in  the new parliament, the alliance would have been in a strong  position to advance its cause within the new constitution."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Warning Against Government-Business Cooperation -- "Tokyo  Sexwale's call for a `chorus of advice' from the business  community is welcome evidence that the ANC has no doubts that  government and business must co-operate if South Africa is to  manage the rapid economic development we need," notes a page-8  editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 7 March.  "But Sexwale and his party must be alive to the danger of that  `chorus of advice' degenerating into self-interest lobbying."  BUSINESS DAY points out that the National Party held regular  talks with business which resulted in a relationship "that  relied on political favours, the distortions of protectionism,  secret loans and so on. It was a relationship that allowed many  businesses to hide behind incomplete disclosure, which was  regularly justified as being `in the national interest'."  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   Mandela-Buthelezi Meeting Emits `Conflicting Signals' --  Cape  Town CAPE TIMES in English on 3 March in a page-8 editorial  finds it "difficult to read" the meeting between Nelson Mandela  and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi "amid the  welter of apparently conflicting signals going out to the world,  with Chief Buthelezi one minute appearing to entertain the idea  of Inkatha registering as a party and contesting the election --  and the next minute preaching an alarming, explosive brand of  Zulu nationalism and insisting that failure to recognise the  sovereignty of the kingdom of kwaZulu would have dire  consequences in `Zulu anger'."</p>

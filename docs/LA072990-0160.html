			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAMS WALKS OUT OF CAMP  </P> <P> Defensive lineman Lee Williams, a two-time Pro Bowl starter who led the AFC in  sacks last season, walked out of Charger training camp Saturday morning in a  dispute over what his agent contends was a team promise to renegotiate his  contract.  </P> <P> Williams and his agent, Steve Feldman of Newport Beach, took the action after a  meeting earlier in the morning with Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard in  which Beathard said he told them he would not renegotiate at this time, if at  all.  </P> <P> Williams has three years remaining on a five-year deal signed before the 1988  season. The agreement will pay him approximately $700,000 this year, sources  said.  </P> <P> "I don't think we're in a position that we owe an apology for this contract,"  Beathard said. "He is making a lot of money."  </P> <P> Feldman, who negotiated the current contract, said Williams is upset because  Beathard will not honor a pledge Feldman said was made to them by Beathard's  predecessor, Steve Ortmayer. Feldman said Ortmayer told them the team would  renegotiate or extend the contract if Williams made two consecutive Pro Bowls,  which he accomplished last season.  </P> <P> Feldman said that he told Beathard of this promise on several occasions over  the past few months and warned him that Williams might take the action he did  Saturday if Beathard did not agree to change the contract.  </P> <P> "They had ample warning," Feldman said. "They knew this could happen."  </P> <P> Beathard said he informed Feldman he would investigate the matter but made no  commitment.  </P> <P> "I told them before minicamp that I didn't know of such a promise," Beathard  said. "I would check to see if there was such a promise. And I find no evidence  of such a promise."  </P> <P> Ortmayer, now an assistant coach with Raiders, said it would be inappropriate  for him to comment since he no longer is with the Chargers. Williams could not  be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Feldman said his position will not change regardless of Beathard's position.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter that Bobby Beathard can't find any evidence of a promise,"  Feldman said. "Lee Williams knows what he was promised. The issue isn't so much  about money. Lee Williams is going to be well paid. He is mad that he was  ignored. He has busted his hump for this team. He was promised something and he  deserves it. He is hurt by this decision."  </P> <P> Williams is in his seventh season with the Chargers. He has started every game  for the past five seasons, except the three during the 1987 players' strike,  the longest such streak on the team.  </P> <P> He led AFC with a 14 sacks last season and his 58 sacks is second on the  Charger all-time list behind Gary Johnson's 67. His 57 sacks over the past five  seasons are the most in the AFC and fourth in the NFL.  </P> <P> "We have a player who obviously came into camp with the idea he was going to go  out of camp," Coach Dan Henning said. "There are some reasons. There is some  background that Bobby needs to get to. There has been a change in the front  office and things that have been said in the past, maybe not in writing, have  to be ironed out."  </P> <P> Williams' walkout is the latest in a series of contract problems between the  Chargers and Feldman, who represents several of the team's most prominent  players.  </P> <P> Two other veteran Feldman clients--cornerback Gill Byrd and free safety Vencie  Glenn--are without contracts. Another Feldman client--first-round draft choice  Junior Seau--is entering the 10th day of his holdout.  </P> <P> Beathard said he did not expect Williams' action to affect talks with Feldman  on other players and that Feldman properly has kept separate talks on each  player. But Henning indicated he was concerned about the team's position  relative to Feldman.  </P> <P> "We have a situation where there is an agent who controls negotiations for a  number of the players who are out," Henning said. "Anywhere else in today's  society, that might be considered a monopoly."  </P> <P> Henning said no decision about whether to fine Williams for his absence has  been made. Buthe doubted that it would have much impact if the team were to  impose the maximum allowable league fine of $1,000 per day. The team also has  the option of sending Williams a letter demanding that he report within five  days or risk being placed on the reserve/left squad list, rendering him  ineligible for the season. Beathard said he informed Williams it was in his  best interest to report to practice.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Outside linebacker Ken Woodard checked himself into Palomar Hospital Friday for  tests after experiencing chest pains, Coach Dan Henning said. Brandon has a  history arythmia, Henning said. . . . There will be no morning practice today.  </P></p>

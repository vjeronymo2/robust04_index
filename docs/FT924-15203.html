			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Observer: Checkout Charlie The most potent symbol of communism has fallen to the epitome of capitalism. On Friday last week Robert Kimmit, the American ambassador to Germany, laid the foundation stone for an American Business Center at Berlin's former Checkpoint Charlie. A Dollars 600m shopping and office centre will rise over the border crossing where US and Soviet tanks confronted each other at the height of the cold war. It is now a barren square, the labyrinthine frontier installations having been torn down after Germany and Berlin were unified in 1990. A Checkpoint Charlie monument will be built nearby. Where once would-be defectors vainly tried to dash through the most famous gap in the Iron Curtain, today's travellers will be going no further than the nearest supermarket aisle.</p>

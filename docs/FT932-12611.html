			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Nation divided by money, power and sentiment THE WILDLY varying referendum results from the Russian Federation show a nation divided by money, power and sentiment. The sentiment was clearly demonstrated in the region around President Boris Yeltsin's home town of Yekaterinburg, where he won his best result - 84.4 per cent support for the question: 'Do you trust the president?'. The angriest response came from Ingushetia, a southern region where he has imposed emergency rule to suppress ethnic strife. Only 2.3 per cent of voters there said they supported him. The other party in that conflict, North Ossetia, which has enjoyed Kremlin support in repelling land claims by the Ingush, produced a healthy 63 per cent 'yes' vote. Elsewhere, the results were determined by whether Mr Yeltsin provided the best deal in terms of local prosperity and power. Nowhere was this clearer than among the Russian Federation's constituent republics, to whom Mr Yeltsin has promised varying degrees of economic and political self-sufficiency. Yakutia-Sakha, which accounts for one sixth of Russia's land mass but less than 1 per cent of the population, produced 67.8 per cent in support. Its conservative but flexible leadership has negotiated substantial rights to local diamond and gold wealth. Mr Yeltsin's support was also high in potentially rich regions like the Tyumen oil-producing area, which produced 58.3 per cent of 'yes' votes and sees its future in continuing reforms and more independence from Moscow. The president can also point to support from industrial regions, where workers have been receiving unlimited wage rises despite many state-owned plants' financial difficulties and falling production. However, the dictum that he has less support in the countryside seems to have been only true in the poorer agricultural regions, where the collective farm boss is still firmly in charge of the minds and hearts of peasants. Mr Yeltsin failed to obtain a majority in regions of the latter category, such as Kursk (42.2 per cent in favour) but he scraped through in richer southern agricultural lands like Rostov province (a 55 per cent majority), where people have been promised precious extra land.</p>

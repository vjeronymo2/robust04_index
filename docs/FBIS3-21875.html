The chief  perpetrators of the gang were sentenced two weeks ago, and now  the dealers lower down on the scale have been sentenced.    The most severe sentence on Tuesday was handed down to Kim  Christian Sjoblom, a 41-year-old Helsinki jeweler. He was  sentenced to five years in prison for possession of over  one-half kilo of heroin. Sjoblom had used some of the substance  himself and had sold some. A certain amount of the substance was  also confiscated from him.    The others receiving sentences on Tuesday were primarily  heroin users. Their sentences varied from four months in prison  to over one year.    According to the court, in 1992-93 Sjoblom trafficked  narcotics that he obtained from an Espoo couple. This couple was  considered to be the primary mover in the case, and they were  sentenced two weeks ago. The man received nine years and his  wife seven years in prison.    According to the court, this gang trafficked a total of 1.7  kilos of heroin. Some of their drugs have been particularly  strong and of good quality. According to Ritva Santavuori, the  city prosecuting attorney, two persons have died because of  overdoses from it.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / West German labour faces real wage cuts WEST GERMAN workers will this year suffer their first real cuts in wages for a decade, according to documents due to be presented to the Bonn cabinet next week. Wage rises are expected to range between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent, while inflation will average 3.5 per cent, the economics ministry says in its official new year forecasts. The leak of the figures, two days before the Bundesbank council is due to consider the country's economic plight, and review - but not change  - its interest rates policy, coincided with the publication of key indicators which showed recession tightening its grip on industry. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, meanwhile, told the European assembly in Strasbourg that he and the government would do everything possible to enable German rates to be reduced. A decision on federal spending cuts would be reached in four weeks at the most, he said. Since the last recession of 1982, pay rises have consistently outstripped increases in living costs. The trend appeared to peak in 1991 when average wages rose 6 per cent and inflation was 3.5 per cent. Last year the consumer prices index rose 4.5 per cent and average wages 5.4 per cent. An interruption of the trend would send a further signal to the Bundesbank that wage-driven inflation could be coming under control. Much depends, however, on public sector pay talks, due to resume today, in which federal, state and local government employees are demanding packages worth up to 5.5 per cent. The employers have so far refused to raise their opening offer of 2.25 per cent. Taken together, Mr Kohl's soothing promise in Strasbourg and the economics ministry forecasts, suggest anything above 3 per cent is out of the question. The economics ministry, meanwhile, reported a 2 per cent drop in industrial production from November to December, and the VDMA engineering industry association said new orders booked during December were 9 per cent lower than a year earlier. Foreign orders were unchanged, while domestic demand slumped 17 per cent, the association said. A breakdown of the economics ministry's production figures showed further strong declines in most sectors except construction. Comparing November and December with the same months of 1991, the ministry said overall industrial production was down by 5.1 per cent. Output in the capital goods and mining sectors fell 10 per cent, while construction rose 5.3 per cent. Solidarity pact deadline, Page 2</p>

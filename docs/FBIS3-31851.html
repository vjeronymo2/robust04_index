The Republic of Macedonia, an independent country and a  member of the United Nations, is deeply interested in  constructing relations and cooperation with all its neighbors on  the basis of good neighborliness and in the interest of peace  and stability in the region. In that sense, we are interested  in a broader development of relations and cooperation with the  neighboring Republic of Greece, which is of multifold interest  to both sides.    For that sake, we are encouraged to do our best to create  conditions for the normalization of our mutual relations in a  principled way and on the basis of equality, as a lasting  interest for both countries, and of a larger significance.    On this occasion, I would like to reiterate our readiness to  sign an agreement with your country guaranteeing the existing  borders between the two countries. If necessary, we are ready  to accept the United Nations or the European Union as guarantors  of this agreement.    We support the idea of resuming a dialogue between our two  countries as soon as possible, without any previous conditions,  on the mutual relations and questions of dissent between us,  including the use of the symbols, the name, and so on. That  dialogue should continue within the framework of the United  Nations and with the mediation of Mr. Cyrus Vance. We are ready  to involve all necessary efforts to reach adequate and mutually  acceptable solutions to the existing problems. Moreover, we  highly appreciate the engagement of the European Union, as well  as the promptness of other international factors, in finding the  best solutions within the framework of the mentioned dialogue.  Therefore, I extend a proposal for a meeting between the  foreign ministers of our two countries in one of the European  capitals, which will function as a dialogue between the two  countries.    Mr. Prime Minister, I would particularly like to express our  concern about the situation created after the measures  undertaken by your government on 16 February this year in  relation to our country. The sustenance and the continuation of  this situation will cause undesired consequences for the peace  and stability in this part of the Balkans, which will  undoubtedly lead us to turn to the Security Council. Moreover,  due to the European dimension of the problem, the engagement of  the CSCE will be indispensable.    I firmly believe that, due to the seriousness of all these  issues and the responsibility we are bearing, a way for their  fast settlement will be found, on a principled and lasting  basis, and in the interests of our two countries and peoples.    With respect,    Kiro Gligorov</p>

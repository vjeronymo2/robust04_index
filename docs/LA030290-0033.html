			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> TRI-VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Moorpark  </P> <P> COACH: David Rhoades, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 15-7; 2nd in league at 10-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: If nothing else, the Musketeers should be a harmonious bunch.  Rhoades, Moorpark's junior varsity coach the past three seasons, is in his  fourth season with several players. Senior right-hander and three-sport athlete  Robert Hernandez (6-3, 190), who was 7-4 with a 3.38 earned-run average and  three saves in '89, and junior right-hander Brad Taylor (5-11, 175), who was  6-1 for the junior varsity, form a solid rotation. Hard-throwing senior Jake  Sepulveda (6-4, 270), a right-handed reliever, "will be my Goose Gossage,"  Rhoades said. Senior left fielder Andy Richter (5-11, 175, .328, four triples)  and senior second baseman Mike Zamrock (5-9, 155), a "get-on-base type guy,"  Rhoades said, are both returning all-league selections. So are senior shortstop  Frank Fernandez (.507) and senior third baseman Tom Uphoff (.397). Both,  however, are academically ineligible and will not return until at least the  season's seventh week. Juniors Chuong Ho and Jim Loosbrock, who batted .400 to  lead the junior varsity, are their replacements. Senior first baseman Mike  Granderson (6-3, 180) is a returning starter. Senior Chris Boyer (5-9, 155),  who platooned at second base last year, will be a utility player. Senior  left-hander Rey Gonzalez, who sat on the bench last year, will see relief duty.  Junior center fielder Greg Burns (5-9, 150) has good speed.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "A lot of our success will depend on our juniors if they can make  adjustments to the varsity," Rhoades said. Moorpark's strength is its pitching  staff, which is better and deeper than others throughout the league.  </P> <P> Oak Park  </P> <P> COACH: Scott Randles, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 8-12; 5th in league at 5-10  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The fact that Randles considers juniors Jason Kane, a  power-hitting second-team all-league center fielder, and shortstop Zach  Sterling, a returning starter, his "team leaders" gives indication of the  Eagles' inexperience. Senior right-hander Ben Feick (6-foot-5) will play first  base and enter as the No. 1 reliever. Left fielder Erik Cass, a returning  starter, is the only other senior. Sophomore right-hander Jeff Gibbons, who  joined the varsity near season's end last year, is the best of an untested  staff, Randles said. Junior third base man Art Kahn, another power threat, and  sophomore second baseman Eric Pryor, a versatile fielder, round out the  infield. Speedy junior Chris Ruhle, a wide receiver on the football team, will  play right field. Junior catcher Tom Watson (5-10, 180), another JV graduate,  is the starting catcher.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "We'll probably get off to a slow start, but I think it will be a  positive experience," Randles said. A third-place finish would rate a  successful season.  </P></p>

Commenting on this, NODONG  SINMUN in a commentary today brands the utterances of Ozawa as a  dangerous aggressive blast that betrays the heinous intention of  the Japanese reactionaries to play the role of a shock brigade  of the imperialists in isolating and stifling our socialism.    The analyst says:    Ozawa tried to create an atmosphere of terror with the  outcries over "a military action" of the DPRK. This may be  termed "a shock propaganda" designed to channel public opinion  to a support to the conversion of Japan into a military power  and its nuclear armament.    No matter how loudly Ozawa may cry over "threat" from the  DPRK, it can convince none of the people who have an unbiased  view of things. The world considers that Japan, with its huge  stockpile of plutonium, can become a nuclear power in a short  time, if it decides to.    Having paved the way for troop dispatch overseas, Japan is  going to embark upon reinvasion in Asia, taking Korea as the  first target. Ozawa's call for examining "a countermeasure" to  cope with "the event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula  revealed the intention of Japan to round off the preparations  for aggression on Korea and move up the date of military action.    The Korean people will never allow anyone to infringe upon  the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and hurl mud at our  system.    The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, mindful  that the conversion of Japan into a military power, its nuclear  armament and a war of aggression would lead them to destruction.</p>

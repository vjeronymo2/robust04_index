			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GLOBAL COMPUTER SET-UP URGED FOR SECURITIES REGULATORS TO FIGHT FRAUD  </P> <P> The new president of a North American securities regulators group said today  she plans to enlist Canada and Mexico in the battle against stock fraud by  linking them to a U.S. enforcement computer network.  </P> <P> "To fight international securities fraud, we will need a truly global system  for spotting and tracking violators," Susan Bryant said at a conference of the  North American Securities Administrators Assn.  </P> <P> "This step will make North America the first continent in the world in which  grass-roots securities regulators will be 'wired together' in order to fight  securities fraud and abuse," she said.  </P> <P> The enforcement computer link-up will be an expansion of the Central  Registration Depository, which contains information on more than 425,000 U.S.  broker-dealers, stockbrokers and other investment promoters.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, U.S., Canadian and Mexican securities officials would be  able instantaneously to share information on new enforcement actions, suspected  investment schemes and illicit promoters.  </P></p>

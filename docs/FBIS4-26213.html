			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Great Strides Seen in Trademark </F> Protection"]    [Text] Chinese chocolate lovers used to be puzzled when  they visited the store and found M &amp; M's, a U.S. brand,  alongside W &amp; W's, a Chinese candy.    Similarly, Readers' Digest, a well-known U.S. magazine, was  shocked when it discovered a popular Chinese periodical with the  same name. And the world-renowned London-based newspaper  Financial Times spotted a newspaper in Beijing using exactly the  same name.    The two Chinese publications were later changed into  "Readers" and "Financial News" as China strengthens the  protection of foreign property rights.    For many foreigners doing business in China, one of the  biggest headaches is protecting their trademarks and patents.  All too often, brand names are stolen or fake products enter  the market, hurting company sales.    Fortunately, overseas companies are happy to see that the  Chinese Government is making great efforts to protect their  property rights.    "The framework of China's laws provides protection which is  as good as that of other Asian countries," said Jingzhou Tao,  lawyer with the Beijing office of the American law firm Coudert  Brothers, which was the first foreign law office allowed to  practice in China.    China has also signed major international conventions in the  area such as the Paris Convention in 1985, the Madrid Agreement  for the International Registration of Marks in 1989, the Berne  Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention in 1992, and  the Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms in  1993.    "Intellectual property protection in China has undeniably  improved throughout the past decade," Tao said. "At least more  and more Chinese people are talking about this issue ."    Meanwhile, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce  (SAIC) has intensified steps to crack down on counterfeiting and  has achieved visible results.    For example, the trademark W &amp; W's, produced by a  factory in  Zhejiang Province, is no longer used.    China now protects not only registered brands, but also  packaging, such as the bottling of cognac.    "However, we should admit that the enhancement [as  published]  of these laws requires much more time than the drafting and  elaboration of the laws themselves," Tao said.    He said the anti-counterfeiting efforts will be more  effective if China imposes tougher punishment on violators.    To prevent fake products, foreign investors should register  their trademarks, patents, software and company names as soon as  they enter China, Tao said.    And before legal action is taken, it may sometimes be more  effective to pursue informal measures such as sending a warning  letter or meeting with an infringer since they may be unaware  they are violating the law, he said.    Victims may also approach the People's Court directly. Some  cities, such as Beijing, have established intellectual property  chambers.</p>

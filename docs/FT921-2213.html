			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Observer: Yellow peril There were worried frowns recently at Thompson Clive Investments, a specialist venture capital investment trust, when a look through its stock exchange yellow book revealed that it was supposed to notify the market about 'any change in the directorate'. So it rushed in a letter about one Stephen Black who resigned last June. Imagine the surprise of the company secretary yesterday when Observer told her that the announcement was running on Topic, the stock exchange information service. 'They shouldn't have done that,' said she - obviously still less than an expert on the ways of the market. 'We were only floated in September 1988, and we're still on the learning curve,' explains director Charles Fitzherbert. Hardly an encouraging message for his shareholders.</p>

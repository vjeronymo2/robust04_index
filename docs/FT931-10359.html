			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Romanians in deal to build 11 BAC 1-11s ROMAERO, Romania's state-owned aircraft manufacturer, has won a contract to make 11 BAC 1-11 jets, from Kiwi International Airlines, a US domestic air carrier. The contract is Romania's first order from a western company for the BAC 1-11 since it began making the medium-to-short haul jets under licence from British Aerospace in 1982, Romaero said yesterday. Romaero, formerly known as IRMA, is to update the BAC 1-11, using components and technical support from British Aerospace, Alenia and Dee Howard, with Rolls-Royce supplying the aircraft's engines. The first delivery is due in November 1994. Kiwi has an option to buy five more BAC 1-11s with delivery by June 1998, Romaero said. The companies have not disclosed the value of the order. Kiwi International, based in Newark, New Jersey, was set up by former employees of Pan-Am, Eastern and Midway airlines. It began operating last September with two leased Boeing 727 jets and flies from Newark to Chicago, Detroit and Orlando, Florida. Romaero said Kiwi planned to use the 104-seater jets to expand its services to Los Angeles and possibly to medium-haul international destinations. The deal is a boost to Romania's ailing aircraft manufacturing industry. The nine BAC 1-11s produced since 1982 at Romaero's Baneasa plant outside Bucharest were sold on the domestic market. But Tarom, Romania's state-owned airline, has switched to foreign manufacturers since the end of communist rule in 1989. It recently took delivery of two Airbus Industrie A-310s and has placed orders for up to 13 Boeing 737-300s. Romaero's other main activity is the manufacture of nine-seater Islander aircraft under licence from Pilatus Britten-Norman, the Isle of Wight-company. Romaero said it had produced around 500 Islanders since 1969, including 11 last year.</p>

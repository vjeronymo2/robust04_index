			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Judy Davis, playing the title role in "Hapgood" at the Ahmanson Theatre, was  forced to leave at the end of the second act Wednesday night because of voice  problems. She replaced by understudy Babbie Green. Davis earlier had received  medical treatment for a throat ailment, and thought she was well enough to  perform, said theatre spokesman Tony Sherwood. "She went on, thought she could  get through it and lost her voice," he said. She missed Thursday's matinee  performance, but was expected to be back on stage Thursday night, Sherwood  said. Davis was the star of the Australian film, "My Brilliant Career."  </P></p>

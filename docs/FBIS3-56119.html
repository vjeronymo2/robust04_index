			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yaroslav Mynko: "Who Will Unite With Whom?"] </F>   [Text] Four political forces prevail in Ukraine's current  social life. The most influential of them is the so-called  'party of power,' represented by presidential structures and a  majority of lawmakers. The possibility to influence the  progress of electoral competition is their privilege. These  people are interested in preserving the current state of things,  which amounts to preserving their legislative seats. I think  that the constituency has had a chance to access the activities  of this group and to feel the effects of the latter over the  last four years. I do not mean only negative phenomena  surrounding us but also genuinely historic events -- the winning  of independence and avoiding armed conflicts. Although, I must  point out that this achievement should not be attributed to our  mutated nomenklatura, because they are rather a result of our  nation's wisdom, perseverance, and natural drive for democracy,  telling to obey the most mediocre governments out of compassion  for the weak and unwise. The current government made promises  and humbly repented for not keeping them, but when it comes to  losing power and dramatically changing their fate, they will  wage an uncompromising war to keep their seats. The merging of  powers has resulted in a situation when every oblast has its  "presidents" and "fuehrers" ready to use their official status  for victory in the elections.    The Socialist Party is another significant political force,  represented by communists who want to separate themselves from  the crimes of the Bolshevik regime and accept existing  realities, including Ukraine's independence. However, this does  not mean that these people have broken the ideals of "real  socialism." Socialists oppose "antipopular reform" and  "capitalist ideology."    Before the reconstitution of the Communist Party of Ukraine,  its members worked within the Socialist Party structures. One  could assume that the two parties would form an electoral bloc,  but following the Communist Party's official registration,  conflicts arose over distributing nominations for candidates.  Then, Socialists made the final decision to refrain from  forming coalitions and decided to participate independently in  the elections.    Still, in the political aspect, the Communist Party remains  a  shadow of the Socialist Party; being not the smallest party in  Ukraine, it does not have a lot of supporters. After some  aggressive statements by its First Secretary Symonenko, the  leadership of the party keeps mysteriously silent, perhaps  having a surprise up their sleeve. One may anticipate that  depending on the results of the elections, Communists will  probably join Socialists or vice versa, disregarding the only  basic discrepancy in their programs. Socialists champion  Ukraine's independence, while Communists oppose it. However,  judging from their fraternization, the similarity of political  views, and traditional habit not to keep promises, new realities  may bring the two parties together.    The electoral bloc of V. Hrynyov's New Ukraine and the Civic  Union led by former Prime Minister Kuchma, also has numerous  supporters. The two parties have absolute accord on the most  crucial issue -- Ukraine can survive only with Russia's  assistance and thus, will continue to be dependent on its  neighbor. This standpoint puts an end to age-old hopes to join  Europe, once voiced by the Ukrainian president. Leonid Kuchma  continues to reiterate his hackneyed phrase that the West will  not welcome us. However, he has never bothered to ask himself  this question: "Why should they?"    Yet, a difference in views on Ukraine's economic development  seems more surprising. Hrynyov advocates deep political and  economic reform on the basis of market relations and private  property, while Kuchma, being the prime minister supported the  preservation of the state-run sector, representing 95 percent of  the Ukrainian economy.    Both parties are primarily represented by hardheaded  technocrats and big enterprise managers disregarding any  psychological peculiarities of the nation. Many of them believe  that patriotism is for fools. For example, Hrynyov treats the  winning of independence as a given fact and not a progressive  phenomenon. In his opinion, Ukraine should become a  multinational state. The trick is that this otherwise perfect  term in the current realities is devised for granting privileges  to Russian culture and Russian mentality. Pragmatists do not  care about Ukraine's rocky path to freedom.    Finally, the fourth force (due to its numeric strength  rather  than political significance) is the People's Rukh of Ukraine.  Its program lists joining the EC, consolidating economic  independence, and a renaissance of Ukrainian culture as the  organization's primary goals. According to Rukh postulates, a  society devoid of national features cannot integrate in world  processes without risk of becoming someone else's appendage. A  renaissance of national culture is a prerequisite, or rather the  only way to join world culture. Without strengthening  patriotism it is impossible to overcome the economic crisis  racking the country. This is not romanticism; this is one of  the most important factors of stability and democracy, which has  been proven by the experience of those European and Asian  countries that have become world leaders with regard to people's  well-being.    The remaining principles promoted by the Rukh coincide with  those of New Ukraine -- the building of a market economy and  equal relations with all states, including Russia.    The chances of political parties and blocs in the upcoming  elections depend not only on the number of their members, but  also on the number of supporters and sympathizers. It is  interesting that out of 450 electoral districts, 300 are urban  districts. It is evident that the future fate of the state will  be determined in those districts.    In Donbass, the south Cisdnieper areas, and a part of  northeastern Ukraine, votes will be divided between the  Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc and socialist-communist candidates.  However, it would be naive to believe that this will grant  anyone absolute domination in the legislature.  National-democratic forces will probably receive support from  central and western Ukrainian oblasts.</p>

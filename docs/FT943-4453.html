			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Second-tier data fail to effect sentiment Wall Street Blue chips retreated yesterday, but technology issues forged ahead in spite of a sagging bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 12.45 off at 3,886.25, near to its worst level of the day. But the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down just 0.90 at 470.96. By the close the Big Board was showing nearly as many rising issues as falls. After Tuesday's sluggish session, New York SE volume picked up to a fairly active 292m shares, even though many investors were taking the day off in observance of Rosh Hashanan, the Jewish new year. In the secondary markets, the Nasdaq composite outperformed other leading indices, climbing 4.80 to 764.28 on the back of a firming trend in technology stocks. The American SE composite managed to add 0.68 at 455.32. The morning brought a smattering of second-tier economic data, none of which had much influence on market sentiment. In a mildly unfavourable development, the Labor Department revised downwards its estimate of the decline in second-quarter non-farm productivity to 2.5 per cent, the largest drop since the first three months of 1989. Meanwhile, the increase in unit labour costs were revised upwards to 3.4 per cent, suggesting stronger inflationary pressures. That news, coupled with higher commodity prices, offered bond traders no encouragement to buy ahead of Friday's keenly awaited producer price data. As a consequence, the long end of the Treasury yield curve suffered moderate losses, with many accounts preferring to stay on the sidelines until after the release of the inflation report. After a static morning, the similar trend was evident among the Dow industrials. The decline was led by DuPont, off Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 58 7/8 , and United Technologies, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 33. In the oil group, Texaco gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 62 1/8 , while Arco jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 106 3/8 . The retailing sector showed a spark of life. Circuit City Stores, a home electronics chain, climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 26 after announcing that sales in outlets opened at least a year had risen 16 per cent last month. The company also forecast a 27 per cent surge in net income in its current fiscal quarter. On the negative side, shares in Jones Apparel dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 23 1/8 on a downgrading by Merrill Lynch. The company's outlook was clouded by the resignation of its president, announced a day earlier. Warner-Lambert, the drugs and consumer products marketer, continued to be buffeted by takeover speculation. Yesterday profit-takers prevailed, pushing it down Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 80 3/4 . The technology sector was the liveliest of a rather lacklustre lot. Stocks across the board were showing solid gains, although analysts were unable to link the improvement to any specific development. In semiconductors, Texas Instruments improved Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 75 1/2 . On the Nasdaq, Lotus Development jumped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 44 1/2 , Cyrix added Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 40 1/8 and Intel appreciated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 66 3/8 . Canada A late afternoon rally on the Toronto market erased more than half of an early fall for the TSE 300 index, which finished a net 8.10 down at 4,339.07 after touching 4,327.43. Declines finally led gains by 399 to 366 after moderate volume of 59.3m shares. An analyst said that besides the traditional September doldrums, the upcoming release of August inflation figures - the US producer price index on Friday and Canada's consumer price index next week - and next Monday's election in Quebec could make for a lacklustre market this week. Nine of the 14 sub-indices were lower, with chemical and forestry shares leading the declines while transportation and conglomerates were the best performers. The golds group built on Tuesday's rise, adding 0.3 per cent as the New York spot bullion price put on USDollars 2 at USDollars 390.25 an ounce. Mexico Shares closed higher in a continuation of the technical rebound that began on Tuesday after eight straight losing sessions. The IPC index moved forward 34.85, or 1.29 per cent, to 2,738.92 as the market ignored a third consecutive weekly rise in the bellwether 28-day cetes - or treasury bill - rates.</p>

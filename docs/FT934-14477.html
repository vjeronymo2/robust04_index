			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ferromet cuts interim loss and plans capital reorganisation FERROMET Group, the USM-quoted metals trader, yesterday revealed a cut in losses on continuing activities for the first half of 1993 and at the same time announced a capital reorganisation. The pre-tax loss fell from Pounds 241,000 to Pounds 81,000. Turnover of continuing activities, Portsmouth Metals and Clogau Nevada, fell from Pounds 820,000 to Pounds 558,000. Administration expenses were trimmed to Pounds 159,000 (Pounds 372,000). Losses per share worked through at 0.04p (0.12p. There is to be a rights issue to raise Pounds 327,129 gross and it is planned to raise a further Pounds 418,595 gross via a share subscription. In the share restructure each existing 1p ordinary share will be converted into one ordinary 0.25p share and a 0.75p deferred share, the latter being effectively valueless. The rights issue of 130.85m new 0.25p shares will follow the capital restructure and will be on the basis of one new 0.25p share for every two 1p shares held. The share subscription will take the form of the issue of 167.44m new 0.25p shares to Bankhill Trustees. Bankhill will then hold 29.9 per cent of the enlarged share capital of Ferromet. The holding will represent 15 per cent on behalf of a trust formed for the benefit of Mr Masoud Amir Alikhani and his immediate family with the 14.9 per cent balance held on behalf of seven Russian investors. Mr Alikhani, who is currently a member of the board of the International Foundation for Privatisation and Foreign Investment in Russia, will be appointed to Ferromet's board.</p>

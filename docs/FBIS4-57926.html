			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- Today, the presidents of  Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela reasserted their  commitment to the integration process of the Andean Group (GRAN)  or Cartagena Agreement on the occasion of its 25th anniversary.    The five presidents expressed their support for the Andean  integration process in separate communiques issued here today by  the Cartagena Agreement Board (JUNAC), the GRAN's technical and  executive body.    Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada stated the  common problems affecting Andean countries are the basic factor  in their unity. He added: "More than ever before, the  challenges and hopes the Andean Group represents still prevail."    Sanchez de Lozada stated: "With our creativity and effort,  we still must strive to achieve a better life for our countries."    His Colombian colleague, Cesar Gaviria, stated on the  occasion of GRAN's 25th anniversary, "we have to rejoice over  the implementation of this idea that has made a great  contribution to the unity of our countries." He added: "Today,  trade is the great force behind economic development,  integration, and the well-being of nations."    Gaviria asserted that in these two and a half decades, GRAN  faced difficulties "because the prevailing protectionist  practices undermined commercial and integration processes."    He added: "Today we hope the Andean Group will develop. We  also hope to establish a common export tariff, although we are  aware this does not constitute a goal in itself but a means for  achieving a free trade zone throughout the entire continent of  the Americas."    Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen stressed the  "integrating tradition" of GRAN members and reasserted his  country's support for "the Andean integration process."    Duran-Ballen stated the Andean Group faces the immediate  challenge of establishing an Andean free trade zone and helping  Andean countries achieve "a level of modernization and  proficiency that will allow them to achieve a definitive and  advantageous presence in the international market."    Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori stated that his country  shares with other Andean countries "a profound integrationist  spirit." Fujimori explained that Peru temporarily withdrew from  GRAN's economic process from August 1992 to April 1994 because  of the serious domestic crisis his country was experiencing.    He added that today, Peru has been able to achieve economic  stability and has reassumed "with great enthusiasm, the noble  task we assumed with our Andean brothers a quarter of a century  ago."    After noting that businessmen were skeptical about the  Andean  Group's success when it was implemented, Rafael Caldera, the  president of Venezuela, which joined the Andean Group 23 years  ago, praised the fact that private business has become the most  important integration force.    Caldera added: "The celebration of the anniversary of one of  the most effective and auspicious Latin American integrationist  movements constitutes an auspicious event not only for its  members but for all developing countries."</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> The image of "little cable cars climbing halfway to the stars" usually conjures  up thoughts of San Francisco, but Orange County can also be colored into that  scenario -- if only from the standpoint of nostalgia.  </P> <P> Until the middle of the century, railway cars were a mainstay of transportation  for county residents, carrying passengers back and forth from outlying areas to  resort communities.  </P> <P> This intricate, interurban system of street cars, dubbed "The Red Cars," kept  Southern California mobile from Santa Monica to Riverside to Newport Beach, and  helped stimulate population growth.  </P> <P> Operated by Pacific Electric Railway Co., the cars ran down the middle of the  street. They were powered by overhead electrical lines and guided by rail  tracks. However, with the advent of the automobile, the Depression and the  federal government giving subsidies for California's freeway system, the  popularity of the system began to wane during the 1930s. By the '60s, it had  altogether disappeared.  </P> <P> But Wednesday at 7 p.m., the old cars will come to life, if only for a little  while, as historian William Myers of Southern California Edison acts as guest  curator at a free lecture and slide show entitled "The Red Car of Orange  County" at the Old Courthouse Museum at 211 W. Santa Ana Blvd., Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The exhibit will run in tandem with a related display, "Street Rail to Light  Rail: California's Trolleys," sponsored by the California State Archives. "The  Red Car of Orange County" is sponsored by the Orange County Historical  Commission, and both exhibits will run through March 26. For more information,  call the Old Courthouse Museum at (714) 834-3703 or (714) 834-5536. DALLAS M.  JACKSON  </P></p>

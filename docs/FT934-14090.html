			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Backbenchers make muted protest THE EXPECTED pre-emptive strike against the threat of further defence cuts was duly launched from the Tory back benches when the two-day defence debate began in the Commons yesterday. But it was more muted than it had been billed. This was not surprising. For one thing, the villain of the piece - namely Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor - had sensibly beaten a tactical retreat to the Treasury for the day. For another, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, was unable to refer directly to the state of his negotiations with the cabinet's EDX committee about the size of his future budget. By giving way to other MPs with unusual alacrity, however, Mr Rifkind did ensure that as many as possible of his Tory colleagues who were opposed to further cuts had their say. Mr Winston Churchill, MP for Davyhulme, called for the Pounds 80bn social security budget to be cut rather than defence. Conservatives had traditionally regarded their 'prime raison d'etre' as the defence of the realm, he said. Mr Cyril Townsend, MP for Bexleyheath, said it would be 'fatal' to chop a further Pounds 1bn from the defence budget, as the Treasury is said to be considering. He was supported by Mr Patrick Cormack, MP for Staffordshire South, who urged Mr Rifkind to resist 'fatuous' proposals such as those for an arbitrary Pounds 1bn cut. Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, a leading member of the Conservative backbench defence committee, asked for an assurance that moves to deploy reserve forces more widely would not be used as an 'excuse' for lowering the quality of training and equipment given to regular forces. Mr Archie Hamilton, the former armed forces minister, called for other departments which used British troops, such as the Foreign Office and the Northern Ireland Office, to be asked to pay for them. Sir Geoffrey Pattie, MP for Chertsey and Walton and non-executive chairman of GEC-Marconi, backed calls for a full defence review. He said that, if the government believed the UK to be no longer capable of sustaining a 'Falklands-type operation on our own', the British people should be told. The first threat of a revolt by Tory backbenchers came from Sir Jerry Wiggin, MP for Weston-super-Mare and a former defence minister. He warned that savage and serious cuts in defence would be questioned by some Tory backbenchers 'very strongly, and probably in the lobby'. For Labour, Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, accused ministers of 'rushing through' the debate because they knew Mr Clarke would announce further cuts in next month's Budget. Mr Clark said a Labour government would keep the Trident missile programme in spite of a vote to scrap it at the party's annual conference in Brighton earlier this month.</p>

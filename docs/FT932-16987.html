			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: AP Moller net profits fall 20% to DKr1.53bn NET PROFITS for AP Moller, the shipping, shipbuilding and oil and gas group, fell by 20 per cent last year to DKr1.53bn (Dollars 246m) from DKr1.92bn in 1991. Pre-tax profits also declined, from DKr2.78bn to Dkr2.29bn. Group turnover, 85 per cent derived from shipping, was down from DKr23.69bn to DKr23.04bn. The group operates more than 150 vessels and several offshore drilling rigs. The preliminary report described world markets at the start of 1993 as 'not encouraging'. There were no indications earnings from shipping would be better than in 1992. Results from oil and gas production will depend on the price of oil, which in the first quarter was about Dollars 18 a barrel, compared with an average price of Dollars 19 in 1992. The profits slide was caused by lower earnings by the shipping business, Tankers &amp; Liners in Partnership, which reported a fall in net profits from DKr1.05bn from Dkr1.51bn in 1991. After allowing for transfers to the partnership from the twin parent companies, D/S af 1912 and D/S Svendborg, the fall in profits was sharper, from DKr1.26bn to DKr478m. The Maersk Line container services achieved a better result than last year but results for tankers, gas carriers, bulk carriers and offshore drilling operations were unfavourable. The report criticised owners of oil cargoes for failing to face up to their responsibility for pollution spills. Pre-tax profits in the oil and gas business, which produce oil and gas from the North Sea through the Danish Underground Consortium, were down from DKr808m to DKr853m on turnover which fell from DKr3.33bn to DKr3.30bn. The dividends in the twin parent companies will remain unchanged.</p>

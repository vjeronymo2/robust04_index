			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Labels to cut back logging Indonesia, one of the world's biggest forestry producers, is to introduce an eco-labelling system for wood products. The move comes in response to criticism from environmentalists about the scale of illegal logging in the country. The scheme, to begin on an experimental basis this year and to become fully operational in 1997, will label all wood products with information about where the wood originated and how it was processed. Although the Indonesian government will be involved in the scheme, Djamaludin Surjohadikusomo, the forestry minister, says he hopes it eventually will be independent of government. It will be headed by Emil Salim, the former environment minister, and non-governmental organisations will be invited to participate. 'The forestry industry needs a sustainable supply,' says Djamaludin, a former forester. 'Without it, the industry will commit suicide.' The government may provide some initial funding, but Djamaludin says he would like to see the scheme financed by the industry or international agencies. The initiative has been welcomed by leading environmental groups. 'The eco-labelling debate is a way of bringing a lot out into the open,' says Suraya Afiff of Walhi, the local branch of Friends of the Earth. Walhi has estimated that illegal logging amounts to as much as 30-40 per cent of the 30 cu m of timber which are officially logged each year. Djamaludin puts it much lower - at 4-6m cu m. Mohammad Hasan, who controls ITCI, one of the country's largest timber companies, and also heads Apkindo, the powerful plywood trade group, says fairness requires that countries producing non-tropical timber should also have eco-labelling schemes.</p>

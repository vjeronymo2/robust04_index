			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: All you need is doves SOME journalists are paid good money to position themselves at the centre of affairs. News-sleuths or feature-hounds, they are expected to be where it is happening, to know what is happening, and to file copy that gleams with immediacy. Then there are the rest of us, a band small in number - journalists such as me (still paid good money, very often better) who are supposed to hang back a bit, fossick at the margins, sleuth in dark corners, ask original questions, ponder and dwell, mull things over, make unexpected journeys, fly in small aircraft, throw frequent but fetching tantrums and filter all we see and hear through the silk-fine mesh of our experience and intellect. It takes all sorts. This week, for example, I have been nowhere near the hustings, in Britain or America. Nothing so predictable. My game is far deeper, my quarry more obscure. For reasons I cannot go into (journalism is a jungle: brutish and predatory), I was briefly in Miami; then briefly in San Juan; then briefly in St Maarten, then briefly somewhere else. Now I am in Miami again. Or somewhere remarkably like it. Rush, rush; scurry, scurry. But I have had odd moments to myself, most of which I have spent delving into a collection of the writings of E B White: wise and witty pieces, most of them quite short, published in The New Yorker between 1927 and 1976. The man I have to thank for introducing me to E B White is the FT books editor, who stopped by my desk recently, said he had a present for me and handed me the volume. Then he went to lunch. E B White is brilliant. On March 26 1955, for example, a piece by him - 'Stock Market Zigzags' - appeared in The New Yorker. It was very short, so I can quote it almost in full, for its pertinence has not dimmed. 'We don't fully subscribe to the bald statement that confidence in this country's economy can be lost in a day', White started. 'There are tangible assets that are not easily wiped out - the soil, the climate, the industrial vigor, the immense spirit of a people who won freedom through revolutionary zeal and are still willing to work for it. And there are intangibles that give the economy fertility and vitality. 'The stock market, which is a sort of horse track without the horses, does not deserve its wide reputation as a barometer. It sometimes sows the hurricane, instead of reporting the breeze. It is naturally flighty . . . But what the market does symbolise, in its nervous way, is the health-giving flexibility of capitalism - the trait that keeps our economy delicately balanced but that makes it a far better servant of the people than the state-driven economies that have hardly any elasticity at all.' So far so good. But then White got to the point. 'The other day', he continued, 'in San Diego, the American economy even adjusted to springtime: work was halted on a Dollars 7m building programme to give a dove time to hatch her eggs. Our confidence in a society that observes this sentimental ritual and practices this fiscal folly cannot be toppled in a day. To talk of peace is not enough; we must hatch the eggs of the dove.' And that was it. A pearl, an emerald. Or so I thought at first, as the orange glow of sunset streaked the horizon and pelicans wheeled. But then I thought: what a beautiful sleight-of-hand. Magician-like, White achieves his purpose - a toot for capitalism - by implying that the eggs of the dove are safer if threatened by a capitalistic building programme than if threatened by a state-driven one. Which is nonsense. So far as I know, there is no particular evidence to indicate that market-driven economies, or democracies, are better at protecting the environment, or other species, than state-driven ones. As a matter of fact, the worst abuses seem to occur when foreign-owned enterprises of a capitalistic nature work hand-in-glove with the corrupt servants of socialist, or centralist, regimes. To see that this is so, all you need do is read Dale Peterson's The Deluge and the Ark, an account of the pressures and deprivations facing many of the world's 180 species of primate. Worldwide, people now consume around 4bn cubic yards of wood annually, enough to build a solid wooden highway to the moon. This is not good for the primates, many of whose habitats are so threatened by the antics of loggers and governments everywhere, and of every political tint, that almost half are declining towards extinction. My thought for the day: beware of stylish journalism. It can lure you into the swamp. E B White: Writings from The New Yorker 1927-1976, Harper Perennial, Pounds 7.99.

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Tantalising prospect of a better diet - Volkswagen An issue exercising at least one of the analysts summoned to Volkswagen headquarters on Thursday is whether there will be asparagus for lunch. Not unrelated, since it governs the prospects for a good lunch and jam tomorrow, is how convincingly the board spells out VW's medium-term earnings outlook. Last year's figures, released last week, showing a DM1.94bn (Pounds 750m) group deficit, 'don't mean anything', according to one invitee. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, is expected to issue a cautious forecast of break-even for this year. But he is likely to wax lyrical on rapidly rising profits thereafter. The board may also clarify the restructuring at Seat, the Spanish subsidiary whose near-collapse has been blamed for last year's earnings slump. VW expects it to be the only one of its marques to remain in the red this year. Although there are hefty doubts about the effects on unit labour costs of the four-day working week currently in effect in Germany, and the overhang of 30,000 surplus employees, analysts appear to have been convinced that new production methods are enough to have turned the tide. Ample portions of asparagus, usual at analysts' meetings traditionally held in May - when the green stuff is in season and cheap - may serve to underpin their belief.</p>

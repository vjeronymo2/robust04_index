			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Pakistan faces big budget hole: Farhan Bokhari looks at the country's revenue and spending books PAKISTAN'S looming cash crunch and fears of slower growth are worrying policy makers as the country prepares for its annual budget on Monday. The fiscal year ending this month is expected to close with one of the highest budget deficits in Pakistan's history. That is expected to be around Rs100bn (Pounds 2.5bn) or over 7 per cent of gross domestic product, up from an earlier projection of Rs65bn or 5 per cent of GDP. According to government estimates, annual growth is expected to drop to just under 4 per cent, down from a target of over 6 per cent. In large part, the fall has been caused by a nearly 25 per cent shortfall in the expected cotton output after floods last year which hit crops in the heart of Pakistan's cotton belt. Output in the agriculture sector is expected to suffer badly. Last year's growth rate of 6.4 per cent in agriculture is expected to drop below 4 per cent, while the sector's overall contribution of 26 per cent to GDP is certain to fall. Cotton production is expected to be about 9m bales, down from the projected 12m bales. As a result, the textile sector has been affected too. One evidence of the importance of cotton is that 58 per cent of last year's exports came directly or indirectly from the crop. 'Reducing the fiscal deficit which means raising more resources and reducing expenditure has emerged as the top priority item for us. If we cannot do this we cannot even sustain the reform programme,' says Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister. Mr Aziz plans to narrow part of the resource gap through taxation of consumption rather than investments, as a way to encourage business expansion while also raising more revenues. This may include higher revenues through a general sales tax and central excise duties on industrial output. However, the minister agrees that there are limitations on the extent to which the division of expenditures can be changed around. Nearly 60 per cent of Pakistan's budget is expected to remain committed to national defence and debt servicing. Mr Aziz hopes that the results of the government's economic reform programme and its privatisation efforts will help compensate for areas where public investment would otherwise be needed, such as creating employment. Despite concerns over the economy, the finance minister expects a rapid turn around and growth rates jumping up to 7.5 per cent, if cotton output recovers next year. One of the issues connected to deficit reduction targets is that of Pakistan's commitments to international financial institutions. Pakistan has recently been negotiating with the International Monetary Fund for a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) loan under an extended structural adjustment facility. In the past, senior officials have said that bringing the deficit down to 5 per cent of GDP, recommended by international donors, would require difficult measures. 'Because we are in a growth situation where we have to make investments in infrastructure and the social sectors, a drastic reduction is not compatible with these two,' says Mr Aziz. I have been trying to convince the IMF that a 1 per cent reduction in the budget deficit is reasonable, otherwise we can't maintain our growth rate.' However, some western economists say, Islamabad will face questions at the next aid-to-Pakistan consortium meeting, due this summer, to explain why it has repeatedly missed its deficit reduction targets for more than three years. But Mr Aziz points first towards higher oil prices during the Gulf war and the effects of international recession, as the key difficulties during this time. But, they also add, the public commitments by the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif to continued economic reforms and privatisation are expected to earn plus points. The recent restoration of his government through a Supreme Court judgment, overturning a dissolution of the elected assembly in a presidential order, is also being seen as a step forward in the democratic process. However, Mr Sharif needs to hold on to power and create an image of stability before economic reforms gain pace, western diplomats add.</p>

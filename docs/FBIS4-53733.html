			<p>BFN     [Text] Chat Phatthana MP for Chiang Rai Mongkhon  Chongsuthamani yesterday threatened to file defamation lawsuits  against the American Embassy and the Foreign Ministry or  Minister Prasong Sunsiri for allegedly linking him with the  narcotics trade.    Mr Mongkhon said before leaving for his home province in the  morning that he would study what legal aspects could be used  against those who damaged his reputation.    He and other Opposition MPs have been angered by reports  that  Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong told last week's Cabinet  meeting that 17 Opposition MPs were suspected by the U.S. of  involvement in illicit drug businesses and that three of them  were denied entry visas to the US.    A Cabinet source quoted Sqn Ldr Prasong as naming Mr  Mongkhon  as one of the three MPs whose visa applications were rejected.    The foreign minister, however, denied that at the Cabinet  meeting he had identified any drug suspects or those whose U.S.  visas were refused.    Mr Mongkhon tearfully told the House on Thursday that he had  never been involved in drug trafficking and had never been told  by the United States Embassy that a visa which was issued to him  in 1991 could not be used now.    The United States Information Services on Friday issued a  statement saying there was "reason to believe" that Mr Mongkhon  was involved in the drugs trade, therefore his visa was denied  under the Immigration and Nationality Act.    According to the statement, the Chiang Rai MP had been told  in writing why he was ineligible for a visa.    Mr Mongkhon, however, repeatedly denied yesterday that he or  anyone at his house had ever received such a letter from the  embassy. There was no evidence to prove the letter had been  sent to his house.    "I was surprised why that letter never reached me although I  have my address here."    He asked the news media to help trace that letter for him.    "The news media should ask for proof (that the letter was  sent to Mr Mongkhon) from the embassy."    According to Mr Mongkhon, the embassy told him the visa  could  not be issued because it needed a few more documents but did not  say anything about suspected drug involvement.    Mr Mongkhon said he could not say whether the embassy was  giving false evidence but wondered why the news had just been  revealed during a time of rising conflict between the Government  and the Opposition.    He said he believed the drug allegations against him were  politically motivated, accusing the Government of trying to get  the upper hand on the Opposition after senators and Opposition  parties turned down its draft constitution amendment bills last  month.    "The embassy should have informed me in February or March  when the visa application was rejected. I do not understand why  everything has just happened now," Mr Mongkhon said.    The Chiang Rai MP said he would hold a press conference  after  meeting party leader Chatchai Chunhawan today. He would also  ask the U.S. embassy why it did not send a letter to him to  advise that his entry visa was denied.    Mr Mongkhon said the fact that he used to be the secretary  of  former agriculture and cooperatives minister Narong Wongwan, who  was alleged to be on the U.S. blacklist of drug suspects should  not be relevant to the drug allegations against him. He  challenged the Government to take legal action against him so he  could prove he was innocent.    The MP, who happened to take the same flight to the northern  province with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, said he might ask  the premier for just treatment.    The Chat Phatthana Party issued a statement saying it would  certainly take tough action against Mr Mongkhon if any criminal  charge filed against him was proven.    The party said that at this stage Mr Mongkhon had not been  charged in the U.S. or Thailand. The visa was denied on  suspicion only.</p>

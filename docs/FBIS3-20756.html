			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by PAD: "`S' on the Elections"] </F>   [Text] Solidarity's National Commission Presidium is of the  opinion that the trade union should not put forth an independent  list of candidates in the coming [June] local elections. The  regional structures will decide on their own how to take part in  the elections.    Piotr Zak, Solidarity spokesman, said, "These opinions  result  from an internal union polling. The regional authorities will  make the final decision because they have the best perception of  the situation. They can support specific people or coalitions,  or create programmatic blocs. We will allow participation in  various coalitions, even in such that group forces ranging from  Union of Labor [social democratic, left point of view] to Union  for Real Politics [laissez faire, free market point of view]."  Zak underscored the fact that the Solidarity trade union is a  attractive partner, having at its disposal almost 2 million  members, a structure of several thousand factory commissions,  and a printing base. He added, "We want groups that emerged from  Solidarity to win in these elections; therefore, the stronger  the local alliances, the greater their chances for success. It  would be inadvisable to give preference to one or two groups."    During the Tuesday (1 February) meeting, the draft of the  state budget was also discussed. Solidarity chief Marian  Krzaklewski said that this was a draft of continuation not of  changes, and, for that reason, Solidarity gives it a negative  mark. The wage regulation that is meant to take the place of the  popiwek (excess wage tax) in the draft budget came under strong  criticism, as an attempt to introduce a manually controlled  economy, said Krzaklewski, adding that "OPZZ [All-Polish Trade  Unions Agreement--the communist government-sponsored trade union  founded in 1984] will claim that it was it that got rid of the  popiwek." In the opinion of the Solidarity chief, the regulation  of wages should be brought about by collective arrangements at  the enterprise level.    According to initial assessments, over 20,000 trade  unionists  are expected to take part in the manifestation scheduled for 9  February in Warsaw. Krzaklewski said, "Participation in the  manifestation is open to all, but, personally, I would not be  pleased if OPZZ activists demonstrated with us." He added that  the Secretariat of the center-right parties has called for  support of the Solidarity manifestation.    The Presidium also agreed to conduct an eight-hour strike in  the defense industry factories this coming Thursday (3 February).</p>

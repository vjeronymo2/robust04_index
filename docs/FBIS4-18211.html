			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italian Institute for Financing </F> Personal and Real Property Sees Resumption of Profitability"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 30 -- Italian company accounts  for 1993 should show some resumption of profitability after the  black year of 1992, according to analysts at the Istituto  Mobiliare Italiano (IMI [Italian Institute for Financing  Personal and Real Property]), the recently privatised corporate  finance and merchant bank.    A report released by the bank's research division suggested  today that, with stable inflation and exchange rates, costs and  prices in the manufacturing sector should hold steady at this  year's levels for the next couple of years.    The IMI study said that, in 1994-95, pre-tax operating  results should come out at about 10 percent for 1994-95. The  study also confirmed a forecast from ISCO [National Institute  for the Study of the Economic Sitation], the short-term economic  analysis unit, of an increase of about 1.3 percent in gross  domestic product this year.    According to IMI, even though industrial activity closed 3  percent down in 1993, this may turn out to have been  underestimated by a number of other research units, which would  put a number of the other projections out of line, making them  too pessimistic.    The IMI study suggested that fixed investments had begun  moving ahead "firmly" and output was increasing, also to rebuild  stocks to the basic minimums. Other important factors were said  to be continued fair weather on the trade account; stronger  domestic demand, and further progressive reductions in interest  rates. All this, said IMI, should enable firms to reduce their  debt.    The study suggested that the biggest winners would be home  appliances, paving tiles, plastic and rubber products, chemical  products for retail sale and, profiting by strong foreign  demand, machine tools and automation and numerical control  equipment.    The sectors which IMI said had failed to profit by the  lira's  devaluation were steel, basic chemicals and fibres, vehicles and  paper products. Car sales, in particular, could only be  expected to pick up when family expenditure does, while the  chemical industry has its old problems plus the world crisis in  the sector to deal with.</p>

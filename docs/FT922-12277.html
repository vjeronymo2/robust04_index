			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / UK Gilts: Conditions set for continued rally THE GILT market looks set to be busy over the next few months, with signs of strong demand from domestic and overseas investors for the large issues of the securities in the pipeline. With the political outlook settled after the Tories' surprise win in the general election, and inflation heading for further falls, the conditions are in place for a continued rally in the market, with a further drop in yields. The main worry for investors is the volume of new gilts to be issued by the Bank of England to pay for rising public borrowing. The Pounds 30bn or so of gilts likely to be made available to investors over the next year will limit the scope for a large drop in yields, putting a lid on any rise in prices. Much the same calculations apply for bonds issued by other European governments. With France and Germany likely to issue large amounts of securities over the next two years to finance their borrowing needs, yields for European government bonds generally may be kept relatively high to attract purchasers. Last week, the gilt market paused for breath after the four-point surge in prices in the 24 hours after the election result on April 9. As a result, the market saw only a relatively small downward movement in yields. Despite this, it had little trouble digesting an issue of Pounds 800m worth of gilts announced by the Bank on April 13. The selling of this stock in a matter of hours means the Bank has, since the start of the 1992-93 financial year, found buyers for some Pounds 5bn worth of securities. At the end of last week, the 10 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 1994 was quoted at 101 1/8 , a rise of  1/8 of a point. The yield was pushed down from 9.54 per cent to 9.4 per cent. The longer-dated 9 per cent Treasury gilt due in 2008 saw a  1/2 point gain, with a closing price of 99. Its yield went down from 9.08 per cent to 9.03 per cent. In the past week, gilt specialists have reported strong demand for the securities from investors in Germany and Japan. The allure of the bonds to overseas buyers is helped by the strength of sterling since the election result, and the perception that Britain is on its way to achieving low inflation due to the link between the pound and the D-Mark via the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). In recent days, economic data have provided hesitant signs of a recovery in the UK economy, gripped by recession for nearly two years. Seasonally adjusted unemployment in March rose by just 7,400, the smallest monthly increase for nearly two years, while manufacturing output jumped in February by a higher-than-expected 1.1 per cent. The concern over funding was, however, underlined by a record Pounds 6.4bn public-sector borrowing requirement in March, the last month of the 1991-92 financial year. This brought the borrowing figure for the year to Pounds 13.9bn, compared with a small net repayment of Pounds 465m the year before. In 1992-93 the Treasury expects the figure to be Pounds 28bn. The rising figure for borrowing will probably not pose too many problems for the gilt market in the next few months. That is the view of Mr Stephen Bell, UK economist at Morgan Grenfell and gilts adviser to Deutsche Bank, which owns Morgan Grenfell and has just become a market-maker in the securities. According to Mr Bell, gilt yields are likely to fall over the next six months by about 0.4 of a percentage point, continuing the broad trend of falling yields for the securities which started around the middle of last year. Yields for German bonds - which act as a benchmark for the European government bond market - are likely to see a similar fall. However, he thinks that by the end of 1992 the volume of funding in the pipeline by Germany, Britain and France could start to create problems for the European bond market. With these three governments likely to issue between them more than Pounds 200bn worth of bonds over the next two years, the volume of securities for which the governments will be seeking buyers will depress any tendency for a further drop in yields, and keep prices relatively low.</p>

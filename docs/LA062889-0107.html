			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EQUESTRIAN HURT IN FALL WINS $385,714  </P> <P> A Glendale woman, who fell while riding a horse on a Los Angeles City bridle  trail and injured her leg, will be paid $385,714 in damages by the city because  the Parks Department failed to property maintain the trail, the City Council  agreed Tuesday.  </P> <P> Miriam Dow, 42, was riding her horse down an equestrian ramp along the Los  Angeles River Basin on Dec. 5, 1985, when the horse slipped and fell on her  leg, breaking her left femur bone.  </P> <P> As a result of surgery Dow's leg was shortened nearly an inch. She now walks  with a limp, suffers from chronic pain and is unable to walk long distances and  play tennis or other sporting activities, according to a report by the city  attorney.  </P> <P> Last February, a Los Angeles Superior Court civil trial jury found that the Los  Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks had maintained the river ramps in  poor conditions by failing to properly pack the cement paths with dirt to  prevent horses from slipping. The jury awarded Dow the $385,714, which was  approved by the council Tuesday.  </P> <P> City parks officials said that a caution sign has been installed at the  entrance to the trail, warning users to "proceed at their own risk."  </P></p>

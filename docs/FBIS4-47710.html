			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini in Nongoma on 30 </F> April--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent Gary Alfonso] Well, good afternoon  from Ulundi, here where that good news which we've just heard  from the European parliamentarians has certainly also filtered  down to this area, and we went along to King Goodwill  Zwelithini's home at Nongoma a short while ago and there, as  we've just remarked, well, the king says people don't talk to  him. The king said, well, he addresses the people. This was  the address by King Goodwill Zwelithini a short while ago:    [Zwelithini] The long awaited election has been held in our  country, on the 26th, 27th, and 28th, and other regions were  still finishing their voting process on 29 April, 1994. We all  in our joyful stance witness the beginning of the new era in  South Africa. We know that the international community has been  watchfully monitoring the progress of change in this country,  and that they have contributed a lot toward that direction. I,  as the king of the Zulu nation, wish the entire South African  community a joyful and prosperous transition toward their  freedom. I say these things knowing full well that we still  have a very long and hard road to travel. By voting we have  just taken the first step toward the direction of our destiny,  and we still have to take a million more steps to accomplish our  freedom.    At the outset I wish to sound a very clear warning to you,  the people of South Africa. I know that we have suffered  uncomfortable misfortunes for many hundreds of years under the  then apartheid system. I therefore wish to warn that whichever  party wins the election, we must not celebrate that victory to  the detriment of our well-being. People must not over enjoy  themselves in such a way that other people might feel offended.  We must not celebrate our victory in a way that will shame our  freedom and our country. We must teach ourselves from the  outset to respect other people and properties because that is  our philosophy of ubuntu [humanity].    It is my wish as king of the people, that the people must  realize the basic necessities of life. Killing one another is  surely not a basic necessity of life. I therefore urge you to  stop doing unnecessary things. Rather take a good look at  yourselves and try to understand what freedom means to you. I  have a very good understanding of that. It means dedication and  hard work. I therefore once again wish to appeal to the people  of KwaZulu-Natal, and the rest of South Africa, to turn their  backs against violence and squarely face the future.    Having said these things I now wish to place a challenge to  you, the people of this country. You have now fought, won the  battle, and political freedom. Let us now join hands and fight  to win the battles of poverty, disease and ignorance. To me  that is the final attainment of freedom.    The international community has helped us to win our  political freedom. Let us now challenge them in unison to help  us win our final freedom, which is freedom to know, freedom to  practice, and freedom to do. We have been promised by our  political parties a lot of good things. Let us give them a  chance to practice what they have been promising. I myself am  very keen on developmental projects, and I therefore promise to  lead exemplarily toward that direction. A nation without  development projects is doomed to fail. I urge you to join hands  to develop South Africa to its maximum.    In conclusion I wish to thank the people of KwaZulu-Natal  for  heeding my call to go to vote. Let the example that you have  shown in this crucial period be the (?feet) to carry you in more  years to come. I want to thank the Almighty God for having  saved the entire South Africa through the important period of  our history, and I pray that you should now go back to your  roots and practice ubuntu.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Latin Americans perform as Turkey holds its own - John Pitt reviews Istanbul's lead this year over winners and losers among emerging markets in May Latin America provided the best performers among the world's emerging markets in May, although significant gains were also to be seen in Portugal, Indonesia and India. Turkey, still the best performing market this year in dollar terms, according to data supplied by the IFC, a part of the World Bank, fell back slightly as some investors decided to lock in profits. The political vacuum left by the election of Mr Suleyman Demirel last month as president, thereby vacating the prime minister's office, seems to have had little effect on the Turkish equity market. Ms Nur Pekin of Schroders in London comments that the rally has partly been driven by a change in the law encouraging institutional investors to switch funds into equities: under the new legislation, funds which have at least 25 per cent of their portfolios in equities only have to pay a 10 per cent withholding tax. Furthermore, says Ms Pekin, 'robust economic growth continues to boost company earnings: first-quarter interims have in the most part been excellent, with real earnings up by more than 100 per cent in many cases'. Taken together with falling interest rates - three-month rates are down to 67 per cent from last year's 76 per cent - Schroders is forecasting that the index will reach 10,000 by the year-end, against its present level of around 8,580. Brazil was lifted last month by the appointment of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso as economics minister, so much so that the Bovespa index rose by more than 7 per cent on news of the cabinet reshuffle. Mr Eduardo Faria of Latin American Securities observes: 'The new economics team brings a degree of technical competence which has been absent from the ministry since President Franco took office.' But he continues: 'With inflation running dangerously close to 30 per cent per month . . . a skilful compromise between much-needed fiscal discipline and Franco's commitment to economic recovery will need to be reached.' Elsewhere in the region both Colombia and Venezuela saw positive movements last month, the former assisted by good company results, particularly in the financial sector, and increased foreign demand, and the latter by the suspension from office of President Carlos Andres Perez on corruption allegations. In Asia, India drew ahead, although not enough to move it off the bottom as the worst performer since the start of the year. Mr Nigel Spence of Lehman Brothers says that weak corporate results, high interest rates and the slow pace of labour reform have all contributed to dull the market. But, he adds, the start of the monsoon season today should provide the traditional short-term bounce. Indonesia, always a fairly illiquid market, was driven higher in May by strong US and European interest attracted by indications of improving economic activity. Portuguese equities enjoyed the benefits of a devaluation and a sharp fall in April inflation data which drew investors back to the market. Mr John Ferreira of Carnegie comments that 'the low domestic and foreign equity weightings before the devaluation (on May 13) suggest that there is a strong momentum argument for the market'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report "based on material from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and </F> ITAR-TASS correspondents" under the "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow"  rubric: "Weather Prevents Sowing"]    [Text] At the very height of field work, the sowing of  early grain crops in Belgorod Oblast has been suspended. The  reason for this is bad weather.    Sowing machines have stopped work in most rayons because of  the rain which has affected practically the entire territory of  the Belgorod region area. As of today 86 percent of areas here  have already been sown to early grain crops. So as not to lose  time and to complete sowing in the shortest time possible,  machine operators have organized duty rosters in field camps.  As soon as weather conditions permit they are ready to bring  the full range of agricultural equipment into operation.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / International Company News: Shell unit trims forex exposure SHOWA SHELL Sekiyu, the Royal Dutch/Shell group's Japanese affiliate which in February revealed its traders had run up some Dollars 1bn in unrealised foreign exchange losses, said yesterday its efforts to resolve the debacle were yielding better than expected results. The unauthorised dealings at the oil refiner and distributor, half-owned by the Anglo-Dutch group, led to provisions being made in its parent's accounts and to the resignation of Showa Shell's chairman and president. A Dollars 6.44bn forward exposure to the dollar at the end of last year - incurred in secret by a group in Showa Shell's treasury, which had erroneously believed the US currency would rise against the yen - was reduced by Dollars 2.97bn during the first half to June. The settling of these contracts brought the unrealised losses down by Y71.8bn, from Y165bn at the end of February. Nearly a quarter of the dollars generated were used in the course of its business - buying crude and other products, and repaying foreign borrowings  -with the Y53.9bn remainder charged as a special loss. The company sold securities and land holdings which, because of a favourable turn in the stock market, should bring Y15bn more profit than projected, for a total of Y65bn this year. Some Y100bn of the unrealised exchange losses are to be realised for 1993. It was thought that only Y70bn could be settled this year. Showa Shell described the progress as encouraging, but said there was a 'longish tunnel' of two to three years before it would emerge from the episode. The company yesterday reported interim pre-tax profits down 2.1 per cent to Y18.27bn (Dollars 175.25m), but net earnings 52.6 per cent lower at Y5.12bn after the exceptional charges. Sales dipped 2.1 per cent to Y746.1bn, with import prices cheaper but volumes flat.</p>

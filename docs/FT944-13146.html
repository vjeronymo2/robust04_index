			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sales growth helps Dow rise 102% Dow Chemical of the US reported a 102 per cent jump in net earnings to Dollars 288m for the third quarter. Sales in the quarter rose 15 per cent, made up of 11 per cent extra volume and a 4 per cent rise in prices. Dow said it had increased capacity in chemicals and plastics by more than 2bn lbs, at a time of shortage for many of its products. The group's performance was better than that reported on Wednesday by DuPont, its larger US rival. Dow said its plastics division had increased operating profits by 177 per cent to Dollars 305m on sales up 23 per cent at Dollars 1.9bn. The strongest volume growth came in the Pacific area, while new capacity had been added in polyethylene in Canada and polyurethane in China. The chemicals and performance products division increased profits 139 per cent to Dollars 182m, on sales up 13 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn. The strongest performer was vinyl chloride monomer (used to make PVC), helped by the opening of a new plant in Texas. The hydrocarbons and energy division raised profits by 77 per cent to Dollars 23m on sales up 15 per cent to Dollars 520m. A new ethylene plant with 1.2bn lbs of capacity was opened in Canada during the quarter. Profits at the consumer specialities division fell 12 per cent to Dollars 146m, in spite of an 8 per cent rise in sales to Dollars 1.4bn. Dow said this was chiefly due to pharmaceuticals and consumer products. As previously reported, Marion Merrill Dow, its 72 per cent-owned drugs subsidiary, had a 12 per cent fall in net profits for the quarter. Dow said in August it was looking at strategic options for the company.</p>

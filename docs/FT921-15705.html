			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Profits at Paramount slide 52% to Dollars 122m PARAMOUNT Communi-cations, the US entertainment and publishing company, yesterday blamed its 52.8 per cent decline in last year's earnings on a poor performance in entertainment and lower interest income. For the fourth quarter to October 31, its profits fell 24.6 per cent to Dollars 83.3m, or 70 cents a share, from Dollars 110.5m, or 93 cents, a year earlier. Revenues eased slightly to Dollars 1.17bn from Dollars 1.18bn. For the whole of 1991, Paramount had net income of Dollars 122.2m, or Dollars 1.03 a share, against Dollars 259.1m, or Dollars 2.19. Revenues in 1991 were Dollars 3.9bn, compared with Dollars 3.87bn in 1990. Paramount's provision for tax was Dollars 39.2m in the 1991 quarter, against Dollars 41.9m a year ago. Earnings for the year include an after-tax charge of Dollars 35.4m for write-downs on some film and television development commitments and reorganisation costs. Paramount's provision for tax in 1991 was Dollars 57.5m, against Dollars 121.9m a year earlier. Mr Martin Davis, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Fiscal 1991 results were clearly disappointing. However, we are confident that the decisive steps we have taken to strengthen management, improve our infrastructure and sharply pare overhead costs will produce markedly better results in 1992 and in the long term.' The recent changes at Paramount include the surprise appointment last spring of Mr Stanley Jaffe as president and chief operating officer. Mr Jaffe's appointment was followed by the abrupt resignation of the head of Paramount's entertainment division, Mr Frank Mancuso, who was replaced by Mr Brandon Tartikoff. Paramount said the results were in line with expectations, and shares in the company rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 40 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Income from motion pictures was affected by a series of weak film releases, but Paramount's publishing division had strong operating income. Madison Square Gardens' loss in the fourth quarter and the year reflected higher programming expenses at MSG Network, costs related to the venue's official reopening in September, and the opening of a new 5,600-seat theatre.</p>

The Second Chamber voted on Thursday [10  February] to purchase four F-60's, the military version of the  Fokker-50. Defense Secretary Frinking and Fokker's new top man,  R. van Duinen, are to finalize the contract this afternoon.    The fact that Fokker was in the running in the first place  for the supply of these four aircraft is thanks to Parliament.  The Air Force, with the strong backing of Frinking's  predecessor Baron Van Voorst of Voorst, the present governor of  Limburg, did not originally believe Fokker capable of producing  a medium-sized transport plane able to satisfy all modern  military requirements.    The Air Force preferred Italian or Spanish aircraft. But the  Second Chamber and the Ministry of Economic Affairs succeeded --  heedful of the dire straits of the Dutch plane manufacturer --  in allaying the doubts of the Ministry of Defense. The former  is to contribute 30 million guilders to developing the aircraft,  which is to be equipped with an extended fuselage, reinforced  loading platform, and cargo door. The aircraft are to be used  for transporting men and wounded and dropping parachutists.  [passage omitted]</p>

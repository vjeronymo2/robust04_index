			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: National Power It is strange that the stock market should take the downbeat message from National Power so seriously. The sharp fall in market share in the first half was partly due to the company's tardiness in building new gas-fired plant. The decline will be much less pronounced from here on. Since the regulator is deciding whether to refer the generating duopoly to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, National Power has an incentive to err on the side of caution. That might also explain the disappointing dividend. True, the 14 per cent increase in interim pay-out looks miserly against the 18 per cent rise afforded by PowerGen. But National Power is sticking to its target of reducing dividend cover from 3.3 times to 2.5 times by 1995. Working capital is being released as surplus coal stocks are run down, so there is hardly a shortage of cash. Annual dividend increases of at least 15 per cent thus look probable, even if earnings do not grow at all. The profits outlook is certainly becoming less rosy as operating efficiencies become more difficult to find. But National Power looks some distance from running out of cost savings. Besides, the Pounds 454m provisions in the balance sheet are a cushion against hard times. A Pounds 34m slug was released to profits yesterday, in addition to the Pounds 45m pension-related credit taken as an exceptional item. A monopolies reference would undermine both generators, regardless of their financial strength. With its shares now lagging those of PowerGen by 13 per cent, National Power may have limited the downside risk.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUSS OVER ETHICS AND OFFICEHOLDERS  </P> <P> The front page of The Times (April 13) was a real lulu. Three separate stories  dealing with the strange topic of "ethics." One on Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas)  and his problems with the House of Representatives. Another one describes our  noble Mayor Tom Bradley deciding at this late date to divest himself from the  savings and loan with its sizable contributions to his pocket. And lastly, our  noble President Bush deciding on a list of "ethics" for the national  government.  </P> <P> Why all the current fuss about ethics?  </P> <P> We all know about man's inherent crookedness -- the sleaze that infects all  levels of government -- why kid ourselves? Everyone is out to get what he can  -- by hook or crook or subterfuge. No one is going to change our inherent  natures, from cheating on our taxes to lining our pockets anyway possible.  </P> <P> You want names? How about former Atty. Gen. Ed Meese, (former White House  aides) Michael Deaver and Lyn Nofziger and all members of Congress with their  hypocritical honorariums?  </P> <P> Face the facts -- we've always had it and no doubt always will.  </P> <P> JACK H. CHESNER  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

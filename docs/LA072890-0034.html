			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL TRUSTEES REAFFIRM SUPPORT OF READING  SERIES  </P> <P> Lawndale School District trustees have unanimously reaffirmed their support for  the "Impressions" reading series, despite a review panel's conclusions that  some of the material is inappropriate for grade-school pupils and that some  readings need to be handled with caution.  </P> <P> The board, which adopted the controversial series published by Holt, Reinhart  &amp; Winston, agreed to convene a panel of teachers, parents and  administrators after receiving complaints from some parents and members of a  conservative Christian organization that the stories are satanic and filled  with morbid themes.  </P> <P> The 22-member panel concluded that the books are generally acceptable, but that  five selections in the teachers' books are inappropriate and that 21 selections  in all four series books need to be handled with sensitivity.  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Import checks fail to appease fishermen The French government yesterday stepped up checks on fish imports from outside the European Union, in a further effort to appease Breton fishermen who none the less carried their violent protest to the Channel. After invading the main Paris fish market in a clash that injured 17 policemen, the protesting fisherman blocked ferry traffic at Calais and destroyed some Scottish mackerel at Cherbourg. The European Commission said yesterday it was studying France's demand that Brussels reinstate minimum prices for seven species of fish, including salmon. The new French customs checks will be carried out on imports of non-EU fish, of which Norwegian salmon is the main problem, according to the French agriculture ministry. But Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK agriculture and fishing minister, yesterday protested to her French counterpart, Mr Jean Puech, about the 'unacceptable behaviour' of the French fishermen. She welcomed the latter's offer to compensate British fisherman for any losses, but said: 'I find it incredible that such arrangements should be necessary to protect lawful trade between members of the European Union.' Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, is expected to be greeted with further protests today when he visits the Breton capital of Rennes. The government had earlier sought to placate the fisherman by announcing on Wednesday night special aid of FFr300m (Pounds 34m) for the region's hard-hit fishing industry, half of it in the form of subsidised loans and the rest, including FFr27m, to take some of the surplus fish off the market.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bond issue by Turkish telephone group Turkey has mandated a group of international banks to issue Dollars 2bn worth of convertible bonds in the state telephone monopoly PTT to overcome legal obstacles preventing its privatisation. The move, which bankers describe as a pre-funding for the privatisation, is evidence of the urgency being given to Turkey's sell-off programme, as the government seeks to narrow the budget deficit. Earlier proposals separating the PTT into its post and telephone arms, the first step to selling the telecommunications company, were blocked by the courts on appeal from opposition politicians. The newly appointed privatisation chief, Mr Tezcan Yaramanci, unveiled an ambitious target to sell Dollars 20bn worth of government companies before the end of 1995. S. G. Warburg and Morgan Stanley were appointed joint global co-ordinators for the PTT convertible issue, while IndoSuez, the French bank, and Lehman Bros, of the US are co-lead managers. The bonds will be convertible into shares in the company only after the privatisation. They will provide immediate budget revenues but will also represent a liability for the government when Turkey faces foreign public and private debt put at Dollars 64bn. Bankers expect the issue to target risk-averse investors looking for high yield paper rather than capital growth - hitherto the main attraction of emerging markets like Turkey's. Some economists remain sceptical of the benefits of the convertible, which could limit the scope of any future privatisation of PTT. In a further indication of the impetus being given to the programme, the Public Participation Administration, the government agency handling state asset sales, this week dusted off a three-year-old mandate agreed with Credit Suisse First Boston to sell the government's estimated 51 per cent stake in Eregli Demir Celik (Erdemir), the Black Sea-based iron and steel works listed on the Istanbul exchange. Erdemir, Turkey's only flat rolled steel producer, is investing Dollars 2bn in a modernisation programme. The disposal, worth an estimated Dollars 500m, could be complete by mid-1994. A full registration with the New York Securities and Exchange Commission is envisaged. CSFB is enlisting Turkish brokers to handle the secondary offering on the local Istanbul market.</p>

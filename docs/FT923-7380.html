			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Observer: Tragedy of the opera When it comes to international soap operas it it hard to beat the goings on at the world's leading opera houses. Whilst everyone is waiting for the final act in Covent Garden's Jeremy Isaacs drama, opera-lovers should not miss an interesting divertissement in Paris. The hero, or villain, depending on one's taste, is Pierre Berge, alias Pierre la Panthere, president of L'Opera de Paris. He's having a horrible summer. First, a set collapsed killing a member of the chorus and injuring 30 others. Then Philippe Belaval, his director general, and three of his supporting cast, walked out after firing a highly critical broadside at Berges management style. Now the the premiere of Arthur Honneger's Jeanne au Bucher, has had to be postponed because 20 of the chorus have still not recovered from the Seville tragedy. As if he did not have enough problems, Berge, who doubles up as president of the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house, is also under attack for spending too much money trying to launch the career of his young friend, Robert Merloz, as a fashion designer. However, Berges future may still be brighter than that of Jeremy Isaacs. For a start he is the best of friends with Jack Lang, the flamboyant French arts minister. They have even bought a wooden datcha together outside Paris.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: German car parts makers hit THE EFFECTS of the crisis in the German motor industry showed up yesterday in poor first-half results at two leading parts suppliers. VDO Adolf Schindling, part of the Mannesmann group, recorded a loss, while Varta, the battery maker, saw net earnings shrink 75 per cent to DM5m (Dollars 2.9m). VDO said first-half sales had fallen 1.3 per cent to DM1.17bn, despite a 27 per cent rise in foreign turnover. Unofficial estimates put the loss at around DM50m. The group said it expected a deficit for the full year after a 15 per cent fall in turnover, although 1994 should show a marked improvement. Fichtel &amp; Sachs, another Mannesmann components maker, reported mounting losses earlier this week. Its deficit rose to DM98m during 1992, compared with a loss of DM68m a year earlier. New orders in the early months of the current year were stubbornly low, and the company suggested losses could increase again. Varta, a leading supplier of car batteries, said half of its 8 per cent fall in first-half turnover to DM1bn was a result of currency fluctuations. Recession had hit industrial sales, with car battery turnover dropping 13 per cent to DM363m. Turnover from power units for portable appliances was unchanged at DM403m.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Singapore trade official charged A TOP Singapore trade official was charged in court yesterday by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau with deceiving corporate executives and a museum director, Reuter reports from Singapore. The bureau accused Mr Yeo Seng Teck, chief executive of the state Trade Development Board, of forging documents and cheating local companies in deals worth a total of SDollars 2m (Pounds 860,000) between July 1988 and February 1993. He faces 22 charges stemming from the deals, which involved antiques and art pieces. Mr Yeo, who is also the chairman of NatSteel and the Empress Place Museum, both in Singapore, recently chaired the board of advisers for an international fine art and antiques fair, billed as the biggest ever in Asia. No plea was taken from Mr Yeo, who was arrested on Tuesday but released on bail of SDollars 600,000.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARREST WARRANT ISSUED FOR ACTOR COREY  FELDMAN  </P> <P> An arrest warrant was issued Thursday for actor Corey Feldman, who failed to  appear in court for one of his two heroin cases because he has enrolled in a  live-in drug rehabilitation program.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer held the bench warrant until Oct. 31, when  Feldman, 19, is to again appear in court.  </P> <P> Feldman, the star of such movies as "Stand by Me," "The Goonies" and "The Lost  Boys," will not be arrested unless he fails to show up then.  </P> <P> His lawyer, Richard Hirsch, said Feldman did not appear for Thursday's pretrial  hearing because he has enrolled in the 30-day live-in program.  </P> <P> Feldman enrolled in the program after his arrest last week during which police  in North Hollywood found packets of heroin in his socks while the actor was  sitting in a car whose rear window was smashed. Feldman is to be arraigned  Monday on a heroin charge stemming from that arrest.  </P></p>

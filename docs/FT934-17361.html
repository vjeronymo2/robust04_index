			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Technology: Cashing in on radio signals - Worth Watching As Christmas approaches many retailers will want to install more tills to help increase sales. The problem is that most point-of-sale equipment needs a phone line to send purchase data back to the store's computer. Tec, part of the Toshiba group, has overcome the obstacle with a range of tills which transmits the information over a radio link. In the UK the equipment uses the frequency allocated for cordless local area networks in offices, at 2.46 GigHz. Tec believes the system will give retailers greater flexibility in designing store layouts. Tec: Japan, 03 3292 6223; UK, 0923 233688.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by station editor </F> Robert Tamchyna; place and date not given: "Conversations at  Lany"--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Tamchyna] Mr. President, in the last edition of  these conversations, you spoke in great detail about the current  political situation in Slovakia. This week was marked there by  the appointment of the new government and the parliament's  approval of the date of the early elections this fall. Could it  be said that the political crisis has been successfully resolved?    [Havel] I do not think the latest developments mark the end  of the crisis in Slovakia and the beginning of an era of  stability. For numerous and varied reasons, real stability of  the Slovak political scene and the creation of a political  culture necessary for the peaceful development of the country  are still some distance away.    Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly an important and good move;  it is a move in the right direction. I would not say it is a  victory of some over others. I would say it is a victory for  the parliament concept, a victory for democracy. [passage  omitted] The whole process was free of chaos, uncertainty,  lawlessness, and so on.    As far as the government is concerned, I do not wish to  provide any assessments or comments on it. I believe it will be  a hard-working and nonconfrontational government.    It might be relevant to comment briefly on the new Slovak  prime minister, Mr. Moravcik, whom I know quite well because, at  the time I was federal president, he was federal minister of  foreign affairs. Thus, I had quite a lot to do with him. We  went to the CSCE summit in Helsinki together. I must say that  my cooperation with him was exceptionally good. He is an  accommodating and very decent person, who does not miss an  opportunity to either express thanks for a job well done or  praise it. At the same time, he is a person who expresses  himself openly and yet politely if his views differ from those  of others. I liked cooperating with him.    I think he is a decent man. I believe that a climate of  democracy and a spirit of dialogue and cooperation will prevail  in the government because these will indeed be necessary. After  all, it is the government where, on the one hand, there is the  Party of the Democratic Left and, on the other, there is the  Christian Democratic Movement. This means that both poles of  the political spectrum are present there. Without a real will  for compromise, for search for compromise, for cooperation and  dialogue, the government could find its work difficult. Let us  hope it will succeed, and, above all, let us hope the result of  the next elections is good and that this leads to a calmer  period in Slovakia's political life.    [Tamchyna] I have no idea whether you encountered anything  of  this kind in your circles, but, speaking for myself, it felt as  if some reactions to the current events in Slovakia emanated an  unconcealed joy that this political crisis no longer affects us  and that the Slovaks should deal with this in their own way. Is  this not a little dangerous?    [Havel] This is a phenomenon I have frequently criticized, a  phenomenon I do not like and one that I tend to brand Czech  provincialism. [passage omitted]    This policy is completely shortsighted, and the social  climate or social mentality promoting this policy is no good,  either. We have paid a high price for it in our modern history.  This could be documented by many examples. I think that, just  as we should not be indifferent to what is taking place in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, we should not be indifferent to what is  happening in other neighboring countries or in more distant  countries. We should all the more not be indifferent to what is  going on in Slovakia because Slovakia is our immediate neighbor.  Together with Slovakia, we have had many good and bad  experiences. There are thousands of threads binding us together  with this neighbor. Although we are two independent states now,  neither state should interfere in political developments of the  other state or influence its history. We must follow each  other's actions very attentively and support everything that  will facilitate good mutual cooperation. [passage omitted]    [Tamchyna] Mr. President, you have mentioned several times  in  conversation, even here at Lany, the necessity of compensating  our citizens for injustices perpetrated against them during  World War II. The Czech Government has now stipulated  conditions for the so-called humanitarian gesture toward victims  of Nazism. Are you not concerned that this humanitarian  gesture, based on the amount to be divided among an exact number  of victims, could provoke ill will or an inappropriate reaction?    [Havel] I think--and it was repeated often enough--that  injustices cannot be undone. There are injustices that simply  cannot be undone. No one could ever be compensated for spending  10 years in a Nazi concentration camp or in a communist prison,  or for not being able to work in his profession for a whole  lifetime, even if he were given a million korunas. What we are  trying to do, with varied degree of success, is to mitigate  these injustices, to demonstrate that we are aware of injustices  having been perpetrated. Naturally, it is important that this  gesture of providing 1 billion korunas should also express our  knowledge of the suffering our compatriots had to endure during  World War II; it should show that we are not indifferent to it.  We want somehow to demonstrate our awareness of it without any  hint of suggestion that this amount would in some way remove the  suffering endured.    I think it is very good, and it is not important what you  call this. It is very important to realize that this gesture of  our government does not mean giving up negotiations with Germany  about what used to be called compensation, which was paid to  many other countries in the form of restitution but which did  not happen in our case for various reasons beyond our control.    However, we think that this compensation, which the German  Government also called a humanitarian gesture for its own legal  reasons, is due us, and we are not giving up. These  negotiations will continue, and I consider it my own personal  duty. I have been engaged in numerous talks on this issue.  [passage omitted]    I do not consider the matter closed. On the contrary, I  firmly believe that we will succeed in getting this settlement  with Germany. It will undoubtedly contribute toward cleansing  our relations with this big and important neighbor.</p>

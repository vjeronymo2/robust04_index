			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tseng Hui-yen (2582 1979 3601 ): "Liu Nianchun and </F> Zhang Ling From the League for Guaranteeing Laborers' Rights  Disappear One After Another"]    [Text] Liu Nianchun, instigator of the "League for  Guaranteeing Laborers' Rights" [LGLR] in Mainland China and  convener of the Peace Charter, has disappeared from Jiangsu  since 28 May. His brother Liu Qing, who is chairman of "China  Human Rights" in New York, is 99 percent sure he has been  arrested by the mainland authorities. Zhang Ling, another  member of the LGLR in Anhui, has also been taken away by  security personnel. Liu Qing is worried that a new round of  dissident arrests has started in Beijing.    On 9 March this year, Liu Nianchun, Yuan Hongbing, and Wang  Zhongqiu officially applied to the authorities for the  establishment of the LGLR. The application was handed in by Liu  Nianchun to the Ministry of Civil Administration. As this was a  pioneering undertaking on the mainland, indicating that the  mainland's democracy movement had become more open, organized,  and legalized, it attracted attention from the international  media. The organization has a preparatory committee with more  than 120 members nationwide, but because of their worries about  large-scale arrests by the mainland authorities, their names  have not been made public for the time being. Instead, Liu  Nianchun and the other two shouldered the responsibility and  appeared in public.    Of the three men, Yuan Hongbin, a lecturer in the Law  Faculty  of Beijing University, was first arrested by the mainland  authorities on 2 April. Another organizer, Wang Zhongqiu, was  also arrested on 1 June. Wang Jiaqi, a postgraduate at the Law  Faculty of Beijing University and another key member of the LGLR  who was arrested together with Yuan Hongbin, escaped while being  escorted from Beijing to Hebei's Tangshan Prison. With the  assistance of underground pro-democracy organizations, he  successfully arrived in Hong Kong on 15 April, gained U.S.  political asylum, and went to New York via London.    Liu Qing pointed out that Liu Nianchun had actually intended  to leave for Jiangsu and lie low on the eve of the 4 June  incident. His wife, who is in Beijing, last received a phone  call from him on 26 May, and he said he would return to Beijing  the following week. Liu Nianchun and one of his friends both  disappeared on 28 May after they had a telephone conversation.  Wang Zhongqiu also disappeared at the same time and his arrest  was later confirmed.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Sport: England to triumph on a mighty occasion - The Five Nations' Championship / Rugby Something is wrong. Something is going right with English sport. First, Terry Venables' appointment is applauded, second, Ray Illingworth comes in from the cold to take the reins of the England cricket team and, late yesterday, the Rugby Football Union continued this uncanny run of common sense by appointing Jack Rowell, the Bath coach, to be the new guru for the national side. The announcement was expected on Monday - but its timing gives him the chance of being fully involved with this afternoon's game. Rowell's appointment will be widely welcomed, except perhaps by a few die-hards within the RFU executive committee. Rowell's precise role will need to be carefully defined over the coming months. He may want to merge the role of manager and coach. Dick Best is the present England coach, but the jury is out on his contribution to the England set-up over the past three years. He is an enlightened coach but his work for England has gone largely unnoticed. Geoff Cooke has retained all the power in selection. In particular, Best lost the case for Stuart Barnes, the Bath captain, as the pivot on which to base his England team. Without Barnes, a running outside-half, Best lost the architect of his tactics. Instead, we have had a diet of unrelieved boredom from the England camp, the win against the All Blacks notwithstanding. The England team, instead of building another dimension to their game, as the Australians did between their Grand Slam in 1984 and their winning of the World Cup in 1991, has gone from rags to riches to rags in an identical period of time. And, in between, France and now Wales have made great strides to catch up. Cooke's control of the England team was suffocating the side. He needed to relieve Carling of the captaincy and allow Dean Richards, one of his bete-noires, the chance to lead the side until after next year's Rugby World Cup. Rowell's appointment may lead to a shake-up in the England team. He will probably replace Andrew with Barnes and ask Will Carling to stand down as captain. He is also likely to call on all his powers to ensure a fit Jeremy Guscott at centre. If one player has been missed this season, it has been Guscott. We might just have reached the same conclusion over gifted Welsh centre Scott Gibbs who has also been absent for the tournament. Without him though, Welsh back play has matured and developed beyond expectations. This is not just because of Neil Jenkins' coming of age, but because of his right-hand man in the centre, Nigel Davies. For me, Davies has been the player of the championship. Unsung and largely unheard of, he missed the Canadian debacle in November and, through injury, the French game four weeks ago. But Davies has an acute tactical brain, safe hands and is a sound kicker. Above all, he has one exceptional gift, he makes time for himself. The Llanelli player will have his toughest game today against Carling. It will be one to savour. Romantics will want a Welsh victory. After all, there were supposed to be only two teams in this championship, England and France. My how we all got that wrong. Commentators are already concluding that Wales' chance of achieving the Grand Slam has come too early for the team. This is nonsense. Nothing comes too early in sport. Nevertheless, this is a wounded England side and there is nothing more dangerous. They played so abjectly against Ireland that they still have something to prove to their loyal supporters. The side has developed a symbiotic relationship with them and they will want to provide a game to talk about and a game with which to thank Geoff Cooke for his sterling work over the past seven years. The game again hinges on the play of the respective back-rows. Dean Richards has that uncanny knack of always being in the right place at the right time. His presence enables Ben Clarke to play a slightly wider game, one that best fits the likes of Victor Ubogu and Tim Rodber. It is their pace over the ground - which the Welsh lack - where the game will be won. I do not see England being unduly bothered about tries in spite of the media interest. They will want a win and will steel themselves to ensure it is by the requisite 16 points so that they can claim the championship. I believe they will do it. Twickenham is again host to another mighty occasion.</p>

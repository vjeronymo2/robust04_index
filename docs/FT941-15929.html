			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Sterling nudges DM2.60 Sterling remained in the spotlight yesterday, ahead of the monthly monetary meeting today between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, writes Gillian Tett. Before the new year, many were speculating whether the authorities would use the opportunity to cut UK interest rates. But strong economic news seems to have reduced this possibility, thereby fuelling sterling's recent strength. Ironically the upward pressure on the pound has led some analysts to wonder whether the chancellor might yet be prodded into action. Meanwhile, sterling strengthened against the D-Mark yesterday, as the German unit lost ground against most currencies. The key question currently absorbing the markets is whether the pound will be able to breach the DM2.60 barrier. After drifting upwards in recent weeks, the British currency yesterday nudged towards this barrier, touching DM2.5981, up from yesterday's close of DM2.5883. But though the rise provoked a wave of excitement in the markets, sterling later fell back, finally closing  1/2 pfennig up on the day at DM2.5944. With the German economy still showing no sign of emerging from recession, the D-Mark is expected to remain weak against sterling in the near future, dealers said. Gloom about the German economy was again underlined yesterday by the publication of figures showing that West German GDP had fallen by 1.9 per cent last year, compared to 1.6 per cent growth in 1992. On the sterling side, however, opinion is more mixed about the British currency's potential. Although the market now believes that the British recovery is under way, there are doubts about its pace, with traders looking anxiously to the release of a new batch of UK economic data later this week. Earnings figures, due to be published today, will be watched carefully for signs of an upturn in wage pressure. The consensus is for annual earnings growth of 3 per cent, unchanged from October. As the pound nudged higher yesterday, rumours circulated that the Bank of England had briefly intervened in the Far Eastern markets to stem the rise. 'It is not inconceivable that the Bank of England would discretely intervene to restrain sterling,' said Mr Michael Feeny of Sumitomo Bank. As usual, however, the rumours were unconfirmed and most dealers doubt that interest rate cuts will occur before the end of February or beginning of March. This view is apparently shared by the futures market, which yesterday traded about five basis points lower for the March contract, at 94.65, and about seven basis points down for the June contract, at 94.79. At this level, dealers are pricing three-month and six-month money at 5.35 and 5.21 per cent respectively. Nevertheless, as Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank, points out, the fact that sterling is nudging at the DM2.60 barrier does create fresh pressure for a rate cut, particularly from British exporters. 'If sterling soars through DM2.60, the market will look for a DM2.65 level very fast and this will put added pressure on Mr Clarke to cut rates earlier,' he said. Meanwhile, with American investors feeling increasingly positive about the British economy's prospects for recovery, Mr Cocker believes that the pound will continue to maintain its firm tone against the dollar, in spite of the dollar's recent strengthening. The pound yesterday closed at Dollars 1.4981, up from the previous day's Dollars 1.4955. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank's attempt to convince the money markets that a German rate cut would not occur soon met with more scepticism yesterday, as the poor German GDP data fuelled expectations about an early reduction. The D-Mark yesterday declined against the dollar, which closed at DM1.7398 compared to DM1.7308 the previous day. In New York it finished trading at DM1.7418. With the dollar now having recouped most of the losses that occurred after the release of weaker than expected US employment data on Friday, the American currency is expected to renew its attempt on the 1993 high of DM1.7485 in the next few days, dealers said. The D-Mark also weakened over the day against the French franc, in spite of staging a brief rally in the morning. It was at FFr3.401 at the end of London trading, compared with yesterday's close of FFr3.410. With the Italian parliament due to debate a no confidence motion today, the lira softened yesterday against most currencies, with the exception of the weak D-Mark. It finished at L978.4 against the D-Mark, compared to a previous close of L983.4. Sentiment towards the lira is expected to remain nervous in the coming days, in spite of the Italian currency's recent bull run. However, if the political turmoil is contained, the lira's potential for further rises remains good, dealers said, with many predicting that the Italian lira will join the Swedish krone as one of this year's best performers. The Bank of England yesterday predicted a shortage of Pounds 1.55bn in its money market operations, and later revised this up to Pounds 1.65bn. It bought Pounds 1.1bn of bills at 5 3/8 per cent.  -----------------------------------------             POUND IN NEW YORK  ----------------------------------------- Jan 11           Close      Prev. close  ----------------------------------------- Pounds spot     1.4900        1.4930 1 mth           1.4868        1.4898 3 mth           1.4818        1.4850 1 yr            1.4674        1.4710  -----------------------------------------</p>

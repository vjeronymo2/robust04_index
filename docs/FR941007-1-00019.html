			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE believes that the preponderant share of reduced oil consumption caused by incremental appliance efficiency standards, will come from imports. The price of oil is set in a world market and domestic energy producers supply as much oil as is profitable given that world price. Unless appliance efficiency standards significantly affect the world oil price, domestic production will remain largely unchanged and imports will fall.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has considered, in several recent policy exercises, the impact of changes in domestic oil consumption on world market prices. The change in price determines how reduced consumption is split between reduced imports and reduced domestic production. Current modeling generally shows that domestic production falls by only about ten percent of the decrease in domestic consumption. The Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service also studied this issue in detail as a part of their 1992 5&hyph;Year Leasing Program, and reached similar conclusions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issue 18: The possibility of energy security externalities associated with non-oil fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department does not believe that there are comparable energy security externalities associated with fuels other than oil. That is because non-oil fuels consumed in the U.S. are obtained primarily from domestic sources. The prices of these fuels are primarily determined in national markets, and are not particularly susceptible to price spikes caused by supply disruptions in other areas of the world. Because of these factors, DOE does not intend to consider energy security externalities for fuels other than oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, it is important to note that the generic issue of the relationship between price and marginal cost outlined in the Crosscutting Issues section must be considered in the determination of whether an application of an incremental externality value is appropriate in those cases where an energy security externality related to the use of oil in electricity generation is identified. However, given the competitive market structure of the fuel oil industry, the Department, based on its current information, presumes that oil sold directly to residential end-users is competitively priced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Review under Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rulemaking on energy efficiency standards for central air conditioners, heat pumps, furnaces, refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers has been determined to be an ``economically significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was subject to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There was no substantive changes between the draft submitted to OIRA and today's action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft of today's action and any other documents submitted to OIRA for review have been made part of the rulemaking record and are available for public review in the Department's Freedom of Information Reading Room, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585 between the hours of 9 and 4, Monday through Friday, telephone (202) 586&hyph;6020.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Public Comment Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> a. Participation in Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department encourages the maximum level of public participation possible in this rulemaking. Individual consumers, representatives of consumer groups, manufacturers, associations, States or other governmental entities, utilities, retailers, distributors, manufacturers, and others are urged to submit written statements on the proposal. The Department also encourages interested persons to participate in the public hearing to be held in Washington, DC at the time and place indicated at the beginning of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOE has established a period of 60 days following publication of this notice for persons to comment on this proposal. All public comments received and the transcript of the public hearing will be available for review in the DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Bankruptcy debt up 25%: Sign of growing bad-loan burden carried by banks Outstanding debts of Japan's corporate bankruptcies in November jumped 25.6 per cent from a year earlier to Y1,032bn (Pounds 6.3bn), a record for a single month and a sign of the mounting bad loan burden carried by the country's banks. Teikoku Databank, the credit research agency, said the debt figure was boosted by the collapse of Muramoto Construction, which owed about Y590bn, but a continuing increase in recession-related bankruptcies is keeping the failure rate at an unusually high level. The agency said 1,176 companies failed during the month, a fall of 11.4 per cent from a year earlier and 6.5 per cent from October. Another sign of economic weakness released yesterday was a 10.5 per cent fall year-on-year in Tokyo department-store sales during November, the third consecutive month of double-digit decreases. The Japan Department Stores' Association said clothing sales were 12.4 per cent lower and those of household articles slipped 17.1 per cent. The Economic Planning Agency suggests that a recovery in consumer spending and capital investment will lead a broader recovery, but a 13.5 per cent fall in machinery orders in October, against a year earlier, indicates that companies are still reducing capital spending. Compared to a month earlier, the EPA said private machinery orders dipped 15.2 per cent and those from the public sector fell 8 per cent, while exports increased 2.4 per cent. The Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics said Japan is likely to have zero growth next year, if the yen remains at around Y110 to the dollar, public works spending is increased by Y5,000bn and income taxes are cut by Y6,000bn.</p>

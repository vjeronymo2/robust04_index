			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chief Editor Jan Smolec: "Step Down, Too, </F> Mr. President!"]    [Text] When assessing the political situation in the wake  of the no-confidence vote in Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir  Meciar in his interview for Slovak Television on Saturday [12  March], President Michal Kovac told television viewers: "We are  in a democratic state, and a decision made by the majority is  thus valid." He asserted, furthermore, that "this certainly does  not mean any black mark against parliament in the eyes of our  public." If the deputies and the president himself were  convinced about the correctness of this decision, they should  have explained it in person to the voters who had assembled in  front of parliament and the Primacialny Palace [temporary seat  of Slovak president].    Let me remind the president of the majority principle also  regarding the assessment of his activity by deputies for the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] to the former CSFR  Federal Assembly. He actively cooperated with these deputies  for half a year, when dividing the federation. In a statement  adopted on Saturday [12 March], the great majority of these  deputies said that the Slovak president had destabilized the  political scene, initiated a parliamentary crisis, and evidently  exceeded the framework of his constitutional powers. Such  action by a president is without precedent in the history of  European parliamentarianism. Supported by mandates received from  their voters, HZDS deputies to the former Federal Assembly  appealed to the president's conscience to consider his remaining  in the post of president.    How will the president react to the decision of this  majority? A government without top political leaders is to be  formed in the days to come. Let us apply that principle  consistently. Also to the president.</p>

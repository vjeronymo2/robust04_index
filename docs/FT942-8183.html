			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Signet Signet has made great strides to escape from its lurid past. The Ratners name will soon disappear from UK high streets. The provision against Salisburys suggests the loss-making luggage chain will soon be sold. Having spent 1992 cutting costs and squeezing cash out of the business, Signet's management last year delivered growth. A modest increase in sales from UK stores is encouraging. Sales growth of 11 per cent in the US, which accounts for more than half the group's business, is a taste of what might be achieved if UK recovery continues. The snag is that the Ratner legacy lingers in the balance sheet. Suspended payments on US preference shares are accumulating at around Pounds 30m a year. Ordinary shareholders will not see a dividend until the backlog has been cleared. Repaying the prefs in full would now cost Pounds 380m. Since Signet had Pounds 360m bank borrowings at the year end, replacing preference capital with debt is hardly an option. Cash flow is not yet strong enough to help, so additional equity will probably be required. Yet it is difficult to judge how far ordinary shareholders face dilution. There is no deadline for repayment of the prefs. Mr James McAdam, Signet's chief executive, might fancy his chances of striking a deal with the holders of that paper. If the trading recovery continues, the company's hand will be further strengthened. While the recovery in the shares so far has been a testament to Mr McAdam's skill as a retailer, further progress depends on his ability as a banker.</p>

In the past, that is to say about 10 years ago, the export  of military goods to countries in the Middle East would have met  with insurmountable problems. This changed somewhat following  the Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement (Camp David).  Minesweepers were allowed to demonstrate their abilities in  Alexandria, top military personnel and secretaries of state (Van  Houwelingen in 1985) cautiously tested the market during sneaky  trips to the Nile. No real weapons were involved: after all,  electronics, patrol ships and fishing for mines in the Red Sea  did serve the general interest. In 1988, the Royal Navy also  made a call in Egypt to once again demonstrate the quality of  the Netherlands bottoms. But Egypt did not have any money. In  thanks for services rendered during the Gulf war, it received  generous military assistance from the United States so that it  did not have to put its scarce resources into Netherlands goods.  But now a small breakthrough is in the offing. It concerns real  weapons, and the supplier is once again the Netherlands  Government itself. The disarmament race in Europe has led to  an enormous surplus of weapons. Minister Ter Beek has 727  armored infantry vehicles, model YPR-765, for sale. The oldest  are only 20 years old, the youngest were made in 1987. Now Egypt  would like to acquire as many as 500 to 600 of them. According  to the ministry's sales brochure, they should yield between  400,000 and 700,000 guilders each, hence a total of something  like 250 million guilders. According to reports, Pakistan had  also expressed interest, but the idea of Daf armored vehicles on  the front line against India was going a bit too far. Even  though a war between Egypt and Israel is really no longer a  matter of consideration, the planned sale to Egypt is not  uncontroversial. First of all, the possibility of an "Iranian"  development in Egypt, where fundamentalists and the government  are fighting hard, is not excluded. To deliver to Egypt means  more or less lengthy military relations with that country  (maintenance, reserve parts), unless the United States is  willing to provide the follow up care (even during crises). The  willingness to enter into military ties with Egypt shows that  the arms export policy of the Netherlands is in the process of  changing. Evenhandedness requires that Israel no longer be an  undesirable destination either. Before you know it, we will have  moved from a quasiembargo of the Middle East as a "sensitive  region" into a policy that comes down to calling yourself  neutral as long as you supply all countries with equal amounts.  Countries such as Iran and Iraq excluded, of course. The  pressure to export becomes even greater because the defense  budget takes income from future exports into account. Now that a  large part of the discontinued equipment is bad, produces little  return, and meanwhile is rusting away, the Ministry of Defense  cannot afford to miss another major hit in the Middle East.</p>

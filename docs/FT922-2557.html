			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Keeping chambers up to standard - In a nutshell The North Derbyshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry has become the first to win BS5750 quality assurance for the entire range of its activities. The chamber, based in Chesterfield, has 1,000 members. Other chambers are expected to follow as part of a programme launched 18 months ago by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce to improve the quality of service provided by chambers nationally. A further three chambers, in Bristol, Nottinghamshire and Walsall, have qualified for the association's approval status, bringing the total of approved chambers to six. The association regards approval as the first stage in improving quality, to be followed by BS5750 accreditation. Its ultimate aim is for 50 chambers to be approved.</p>

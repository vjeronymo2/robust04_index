			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Refinery blaze hits Texaco contracts Texaco has told some of its bulk customers that it will be unable to meet certain supply contracts because of the fire at its refinery at Milford Haven in west Wales. The company cited force majeure, or forces beyond its control. The affected contracts are those for delivery in Pembrokeshire, the site of the refinery. Texaco also said it would be unable to meet swap arrangements where payment was due in Pembrokeshire. Oil companies routinely swap refined products to avoid having to ship them to distant locations. These swaps would enable Texaco to meet its commitments in other parts of the country. Texaco said last night that it could not reveal the amounts involved in the affected contracts. But it stressed that deliveries to Texaco petrol stations would not be affected. Other companies have said that they do not expect the closure of the refinery to have any noticeable effect on either supplies or petrol prices because of a refining capacity surplus. But it was expected that Texaco might lose some market share because of its inability to supply from Pembrokeshire. Officials from the Health and Safety Executive began their investigation of the damaged refinery yesterday, after the last fires had been extinguished. Texaco said it expected them to make a preliminary statement today. The fire, thought to have been started by a lightning strike on Sunday, raged for 36 hours. It forced the closure of the refinery, which accounts for 10 per cent of the UK's refining capacity. There were no serious injuries.</p>

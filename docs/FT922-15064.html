			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Technology: Computers left, right and centre - How IT is helping to improve the parties' chances of victory at next week's UK election FIVE YEARS is a longer time in technology than in politics. The performance of personal computers doubles every 12-18 months, which means that the hardware available to today's political campaigners is between 10 and 30 times more powerful than what was on offer at the last UK general election in 1987. Computers have also grown in numbers. This election has them left, right and centre, as one hardware supplier gleefully notes. At Neil Kinnock's Walworth Road headquarters in London, a McDonnell Douglas minicomputer tracks and co-ordinates the movements of the Labour party's main campaigners; on John Major's election coach, a clutch of sophisticated PCs and communications equipment provides the prime minister with instant information wherever he is in the country; and in Paddy Ashdown's pocket, a tiny PC, no bigger than a videocassette, stores speeches transmitted from his office at the House of Commons. At the constituency level, technology is far more widespread than in 1987. PCs and laser printers produce personalised letters, target different sections of the community, and on polling day, draw up lists of supporters who have yet to vote. These systems are an indispensable canvassing tool in a marginal seat. John Major's coach is equipped with the latest hardware from Apricot, the once British computer company now owned by Mitsubishi of Japan. Three desktop computers based on Intel's superfast 486 chip churn out reports, press releases and speeches. In an impressive demonstration of 1990s' technology, they hook up to a device which scans incoming faxes and converts them into files for word processing. The system ships documents around the country, through BT's Cellnet, to the computers, printers or autocue systems where they are needed. The PCs are highly secure with infra-red cards to prevent unauthorised access. At the Liberal Democrats' central office at Cowley Street, London, a new computer system came on line earlier this month to help raise funds for the election campaign. It's only a PC - but a very powerful one, again based on the 486 chip. Although it takes up a fraction of the space of the party's old UCL minicomputer, the new 'Pick' system represents a four-fold increase in processing power. 'Given the power of PCs as compared with five years ago, we've been able to upgrade by downgrading,' says Keith House, computer director. Labour, meanwhile, is several years into a computer revolution which mirrors the overall modernisation of the party's image during the 1980s. The party has been using IT in anger only since 1987 says Roger Hough, Labour's information systems manager. Since then it has installed a new minicomputer, arranged a bulk purchasing deal for constituency PCs with Opus, a maker of IBM-compatible machines, and developed its nationwide interest group, Computing for Labour, into a thriving organisation with 1,200 members. Hough's department sends out a daily election bulletin to constituencies using BT's Telecom Gold service. The bulletin sets the agenda for the day, briefing local canvassers on the progress of the national campaign, distributing press releases and suggesting answers to questions that are likely to come up on the doorstep. 'In 1987 we had about 30 constituencies using computers,' says Hough. 'Now it's more than 300. It's natural for people to use PCs - many already do so at work.' Computing for Labour (CFL) is a forum for party members who want to make their computer skills available to the cause. Its main achievement is a database called Elpack which allows a local party to store information on every voter. Names and addresses from the electoral roll, available from local authorities for a small fee per 1,000 names, are fed into the system and classified through a mixture of intuition and footwork. CFL supplies constituencies with discs containing names that suggest a particular sex, age-range or ethnic group. The system scans the database and marks people down, for example, as male, female, Asian, Greek, retired, or a first-time voter. 'Anyone with an eye for these things can identify pensioners from their forenames,' says David Wilkinson, a Labour party organiser in London. 'The system can also work out how many people live in a house - and whether they're a family or a bunch of individuals sharing.' Facts about each ward are entered such as locations of council houses and whether or not the occupants have exercised their right to buy. 'Previously we might have gone round a council estate giving out leaflets on council rents when 30 per cent of the people there had bought their homes and would have been more interested in a leaflet about mortgages,' says Wilkinson. When canvassers go on their rounds they carry canvass cards, produced by Elpack, which list all the voters in a district. Canvassers write information on the cards and enter it into Elpack when they return to base. The Liberal Democrats use software very similar to Elpack. It's called Polly and comes from a company called Democrats Election Computer System (Decs). 'Paddy Ashdown was one of the original architects,' says Polly's author, Gillian Gunner. 'He calls himself the architect,' she adds, 'but I call him the first major guinea pig.' As a priority Polly has been installed in marginal seats such as Richmond and Barnes, and Twickenham in London. Vincent Cable, the Liberal Democrat Candidate for Twickenham, finds the system invaluable. 'Your canvassing can be much more creative and useful. The traditional way is to go out in cars and chase your supporters. This time it's much more personal.' Locally, the Liberal Democrats appear to beg, steal and borrow their hardware. Unlike Labour and the Conservatives very few constituencies own a PC. They depend instead on local members bringing them in from their home or work. 'Last time we could not have managed without business people being involved,' says Peter Beardow, a Twickenham campaigner. 'Now there are more people who have computers we can borrow.' Twickenham has tested its two printers almost to destruction by producing 45,000 mailshot labels over eight hours and 2,500 canvass cards over three days. 'We're doing things you wouldn't do in a commercial environment,' says Beardow. 'The printer makers should be very proud of their products.' The Conservatives also have a constituency computer system similar to Elpack and Polly. It's called Fileplan and is supplied to local parties by Resource Management, a company based in Bath. Local Conservative parties are autonomous and can choose whatever software they like stresses Nigel Hawkes, the Tories' constituency computer adviser. However, he recommends Fileplan and Apricot. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are also using a system called Discfax for sending the contents of a floppy disc through the telephone network to a second disc at the end of the line. The Conservatives have installed Discfax on John Major's coach and at various locations around the country. The Liberal Democrats use it to send faulty software back to Decs for repair. On polling day, PCs will have another role to play. Systems such as Polly, Elpack and Fileplan will keep track of who has voted throughout the day so that forgetful supporters can be rounded up. Traditionally, the job is done with 'Reading' pads - ingenious multi-layered lists of voters with a different colour on each layer to show how many times a particular district has been visited. Reading pads have a devoted following. They're better than progams, says Alan Barnard, Labour agent for Islington South and Finsbury. 'With coloured paper laid out on a table, you can tell at a glance which areas to send people to.' Barnard commands a room full of computers and printers but does not use Elpack. Instead he has an equally-powerful database borrowed from a colleague's employer. 'Last time we were using typewriters with carbon paper. People who were working here then have come in and been amazed at what we are doing now. In 1987 we won the seat by 2 per cent and that 2 per cent was totally due to our organisation. This time our organisation is improved through computers.'</p>

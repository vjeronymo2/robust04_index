			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> LISTING BACKERS OF INITIATIVES VETOED  </P> <P> A measure that would have required backers of ballot initiatives to list  publicly any contributions of $10,000 or more toward their campaign was vetoed  by Gov. George Deukmejian. The proposal, offered by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San  Francisco), was aimed at discouraging contributions made in exchange for a  specific benefit from an initiative. The governor said he supported the bill's  purpose, but insisted that Kopp's measure would not accomplish its stated goal.  </P></p>

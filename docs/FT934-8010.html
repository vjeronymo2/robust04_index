			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Jobs: Decision makers ride a harder hobby horse - A look at free-time activities that do not necessarily tell us about interviewees THE myopic, moon-faced executive leans back to absorb the well-prepared lies that he is about to hear after posing the question: 'How do you spend you free time'? It is a common enough interview question, as well as one that usually appears in the application form. It provides a wonderful opportunity, for self-aggrandisement and impression management. 'Crosswords, computers and lacrosse' is meant to indicate 'I am literate, numerate and sporty', while 'Numismatics and icthyology' means 'I am pretentious, collect coins and have a fish tank'. 'Train-spotting and fishing' probably means 'I am honest'.) Filling out this the section on leisure activities in the a job application form is usually pleasurable, but may pose difficulties. Some people do not have leisure activities in a conventional sense: 'pontificating at dinner parties' or 'pottering round the house' do not usually qualify. For others work is their passion: Sir Peter Hall, for example, on being asked the question, replied: 'Leisure? What need I of other pastimes when I enjoy my work so]' The other concern is being caught out. It is all very well putting down 'modern jazz dancing' or 'cuckoo-clock-carving' to impress, but what if there is an expert across the table who knows more about the subject than you? According to Samuel Johnson, 'All intellectual improvement arises in leisure', while Disraeli opined that 'Increased means and increased leisure are the two civilisers of man'. Most people seem to think that an individual's choice of leisure pursuits reveals a person's needs, motives or habits. Thus extraverts, it is suggested, choose highly arousing, sociable, varied activities (disco dancing, amateur dramatics), while introverts prefer passive, retiring familiar activities (reading, collecting, computing). However, this belief overlooks two important points. First, even though one might want to participate in a particular leisure activity (which might or might not reflect one's personality), one may be prevented from doing so by circumstances beyond one's control. Second, a person's choice of occupation may also reflect needs. Thus those who have high nurturance needs may choose the medical profession; those with needs for order and silence, librarianship; the need for avarice may be fulfilled in the City; the need for power in parliament. To the extent that a person's needs are fulfilled at work, he/she may be less driven to pursue their fulfilment elsewhere, in which case leisure activities might be expected to reflect personality strivings only marginally, if at all. This notion is implicit in one of two, mutually contradictory, theories of work and leisure. According to the currently in vogue 'compensation theory', the last thing the BL worker wishes to do is to spend the weekend doing mechanical work. But if the 'spillover theory' is true, he can't wait to repair his own or his neighbour's car. Do people in fact spill over or compensate (or neither or both)? I did a little, albeit casual, research on this topic. Taking a fairly recent (1984) copy of Who's Who, I examined a semi-random sample of its distinguished decision makers, simply by looking at the entry on the top right of every fifteenth page. Most entrants specify their leisure time pursuits. They differ enormously. Some people use this as a vehicle for further self-aggrandisement: Donald Sinden lists French History and ecclesiology, and Cyril Smith charitable works. Others show they have a sense of humour: John Cleese lists gluttony and sloth, Frank Muir's is staring silently into space, while Frederick Raphael lists painting things white. The vast majority of entries, however, are curt and factual. My research (that activity which is simultaneously private, respectable and pointless) showed music to be very popular, but what came out top was gardening. Why gardening? Gardening for these Who's Whoers is a private, solo activity. Not for them the bonhomie and cameraderie of the allotment where working-class men escape their wives and families, and enjoy the odd glass of home-made wine carefully stored in the potting shed. Gardening for these decision makers is a private, quiet activity away from other people and the drone of the boardroom. Second, it is physically demanding exercise (in green wellies) that, quite literally, gets one's hands dirty. This is a nice compensation for those whose main exercise is pushing papers from left to right across smooth, well polished oak and leather-topped desks or opening a nice claret. Being physically tired from hard labour is a refreshing change from the exhaustion of a day on a committee or in a plane where thevery constraint on movement is itself exhausting. Getting dirty - being 'messy' - even more delightfully antithetical to a daily work routine which can be construed as a never-ending battle to impose order on potential chaos, ie to combat messiness, a legitimate outlet for what Freud would have termed 'anal' impulses. Third, and perhaps most importantly, gardening offers one the opportunity of activity producing something, and relatively quickly. Decision makers frequently are responsible for galvanising others into action and instigating programmes that ultimately achieve or produce something. But the time-spans are often excessively long - a bit like being an architect for a never finished cathedral or pyramid. Sometimes, indeed often, one never sees the product of one's labours. The Marxist alienation argument may apply here. Like the car worker on the conveyer belt who only screws in the rear parking lights, and never identifies with the completed vehicle that emerges shining and finished at the other end, the decision maker may never identify with, say, the new degree course or the new factory in South East Asia. Therein lies the advantage of tomato growing. One can buy the seeds, water, weed and fertilise them and, within a relatively short period of time (usually just when those red and round Dutch and Jersey tomatoes are cheapest in the shops), harvest those small, speckled, gnarled objects, proudly displaying them as the centre-piece of a Sunday lunch. There is one other possibility. Some people garden by planting oaks, by landscaping, by actually changing the environment. Michael Heseltine is one latter-day Capability Brown. For them, gardening is one way of making a lasting contribution to the future; a living monument. Life among the stocks and shares or on committees may provide money, but in many senses it is utterly ephemeral - merely the creation and circulation of paper. But to plant and tender great trees that will continue to grow and blossom long after one is dead, that has real worth. But what of the evidence for spillover: the librarian who comes home looking forward to a quiet evening with a book; the car worker who downs tools on his BL plant to take up an identical set to tinker about with his car; the cook who leaves the over-priced health food restaurant to spend an enthralled evening at a vegetarian cookery class? The problem is that, ultimately, one really has no way of knowing which theory is true in any given case. It is a little like resolving the issue of the truthfulness of antonomous proverbs: out of sight, out of mind; or absence makes the heart grow fonder. It is quite possible that both are true, but in different circumstances. What can we conclude from all of this? The 'royal road' to understanding other people's personalities is clearly not via an expose' of their leisure activities. The main function of leisure questions on application forms is probably to provide interviewers both with something to talk about when they are at a loss, and with an opportunity for legitimate voyeurism. So, beware of judging other people on the basis of their leisure activities. Your judgments may reveal more about yourself than about them.

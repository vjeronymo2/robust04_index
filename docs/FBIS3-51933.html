			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Basseterre, St. Kitts, 26 Jan, CANA -- A new session  of the St. Kitts and Nevis Parliament opened Wednesday to noisy  opposition protests.    Several supporters of the opposition St. Kitts-Nevis Labour  Party demonstrated outside parliament as Governor General Sir  Clement Arrindell read the traditional throne speech.    The Labour Party is pressing for fresh general elections,  saying the minority coalition People's Action Movement/Nevis  Reformation Party government had no moral authority to run the  twin-island state.    The last general election here, in November 1993, produced  no  clear winner. PAM and the Labour Party each took four of the 11  seats at stake.    The Nevis Reformation Party picked up just one seat and the  Concerned Citizen's Movement two.    The coalition controls just five of the 11 parliamentary  seats.    Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds this week appealed for the  maintenance of law and order ahead of the demonstration.    He said the police had given no permission for the  demonstration and warned: "Those who break the law will be dealt  with appropriately."    On Wednesday, there was a strong police presence outside the  parliament building.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Melisa Soto; from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Nine inmates and one National Guard member have  died in Aragua State, while 40 prisoners have escaped from the  Tocoron Jail through a tunnel which they built.    Director of Prisons Dora Bracho de Briceno has confirmed  this  when asked about the current situation of the country's (?32)  jails, which house approximately 25,000 inmates. In that  regard, she said that her office has instructed the National  Guard to adopt the necessary emergency measures in all of the  country's jails to prevent a repetition of the recent incidents  in Maracaibo. She added that the situation in Ciudad Bolivar  Jail--where inmates began a hunger strike, demanding better  conditions--is under control; finally, she said that what  occurred in Sabaneta should be a lesson for the government and  society.    [Begin Bracho de Briceno recording] There are five types of  inmates, all under one roof. This is what has caused the  current situation; in addition, there is only one jail for the  entire state, which is inadmissible due to the large distances  between one place to the other. In certain cases inmates must  travel eight, nine, or 10 hours to appear before a court; an  example of this is Santa Barbara de Zulia, where there are 115  prisoners. [end recording]    Bracho de Briceno will travel to Maracaibo today to assess  the situation at the Sabaneta Jail. It was also learned that  the National Guard has been instructed to adopt emergency  measures in all of the country's jails to prevent a similar  tragedy.</p>

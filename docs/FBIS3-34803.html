			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nairobi, Feb 12 (AFP) -- A Sudanese rebel leader on  Saturday called on the UN to intervene to stop what he called  the Islamic fundamentalist government's extermination and  enslavement of people in the mainly Christian south.    Riak Machar, head of one of two rival factions of the rebel  Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said Khartoum's military  government had taken advantage of the rebels' divisions to  launch its biggest offensive ever in the past two months. "An  estimated four million people are at risk of death in south  Sudan due to the Sudan government military offensive, drought  and starvation," Machar told a news conference in the Kenyan  capital Nairobi.    UN officials said at least two million people were  threatened  with starvation in the rebel-held south, as well as another two  million displaced southerners living in squalid camps around  Khartoum. They said the offensive was driving 140,000  southerners towards the Ugandan border. "The deplorable and  despicable practices of slavery and slave trade have surfaced,"  Machar said.    Speaking a day after UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali  expressed concern about the escalation of the war and widespread  human rights violations by all sides, Machar accused government  forces of kidnapping children and selling them to Sudanese  farmers and to Saudi Arabia and Libya.    He said the government was "exporting its brand of Iranian  Islamic fundamentalism to neighbouring states of Egypt, Eritrea,  Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda." Eritrea has complained of attacks  by terrorist groups based in Sudan.    Machar urged the United Nations to appoint a peace mediator  to negotiate an end to the decades-old conflict between the  Arabised north and the largely black south which erupted into  full-scale civil war in 1983.    Machar, who broke with SPLA leader John Garang in 1991 to  form the SPLA-United splinter group, urged the United Nations to  impose an oil and arms embargo on Sudan, "establish safe havens  for civilians in south Sudan, and put pressure on Khartoum to  accept an immediate ceasefire and allow in relief supplies." He  said the United Nations should send peacekeepers if Khartoum  refused to comply, dismissing suggestions that the world body  could not despatch troops without government approval.    "There is no government in south Sudan," Machar said. "The  government is in the north. We have been fighting one another  for the past 40 years. The war is a result of imposed unity and  imposed Arabic, Islam, racial hatred and religious intolerance."    Western diplomats, however, said the United Nations was  unlikely to intervene in Sudan after its debacle in Somalia.  They also noted that intervention would be complicated because  the conflict was three-sided, as Machar's Nuer tribesmen had  often fought Garang's Dinka forces. Machar denied Garang's  accusation that his forces had fought on the government's side.    The two rebel factions agreed in December to press for a  referendum on southern self-determination, a demand rejected by  the government which fears secession of the south.    The government has banned relief flights to key destinations  along the southern border with Uganda while sending warplanes  and tens of thousands of troops south in what diplomats said  looked like a final push to crush the rebellion. Most foreign  relief workers have been forced to leave.    Machar accused Khartoum of "using food as a weapon" and  trying to "exterminate the civilian population of south Sudan by  starvation."</p>

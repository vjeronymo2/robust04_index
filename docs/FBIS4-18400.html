			<p>BFN     [Text] Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein has rejected  criticism by Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  concerning the planned deportation of militant Kurds. In an  interview with western German radio this morning, Beckstein  accused the justice minister of a lack of legal knowledge,  stressing that the existing laws cover his action.  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger criticized the fact that a simple  statement by the Turkish ambassador on the security of deported  Kurds should be sufficient. She rejected the deportations as  long as it cannot be ruled out that those affected do not face  torture or death in Turkey.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'I WANT TO LET AS MANY CHILDREN AS I CAN MEET KNOW THAT LEARNING  IS EXCITING.'  </P> <P> Mission Hills resident Judi Willkins, also known as the Fairy Godmother and  Captain Morgana, Queen of the Reformed Pirates to hundreds of school children,  bought the S&amp;S International Bookshop in April to give a home to her  musical shows for children. Willkins presents as many as five shows a week at  the shop, giving children and adults a chance to mend the gap between  themselves and their heritage. She was interviewed by Times Staff Writer G.  Jeanette Avent and photographed by Bruce K. Huff.  </P> <P> I have two children, two foster children and seven grandchildren, so I've been  very involved in teaching children. When I was into ceramics, I would teach  children ceramics in my home; when I was into weaving, I would teach them  weaving. Anything I felt they wanted to learn, I would make the time to teach  them, because I didn't want them to lose the spark. I want to let as many  children as I can meet know that learning is exciting.  </P> <P> I've also been involved with music for many years. The first instrument I  played was an E Flat Alto saxophone with the Salvation Army Band. I was about  7. I thought it was so neat that they stood out on corners and played music to  people, I asked if I could join. They gave me a horn and lessons, and I played  with the band until I was about in the sixth grade.  </P> <P> About three years ago, I started a group, the Black Thorns Maritime Band, to  work with young audiences. We do shows in school, shopping malls and private  parties to teach children maritime history through stories and songs. I work  with a classically trained guitarist, bassist and flute players to give the  children a very fine musical experience, too.  </P> <P> We try to present it in a pretty exciting way, and we involve them from the  beginning. When I am Captain Morgana, Queen of the Reformed Pirates, I dress in  a huge, Renaissance-style dress with all kinds of jewels and a big cap with  feathers in it.  </P> <P> I'm trying to present what I think is a wonderful tradition and one that is  beneficial to children. Storytelling demands that children create their own  images. I tell them we are going to take them on an imaginary trip back in time  when pirates and thieves roved these great seas of ours. There's a real  theatrical work to bring them into the story. We pretend we are taking the Star  of India, and we're going to need a crew. Hands go up all over the audience.  </P> <P> In the maritime show, we talk about the different areas the sailors and pirates  came from. When we're rounding the coast of New England we talk about sailors  from Wales, England and Ireland. When we travel into the Caribbean, South  America and to China by way of Hawaii, we have different kinds of songs and  stories.  </P> <P> The songs tell us a little bit about the world. They tell us what people were  thinking. They tell us what life was like. There are very few good, written  pictures of life on the big whaling ships. Those men didn't keep big diaries.  But in those songs, you can hear how rough their lives were. One of our tips to  the children is how to be observant and listen to what a song says because  they'll learn something from it. At the end of the show, I encourage them to be  a part of that creating spirit that tells the world a little about their view.  If I can get one child excited about writing stories, I'll tell stories till  the cows come home.  </P> <P> When I do the fairy godmother I talk about European history, Celtic history and  tradition. Storytelling is about tradition. It's about an oral tradition that  preserves history and explains the world in the best way people could before  there were books and before there were as many explanations for the world as  there are today. It's about magic and about dreams coming true.  </P> <P> I've been doing the children's shows full time for eight years. Senior citizens  love them too. With the seniors, I encourage them to leave as a legacy not  their money or their jewels or their china, but to leave the story of their  lives. There is no more important legacy to leave your children than the story  of when you were a child because that can never happen again. This comes out of  a real concern for what has happened to our family structure. The family  structure of the '40s and '50s has changed dramatically because of the economic  demands that have been placed on the family. As we are evolving toward a new  structure, what is happening is that the elders in the community who typically  were the ones who had a lot of time to spend with the children, the ones who  passed on the lessons of morals and ethics, are living in communities of their  own, living away from their family. Those lessons aren't being passed on to  children, and the parents are too busy to do it.  </P> <P> I'm working with and promoting an intergenerational type of experience between  children and the elders of our community. At the very least, when one of their  grandchildren has a birthday, I encourage grandparents to write a story of the  birthday that was the most important in their life. When the next new baby  comes along in the family, write the story of when their daughter was born and  what it felt like to hold her in their arms. Children need to feel this tie  with their heritage, this tie with their family, this tie with their ancestry.  </P> <P> I've been getting some very fine feedback on that. Some people have actually  written little books, and given them as gifts during Christmas to all the  grandchildren, about their favorite Christmas. I think a lot of effort ought to  be made to bring children and grandparents together.  </P></p>

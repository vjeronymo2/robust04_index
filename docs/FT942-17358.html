			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Whatever minor distractions the Treasury bond market may have in the coming days, there are only two questions hanging over it: when will the Federal Reserve next raise rates, and by how much? Any lingering doubts that another rate hike is on the cards seemed to be dispelled by Friday's figures showing a 456,000 seasonally-adjusted rise in non-farm payrolls in March. This was nearly double the consensus estimate on Wall Street and appeared to confirm that economic growth in the first quarter, though dented by bad weather, had not slowed by as much as had been expected from the buoyant fourth quarter of last year. Officially, the markets were closed for the Good Friday holiday, but there were enough traders on hand to mark prices down by around a point and a half. That judgment was confirmed when the market got back to work in earnest yesterday morning, with the yield on the benchmark long bond hovering around 7.25 per cent. The Federal Open Markets Committee, which determines interest rate policy, is not due to meet again until May 17. In a market that is scared of its own shadow, though, last Friday's news raised fresh fears that it will act sooner.</p>

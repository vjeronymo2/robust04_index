			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTER DEAL FOR POLITICAL REFUGEES  </P> <P> For Central Americans, who make up 80% of those seeking asylum in the United  States, Immigration and Naturalization Service policies have often seemed a  double standard: Nicaraguans, seeking asylum from the Sandinista regime that  was fighting U.S.-backed Contra rebels, were regularly welcomed. But those  fleeing violence in U.S.-allied El Salvador and Guatemala, for example, were  usually refused sanctuary.  </P> <P> INS officials must currently follow State Department assessments of whether a  refugee's fear of persecution in the home country is "well-founded". This  screening method has sparked charges that the process is too politicized.  Indeed, in order for the State Department to acknowledge political persecution  and rights abuses under U.S.-supported governments, it must sometimes  contradict its own foreign-policy assessments.  </P> <P> The controversy surrounding past U.S. asylum practices was highlighted by the  1986 trial and conviction of U.S. church workers on charges they illegally  housed refugees in churches. The defendants, activists in the so-called  Sanctuary movement, sought to publicize what they saw as the misguided ideology  of American refugee policy.  </P> <P> Critics may be assuaged by newly announced INS methods of determining which  petitions should be granted. The effect of the new guidelines could be  especially noticeable in Southern California, one of the principal ports of  entry for refugees.  </P> <P> The changes will include the appointment of 70-90 investigators who will  receive special training in asylum law and on the conditions in  refugee-producing countries. The new asylum unit needn't rely on State  Department evaluations of refugees' fears and instead can use documentation  from such organizations as Amnesty International. Also, a refugee no longer  will need to prove that he or she has been targeted for persecution. Instead,  INS investigators will decide whether a petitioner's story is plausible, given  the patterns of oppression in the home country.  </P> <P> If rigorously embraced, the policy changes will be a laudable step closer not  only to world asylum standards but to a realistic system for coping with the  burgeoning flood of would-be U.S. immigrants.  </P></p>

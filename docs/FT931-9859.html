			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen consolidates its strength THE YEN yesterday consolidated its stronger position against both the dollar and the D-Mark, as dealers continued to speculate on the possibility of a G7 accord to reduce the Japanese trade surplus, writes James Blitz. The yen climbed to Y120.64 against the dollar before closing at Y120.90, up from Y121.35. It finished at Y73.00 to the D-Mark, from a previous close of Y73.42. In New York it ended at Y121.23 per dollar. The Clinton administration has indicated that the Japanese trade surplus is a matter of deep concern. But there was scepticism yesterday over whether US and Japanese officials would agree to boost the currency further when they meet this weekend. According to Mr Mark Cliffe, chief economist at Nomura Securities in London, the main policy debate in Tokyo is on how to boost the fiscal stimulus to the economy rather than on raising interest rates. Mr Neil Mackinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, said the Japanese currency will not strengthen very much because interest rates in Tokyo are unlikely to rise in the near term, limiting the returns for potential investors. He believes the yen could appreciate to Y65 to the D-Mark and that there may be a test of the historic high of Y119.00 against the dollar, set on September 28 last year. 'But I do not see the 16 to 20 per cent appreciation in the yen/dollar rate which some people are suggesting,' he said. Inside the European exchange rate mechanism, there were growing signs of tension in spite of last week's cuts in the Bundesbank's official interest rates. The Bundesbank's decision to accept a tender for its repo at 8.50 per cent, against 8.57 per cent last week, was widely expected by the market, although it raised concern that German policy-easing was on the slow side. The Belgian authorities raised their end-of-day support rate by 50 basis points, to 9.3 per cent, to counter selling pressure on the Belgian franc. The authorities have privately committed their currency to diverge by only a limited amount against the D-Mark in the ERM grid. But dealers were yesterday buying currency options to hedge against a weaker Belgian franc in the event that the ERM breaks up - and this pushed the Belgian franc as much as 30 basis points away from the D-Mark. The Belgian currency was only 10 basis points weaker than the D-Mark on the grid last night. But Mr Mark Austin, a Treasury economist at Midland Global Markets in London, remained pessimistic. 'It is hard to believe that we will get through the run-up to the French elections next month without fireworks in the ERM,' he said. Sterling yesterday traded more comfortably after two hair-raising days against the D-Mark and dollar. It closed unchanged at DM2.3625 and slightly easier at Dollars 1.4275. In New York it dipped to Dollars 1.4236.</p>

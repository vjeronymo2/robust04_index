			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / 'No mercy' warning to Algerians ALGERIANS were warned last night the security forces would show no mercy if attempts were made today to disrupt public order, by 'enemies of the nation', writes Tony Walker in Algiers. The Interior Ministry warning, broadcast on Algiers Radio, came on the eve of a threatened mass demonstration in Algiers by followers of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which is outlawed under a state of emergency proclaimed last week. The broadcast said the security forces were determined to 'find and neutralise all terrorists and authors of unrest and subversive acts'. This latest warning followed an attack yesterday on a guard post at a naval repair yard in Algiers in which one guard died and two others were wounded. Algiers Radio reported that two of the assailants were killed in an exchange of gunfire.</p>

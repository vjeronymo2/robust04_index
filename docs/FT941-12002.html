			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Profits rich in culture - A man who exemplifies the Mittelstand Business school academics have found at least 200 ways of defining the German Mittelstand, the broad swathe of medium-sized, privately-owned companies which dominate corporate Germany. Size - in terms of turnover and the number of employees - is the obvious yardstick but not the best way of defining a Mittelstand company, says Berthold Leibinger, the 63-year-old chief executive and majority shareholder in Trumpf, a machine-tools company based in Ditzingen near Stuttgart in south-west Germany. Better, the machine-tools entrepreneur contends, is to think in terms of a philosophy of management, a network of distinct values shared by thousands of small, medium-sized and large German companies. At the core of this cluster of values are two qualities: a passionate desire for independence and a fascination with technology. Coupled together, these qualities lead to strong emotional ties between the entrepreneur and the products which his company makes, Leibinger argues. These values have deep cultural roots, explains Leibinger, the son of an oriental art-dealer from the small village of Muhlheim-bei-Tuttlingen in the heart of the state of Baden-Wurttemberg. Leibinger cites a law dating back to 1548 which saw to it that family fortunes in the south-west of Germany had to be divided equally between all children, including daughters. The very opposite of primogeniture - the system whereby family wealth was passed from father to eldest son  - the system of 'realteilung' prevented the accumulation of wealth. Families were obliged to set up small businesses in order to enhance meagre living standards. These were the forerunners of some of Germany's most successful industrial companies. Baden-Wurttemberg is still known for its 'tuftlers', amateur engineers who while away winter evenings working in their shops, attempting to solve apparently unsolvable technical problems. 'Go up to the Schwabische Alb (a range of hills near Stuttgart) and you'll still find hundreds of these workshops,' says Leibinger. The modern-day mechanics working away at weekends and evenings in cellars and garages are the successors of 'tuftlers' such as Robert Bosch or Karl Benz, Baden-Wurttemberg entrepreneurs whose businesses evolved into some of Europe's biggest industrial groups. Leibinger contends that the relationship between the technician and his invention is far closer than that of the financier investing money into a business in a dispassionate way in the hope of making a profit. This distinction, he believes, helps explain the difference between the nature of Anglo-American capitalism and the German version. In the UK or the US, the bulk of industrial activity is conducted by stock-market-quoted companies, financed by profit-oriented investors; by contrast in Germany the stock-market plays a limited role in the country's economic life. Even those German companies which are stock-market listed (664 in total compared with about 3,000 in the UK) tend to be majority-owned by families, other companies and by financial institutions - with the result that the management priorities of quoted companies tend to be little different from those of private ones. The insulation from the pressure to generate short-term profits is one factor behind Germany's post-war success, Leibinger argues. It is also a reason why he is reluctant to bring Trumpf to the stock-market, even though with turnover of DM620m last year he could easily consider such a move. Leibinger, who points to his son-in-law (currently production director) as a potential successor, conforms exactly to his own definition of a 'Mittelstandler'. A practising protestant and a self-confessed 'tuftler', he comes from a family of surgical instrument makers which has lived in the same village for generations. He has 20 patents outstanding for machine-tools and when still at university he invented the 'copy nibbling' process which became a standard throughout the industry. The income from this and other inventions helped him raise the finance to buy out the Trumpf family in 1973. Under Leibinger's direction, the company grew rapidly to become one of the world's largest manufacturers of machines for punching, nibbling, bending and forming sheet-metal. But the growth has, come to a halt: so severe is the recession afflicting the sector that Trumpf made a loss last year for the first time in 40 years. The group lost DM48.9m on turnover down 9 per cent to DM620m in the year to July. Other companies have fared far worse under the dismal combination of falling demand and high costs, their problems exacerbated by the strength of the D-Mark. Critics have looked at sectors of the economy such as the machine-tool industry and suggested that traditional Mittelstand virtues have now become a handicap. They argue that the love of independence has blinded company managers to the need for strategic mergers and that the obsession with technology helped Mittelstand companies fall into the trap of making sophisticated products for their own sake, without taking account of customers' needs. By implication Leibinger accepts one aspect of this criticism: part of his response to the recession has been to put a new emphasis on 'value-for-money' manufacturing. 'We are trying to introduce new machines with the same or improved technical features as the old ones but with a 20 to 25 per cent cost reduction,' he says. But he rejects the other element of the critique: that Mittelstand companies need to merge with one another to survive. 'If the German machine-tool industry consisted of six to eight big conglomerates, rather than hundreds of independent companies, the impact of the current recession on the labour market would be far worse than it has been,' Leibinger says, true to his deeply-rooted Mittelstandler values. 'Independent family-owned businesses add stability to the business community, especially in difficult times.'</p>

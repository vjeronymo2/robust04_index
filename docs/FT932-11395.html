			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Brussels worried over steel subsidy moves THE EUROPEAN Commission is increasingly concerned that the EC-wide plan to support the ailing west European steel industry could be derailed by member states' attempts to subsidise their national producers. EC industry ministers meet today in Brussels to discuss the progress of the plan so far, in the wake of the Commission's rejection last week of German proposals to restructure Ekostahl, the east German producer, and scepticism about a new rationalisation plan from Ilva, the loss-making Italian steelmaker. The Commission has not yet submitted formal proposals to the ministers on any of the most controversial state subsidy cases, but it is pressing for a special meeting in July to consider German, Italian and Spanish steel aid plans together. On Friday, Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, told Mr Michele Tedeschi, the managing director of Iri, the Italian state holding company which controls Ilva, that the Commission needed to have a clearer view of the subsidies involved in the new plan, and the reduction of capacity it might involve. Iri claims the restructuring plan involves no state aid, and is based on the behaviour of a private sector shareholder. Moreover, as the plants it plans to retain are already efficient and competitive, they should not be subject to production cuts. Commission officials fear this may herald lengthy negotiations which could jeopardise decisions on the other state aid cases, and the EC industry's own restructuring plan. 'It's out of the question to come to a decision on the Spanish plan, or on Ekostahl, if at the same time we drag our feet on Ilva,' said one senior official. The Ilva restructuring plan involves creating a new company, Nuova Siderurgica, specialising in flat laminates. Nuova Siderurgica, with assets of L2,770bn (Dollars 1.9bn) and net shareholders' funds of L1,900bn, would be profitable and have a 'balanced' financial position, according to Iri. Net borrowing at the group would be just a fraction of Ilva's L7,583bn net debts at the end of last year. Other Ilva operations and shareholdings will be sold, either directly, or via Iri, to raise L2,700bn. Iri would also take on some Ilva debt as part of the liquidation of the remaining operations. A precise figure has not been revealed, but has been estimated at about L2,500bn. The proceeds of asset sales would be used to lower Ilva's debts. The group, which is Europe's fourth biggest steelmaker, reported a net group loss of L2,309bn last year on sales of L10,087bn. Iri will be sole owner of the new company at the outset, but intends gradually to lower its stake below 50 per cent, perhaps through joint ventures with domestic or foreign steelmakers. It is hard to see how the new company will raise L2,700bn through asset sales given the present European steel crisis. Much of the cash may come from 'selling' assets to Iri, which will then oversee their eventual disposal. The chances of bringing private shareholders into Nuova Siderurgica also look slim in the short term. EC set to reclaim Klockner-Werke loan, Page 17</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Brussels setback for media owners The European Commission yesterday backed away from proposals to harmonise rules on media ownership, frightened that action to make it easier for media companies to invest across borders could prompt an outcry from member states. The decision represents a setback for Commission plans to prepare the single market for the so-called 'information society' and the revolution that will come from new communications technologies. Commission officials argue that the current patchwork of national rules hampers investment, while member states see Brussels venturing into areas best left to national governments. Harmonisation of rules on media ownership was one of four areas identified in the report by Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner, on global communications, where Union action was essential to establish a common regulatory framework for the community. Other fields included privacy, protection of intellectual property rights and encryption. Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, the commissioner responsible for the single market, said yesterday the Commission was preparing a further round of consultation with industry before deciding next year whether media ownership legislation at European level was necessary. Media companies complain that existing rules are unfair. For instance there is no limit on the number of satellite television stations that can be owned by one company in the UK, while in Italy no one company can own more than three satellite or terrestrial stations. In France and Spain the limit is one. In the Netherlands, newspaper publishers with a market share of more than 25 per cent are not allowed to own TV channels. Single market officials yesterday insisted that initial suggestions put forward on media ownership had been misunderstood. They argued that the Commission did not intend to produce rules that interfered with national policy on media ownership, but ones that would facilitate transnational investments. 'We have defined a middle course which will safeguard a number of interests. The Commission is not seeking to be invasive in this field.' said Mr Vanni D'Archirafi.</p>

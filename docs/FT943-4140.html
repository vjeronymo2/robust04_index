Calor has accused the union of blurring the issue. Most employees, it said, did not want to be involved in an industrial dispute and about half of those offered new contracts had already signed. Mr John Harris, Calor's director of operations and human resources, said: 'It is very unfortunate that our employees have become caught up in a confrontation which the TGWU has chosen to have with the company.' The management is to meet union officials on Monday for discussions on the transport division.

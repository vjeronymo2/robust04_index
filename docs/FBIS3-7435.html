Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary for Defence Suwit  Chantharapradit yesterday emphatically ruled out the likelihood  of another coup, which he described as an idea "as extinct as  dinosaurs". The article, entitled "Fear No Coup" and written  under the pseudonym "Lt Col Tatthiam Yiamnakhon", argues that  contrary to popular belief, the armed forces' hunger for power  is not the main cause of most government takeovers.    "The notion that coups were caused by over-ambitious  soldiers  is an unscientific explanation because military officers never  covet the power to rule. All of them only want to defend the  country against outside threat," the anonymous writer claims.  "Rather the main cause of most coups were shortcomings on the  part of the country's democratic system," he says.    The writer says military men never initiated a coup but were  asked by the government's opponents and disempowered groups, and  members of the public.    "Other warning signs were harsh criticism by the mass media  and a show of frustration by academics," he says.</p>

The requirements of the U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade are the same as those of the U.S. No. 1 grade, with two exceptions. The first relates to bunch size. Under the U.S. No. 1 grade, there is a minimum bunch size requirement of 4 ounces. Under the U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade, bunches must weigh at least 2 ounces but not more than 5 ounces. The second difference is that at least 95 percent of the containers in a lot of grapes grading U.S. No. 1 Institutional must be legibly marked ``Institutional Pack,'' whereas no such marking requirement applies under the U.S. No. 1 grade. In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling, both grades provide a tolerance of 8 percent for off-size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> bunches and for bunches and berries failing to meet other grade requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The California Desert Grape Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order, met on November 4, 1993, and unanimously recommended relaxing the quality requirements in the handling regulations to allow an additional bunch size tolerance for grapes which would otherwise grade U.S. No. 1 Institutional.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule provides an additional tolerance of 25 percent, or a total of 33 percent, for bunches of grapes that would otherwise meet the U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the 1992 season, the minimum grade requirement in effect under the order was U.S. No. 1 grade. The U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade was authorized as a means of allowing the industry to fulfill demands of the foodservice industry (e.g., restaurants and schools) for smaller sized bunches of grapes than are preferred in other markets. However, the domestic table grape industry has experienced difficulty in meeting the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade due to the 8 percent tolerance for off-sized bunches. The committee believes that establishing an additional tolerance for off-sized bunches in the handling regulation will promote sales of grapes packed for institutional use. Due to the requirements of the current handling regulation, California table grape handlers are unable to ship smaller grape bunches because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8 percent off-size bunch tolerance of the U.S. No. 1 Institutional grade. This has required handlers to repack grapes after they have been packed in the vineyards, resulting in packing costs that are prohibitively high for the modest prices paid by buyers of institutional grade grapes. Allowing an additional 25 percent bunch size tolerance is expected to allow the industry to more fully utilize its grapes in the marketplace. This final rule allows handlers to mark containers of grapes meeting the modified requirements as ``DGAC No. 1 Institutional.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 8e of the Act, table grapes imported into the United States are subject to the same minimum grade requirements as those in effect for domestically grown grapes under the marketing order. Those requirements are found in Table Grape Import Regulation 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [7 CFR part 944.503]. Because this final rule will provide an additional tolerance for off-size bunches of grapes under the domestic handling regulation, the same change is being made in the table grape import regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, this rule will also update references to government contacts and sources of regulatory information in both the domestic and import regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposed rule concerning this revision of minimum grade requirements was issued on July 11, 1994, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 15, 1994, [59 FR 36091]. That rule provided a 15-day comment period which ended August 1, 1994. One comment was received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. T. Albert Yamada of Masaoka &amp; Associates, Inc. filed a comment on behalf of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas opposed to the committee's recommendation. Mr. Yamada contends that the proposed relaxation would degrade the quality of grapes offered to the public, and allow sales of very small bunches regardless of the quality of the individual grapes on the bunch. However, Marketing Order regulations will require that grapes grading U.S. No. 1 Institutional under the relaxed bunch size tolerance meet the same quality requirements as before this relaxation. This rule will not impact the quality of grapes. It will only affect the bunch size tolerance for grapes destined for foodservice outlets. Therefore, the comment submitted by Mr. Yamada is denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

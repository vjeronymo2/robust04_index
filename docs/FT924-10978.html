			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Policy begins at home: Domestic considerations have moved to the top of the political agenda worldwide A disturbing tremor is running through the political leadership of the world's leading economies. In the US, President George Bush is facing a desperate struggle for political survival. In Europe, the British government is reeling from a string of crises which has undermined its authority; the French Socialists fear for their political futures; the Italian government is struggling to achieve vital political and economic reforms; across the EC, lights have almost gone out on political and monetary integration. Meanwhile in Japan, the Takeshita faction, the central pillar of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, is embroiled in a power struggle to replace its fallen kingmaker, Mr Shin Kanemaru. The struggle could seriously disable the Miyazawa administration as it attempts to revive the ailing economy. Clearly, the elements of this political turmoil are not all alike. Yet they share a common thread. They are all part of a great turn inwards in politics, away from international commitments towards domestic agendas. In each case the balance between international and domestic priorities is being readjusted. In the late 1980s it became fashionable to predict that national politics would be overtaken by the internationalisation of political power. According to this view, the nation state was being superseded as the base for political power, as national policies were increasingly circumscribed by international factors, particularly the flow of the international economy across national borders. Instead, this year will mark the revenge of national politics, as domestic considerations in the most powerful economies take precedence over international considerations. In the US, Europe and Japan, ambitious attempts to align national political priorities with international commitments are being unwound in favour of more modest attempts to put the domestic economic house in order. This shift is most pronounced in the US. Two years ago President Bush basked in the afterglow of the Gulf war and the west's triumph over communism in eastern Europe. But in the past 18 months the domestic economy has taken priority. The dominant theme of the presidential campaign has been a call for America to redirect its energies to the domestic agenda at the expense of commitments abroad. Until very recently European leaders were confident that economic and monetary union was the best way forward. The line between domestic and international politics has become increasingly blurred in Europe as national sovereignty has been superseded by the Community in more and more areas. But the move towards integration may have stalled. The Maastricht treaty is in danger of running into the sand as its architects reassess the prospects for economic convergence and the democratic credentials of the institutions it seeks to create. But most important, integration has been thrown off-course by the assertion of German national priorities. So far, the country's policy of paying for the costs of unification without significant tax increases has forced others, particularly the UK, to reassess the feasibility of economic integration around the core of the German economy. The German turn inwards has forced others to do the same. Japan is slightly different. Since the second world war it has been cautious in its international commitments. It has just taken its first, tentative moves towards a more active foreign policy through its overseas aid programme and its increasing involvement in UN peacekeeping activities in Asia. However, in Japan too, political turmoil has been provoked by a turn inwards. In the late 1980s Japanese economic policy was largely designed to meet US demands that the Japanese trade surplus should be reduced. To achieve that end authorities stimulated the domestic economy through relatively loose monetary policy, which in turn inflated the bubble economy of soaring stock prices and real estate values. Over the past two years, however, the Japanese economic authorities have reasserted the importance of economic policy being directed towards domestic stability rather than international commitments. As the bubble economy has been deflated, so have the reputations of the politicians who prospered during its heyday. This great turn inwards to put domestic economic houses in order may be necessary. But it carries at least two significant risks. The first is a risk for the world's weaker economies. As the main industrialised countries are increasingly preoccupied with their own problems they may become more reluctant to direct policies and investment towards other countries. Even political leaders of weaker economies in Europe, such as the UK and Ireland, may find it difficult to gain influence with German pol-icymakers. For economic officials in eastern Europe and Africa, the sense of exclusion will be that much greater. In these regions, the need to find levers to influence policy in their more powerful partners will become an increasingly vital task. The second risk confronts the leading economies themselves. The turn inwards could well prove fertile ground for protectionist politics. The introspection of 1992 may mark the ebbing of ambitious international designs for economic co-operation. The danger is that it may yet send the tide flowing in the other direction.</p>

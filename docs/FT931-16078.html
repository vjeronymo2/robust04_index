			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: US retailers post strong advance over Christmas MOST leading US retailers sounded a cheery note yesterday as they reported the best Christmas period sales for several years. Improvements were particularly noticeable among leading department stores, and many said results had come in above their expectations. Federated Department Stores, which takes in chains such as Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Straus and The Bon Marche, reported a same-store sales increase of about 10 per cent in December. 'December sales were the strongest we've seen in several years,' noted Mr Allen Questrom, chairman. He added the company was encouraged about 1993 although it expected some cooling-off in levels of consumer activity in the first quarter. JC Penney, based in Texas, saw a 9.1 per cent advance in same-store sales, with strong gains in the women's, men's, children's and home merchandise divisions. At May Department Stores, December same-store sales were up by 8.4 per cent, and at Dayton Hudson 9.5 per cent. Many analysts had forecast same-store sales improvements for the department store sector of 4 per cent to 7 per cent. In the discount sector, Wal-Mart, the nation's top-selling store chain, saw a 27 per cent rise in total sales during December, to Dollars 5.86bn, and an increase from comparable stores of 10 per cent. This means the group's like-for-like sales in the first 11 months of the financial year were running at 11 per cent. K mart, Wal-Mart's rival in the discount sector, saw a smaller 2.5 per cent gain in like-for-like general merchandise sales, and a 2.2 per cent improvement from its speciality chains. It predicted record after-tax profits for 1992 - exceeding the Dollars 859m seen in 1991 - but said earnings per share would probably be static at around Dollars 2.02. Woolworth fared poorly, posting only a 1 per cent improvement in domestic same-store sales in December. Sears, Roebuck - whose retail operations have been the focus of much shareholder disquiet - ended 1992 in much-improved form, posting an 8.2 per cent advance in same-store sales for the month.</p>

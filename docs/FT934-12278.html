			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Battle is joined for HK's dailies - A report on a new daily paper in Hong Kong, planning to challenge the South China Morning Post JUST weeks after millionaire Mr Robert Kuok paid Dollars 349m to Mr Rupert Murdoch for control of the South China Morning Post (the Post), Hong Kong's leading English language newspaper, its effective monopoly is to be challenged. Oriental Press, the most profitable Chinese language publisher in Hong Kong, is to launch a new English language newspaper, the first in more than a decade. Mr Herman Hui, executive director of Oriental Press, said the group would be able to launch a newspaper by the end of December, but would not proceed unless it was confident it could break even within 'a few months'. It has already poached a significant number of journalists from the Post and appointed an editor. The launch is linked to the Post's change of ownership, which was seen as a political move. Mr Kuok is a major investor in China and an appointed adviser to Beijing on Hong Kong affairs; few believed he would not change the editorial policy. By comparison, Oriental Press Group's main newspaper, the Oriental Daily, is firmly pro-Hong Kong's governor, Chris Patten. Its move has been encouraged by some government officials as a means of encouraging a free press in Hong Kong. The group's image as a saviour of free speech is somewhat tainted, however, by the fact that its founder, Ma Sik-chun and his brother 'White Powder' Ma Sik-yu, fled the colony for Taiwan in 1977 and 1978, to escape heroin trafficking charges. The Ma family owns 70 per cent of Oriental Press. Competition is seen as positive for readers, advertisers and the freedom of the Hong Kong press, but it could be costly for the shareholders of both companies. Stakes are high. South China Morning Post (Holdings) made net profit of HKDollars 494m (USDollars 63.9m) in the year to June 1993, almost exclusively from the Post. The daily paper has a readership of only 238,000, but advertising rates reflect the spending power of its top-flight readership. Oriental Press Group made HKDollars 420m in the year to March 1993, and boasts 1.63m readers - one-third of the entire Hong Kong newspaper market. Despite supporting Mr Patten's democratic reform programme, the paper is generally more interested in gossip on the local film industry's starlets. Most likely victim of the battle is the existing 'second paper', the Hong Kong Standard. It has failed to break the Post's arm-lock on advertising - despite under-cutting prices - and it seems unlikely the small market for English language newspapers can bear three products. However, it is the Post's readership and advertisers that Oriental is targeting. The Post has promised a round of pay rises to counter further staff defections and the new management is keen to counter suggestions that a change of tack towards Beijing may antagonise existing readers. Mr Kuok said that the editorial policy would not change and the Post would remain 'a Hong Kong newspaper dedicated to Hong Kong's best interests'. Oriental Press would not reveal how expensive its gamble will be. It has the spare printing and office capacity to operate another newspaper at little extra cost. It also has a net cash position of around HKDollars 500m, more than enough to fund the salaries and the enormous launch campaign. But they are facing a formidable adversary. In the mid-1970s there were four English language newspapers, but they did little to damage the Post's earnings stream. It has emerged as one of the world's most profitable newspapers. Mr Kuok can afford to be relatively sanguine. His enormous influence in the local business community will ensure continued patronage for his new project, whatever the support for the new competitor. In addition, after 1997 he could expect to be recompensed by the government for any adverse favouritism shown in Hong Kong's dying days as a British colony.</p>

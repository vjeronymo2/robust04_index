The supplement would revise the definition of purpose and need for the proposed Federal action that will be used in the environmental review of applications for renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses. This action was developed in response to public comments on the proposed rule. The redefinition presented in the supplement to the proposed rule would also affect the identification of alternatives to the proposed action that will be considered in environmental reviews for license renewal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments by September 8, 1994.

Concurrently, the NRC published NUREG&hyph;1437, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  a draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) that contained the analysis which NRC proposed to codify in 10 CFR Part 51. In commenting on the proposed rule and the draft GEIS, a number of States expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment of need for generating capacity, alternative energy sources, and certain other issues. They expressed strong concerns that the proposed rule would intrude adversely on traditional State regulatory authority over these matters. They expressed concern that designation of need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources as Category 1 <FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>  <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  issues would substantially eliminate public participation, would adversely affect independent State consideration of these matters, and would inadequately provide for use of current, project specific information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Copies of NUREG&hyph;1437 may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Mail Stop SSOP, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9328.

To facilitate discussion of these matters the NRC staff developed an options paper entitled ``Addressing The Concerns Of States And Others Regarding The Role Of Need For Generating Capacity, Alternative Energy Sources, Utility Costs, And Cost-Benefit Analysis In NRC Environmental Reviews For Relicensing Nuclear Power Plants: An NRC Staff Discussion Paper.''

During the past eight years, almost all the previously  barren  hills in the province have been covered with green, two years  ahead of the provincial government's "ten-year greening  schedule" initiated in 1985.    In the new effort the province plans to plant some 3.33  million ha [hectare] of ecological woods, which will serve  purposes such as water and soil conservation, coastal  windbreaking, nature reserves and forest tourism.    The necessary funds will be mainly set aside in the budget  plan of governments at various levels, but the project will also  receive money from the state and the general public.    Meanwhile, the provincial government has called on local  authorities to plant more fast-growing trees, exert more efforts  in processing forestry products and tap forestry tourism  resources.</p>

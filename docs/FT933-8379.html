			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Economics Notebook: A government dilemma over labour costs In something as complex as the British government machine it is impossible to avoid some conflict between different policy objectives. But a potentially damaging conflict is emerging in a field close to the government's heart: non-wage labour costs. These costs have always been relatively low in Britain because healthcare and much of welfare spending is paid for out of general taxation. Several continental European countries, by contrast, impose big payroll taxes on employers and employees. According to the European Commission, non-wage labour costs add an average of 30 per cent to employment costs in the EC. The figure approaches 50 per cent in Germany, France, Italy and Belgium, but is only 13 per cent in Britain, primarily national insurance. The government believes that low non-wage labour costs, combined with relatively light labour regulation, are an important part of the UK's comparative economic advantage. The small 'tax' on jobs contributes to a high proportion of adults in work as well as sucking in a disproportionate level of inward investment. The 'opt-out' from the Maastricht treaty's social chapter on minimum employment rights, apparently a policy triumph for prime minster Mr John Major, was fought for on the grounds that it allowed Britain to hang on to its low non-wage labour costs. Yet much of what the government is doing, or planning, runs counter to this commitment. In the current review of public spending, ministers openly speculate about transferring welfare costs from the state to individuals and employers, threatening to send non-wage labour costs climbing. And, curiously, if more costs were to be transferred to employers, it would be consistent with what has actually happened over the past 10 years. In the early 1980s the government abolished the redundancy fund, which allowed employers to claim back the costs of statutory redundancy pay. In 1991 employers were made responsible for paying 20 per cent of statutory sick pay benefits. Just last week the government announced that employers would have to foot the bill for improvements to maternity pay required by a European directive. The government also plans to cap the reimbursement employers receive for employing disabled people and will require employers to deduct child support payments from recalcitrant fathers. (In the case of the maternity directive and the disablement cap the government will be creating disincentives to pursue its own equal opportunities goals.) The government's response is to point out that most of these burdens are short-term and inexpensive. The extra maternity payments are, for example, said to be just 0.02 per cent of Britain's wages bill. The government would also argue that, thanks to the social chapter opt-out, non-wage labour costs will be rising from a low base. But it is the trend that is worrying. According to the government's own figures, non-wage labour costs have doubled over the past 20 years. And the administrative burden is often more important than the direct cost. Already employers have to deal with PAYE for the state and, encouraged by the government, about half of all employees are in company pension schemes. These have, until recently, produced great financial benefits for many companies, but still impose a considerable administrative cost. 'Despite its rhetoric the government seems to be drifting towards the discredited continental European model of employer-based welfare,' warns Mr Ira Chalphin of the Institute of Directors. It is not only employers' organisations which complain about new overheads. There is a consensus among labour market analysts that shifting the welfare burden away from employers is good for employment and labour market flexibility. The latest OECD Employment Outlook says that the financing of social security systems should switch from payroll taxes to other taxes that 'have a less unfavourable impact on employment'. Even the European Commission's Employment in Europe report, normally more sympathetic to continental European labour markets, says that high employers' contributions encourage the black economy. There are some things to be said for payroll taxes. From an employee's point of view they may help to protect welfare payments from the vagaries of government spending. From an employer's point of view they help to reduce unwanted labour turnover by locking-in employees. But that also creates a 'lock-out' effect for the unemployed by increasing the fixed cost of employment. In any case even in countries with low statutory payroll costs, employers can provide discretionary benefits such as private health care and company cars to those employees they want to lock in. Several continental European countries are currently trying to unload some of their payroll taxes on to general taxation. Belgium is trying to reduce employers' social security contributions in export industries by introducing a national energy tax and the new French government wants to cut the family allowances that employers have to pay. Low non-wage labour costs are vital for Britain's 'work-sharing' economy, in which part-time employment plays an important role, because employers are relatively indifferent as to whether they employ a large number of people for short periods or a smaller number for long periods. Britain is a low-wage economy compared with France or Germany, but due to the high level of employment, national income per head is not far behind those countries. Higher non-wage labour costs would jeopardise that balance. The UK is not the only highly-indebted government facing a dilemma over non-wage labour costs. Across the Atlantic the Clinton administration is facing an even more blatant conflict between its aim of creating a large number of jobs, and its objective of implementing a national health insurance programme which would, inevitably, increase the cost of hiring.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by Lieutenant General of Medical Services Valentin </F> Ivanovich Yevstigneyev, deputy chief of the Russian Federation  Defense Ministry Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Protection  Forces, "at the request of the Russian Defense Ministry  Information and Press Directorate": "The Military Do Not Deceive  Their Commander in Chief" -- first two paragraphs are KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA introduction]    [Text] The UK newspaper THE SUNDAY TIMES published an  article the other day which asserts, citing anonymous  intelligence sources and the testimony of three "defectors,"  that the Russian Defense Ministry is carrying out work on a  program for the creation of biological weapons without the  knowledge of the country's president.    At the request of the Russian Defense Ministry Information  and Press Directorate, Lieutenant General of Medical Services  Valentin Ivanovich Yevstigneyev, deputy chief of the Russian  Federation Defense Ministry Radiation, Chemical, and Biological  Protection Forces, comments on these assertions.    Yevstigneyev: First of all I wish to note that  the continuing campaign in the West to accuse Russia of carrying  out work on the creation of biological weapons is patently  intended to divert public attention from their own programs  which contravene the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of  Biological and Toxin Weapons.    As is well known, Russia advocates the setting up of a  large-scale mechanism for verification of compliance with this  convention. But such a mechanism is evidently not in the  interests of those who are continuing to improve a scientific,  technical, and industrial potential which could be used for the  production of biological weapons.    We have observed that peaks in the activeness of this  campaign coincide, as a rule, with major international talks  concerning the 1972 Convention. The present press item is no  exception. It came out on the eve of a session of the  preparatory committee for a special conference to examine  possible measures for verification of compliance with the 1972  Convention, at which the Russian side intends to continue work  aimed at setting up a mechanism for verification of compliance  with the said treaty.    As for the accusations against the Russian Defense Ministry,  I wish to remind the author of the SUNDAY TIMES item that in  accordance with Edict No. 390 of the President of the Russian  Federation, 11 April 1992, all work contrary to the requirements  of the 1972 Convention was stopped. Verification of the  fulfillment of the said edict on Russian territory is carried  out by the Committee on Convention Problems of Chemical and  Biological Weapons under the President of the Russian Federation.    In 1993 amendments were made to legislation, making  provision  for criminal accountability for the development, production,  acquisition, or storage of biological weapons.    Every year our country submits to the United Nations an  exhaustive report on its biological facilities and activity  associated with protection against biological weapons. Russia's  biological facilities, including those belonging to the Defense  Ministry, have repeatedly been visited by representatives of the  mass media and the local authorities and by foreign experts.    Back in November 1992 an independent commission of leading  Russian scientists and foreign experts visited the Institute of  Ultrapure Biological Products, at which the United States and  Britain suspected that work was being carried out on the  "superplague" mentioned in the article. The commission found  the institute's activity to be fully in accordance with the  requirements of the 1972 Convention. Immediately following the  completion of the commission's work, the U.S. and British  representatives also voiced no complaints about the work being  carried out at the Institute.    So any suspicions concerning violations by Russia of the ban  on the development, production, or storage of biological weapons  are completely unfounded.</p>

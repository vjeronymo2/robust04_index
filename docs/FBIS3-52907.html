He said: This struggle is not limited to  confrontation with the manifestations of Western culture. There  should be various cultural activities to improve public culture  and perceptions. At the same time there should be plans to end  manifestations of corruption and those who insist on these  matters should be confronted.    In another part of his speech, the Majles speaker praised  the  constructive actions of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic  Guidance in establishing cultural and artistic centers at  mosques. He said: This is one of the best ways of confronting  the cultural onslaught.    Nateq Nuri said cultural activities include the  establishment  of libraries in various areas, particularly at mosques, as well  as the constructive role of radio and television in broadcasting  entertaining variety programs and sound films to provide for the  recreation of people, particularly young people.    He announced that the Majles is prepared to cooperate and to  solve any legal vacuum in the country's cultural sector.</p>

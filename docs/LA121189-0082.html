			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CUT ABOVE THE REST;  </P> <P> TREE FARMS: SOME SERIOUS GROWERS AND HOBBYISTS ARE KEEPING THE INDUSTRY GOING  IN CALIFORNIA TO MEET THE DEMAND OF CONSUMERS WHO LIKE TO CHOOSE AND CUT THEIR  OWN TREE FOR CHRISTMAS.  </P> <P> Urban life is encroaching on Bob and Lorie Sturrock's Christmas tree farm on  San Dimas Canyon Road in San Dimas. Busy Foothill Boulevard nearby is a  constant reminder. Of late, a couple of developers have come calling to state  the obvious -- the land is a lot more valuable for planting houses than trees.  </P> <P> Thus far the Sturrocks have not been moved. "We live here on the farm. It's  pretty nice to have our own piece of green here," Lorie Sturrock said recently.  Moreover, it is her career. She runs the farm year-round while Bob tends to his  job selling thread to the garment industry. He helps out in his spare time, and  most of the 12 children and 22 grandchildren pop up from time to time during  the busy Christmas season to help with customers.  </P> <P> For the 28th year in a row it is business as usual for the Sturrocks who --  within just a few weeks -- get to see if the labor that they put in all year  pays off.  </P> <P> About 500 other growers in California have been going through some of the same  routines since Thanksgiving. While the vast majority of trees sold in  California are grown elsewhere, a small group of serious growers and part-time  hobbyists have kept a farming industry going in California for generations.  </P> <P> California's contribution to the nation's industry is the "choose-and-cut"  farm, a marketing innovation begun in the Santa Cruz mountains more than 40  years ago, according to the tree growers association. The farms allow consumers  to select and cut their own trees or tag a tree for farm workers to cut for  later pickup.  </P> <P> In recent years, more California consumers have become enamored with the idea  of choosing their trees directly from the source, according to the trade group.  This year, the association estimates, more than a million Californians will cut  their own trees.  </P> <P> Mike and Dawn Hansen of Lakewood were on their first visit to a Christmas tree  farm on a recent warm afternoon.  </P> <P> "Last year, we saw one at our neighbor's house," Dawn Hansen said while  searching the Lakewood Pines farm in Lakewood. "We thought it was so nice, so  we decided we would get one this year."  </P> <P> Urbanites don't always have to travel great distances to cut trees. Dozens of  farms operate close to housing developments and shopping centers in Southern  California. Many are on public utility rights of way. They are able to lease  the transmission line corridors because no buildings are allowed near the power  lines.  </P> <P> Those locations are the only economical sites for growing trees in Southern  California because land that can be developed for buildings commands premium  prices, said Bob Jones, president of the tree growers association. "There's no  way you can buy land in that location and grow Christmas trees," said Jones,  who operates a 150-acre wholesale tree farm and three smaller choose-and-cut  farms in Northern California.  </P> <P> The Sturrocks are among the few in Southern California who own their 14 acres,  but the land was bought in 1961 before land prices skyrocketed. They have about  12,000 trees on seven of the acres, Lorie Sturrock said.  </P> <P> A lot of growers in Southern California have sold out to developers over the  years, said Rich DeRosa, who leases public land near power lines for his Grand  Avenue Tree Farm in Glendora. DeRosa, a high school social studies teacher, is  typical of many in the industry who turned to tree farming for extra income. He  says he got the idea from a friend he met at a high school reunion in 1979 who  was a gardener selling trees on the side.  </P> <P> DeRosa said he attended lots of seminars sponsored by the tree growers  association. "We were warned that it wouldn't be easy," he said. "Weeds grow  all the time. They have to be (removed by hand). There are pine top moths, and  other pests are a constant problem. Water lines break -- fun things like that.  Trees aren't terribly easy to grow. It takes a lot of time. We spend about  $2,000 a year on this farm," he said.  </P> <P> Jim Heyne, who operates three farms with partners, can attest to the threat of  pests. "We fumigated this whole area," Heyne said recently, pointing to a large  section of their 8-acre Lakewood Pines farm. "We had a lot of trouble with  yellowing. We brought out the county agricultural agent who advised us to  fumigate," he said. The problem turned out to be fungus and the nematode, a  common plant parasite, he said.  </P> <P> For their labors -- which include constant irrigation and continuous delicate  trimming of trees to produce the most attractive conical shape -- and a  substantial up-front cash outlay, beginning growers won't have a marketable  crop for at least three to four years. The time that it takes to grow a tree  depends on the species and whether you begin with seeds or seedlings, growers  said. And growers have to carefully calculate the number of trees to plant per  acre (allowing for a certain number of trees that will be lost to pests and  other causes) to make the operation economical.  </P> <P> In Southern California, growers tend to plant more trees per acre because their  land costs are higher, said Sharon Burke, executive director of the tree  growers association. But one can plant trees only so close together, Heyne  said. "Our trees are planted on a diagonal that is 4 1/2 feet across between  trees," he said. Heyne said he normally has about 1,200 to 1,500 trees per  acre.  </P> <P> Growing trees has its rewards, said DeRosa. "I always have a tan and I'm sure  it's helped me to be healthy. I get a lot of exercise," he quips. But farming  hasn't yet produced a financial windfall, he said. Nevertheless, DeRosa said he  and a partner are investing proceeds from the Grand Avenue farm into another  operation in Ontario.  </P> <P> Marketing is key for choose-and-cut farms that compete with a variety of  conveniently located retail Christmas tree lots and nurseries, and most  recently grocers and other chain stores. Although chain stores are new to the  market, the tree growers association said they have grabbed a big part of the  market in a few short years. Some retail lots offer extra services like  flocking and flame retarding.  </P> <P> Competition is tough because "there's an oversupply of Christmas trees in the  lower grades," said Jones. But growers who have premium trees have a "pretty  firm market," he added. "People who have the worst ups and downs are those that  usually have a bad location," he said.  </P></p>

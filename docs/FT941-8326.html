			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Disputes on details may hinder EU enlargement Concern is growing that negotiations to bring Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the European Union by next January could sink into a quagmire of detail, during the final stretch of ministerial talks starting today in Brussels. The two-day talks between foreign ministers of the 12 and the four applicants will be followed by marathon negotiations over February 25-28, and probably a third attempt in early March. Unless a deal is finalised by the second week of March, the European Parliament will be unable to examine the accession treaty and the referenda all four candidates have promised their voters could be blown off course. In spite of some softening by both sides on central issues such as agriculture and regional subsidies, tough bargaining on secondary issues and on money is spreading pessimism among negotiators. Mr Esko Aho, the Finnish prime minister, said on Friday that EU prime ministers' support for enlargement had not percolated down to the negotiating table. One EU negotiator said at the weekend it was becoming 'more and more difficult to get a deal within the Union,' especially on how much money the relatively rich candidates should put into the EU budget, on fishing rights, and on subsidies to Nordic and Alpine farmers and the thinly populated Arctic regions of Sweden, Norway and Finland. Spain is leading attempts to get the new members' net financial contributions to the EU funnelled into regional aid for southern member states. But the European Commission's plan to set the four's net EU charges at a modest Ecu1.7bn (Pounds 1.3bn) is building resistance to a solution on agriculture and regional aid that the four applicants could sell to their voters. Attitudes are hardening inside the 12, moreover, because Sweden says it can pay only 40 per cent of its estimated annual Ecu765m net contribution in the first three years of membership, while Austria too wants to phase in its net Ecu752m payments. Spain, with support from the UK, wants guarantees that EU expansion will not dilute the existing rules enabling alliances within the 12 to block measures affecting their national interests. Nevertheless, negotiators expect early progress on issues such as restrictions on buying holiday homes in the candidate countries, on scaling down Nordic alcohol monopolies, and on Nordic duty-free regimes.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Making a whole of the parts - Why a restructuring plan is in progress at APV APV, the UK group which is one of the world's largest manufacturers of food processing equipment, is still feeling the effects of an acquisitive binge in the 1980s. After escaping a hostile bid from Siebe in 1986, the group doubled its turnover in three years through a series of purchases, but did little to integrate the various businesses. APV's profit margins melted away as recession struck its main markets. Last year's pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.1m, on sales of Pounds 947.5m, were just over a third of those achieved in its peak year in 1989. Mr Clive Strowger, appointed chief executive in June last year, has launched an extensive restructuring programme to focus the group, which has once again become the subject of takeover speculation. However, he is doing so against a background of depressed order books and fierce pressure from competitors on margins. Mr Strowger moved quickly to strengthen the balance sheet last year by selling Vent-Axia, a fan and hand drier business, to Smiths Industries for Pounds 56m and in the same week closed a lossmaking beer-kegging equipment site in Kent. Despite reducing its workforce from 14,000 to 11,600 over the past two years, APV still has more than 100 operating units, spread across 10 countries. Mr Strowger says: 'Complexity is both our problem and our opportunity.' Under a business plan agreed in the autumn, the group has identified companies that have a global responsibility for market segments such as dairy, ice cream, beverages, dry foods, processed foods, fruit juices, and industrial sectors such as pharmaceuticals. Other companies have global product responsibilities, while area companies have responsibility for improved market penetration in their territories. A principal aim of this approach is to prevent different parts of APV competing against each other. The group has a strong position in fruit juice extraction equipment and on occasion as many as three APV companies have bid for the same contract. UBS, the stockbroker, says: 'While this may well have been a joyous, if slightly confusing, experience for the customer, such internal competition does, we believe, go a considerable way to explaining APV's low margins.' Putting together the first unified bid team from APV subsidiaries also helped the group to win a Pounds 16m contract for a Korean brewery, for which it will provide project management, engineering and installation services, plus the beer processing equipment. Mr Strowger says he intends to build on this multi-disciplinary approach to win more turnkey contracts. The chief executive says that underlying all these changes is a desire to get closer to the group's customers. He describes this as a key accounts strategy, in which APV aims to have preferred relationship with its customers. The group is anxious to move away from low-margin manufacturing and contracting work, and focus more on developing specific products and processes for customers, on which both sides can make good returns. Mr Strowger says: 'Engineering and products are all being standardised. Make/buy decisions are being made all the time - we are now doing minimum amount of manufacturing.' APV does have some very strong products, and extensive experience of developing processes in collaboration with the main food and drinks groups. It claims a two-year lead in applying microwave technology to commercial baking ovens, and has invested heavily in ohmic heating systems, which produce food capable being stored for long periods without refrigeration. Unfortunately, the group is having to implement this strategy against flat or falling markets - particularly in continental Europe, which accounts for 40 per cent of sales. APV hopes some purchases are merely being deferred, but analysts believe spending was due to decline in real terms after the heavy levels of investment by the food and drinks industry in the late 1980s. Whatever the group's hopes, its business plan assumes no underlying market growth in the next three years. The UK group is also facing ferocious competition on prices - not least from its two main rivals, Tetra Laval, the Swedish food packaging and equipment group, and GEA, the German company, which are both more concentrated on the liquid foods sector. APV believes there is considerable consolidation going on and that all the main groups are suffering from high fixed costs. Mr Strowger says: 'Our erosion of margins is being felt by everyone else. The risk is that smaller companies will be driven into the arms of some of our larger rivals.' The UK group does not rule out strategic alliances in particular countries or product areas, but is more likely to start making infill acquisitions. Mr Strowger says: 'We have gaps in our range in a number of sectors, if we can find suitable partners.' APV has been the target of recurring bid speculation and this was strengthened last year when it emerged that GEA had quietly built up a 2.8 per cent stake in the group. Mr Strowger is fatalistic about the prospect of facing a hostile bid: 'I'm not sure that a predator could do anything very different to what we've done for the business. If it happens, it happens. But if someone came out of the woodwork, they would have to pay a substantial premium for the organic value of the business.' UBS says: 'If the new management fails in its task to improve the performance of the group the fact that APV is a market leader in an international business will not see it remain independent for long.' APV says European orders are down by only 10 per cent, so the extent of the current downturn can be exaggerated. The group, which has 80 per cent of its turnover outside the UK, will also benefit from the devaluation of sterling and sees opportunities in the Pacific Rim. Mr Strowger remains optimistic: 'Having compiled the business plan, the opportunities for us are much greater than hitherto thought.'</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Second fire breaks out at Chernobyl The second fire in less than two days broke out yesterday at the Chernobyl power plant, site of the world's worst nuclear accident, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. The fire was in a ventilation corridor on top of the sarcophagus which covers the melted-down reactor core left by the 1986 accident. The location is considered the most radioactive site at the power plant. Chernobyl officals said no radiation was released, but admitted it could have been, had not the fire been put out quickly. The first and third blocks of the power plant remain in operation. 'Although no radiation was released this is a serious moral blow,' said Mr Anatoli Demianenko, deputy head of the Ukrainian Atomic Energy Safety Commission. 'A fire the day before yesterday, then a fire today - together, these are morally troubling events.' He said a recent inspection at Chernobyl had uncovered serious safety violations in the construction and maintenance of the sarcophagus.</p>

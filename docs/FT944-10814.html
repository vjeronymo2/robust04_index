			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / People: Biffa's Bettington floats up at Severn Trent Severn Trent yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to the waste management business, Biffa, with the appointment of two new executive directors to its board. Brian Duckworth, 45, and Martin Bettington, 42, are joining the board in advance of the retirements next year of Roderick Paul, chief executive, and Michael Upstone, former director of customer service. Paul and Upstone are both retiring at the age of 60. Bettington, managing director of Severn Trent's waste management business, joined the company in 1991 when it bought Biffa from BET for Pounds 212m. Severn Trent said yesterday that Bettington's appointment signalled the company's 'commitment to developing the waste side of the business through Biffa'. The appointment was seen by analysts in London as Severn Trent's attempt to dampen speculation that it was considering selling the waste business. Severn Trent has been criticised in the past for locking itself into onerous financing for Biffa. Duckworth is strongly linked with the regulated utility side of Severn Trent, and led the price negotiations with the industry regulator in the last review. He was recently appointed customer services director.</p>

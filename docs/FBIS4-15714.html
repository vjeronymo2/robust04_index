			<p>BFN     [Text] Estonia deplores the linkage by Russia of its troop  withdrawal by August 31 with a decision that would guarantee the  rights of 11,500 military pensioners and ethnic Russians in that  Baltic republic. This is said in a statement, released in  Tallinn by the President Lennart Meri's Chancellory, and signed  by him as well as by the Premier Mart Laar and the State  Assembly's Chairman Yulo Nugis.    Moscow declared at the last round of bilateral talks that it  would keep the date for the pullout of troops from Estonia blank  until Tallinn ensured residence and other social guarantees for  the retired Russian army officers and other ethnic Russians in  Estonia.    Nonetheless, as the statement says, Estonia "is ready to  continue negotiations in good faith to surmount all  difficulties."    "At the same time, Estonia regards the Russian president's  instruction of April 5 on the creation of military bases in CIS  and Latvia as going back on earlier pledges, international  accords and principles," says the statement.    Estonia's representatives abroad "have been instructed to  remind Russia at every opportunity of its international pledge  to move its troops out of Estonia and Latvia by August 31  quickly and orderly, as has been repeatedly stressed in  international accords," the document notes.</p>

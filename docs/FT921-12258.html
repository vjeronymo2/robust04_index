			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Swire Pacific chief steps down MR DAVID GLEDHILL, chairman of Swire Pacific, the aviation, property and trading group, will step down in May and will be succeeded by his deputy, Mr Peter Sutch, the company announced yesterday. Mr Gledhill, 57, has been chairman of Swire, a company controlled by the Swire family and a leading 'hong' in the colony, for the past four years. He said last night that by the time he retires he will have exceeded the company's policy of retiring senior executives at 55 by two-and-a-half years. 'We have a policy of bringing younger people on in the company, and my time has come,' he said. Mr Sutch, 47, in addition to being deputy chairman of the Swire group, is currently chairman of Cathay Pacific - Hong Kong's international airline. He joined Swire in 1966. Analysts in Hong Kong expected little change in the running of Swire under Mr Sutch. Given his age, however, Mr Sutch could expect to preside over Swire in the run-up to 1997 - and possibly beyond  - when China regains sovereignty over Hong Kong from the British. Analysts said that although the airline has been suffering in line with other international carriers during the current world downturn, Swire's property investment and industry divisions have been performing well.</p>

Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relationship to debarment and suspension.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.'s 12549 and 12689 and DOL's implementing regulations.

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WHAT LOCKOUT? BASEBALL'S BACK  </P> <P> A capacity crowd at Boston's Fenway Park cheered today as Red Sox pitcher Roger  Clemens fired the first pitch of the 1990 baseball season, which began a week  late because the owners and players were embroiled in a contract dispute.  </P> <P> No bitterness was evident in the stands, where fans seemed to take a  better-late-than-never attitude.  </P> <P> "People forgive them," said one Boston fan, William Cullen of Cherry Valley,  Mass. "We're Americans. You love a thing, you're going to go."  </P> <P> Toni Giamatti, widow of the late Baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti, threw out  the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway, where the Red Sox faced the Detroit  Tigers.  </P> <P> A few minutes later, Giamatti's successor as commissioner, Fay Vincent, threw  out the ball at New York's Shea Stadium before the Mets took on the Pittsburgh  Pirates. Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden followed with the first real pitch of the  game -- and, like Clemens, he threw a strike.  </P> <P> There was no game in Cincinnati, marking just the third time since 1876 that  the Reds have opened on the road. Because of the revised schedules, the Reds  play tonight in Houston, where the Astrodome is celebrating its 25th  anniversary.  </P> <P> "We're not going to be at home, so it's not going to be as big a deal,"  Cincinnati's Tom Browning said. "The crowd's not going to be part of the  hoopla."  </P> <P> In Chicago, the Cubs and White Sox were each home today. The White Sox,  starting their last season at Comiskey Park, played Milwaukee, and the Cubs are  to face Philadelphia in the first night opener at Wrigley Field.  </P> <P> The Oakland Athletics, trying to become the first World Series winner to repeat  since the New York Yankees in 1977-78, open at home tonight against Minnesota.  </P> <P> To make it to the World Series, the Athletics will have to win their third  straight American League West title and hold off California and Kansas City,  two teams that improved through free agency.  </P> <P> The Angels signed Mark Langston and the Royals got National League Cy Young  winner Mark Davis along with Storm Davis, a 19-game winner for Oakland last  season.  </P> <P> "It just seems the way those two teams have improved that it's going to take a  lot of wins to finish first," Oakland manager Tony La Russa said. "What we  really stress is taking care of our business. If I had to pick one club to deal  with, it would be this one."  </P> <P> In other AL openers, Baltimore was at Kansas City this afternoon and Seattle is  to play the Angels tonight. In the NL, San Diego played at Los Angeles during  the day and Montreal is at St. Louis tonight.  </P> <P> A lot of players are starting the season in new places. Joe Carter is in San  Diego after being traded for Sandy Alomar Jr., Carlos Baerga and Chris James.  The New York Mets sent Randy Myers to Cincinnati for John Franco in a swap of  relievers, and the Mets dealt Juan Samuel to Los Angeles for Mike Marshall and  Alejandro Pena.  </P> <P> Free agency also reshaped rosters and the salary structure, increasing the  average pay to nearly $600,000. Kevin Bass is in San Francisco, Pete O'Brien is  in Seattle, Dave Parker in Milwaukee, Pascual Perez with the Yankees, Oil Can  Boyd in Montreal, Craig Lefferts in San Diego, Hubie Brooks in Los Angeles, and  two old Mets have moved -- Keith Hernandez to Cleveland and Gary Carter to San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Some players are returning from long absences. Dave Winfield is with the New  York Yankees after missing last season with back problems. Pitcher Greg Mathews  is with St. Louis after missing last year with elbow trouble. Mike Norris, a  22-game winner with Oakland in 1980, is again with the Athletics, making a  comeback at age 35 after physical and drug problems forced him out of the major  leagues in 1983.  </P> <P> Some players won't be on the field on opening day. Paul Molitor, Kirk Gibson,  Todd Worrell, Rick Sutcliffe and touted rookie Ben McDonald of Baltimore are  among those on the disabled list.  </P> <P> Others won't be anywhere. Darrell Evans, with 414 career home runs, was  released by Atlanta in spring training. Joaquin Andujar, who hoped a strong  showing in the senior league would help his comeback, was cut by Montreal.  </P> <P> Alomar, Todd Zeile of St. Louis, John Olerud of Toronto and Marquis Grissom of  Montreal are rookies likely to make an impression.  </P> <P> Some familiar faces are back, too. Nolan Ryan starts tonight for Texas at home  against Toronto.  </P> <P> Ryan, 43, needs 11 victories to reach 300. He won 16 last season for the  Rangers.  </P> <P> "There's some records I don't care that much about, but I do want to win 300  games," Ryan said. "It's probably the only time I've ever gone into a season  shooting at a statistic."  </P> <P> The Toronto at Texas game is one of those rescheduled because of the lockout.  On Tuesday, the two teams will play as previously scheduled, this time in  Toronto.  </P> <P> President Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will toss out the  first balls at the SkyDome when the Rangers, owned by Bush's son, travel to  play the Blue Jays.  </P></p>

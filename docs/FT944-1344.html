			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Russians meet 'stiff resistance' Russian army units yesterday continued to pound Chechen positions to the north of the capital of Grozny but were meeting what the Russian Interior Ministry admitted was 'stiff resistance' and are still holding back from an assault. Despite mounting protests at home and abroad, the government continues to show a will to squeeze the city, if not yet take it. A meeting of officials chaired by Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin promised further 'decisive action,' saying that the army was preparing to cut minor roads to the south of the city. A statement released after the meeting spoke of Chechen forces retreating to the hills, while those which remained used civilians as 'human shields'. The government press service maintained that the 'city is in panic'. But these reports are not wholly confirmed by journalists still in Grozny. Western military analysts in Moscow believe seizure of the city is being delayed until it is as empty as possible and until surrounding Chechen forces have been weakened. While talks were still being called for yesterday, these are now thought all but impossible. Meanwhile, the foreign ministry said Russia was closing its borders with Georgia and Azerbaijan to prevent the movement of rebel fighters in Chechnya. A very Bosnian plight, Page 14</p>

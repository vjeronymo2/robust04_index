			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) which requires, in part, that an agency prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for any proposed rule unless it determines that the rule will not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' In the event that such an analysis is not required for a particular rule, the agency must publish a certification and explanation of that determination in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> a. Environmental Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department prepared an Environmental Assessment (DOE/EA&hyph;0819) on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed standards pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, 42  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 4321  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and the implementing regulations of the Council on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Quality (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508). The Environmental Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addresses the possible incremental environmental effects attributable to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of the proposed standards to the design of the eight types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered products: Room air conditioners, water heaters, direct heating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, mobile home furnaces, kitchen ranges and ovens, pool heaters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluorescent lamp ballasts, and television sets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Finding of No Significant Impact was issued December 1992 and is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Publishing the finding has been delayed along with the proposed rulemaking due to difficulties in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolving issues and coordinating with a related rulemaking. The Finding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No Significant Impact concludes that the proposed standards would result in no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant environmental impacts and that an environmental impact statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Environmental Assessment is published within the Technical Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document and is available at the DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the address provided at the beginning of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. Regulatory Impact Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) directs that, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing a significant regulatory action, <FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>  an agency perform a regulatory analysis. Such an analysis presents major alternatives to the regulation that could achieve substantially the same regulatory goal at lower cost, as well as a description of the costs and benefits (including potential net benefits) of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Significant regulatory action'' means any regulatory action that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise intefere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory action.'' Accordingly, the draft regulatory action has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget has reviewed the draft regulatory action under Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulatory review of the draft regulatory action is summarized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below. This summary focuses on the major alternatives considered in arriving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the proposed approach to improving the energy efficiency of consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. The reader is referred to the complete draft ``Regulatory Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis,'' which is contained in the Technical Support Document, available as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated at the beginning of this notice. It consists of: (1) A statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the problem addressed by this regulation, and the mandate for government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action; (2) a description and analysis of the feasible policy alternatives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this regulation; (3) a quantitative comparison of the impacts of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives; and (4) the economic impact of the proposed standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted at the outset that none of the alternatives that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined for these eight products saved as much energy as the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, most of the alternatives would require that enabling legislation be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enacted, since authority to carry out those alternatives does not presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Mr.  Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who is in Singapore on a two-day visit,  said bilateral relations are good and there is very [as heard]  contact at the ministers' level. But he said there is a need to  replace the old schoolboy network forged through the Raffles  College link. Mr. Abdullah was speaking in an informal dialogue  session with young PAP [People's Action Party] members.    At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Abdullah said that  the ASEAN regional forum on security and the need to ensure its  success was a topic discussed by Singapore leaders.    On the growth triangle, the foreign minister said the  discussions touched on the need to have an easy flow of labor  among the three countries in the group. Mr. Abdullah said the  three should maximize their advantages in labor resources on a  project basis.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (7): Barometer of business The FT500, now in its 12th year of publication, has come to be recognised as Europe's principal barometer of business. The main table ranks the 500 biggest European companies by market capitalisation. A second table ranks the top 500 UK companies on the London Stock Exchange. This year, for the first time, there are two new international listings - the top 100 US and the top 100 Japanese companies, also by market capitalisation. A company's capitalisation is the number of its shares multiplied by the price of its shares, and therefore measures the value of the company in the eyes of investors. Capitalisation is chosen as a yardstick because it has a number of advantages over other methods. It is a good guide to performance over time; it gives a proper weighting to banks, whose positions are distorted in tables based on turnover; and it takes proper account of loss-making companies, which disappear from lists based on profits. The stock market is particularly important in the UK, whereas in Germany the banks play a larger role in corporate finance, and in France and Italy many of the biggest groups are state-owned. However, the table showing the 200 top companies in Europe ranked by turnover includes companies which are publicly-owned and which appear in the top 500, and those which are owned privately or by the state. Rankings: The rankings of the European 500, the UK 500 and the US 100 and Japanese 100 tables are based on market capitalisation at the end of September 1993. Preference capital has been excluded for this calculation. Companies that have 75 per cent or more of equity held by one other concern, or that have only a minimal proportion of their capital openly traded on the market, have been excluded. The main source for the European and UK capitalisation tables was FT Analysis, with additional information from Datastream International, local stock exchanges, and the FT World Actuaries Index. The source for US and Japan capitalisation tables was Standard &amp; Poor's Compustat Services. The ranking of companies having the same capitalisation has been determined by reference to their turnover or, where necessary, their profit. Figures in the European, US and Japanese tables are in dollars, using September 1993 average exchange rates. For ease of comparison, turnover and profit figures for last year are also shown at September 1993 average exchange rates. UK 500 figures are in sterling. Accounts: Consolidated accounts have been used wherever possible. When parent company accounts only have been reported, these figures have been used and annotated. Turnover is shown net of sales taxes and inter-group sales. A ranking based on the latest year's figure is also given. Profit is disclosed profit before tax and minority interest. For the UK companies, it is also before extraordinary items. Return on capital employed (ROCE) is based on pre-tax profit plus interest divided by capital employed at the beginning of the financial year. ROCE is not calculated if pre-tax loss plus interest payment reflects a loss. For banks, capital employed is equivalent to shareholders' funds. UK Investment Trusts: The rankings are based on market capitalisation at the end of September 1993. The shareholders' funds figure is based on the number of shares in issue and the stated net asset value. This table has been compiled with the assistance of NatWest Securities. Other tables: Also included for the first time this year, is a table showing the auditors for the top 100 UK companies. Because of distortions in percentages when companies go from profit to loss and vice versa, the tables showing largest increases in profit and largest decreases in profit exclude these companies. However, tables showing the largest movements from loss to profits and vice versa are published.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- European Top 500 biggest employers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    Rank                                            FT500 1993 1992  Company                  Cntry     Sr    Rank     Employees  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1    1     Siemens                  Ger      541      10        413000 2    2     Daimler-Benz             Ger      401      14        382633 3    3     Unilever plc             NV/Nuk   451       5        287000 4    4     Fiat                     Ita      401      85        285482 5    5     Volkswagen               Ger      401      88        273309 6    6     Philips                  Net      541      86        257671 7    11    Nestle                   Swi      451       6        218005 8    8     ABB Asea Brown Boveri    Swe/i    541      47        213407 9    9     Alcatel Alsthom          Fra      533      18        203000 10   12    Generale des Eaux        Fra      221      40        198813 11   10    BAT Industries           UK       171      11        197989 12   13    Hoechst                  Ger      622      55        177668 13   7     BT                       UK       223       2        170700 14   14    Bayer                    Ger      622      34        156860 15   15    Peugeot                  Fra      401     100        150800 16   16    Thyssen                  Ger      633     146        148272 17         Accor                    Fra      464     211        144093 18   25    Mannesmann               Ger      566      89        141250 19   20    STET                     Ita      171      65        139757 20         BTR                      UK       591      16        135133 21   17    Michelin                 Fra      574     162        130686 22         Veba                     Ger      171      33        129802 23   24    Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez Fra      221     126        127552 24   19    Royal Dutch Shell        Nuk      212       1        127000 25   22    BASF                     Ger      622      63        123500  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

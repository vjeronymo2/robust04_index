			<p>CSO     [Text] The business of the International Conference on War  Crimes and the Blockade's Violations of Human Rights in Iraq  concluded last night in Baghdad. The text of a concluding  statement issued from the conference follows:    The International Conference on War Crimes and the  Blockade's  Violations of Human Rights in Iraq met from 5-8 February 1994 in  Baghdad. It built on the work of the nongovernmental  organizations, societies, unions, and associations that are  interested in human rights (and the legal and social issues  related to them). Their undertaking obeys the call of similar  nongovernmental organizations and societies that work in the  legal and social fields related to human rights in Iraq.    Representatives of the human rights societies and the  societies interested in children, representatives of lawyers'  unions and jurists' societies and unions, representatives of  cultural and religious societies, and Arab and foreign  journalist foundations met together for this noble goal.    Likewise, various personalities from the Arab and Islamic  world, and all the other parts of the world, attended for this  goal. In addition a large number of Muslim and Christian  religious people from various countries of the world attended.    The business of the conference was arranged around three  basic topics. These topics were the objects of dialogue and  elaborate discussions that lasted four days so that the  participants could study the papers of the [conference's] work  and deliver treatises and commentaries on them. The conference  began its work on 5 February 1994 with a legal discussion by  international law experts of a research paper that a  duly-qualified Iraqi committee wrote entitled "Crimes and  Violations of the United States and its Allies Against Human  Rights in Iraq." The subject of this paper was the fundamental  theme of the participants' discussion throughout almost the  entire conference. A work session was dedicated to this topic on  the first day of the conference's work. Mr. Ramsey Clark, the  former American Attorney General, was chosen to lead these  sessions, and Dr. Nazar al-'Anbaki was chosen to report the  business of the conference. Dr. Muhammad al-Duri presented the  Iraqi paper referred to above. Mr. Ramsey Clark delivered a  commentary at the start of the session in which he reported that  the American war crimes were committed based on the decisions of  the Security Council. For this reason, he demanded that the  United Nations system be amended. He criticized the Security  Council, saying that it became a tool of the war. He demanded of  the participants that they remember and carry in their hearts  the memory of the thousands of Iraqis who were martyred as a  result of the criminal activity undertaken by the United States.    He pointed out that he exposed these crimes in his book,  The Fire This Time, which is a testimony of the war  crimes and the blockade on the Iraqi people. He reported that  the blockade does not just kill soldiers, rather it also kills  children and, therefore, it is a comprehensive weapon of  destruction because of its destructive effects, which are  equivalent to the use of nuclear weapons. He demanded that the  elimination of their use be worked toward and that a limit to  their use be set, and a limit be set to the obstacles imposed on  Iraq, because they continue to represent an enduring crime  against humanity. He said that he would be happy to listen to  the viewpoint [from the perspective] of international law in  this conference.    After the presentation and discussion of the Iraqi paper,  the  participants unanimously agreed that the military attack that  began the morning of 17 January 1991 began a continuous chain of  enemy military actions against Iraq. These actions were taken by  the United States and its allies. In view of its purposeful goal  of destroying the civil, industrial, and economic structures in  Iraq, with no military justification for it, and in view of the  concentrated use of weapons and the dreadful, senseless bombing  that killed thousands of civilians, the United States and its  allies have been committing war crimes that have resulted in  immense violations of law.    Likewise, its bombing and destruction of inhabited civil  defense shelters in which hundreds of women and children and old  people fell victim and in which Iraqi soldiers were buried alive  on the battlefront, are, by its own description, willful,  deliberate, and planned violations that are considered living  proof of war crimes.    The conference eventually led to a confirmation of what was  said in the experts' paper--that the United States violated the  rules of international humanitarian law that relate to the  protection of civilians during times of armed struggle, and that  they broke the Geneva Conventions. Specifically, they broke the  third convention relating to the protection of prisoners of war  in the field. This resulted in the bad treatment of the Iraqi  prisoners, as is represented in their willful abuse,  humiliation, attempt at debasement, infliction of bodily and  psychological injury, or killing. The documents, reports, and  studies presented for the purposes of this conference bore  witness to this.    The conference also eventually led to confirmation of the  responsibility of the United States and its allies concerning  violations of the principles of the law of war relating to the  styles and methods of killing in two basic respects:    The first relates to the choice and expansion of bombing  targets that are forbidden by international law--such as  civilian leaders; grain and seed depositories; electric energy  sources that are needed for health and human services; drinking  water networks; military targets that are close to civilian  centers, without previous warning; civilian and military  hospitals; places of worship; and cultural antiquities.    The second relates to the use of prohibited weapons such as  spent uranium bombs, vacuum bombs (fuel-air bombs), cluster and  fission bombs, and incendiary napalm bombs. All of these are  forbidden weapons. Use of these weapons violates the intent of  the 1925 Geneva protocol and is considered a violation of the  protocol's regulations on prohibition or restriction of the use  of forbidden weapons. This protocol is attached to a 1980  agreement on prohibition and restriction of certain traditional  weapons that can be considered excessively harmful. In addition,  the use violates the regulations of the First Protocol of 1977,  the additional addendum to the Geneva conventions of 1949  concerning the victims of war.    Concerning the crimes of the blockade, the participants in  this conference criticized the tyrannical and harsh method with  which the blockade against Iraq was imposed and applied, which  represents an unparalleled precedent. Speaking specifically,  after Iraq carried out the decisions of the Security Council, in  spite of their severity and injustice, continuing to impose the  blockade is for political, not legal reasons. Therefore, it is  inconsistent with the decrees of the United Nations Charter.  And, the use of the blockade as a means of political pressure is  a new method in international relations the essence of which is  the subjugation of the international organization's decisions to  the selfish policies of a powerful, controlling state, which  uses its imperialist, tyrannical power to terrorize the member  states. The United Nations follows the logic of compliance with  the will of the United States and grants it the legal cover  required, or that it is forced to follow, toward Iraq, in  compliance with the wish of the United States of America. The  participants in the conference, in adopting the point of view of  the totality of the legal and factual arguments that the  international law experts' paper contained, came to the  conclusion that continuing the blockade represents rightly a  crime of collective annihilation. It represents a crime of  collective annihilation by causing deficiency in food, medicine,  and health supplies and the prevention of Iraq from using its  frozen assets in the international and foreign banks and  financial institutions, and enormous number of deaths among  children, especially infants, pregnant women, the elderly, and  the chronically ill, who are in need of certain types of  medicine, as United Nations sources themselves confirmed as well  as other neutral sources, and as some of the participants in  this conference witnessed with their own eyes. The persistence  in this situation is a violation of international humanitarian  law; of the international commitment to economic and social  rights; of the agreement of the rights of the child, which the  United Nations set up in 1989 and which became valid in 1991;  and of the principles of the international declaration for human  rights. In addition it is a violation of the rules of  international morals and of the requirements of the general  human conscience.    The participating experts found that continuing the blockade  raises the problem of responsibility of the Security Council  itself and the credibility of the United Nations. The Security  Council, which is responsible for maintaining peace and  international security, is exceeding its jurisdictional  boundaries by randomly devoting all its efforts to fabricating  justifications and groundless reasons for continuing the  blockade. The blockade continues in spite of Iraq's compliance  with the conditions imposed on it by the Security Council.  Therefore, they properly interpret this insistence as racist,  and one that pays no attention to the tragedy and the suffering  that the blockade has caused to a deep-rooted civilized people  that has shared in a distinguished way in building human  civilization. This situation is considered a violation of the  provisions of the Charter, which is built on the foundation of  respect for equality in rights among peoples.    Human rights organizations, lawyers' unions, nongovernmental  societies, and humanitarian organizations presented, on the  first day of the conference, their position on the crimes and  violation confirmed by the legal experts. They attributed the  crimes and violations to the United States and its allies, a  topic that was an object of elaborate discussions in the 6  February session, which was headed by Mr. Amin Shaqir from  Jordan. Dr. Safiyya Safwa spoke and many participants commented,  and the discussion eventually led to the support and  confirmation of what was said in the main paper of the  [conference's] work presented by the international law experts.  The second part related to the effect of the crimes of the  blockade on human rights, whether appling in particular to the  legal aspects mentioned in the paper or relating to  interpretation and factual attestation of the dangerous effects  that have arisen by continuing to impose the blockade, for three  years and in a severe way, and what have arisen from it in terms  of continual deterioration in the social life, living  conditions, and health, cultural, and environmental conditions  that continue to threaten the basic, precious means of human  subsistence. The participants in this conference expressed their  resentment and their anger at the continued insistence on  violating the Iraqi people's right to precious life. They  registered their condemnation of the policies and positions that  some of the governments are still taking, particularly the  governments of the Western alliance under the leadership of the  United States regarding the economic embargo imposed on Iraq and  their continued pressure on the Security Council to prevent its  taking another serious look at its decisions (in accordance with  which the economic embargo was imposed) with the goal of  eliminating them or abolishing them completely in order to end  the justifications for them. They also expressed their  astonishment at the size of the damage that touched the family  life of the Iraqi family and social relationships in general as  a result of the loss of infants and children and heads of large  families due to a deficiency of food and medicine, as the number  of deaths among children demonstrate and according to the  official statistics accompanying the documents presented in the  conference, and the psychological suffering and grief arising  from that.    Part of the conference was dedicated to the Muslim,  Christian, and Sabean religious men. This session was opened on  7 February. Dr. Ibrahim Zaid al-Kilaani was chosen to head this  session. A group of religious men representing the Christian and  Mandean Sabean religions and all their sects in Iraq and the  Arab countries, traveling from Islamic and foreign countries,  spoke. They all expressed their agreement that the procedure  that imposes the blockade on the Iraqi people is illegitimate  because the divine books do not allow starving people or killing  them unjustly, or humiliating them, abusing their generosity, or  distinguishing between them and their fellow nationalities  because of race, religion, language, or color. They cited in  their studies and their contributions texts from the Holy Koran  and from the Old or New Testaments or the sayings of the  prophets that urge human beings to have love for their human  brothers and [to practice] brotherliness among the sons of the  human race and prevent humanity's oppression of its human  brothers, whether in their life, their money, their power or  their faith. They all, without exception, criticized the tyranny  of America and its oppression of those peoples and governments  of the world that refuse to subject their will to the will of  the United States Government. This is what they are undertaking  against the people and the leadership of faithful and struggling  Iraq that practices brotherliness among the religions and  respects all religions on the principle that all the faithful  are brothers. Likewise, they registered their condemnation of  war crimes that America and its allies have committed against  the long-suffering and fighting people of Iraq.    The speakers and participants made sure to extend greetings  to the great people of Iraq and their leader and symbol of their  solidarity, President Commander-in-Chief Saddam Husayn, who  endures, along with his people of Iraq, all this injury because  of refusing to follow the wish of foreign powers and, in  particular, his rejection of the imperialist American control  over the destinies and riches of the Arab nation. This injury is  a result also of his rejection of [the United States'] devotion  to humiliating the countries of the South and causing them to  miss the opportunity to achieve advancement and growth and  mastery of science and technology, intending to maintain their  backwardness and exclusion from opportunities for growth and to  put obstacles in front of them by the tyrannical power that it  possesses and the ability to pressure, based on this power.    Likewise, all the participants made sure to express their  pleasure with the Iraqi miracle of constructing, building, and  restoring, by its own abundant capabilities and by total  dependence on itself, what the war destroyed. They considered  the experience of Iraq in confronting the destructive effects of  the war that the United States and its allies launched against  them, in spite of the blockade [already] imposed on it, an  unrivaled example to be followed, in addition to its being an  indication of the vitality of the Arab nation, its  steadfastness, and its capacity for confrontation [of problems]  and endurance.    Before the end of the conference's business, in the session  just before the concluding one, the participants decided to form  three drafting committees, for each of the three main issues  that were discussed to make recommendations concerning each of  the three issues in light of the working papers and  participants' contributions. The three committees met on the  evening of the 27th in the south hall of the al-Rashid hotel in  which the proceedings of this conference are taking place  jointly with their curriculum. They noticed that most of the  participants' suggestions were primarily founded on the ideas  that the international law experts' paper mentioned. Since these  suggestions were interconnected, the drafting committees  considered the arrangement among themselves in order to prevent  repetition, and they found that the participants in the  conference decided unanimously on the following joint  recommendations:    1. The issuance of statements of affliction and a verdict of  guilty expressing the participants' disapproval of the war  crimes and violations of human rights and international  humanitarian law caused by the blockade on Iraq. No legal or  legitimate justification is found that permits the United States  and its allies to impose this kind of tyrannical blockade and to  continue to impose it in spite of the human tragedy that has  been caused by it. It is considered a crime against humanity  that is worthy of a verdict of guilty and of consequences and of  setting in motion the rules of international responsibility that  are appropriate because they are a basis for Iraq to demand just  and comprehensive compensation for the damage caused by the  violations of international humanitarian law and the adjoining  laws of war, as a result of enemy war-like actions.    2. The demand and urging of the human rights organizations  and societies working in the legal, political, and religious  fields to undertake individual and collective efforts to make  known in their countries the war's and blockade's crimes and to  pressure their governments and build international public  opinion to demand a lifting of the blockade imposed on the Iraqi  people. The existence of this method will bring all the peoples  eager for their independence and their sovereignty face to face  with it. It is practiced now against the people of Iraq with  severity and is practiced in differing degrees against other  countries in the Third World as a means of political pressure on  the political organizations that do not defer to the wishes of  the robbery of the United States of America and its allies.    3. The call of the legal and people's nongovernmental  organizations for the issuing of publications and periodicals  and undertaking active media efforts that disclose to public  opinion in their countries the size of the material and  significant human damage that has touched the people of Iraq and  the accomplishments that their effort and struggle have built  over decades. These media efforts should also make clear the  dimensions and effects of the blockade and the lack of  legitimacy of its contining. The dimensions and effects of its  being imposed in this arbitrary way--which is rejected by the  general human conscience--and that it shamefully violates the  rules of international humanitarian law should also be made  clear. The legal experts' paper should be authorized as a basis  for this movement and working towards spreading it.    4. The call for the accounting of the people responsible for  the war crimes that were committed against the people of Iraq as  a result of the significant violations of the allied Western  states' war operations led by the United States of America and,  in particular, the political and military leaders that gave the  orders to bomb inhabited shelters and bury alive Iraqi soldiers  in their places, to attack civilian centers and residential  concentrations, to launch blind attacks and not take the  necessary precautions to guard against civilian casualties, and  to practice a type of crime of continuous, collective  annihilation resulting from the insistence on continuing to  impose the blockade in a way that expresses its imposers'  contempt for the simplest human values. These violations are  also witnessed in the leaders' lack of mindfulness of the human  casualties that befell the Iraqi people, especially with respect  to the deaths of children as a result of the deficiency in food  or loss of medicine and as a result of the United States' and  its allies' declaration as states devoid of divine religions.  These religions reject unequivocally what they undertook in  using inhuman methods that the divine laws do not consent to, by  a blockade in medicines and food imposed on the people of Iraq.  Usually, that is a groundless criminal action against God and  against humanity.    5. The undertaking of an effective and influential action  towards the United Nations directly, its specialized agencies  and their centers and offices in all the states, without  exception, by way of memoranda, meetings, and the expression of  objection to their negativity towards what the people of Iraq  have endured as a result of the blockade and the creation of the  economic embargo, which was based on the decisions of the  Security Council. It has lost all the groundless justifications  that it was based on. The powers active in the United Nations  system began to use the agencies of the international  organization to execute their illegitimate policies at the  expense of honor, bread, freedom, and human rights in the  countries that oppose procedures of this kind, as a result of  the United States' pressure on the international organizations  because its uniqueness or isolation as a single power  controlling the international system.    6. The revelation and exposure of the double standard  followed in international politics and the exploitation of the  United States and its allies of human rights as a means of  political pressure or for encouraging divisive tendencies,  threatening the sovereignty of states, and working towards their  crumbling on ancestral or denominational grounds. Also, assuring  the exposure of the sabotaging role that the United States  undertakes in the international system's present situation and  exposing the Zionist influences that push the United States in  this direction.    7. The formation of committees from the nongovernmental Arab  and international organizations to undertake voluntary work that  aims toward making clear the justice of the issue of the Iraqi  people on the condition that the Arab organizations carry the  responsibility for pursuing the implementation of this  suggestion and they outline and put in place the methods of  planning and pursuit among themselves.    8. Working toward the arrangement of an international day of  solidarity with Iraq in its ordeal, including a general strike  or any other method that expresses effective solidarity with the  people of Iraq and its leadership, with the vocational and labor  unions, and the other nongovernmental organizations arranging it  and mixing conferences and festivities with it.    9. The declaration of rejection of discrimination in the  treatment of human rights issues and the exposure of the evil  intentions that the United States has striven to fulfill against  Iraq through the exploitation of this issue for the sake of  fabricating justifications for the continuance of the blockade,  and its expansion and exploitation in taking possession of  Iraq's sovereignty and the unity of its lands by impeding Iraq's  practice of its sovereignty and imposing blockade zones in its  north and its south, which is considered a scandalous  interference in its internal affairs that patently violates  Paragraph 7, Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, being  inconsistent with the right to self-determination of the sole  Iraqi people and their right to choose their political and  economic system without mandate or decree or foreign  interference reminiscent of decayed imperialist methods.    In conclusion, it is appropriate to mention that the  participants in the international conference, concerning the war  crimes and violations of the United States and its allies  against human rights in Iraq, concluded the business of their  international conference after ratifying the concluding report  and approving the recommendations and statements of the verdict  of guilty attached to this report in the closing session, which  was held in the hall of the al-Rashid Hotel with the attendance  of all the participants, at 1900, Tuesday, 8 February 1994,  corresponding to 27 Shaban 1414 of the Hijra.</p>

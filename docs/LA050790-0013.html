			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS  </P> <P> Your editorial placed human life above animal life. I congratulate you on  making the only possible moral decision.  </P> <P> However, since human life is more valuable than animal life, it requires that  we ask and answer this question: What is the moral justification for animal  rights groups spending millions of dollars on saving experimental animals while  human beings die of hunger, war and pestilence?  </P> <P> The answer to this question is really an eye-opener!  </P> <P> ROBERT H. JACOBS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (7): Glittering 'grand projet' - Musee de Grenoble Official speeches are generally greeted with polite applause, but Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, was treated to a really rousing response to the address he delivered to mark the opening earlier this year of the glittering new Musee de Grenoble. As the local officials had hoped, Mr Balladur had used the occasion to promise that the government, which had paid roughly half the FFr210m cost of building the new museum, would make a similar contribution to Grenoble's next artistic project, the FFr200m renovation programme for the Maison de la Culture, the city's arts centre which was built in 1968. There is a political logic to Mr Balladur's decision. The new Musee de Grenoble was conceived in the early 1980s, when both the city council and the French government were under socialist control, as part of the Grands Projets, the modern architectural programme initiated by President Francois Mitterrand to mark the bicentennial of the French Revolution and - or so say his critics - his own regime. The new museum has all the hallmarks of the Grands Projets. It is a spectacular piece of contemporary architecture in a stunning setting beside the River Isere. The white cubist building is uncompromisingly modern but makes the most of its location; its white walls lead up to glazed roofs which offer glimpses of the snow-capped mountains all around the city. It houses one of the best art collections in France. This dates back to 1796 when the Musee de Grenoble was first created to house the paintings and sculpture seized from local aristocrats in the 1789 French Revolution. The city has added to the collection ever since, both by acquisition and by donations from the state. The new museum shows off the collection to perfection, beginning with 23 rooms devoted to pre-1900 art, from 13th century Italian Renaissance pieces to post-Impressionist paintings by Paul Gauguin. Another 40 rooms display one of Europe's most comprehensive collections of 20th century art. The new building will allow Serge Lemoine, its chief curator, to stage more temporary exhibitions - and enable the Musee de Grenoble to make the most of proposals to distribute part of the national modern art collection, now housed at Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, to other museums. This was one of the last Grands Projets to be built. The Mitterrand era is now nearing its end and the centre-right Balladur government has adopted a different approach to the arts from the socialists, with a new policy focusing on conservation. Jacques Toubon, the new arts minister, has launched an ambitious programme of renovating France's old buildings - more in keeping with the conservative rhetoric of his cabinet colleagues than the socialists' zest for innovation. He has already announced plans to restore a number of buildings in Paris, including the Georges Pompidou arts centre and Garnier opera house. Renovation of the Maison de la Culture in Grenoble is an ideal addition, particularly as it was the showpiece of the policy pursued by a past centre-right French government: the arts centre programme initiated in the late 1960s by Andre Malraux, the writer who became arts minister under General de Gaulle.</p>

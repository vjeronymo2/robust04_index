He said that in response to the earlier request by the  Russian Minister, Peres voiced consent to discuss the proposals  by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat about the international presence  to help solve the problem.    It was said that the joint search for ways to overcome the  current crisis would be continued. In line with it, the special  envoy of the Russian President, First Deputy Russian Foreign  Minister Igor Ivanov will leave for Israel after the talks with  the Palestinian leadership in Tunisia.    The explosion on Sunday in a Catholic Church in the suburbs  of Beirut indicates that the extremist forces in the region do  not give up attempts to frustrate the national reconciliation in  Lebanon and block the Middle East peace process, Grigoriy  Karasin has told Interfax.    He said that following the criminal act in Hebron, where an  Israeli fanatic shot at believers at a mosque, another tragedy  came. As a result of an explosion during the Sunday mass, dozens  of civilian Lebanese were killed or wounded.    Russia expresses deep condolences to the families of the  victims, said Karasin.    He said that the new tide of violence in the Middle East  must  be stopped and the region and its future must be protected  against the encroachments of extremists.</p>

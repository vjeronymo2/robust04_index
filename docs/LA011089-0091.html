			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> China released a 33-year-old dissident who was active in the pro-democracy  movement in Shanghai. Yang Wei, a former student at the University of Arizona  whose case was taken up by the U.S. Congress, was freed after serving one year  of a two-year prison term for "demagogical propaganda for counterrevolutionary  ends." Yang said he did not regret marching for democracy and writing for China  Spring, the banned periodical of the Chinese Alliance for Democracy, a New  York-based dissident group, but said he didn't know whether he would continue  working for political change in China.  </P></p>

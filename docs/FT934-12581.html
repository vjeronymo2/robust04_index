			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: BET As befits a collection of late-cycle businesses, BET's shares turned seven months after the main body of the stock market. While the first increase in interim pre-tax profits since 1989 justifies the market's faith, progress has relied on self-help and a fair wind in the currency markets. Nearly three years after the arrival of Mr John Clark as chief executive, loss makers are still being weeded out and interest charges reduced. More of the same should be enough to maintain earnings momentum in the second half. By this time next year, though, BET will need to show decent margin improvements in businesses which have survived the axe. So far the trading performance has been mixed. Creditable results in textile services and electronic security in the first half were offset by more pain in cleaning and plant hire. Comparisons with the best of the competition suggests margin improvements might be achieved through the kind of productivity drive the company now promises. But where prices are falling BET is running to stand still. The danger must be that prices will remain under pressure in its low-margin businesses even after economic recovery has taken hold. Whether BET should continue to slug it out in areas with low barriers to entry - such as office cleaning and security guarding - is thus an open question. If these businesses continue to act as a drag on recovery there will be a strong argument for redeploying resources elsewhere. Having repaid Pounds 700m debt and preference shares over three years, BET can at least afford to wait and see.</p>

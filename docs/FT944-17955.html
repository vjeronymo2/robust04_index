			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / NZ hits 6.1% growth New Zealand's gross domestic product grew by 6.1 per cent in the year to June 30, one of the highest growth rates ever recorded, the prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, said yesterday. He said the growth was due to sound responsible management, solid export growth and increased investment. 'It has been achieved without any artificial stimulation to the economy.' However, the GDP figure has aroused concerns that the economy may be overheating. Interest rates rose sharply after the governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Don Brash, told a parliamentary committee yesterday that the figure was much higher than expected and showed the economy was suffering from strong inflationary pressures. Financial markets believe that Dr Brash, who is in charge of monetary policy, will shortly act to raise interest rates.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Letter: Accountability essential with aid to east Europe Sir, Regarding the letters by Dr Seppain and Mr Crossick (November 23) in response to Edward Mortimer's characteristically challenging arguments: they take the US, other western leadership and the international financial institutions to task for failing to assist reconstruction in eastern Europe adequately, in the interest of world security. Reconciliation of policy initiatives by the West requires a tightly monitored emphasis on accountability. When the Financial Times reported the pending Dollars 24bn package to assist the former command economies of the old Soviet Union ('G7 pledges Dollars 24bn Russian aid', April 2), central to the plan's success was to be the installation of auditors to monitor the foreign exchange receipts in the larger relevant exporting industries. In reality, 'offshore banking centres' have far greater knowledge of such industries' foreign exchange proceeds than do internal auditors, who thus far have not been appointed, or who remain silent in the face of intimidation. In the interest of eastern European and world economic and military security, these 'black holes' must be exposed, plugged and regulated immediately. Throwing good money after bad will help neither proposed recipients nor well-meaning donors.

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Jobless total at six-year high AN UNEXPECTEDLY sharp rise in the jobless total last month pushed unemployment to its highest level for almost six years. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit rose a seasonally adjusted 60,800 in December, almost double the rise expected by economists and the biggest monthly increase since July 1991. The 32nd consecutive monthly rise took the jobless total to 2.97m and the rate of unemployment to 10.5 per cent. Unadjusted unemployment rose by 119,279 to 2.98m. Unemployment is now 86 per cent higher than in April 1990, when it started to rise. Although the December figure may have been boosted by a five-week month, the most likely explanation for the latest jump is that people who lost their jobs in widespread redundancies last autumn have swelled the ranks of those claiming benefit. The Department of Employment said the number of people employed in manufacturing industry fell by 31,000 in November. That took the total number of jobs lost in manufacturing since the beginning of the year to 253,000, compared with a fall of 373,000 in the previous year. Overtime working in manufacturing was 8.85m hours a week in November, slightly higher than in October, when it was 8.78m, but still the lowest since the early 1980s. According to the Department of Employment the trend growth rate in unemployment has increased to about 40,000 a month. The average rate of increase in the three months to December was 43,400 compared with 33,900 in the three months to October. The upward trend in the jobless total affected all parts of the country with the sharpest rises occurring in the east and west Midlands, East Anglia and the north. Unemployment is now highest in greater London where the rate is 11.6 per cent and in the north where it is 12.2 per cent. One encouraging sign was an increase in the number of unfilled vacancies at JobCentres - about a third of all vacancies in the economy. They rose by 8,300 in December, the sharpest increase since December 1991, and higher than the average increase over the three months to December of 3,000 a month. The number of jobs lost by Britain's construction industry by mid-summer is likely to have risen by more than half a million since 1989, the Union of Construction Allied Trades and Technicians warned yesterday.</p>

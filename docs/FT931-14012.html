			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Caution in Midlands on recovery MIDLANDS business leaders warned yesterday that recent improvements in the sales and orders of industrial companies, especially in exports, do not mean the recession is ending. Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry in the west Midlands, said after a regional council meeting: 'There are reservations about how long it (the improvement) will last.' Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said at the meeting: 'We are not running up the flags at this point about the recovery. We've had two blips up before in this recession.' Mr Nigel Chubb, director of the Engineering Employers' East Midlands Association, said: 'For the first time in two years there appear to be faint flickerings that the industry is on the turn.' He reported that 40 per cent of companies in an association survey expected total orders to improve over the next three months. But he said: 'We are not expecting any dramatic improvements for 1993.' He noted that the industry has 'a mountain to climb to recover from the recessionary effects of the last 2 1/2 years'. Recent experience of east Midlands engineering companies, leading to what Mr Chubb called 'a much more stable position as far as future orders are concerned,' mirrors the findings of recent surveys from chambers of commerce across the country. Devaluation has given companies a competitive advantage in export markets, but the flatness of the domestic market, the construction industry's weakness and the slowdown in European markets, has made business leaders cautious.</p>

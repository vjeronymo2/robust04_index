			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Letter: Chancellor's modesty is completely misplaced Sir, Why all the criticism of Britain's chancellor? Has he not achieved momentous feats recently? How many chancellors can claim to have cut interest rates by 5 per cent, twice confounded commentators by perfectly executed U-turns, and lost Pounds 11,000 a second, all within 24 hours? Moreover, it is a singularly generous act, on our chancellor's part, to allow the Germans and French to take the lion's share of the glory for these achievements, and to go so far as to understate his own role in bringing about this return to traditional values (such as, for example, a falling pound). P G Hirsch, The Red Lodge, 1 St John's Road, East Molesey, Surrey KT8 9JH</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (1): Toughest test is yet to come - Zambia is making a fresh start, with a radical structural reform programme. But will the medicine prove too strong? Michael Holman investigates Zambia marks its thirtieth anniversary of independence today in sombre mood. Rich in minerals, with abundant good farm land, and boasting game parks whose tourist potential has barely been tapped, the country should be flourishing. But mismanagement - notably a disastrous nationalisation programme - and misfortune, including regional wars, have taken their toll. Life expectancy is falling, infant mortality is rising, and per capita income is lower today than it was 30 years ago. Zambia, is making a fresh start, however. Just three years ago, President Frederick Chiluba's Movement for a Multiparty Democracy (MMD) swept to power in the country's first democratic elections for two decades. It ended 27 years of Kenneth Kaunda's autocratic rule, with a pledge to reverse the country's economic decline and restore political freedom. Today, President Chiluba presides over a radical structural adjustment programme which with the assistance of aid worth Dollars 1bn a year is transforming the economic environment. The toughest test of Mr Chiluba's presidency, however, is yet to come: the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), responsible for more than 90 per cent of export earnings, has to be privatised if it is to survive. Output has slumped from a peak of 700,000 tonnes a year in the mid-1970s to less than 400,000, and it owes creditors Dollars 640m. Only foreign investment can save the fourth-largest copper producer in the world, and this requires a volte-face as rich in symbolism as the 1969 nationalisation. At that time, the move was greeted as heralding a new era for a country that was once little more than a fiefdom of Cecil John Rhodes' British South Africa Company. No wonder, then, that when Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's founding president, brought the mines under state control, he could not resist sounding a triumphant note. Rhodes' vision of the Company blazing a commercial trail from Cape to Cairo, in the name of an Empire run by Englishmen, 'is now buried' declared Mr Kaunda, 'and I hope and pray, never to rise again in this part of Africa'. Rhodes may have the last laugh. Privatisation will mean that boardrooms in Johannesburg and London will once again determine the development of the mines, still at the heart of the economy. Resuscitating the mines by cutting the 50,000-strong labour force by as much as a third, and offering former owners the chance to resume the management role they were forced to surrender 15 years ago, is a complex operation which carries with it considerable political risks. Yet it will be the yardstick by which the Chiluba government will be judged, notwithstanding the progress already achieved. Trade has been liberalised; subsidies removed; privatisation of other nationalised industries is under way; foreign exchange controls have been lifted; the budget deficit reduced; and inflation rates brought down from 187 per cent last year to a forecast 30 per cent in 1994. After years of one-party rule, the electorate enjoys a choice of three main parties and a lively press. An outspoken private sector does not hesitate to criticise government policies. Reform is under way in other areas. A respected lawyer, Mr John Mwanakatwe, heads the commission looking at ways in which the country's constitution can be strengthened. A land commission is investigating changes to the system of communal land ownership and introducing individual freehold tenure. The MMD government's reputation, however, has suffered gravely since taking office. A dozen ministers have been dismissed or resigned, some following allegations of involvement in corruption and drug-running, others in protest over the same issues. For both Mr Kaunda - who may be attempting a political comeback under the banner of the United National Independence Party (Unip) - and Mr Baldwin Nkumbula, leader of of the National Party, the past three years have provided plenty of ammunition as they prepare for an election no more than two years away. The sleaze factor, retrenchment, cuts in food subsidies, and the introduction of user fees in the health services, have all strained the patience of a long-suffering electorate. Mr Nkumbula has also seized on the ZCCM issue, arguing that there is an alternative to selling off the mines - although not, so far, explaining what this could be. Notwithstanding these difficulties, Mr Chiluba maintains that Zambia is 'on the right track'. Structural adjustment is a necessity, he argues: it is the cure, not the cause, of the country's difficulties. For all the encouraging macroeconomic indicators, many Zambians fear that the medicine may prove too strong for the patient, whose growth was first stunted during the colonial period, then further retarded after independence. Had Zambia been better prepared for independence, it might have been better equipped to cope with the pressures that followed. One of the most serious obstacles not only to post-independence development, but to the successful implementation of the current structural adjustment programme is the acute shortage of skills. There is also the weak agricultural base. Both handicaps can be traced back to the colonial legacy. Zambia came to independence with little more than 100 graduates and 1,000 secondary school leavers, an indictment of a system which permitted the remittance of millions of pounds in dividends and profits from the copper mines while only a fraction was reinvested in the country's social services and infrastructure. Nor was it an accident that the agricultural sector had a few hundred commercial farmers, compared to 5,000 in Southern Rhodesia. Northern Rhodesia, as Zambia was known, was kept as an economic hinterland for its southern neighbour - hence African nationalist opposition to the Central African Federation of Southern and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now Malawi) from its inception in 1953 to its demise 10 years later. It was barely a year into independence when Zambia reeled under the first of a series of external blows - the unilateral declaration of independence by Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). A landlocked country, and thus especially vulnerable to dislocation of trade routes, Zambia has never known peace in the region. The conflict in neighbouring Mozambique ended only two years ago, while Angola is still at war. Until 1990, Zambia was a victim of destabilising tactics by South Africa. Further external factors over which Zambia had no control proved to be body-blows: the mid-1970s fall in the price of copper, from which the economy has never fully recovered, and the soaring oil prices of the 1970s. Whether the present reform programme, essentially determined by the donors, takes this history into adequate account is questionable. Local critics of the donors point out that in Ghana and Uganda, where structural adjustment has produced the best results, the governments enjoyed a freer hand than Mr Chiluba. It was 10 years after introducing structural adjustment that the Rawlings government faced the electorate. In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni runs a de facto coalition that has yet to be tested at a multi-party poll. Western donors, say these critics, expect Mr Chiluba to take political risks that would be unthinkable in the west: a French president, for example, confronting farmers over the ending of agricultural subsidies, or an American president taking on the US defence industry. Yet the Zambian leader has to privatise the mines, at the heart of what should be his political stronghold, and face elections in 1996. This task is not made easier by donors' refusal to address an anomaly in Zambia's external debt obligations which require a country following economic reform to the letter to maintain a net outflow to the International Monetary Fund of Dollars 100m a year. Reform is in danger of failing for a further reason, say the critics: the frail state of a society that has been buffeted for so long, and whose institutions have been fatally weakened. Management, whether in the private sector or the civil service, is thinly spread and getting even scarcer as Aids takes a daily toll. President Chiluba readily acknowledges the hurdles ahead. There is, however, no alternative, he says: 'No one will come and rebuild our shattered country. We must do that with our own sweat and blood.' Brave words, but formidable odds.</p>

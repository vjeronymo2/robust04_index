			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Bayer expects 4% sales increase BAYER, the German chemical group, said operating profits in the first two months of this year were slightly below expectations, and it expected them to end close to last year's DM3.18bn (Dollars 1.93bn). Sales this year are likely to climb 4 per cent to DM44.4bn. The remarks by Mr Hermann Strenger, chairman, come only days after Bayer announced the best 1991 result of the big three German chemical companies. With a drop in pre-tax profits of 5 per cent, to DM3.21bn, compared with a fall of over 20 per cent at BASF and Hoechst, Bayer alone has decided to hold its 1991 dividend at the same level as last time's. Bayer disclosed yesterday that operating profits for the group dropped by 10.5 per cent to DM3.18bn last year, reflecting poor conditions in the chemicals industry. Last year, profits in polymers, organic products and industrial chemical products dropped by 21, 56 and 43 per cent respectively. Mr Strenger blamed the decline in profits on increased costs which could not be passed on to customers because of tougher competition in world markets. Total profits were held up at higher levels than those of its German competitors because of Bayer's greater exposure to the non-cyclical pharmaceutical sector. Health products accounted for DM8.8bn of group sales of DM42.4bn last year - 21 per cent of the total  - but generated profits of DM1.74bn, an increase of 11 per cent on the previous year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Melnik -- TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev 22 April TASS -- the Black Sea Fleet should be  shared by all former Soviet republics, Speaker of the Ukrainian  Parliament Ivan Plyushch said on Friday.    "From the very beginning the Black Sea Fleet was shared in  the wrong way," he told a press conference.    According to Plyushch, the "zero option" of sharing the  fleet  would have settled many problems, including the Crimean one.    In the meantime, the Russian and Ukrainian defence ministers  are currently discussing in Sevastopol how to share the fleet  between the two countries. Russia wants to have 85 per cent of  the fleet and leave 15 per cent to Ukraine. Kiev disagrees and  insists on 20 and more per cent.</p>

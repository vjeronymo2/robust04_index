			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Chemical Banking predicts fall in level of bad debt provisions THE CHAIRMAN of Chemical Banking, the US banking group formed by the merger of Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank, yesterday predicted a decline in the level of the bank's bad debt provisions and loan write-offs during the second and third quarters of 1992. Mr John McGillicuddy, speaking at the first shareholders meeting since the merger took place late last year, said the Dollars 375m bad-debt provision level recorded in the first three months of the year was high. He added that he thought the level of non-performing assets would peak in the second or third quarter of the year. The total of non-performing assets at the bank was Dollars 6.2bn at the end of March. Turning to the treatment of loans to Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property group that recently filed for protection from creditors in Canada and the US, Mr McGillicuddy said the bank's lending to O&amp;Y Development Ltd was placed on non-performing status in the first quarter of 1992. Chemical Banking has a loan exposure of about Dollars 250m to the O&amp;Y group, of which half is represented by lending to property projects, like the Canary Wharf development in London. Mr Walter Shipley, chief executive of Chemical, meanwhile told shareholders the bank was confident it would meet or exceed its stated cost-cutting targets, which begin with annual operating cost cuts of Dollars 225m by year-end and as much as Dollars 750m a year by 1995. Mr Shipley said the reduction in staff was also proceeding on schedule, with 2,800 jobs eliminated since the merger was announced last summer and the greater part of the overall goal of 6,200 cuts to be achieved by year-end. Chemical Bank is also continuing to strengthen its capital base, having achieved a level of 6.6 per cent in its Tier 1 risk-based ratio at the end of March. The bank is planning to raise up to Dollars 250m by offering up to 10m fixed-rate perpetual preferred shares at Dollars 25 each. Duff &amp; Phelps, the credit rating service, yesterday said the improving climate led it to upgrade the ratings on seven US banks including The Bank of New York and Mellon Bank. Four other banks - Chase Manhattan, First Interstate, Bank of Boston and Shawmut - were placed on a 'favourable' rating watch with a view to an eventual upgrade. Mr Paul McCarthy, president of Duff &amp; Phelps, said that despite the period of 'severe stress' banks had undergone over the past 18 months, there were sufficiently improved prospects to warrant the upgrades. Among the other banks whose ratings have been upgraded are Crestar Financial, First Bank System, First Fidelity Bancorp, Signet Banking and Valley National.</p>

While the world demands the  end of economic and political genocide by the United States  against Cuba, and while the United Nations calls for an end to  retaliations, Deputy Secretary of State Alexander Watson [title  as heard] requests democratic diversity, which is ironically  dogmatic and orthodox, and which denies the Cuban people's right  to diversity and pluralism.    Europe is beginning to discuss the decline of representative  democracy by political parties, and Cuba, which has taken a step  beyond with its rejuvenating political system and civil society,  is unjustly described by government officials and other figures  who speak to us today in a language that was buried in 1989 on  the island of Malta.    This sad scenario has been chosen for their second-rate cast  of characters who have been given indigestion by the fact that  the Colombian Government and businessmen do not take what is  being said in Miami about Cuba very seriously. The decision  adopted by Bogota and Havana to negotiate the sale of between  15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil under current commercial terms  is judged in outdated, threatening terms and language.    Trade retaliations are being adopted against Colombian  exports of flowers, barriers are erected against Colombian  coffee, while the preparation of a black list of other Colombian  products has also been announced. How long can one put up with  such meddling in relations with third countries? Don't these  events show that the blockade is a war of extraterritorial scale  against Cuba? Why should we continue living under the sway of  blacklists as if they were Damocles' sword. Of course any new  factor attracts one's attention.    Representatives of the National Cuban-American Foundation in  Bogota refused to endorse the boycott which was called by their  own organization, while demonstrations in front of the Colombian  consulate in Miami this past weekend were suspended for a lack  of quorum. Moroever, it has been learned that a meeting of  ultra-rightist immigrants for the establishment of joint actions  has ended in a brouhaha. It just happens that those characters  are the same ones who criticize the forthcoming meeting between  the nation and its emigrants, and try to monopolize, for the  benefit of their own pockets and treasuries, the positions of  migrants toward their homeland.    I wish to ask the following question then: Would they submit  to a plebiscite to truly verify whom they represent? Of course,  Miami is not an essential goal for Colombian trade, only the  port of entry for Colombian products to the United States. The  Colombians, in turn, have said that they cannot submit their  commercial policy to remarks from groups who are divorced from  their country of origin. It would be extremely dramatic for the  Colombians to have to ask permission from a group of Cubans from  Miami in order to negotiate with whomever they want.    Thus, a defender of democratic diversity such as Mr. Watson  should be worried about and dedicated to these violations of  democratic diversity which are so similar to the covert and  not-so-laudable wars of the civil and human rights movements of  the civilized peoples, or has Mr. Watson perhaps become a  hostage of prehistory?</p>

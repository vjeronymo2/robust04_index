			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 25 (TANJUG) -- The Foreign Ministry of  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) on Wednesday  expressed its embitterment over Cairo's conduct and assessed  Egypt's accusations that the F.R.Y. is accountable for the war  in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina as  "senseless and irresponsible". Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa on Tuesday said Egypt would not invite the F.R.Y. to take  part in a conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to be  held in Cairo from May 31 to June 3, stating without any  arguments a series of shocking accusations about the F.R.Y.'s  alleged involvement in the civil war in neighbouring  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "The Egyptian foreign minister's statement is unacceptable  and does not comply with the actual state of affairs," officials  of the F.R.Y. Foreign Ministry told TANJUG. "His explanation  and arguments have been long surmounted, not only by reality and  truth which is pushing its way despite the media campaign  against the F.R.Y., but also by the events such as a ministerial  meeting of Russia, the European Union and the U.S. on  Bosnia-Herzegovina in Geneva on May 13," the same sources said.    The F.R.Y. Foreign Ministry set out that it interpreted  Egypt's decision as a gross violation of the agreement on the  F.R.Y.'s participation in the NAM meetings when crisis in the  former Yugoslavia is discussed and as a misuse of the role of  the host at the NAM ministerial meetings.    "We interpret that decision as a wish to have the NAM openly  sided with the Moslems in the civil war in Bosnia," it was said  in the F.R.Y. Foreign Ministry. After the NAM summit in  Jakarta, a so called gentlemen's agreement was drawn up under  which the F.R.Y. has a full right to actively participate in the  NAM meetings, at which either the crisis in the former  Yugoslavia or other topics are being discussed.    Egypt defaulted regarding the New York agreement and acted  in  an ungentlemanlike way. An obvious intention is to exclude the  F.R.Y. from the NAM, but this would require a full consensus.  The Islamic bloc in the NAM is trying to persuade, first of all  the non-aligned countries of the black Africa to join the bloc  of the "friends" of the Bosnian Moslems.</p>

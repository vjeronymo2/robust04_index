			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Big business techniques 'trickle down' SOME of the financial benefits of new management techniques such as just-in-time manufacturing are gradually trickling down from large companies to small businesses, according to research by Manchester Business School. Big companies are still using their financial muscle at the expense of smaller businesses. A regular six-monthly survey of 5,000 companies in north-west England shows that 31 per cent of small businesses have increased their stock turnover since the spring. This compared with only 24 per cent in the previous survey. The increase is attributed to a knock-on effect from larger companies, which had reported faster stock turnover during the first six months of this year, benefiting from the improvement in the economy. Modern management techniques such as just-in-time manufacturing or electronic data interchange are being used to encourage faster response times from suppliers in an attempt to to keep all stocks and the money to finance them to a minimum. Mr Nitin Sanghavi, who carried out the school's research under the sponsorship of Price Waterhouse, the accountant, said: 'The encouraging performance of smaller firms suggests these new techniques have improved efficiency along the supply chain.' The research also shows, however, that big companies are using their muscle to manage working capital more efficiently at smaller companies' expense. One in 10 large companies collect debts in less than 30 days, compared with only 5 per cent of smaller ones; but 27 per cent of large companies succeed in stretching credit past 60 days, while only 21 per cent of smaller companies manage to do so. One result of better efficiency and improving cashflow is that nearly 48 per cent of large companies have been able to reduce borrowings in the last six months. Business confidence has fallen sharply in the Midlands amid growing fears that the recovery may be faltering, the Engineering Employers Federation said yesterday. According to its latest quarterly survey in the east Midlands, the proportion of engineering companies reporting increased orders fell from 49 per cent in the three months to July to 32 per cent in the past quarter.</p>

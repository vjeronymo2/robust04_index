			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Return to dividend list by N Sea Assets North Sea Assets is to pay its first dividend since 1985 with a proposed final payment of 0.75p on 1991 pre-tax profits 72 per cent ahead at Pounds 2.08m, against Pounds 1.21m. Mr Philip Parker, chief executive, said that the company's businesses, which supply services to the offshore oil and gas industry, had made considerable progress. During the year the company withdrew from shipping, which was making losses. In November the ship management activities and five of its six ships were sold followed by the sale a few days ago of the remaining ship. Turnover rose to Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 21.6m) and the pre-tax figure was struck after a higher net interest charge of Pounds 985,000 (Pounds 361,000) and an exceptional gain of Pounds 43,000 compared with a charge last time of Pounds 360,000. Earnings per share came out at 4.16p (2.81p).</p>

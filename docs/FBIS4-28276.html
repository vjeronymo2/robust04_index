			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sin Yong-su from Beijing] </F>   [Text] There have been some reports that Chinese President  Jiang Zemin warned North Korea to accept negotiations on the  nuclear issue when he met on 7 June with Choe Kwang, chief of  general staff of North Korea's Army during his visit to China.  However, it has been learned this is not true.    One high-ranking official of the ROK Embassy in China said:  I understand that President Jiang did not make a detailed  mention of North Korea's nuclear issue, but only confirmed the  traditional friendship between the two countries when he met  with Chief of General Staff Choe.</p>

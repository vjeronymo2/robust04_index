			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HAWAII;  </P> <P> LAVA HITS OCEAN, BREWS TOXIC STEAM  </P> <P> Searing lava from Kilauea Volcano reached the ocean, sending up billowing  clouds of hazardous steam.  </P> <P> The lava also threw a noose around the only store and remaining church in a  remote rural community of Kalapana on the island of Hawaii. The steam, called  laze, since it is a lava-generated haze, poses a potential health hazard  because the fiery rock hitting seawater generates acid fumes. Strong trade  winds were blowing the steam out toward the sea, but officials were concerned  that nighttime sea breezes or a wind shift could send toxic materials over the  land.  </P></p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Major escapes full public handbagging: But Thatcher heaps fury on Howe and Lawson SO Mr Major could breathe a small sigh of relief. After all the advance hype, the publication yesterday of official extracts from Baroness Thatcher's memoirs proved a predictable anticlimax. True, she is not exactly full of praise for her successor. She makes little secret of her reservations about his intellect and ideological backbone. She wonders aloud whether she would have backed him if she had managed, as she planned, to continue her premiership beyond a fourth general election victory. There is probably more to come when The Sunday Times publishes its second set of extracts next week. Lady Thatcher believes that Mr Major deserted her during the first round of the 1990 leadership campaign in which Mr Michael Heseltine brought her down. But to anyone who has heard Lady Thatcher speak in private of Mr Major, these are distinctly modest criticisms. Around the lunch or dinner table she has accused him of being weak and indecisive and of abandoning the commitment to sound public finance. But in writing her memoirs she has been persuaded to exercise a degree of the self-restraint and self-discipline which deserted her in her final years in Number 10 Downing Street. The real venom is reserved for Lords Howe and Lawson. These were the principal architects of the Thatcher revolution: the men in her government who provided the intellectual framework which translated her ideological instincts into a coherent set of policies. But it was her disagreement with them over the European exchange rate mechanism and, in the case of Lord Howe, Europe more generally that precipitated the final implosion of her cabinet. Thus Lord Lawson is at once praised for his intellect and then accused of 'folly' in allowing his determination to get sterling into the ERM to override her determination to hold down inflation. Somewhat implausibly for those who followed the argument at the time, he is accused of wanting constantly to cut interest rates while she was forever asking for the burden on homeowners to be increased. The Financial Times is credited for tipping her off in November 1987 about his policy of shadowing the D-Mark. No matter that everyone of importance in Whitehall knew of the policy months earlier. For Lady Thatcher her then-chancellor's approach is proof that: 'the belief that the laws of economics and the judgments of the markets can be suspended by clever people is a perpetual temptation to folly.' The truth, of course, is rather more complicated than that. Providing a deliciously ironic, and presumably unconscious, assessment of the forces behind her own down-fall, Lady Thatcher concludes a bitter attack on the 'treachery and bile' of Lord Howe with the thought that: 'Above all, I suspect, he thought he had become indispensable, a dangerous illusion for a politician.' Her single mistake, according to Lady Thatcher, was failing to sack her chancellor and foreign secretary. Britain would have stuck with a floating pound and would have taken the path towards economic prosperity as its 11 European Community partners foolishly isolated themselves by embarking on monetary union. Even the poll tax, she seems to believe, might have been made to work. She would have won the election and, just about now, would be contemplating a graceful move into retirement. In the words of one cabinet minister yesterday: 'Such are the delusions of once-great political lead-ers.' Sadly, Mr Major cannot brush aside so casually the legacy of his predecessor. Her influence is waning. Even in great leaders, self-justification is too easily self-defeating. The ideological warfare in Blackpool last week was a potent reminder that the instincts of Thatcherism live on in a significant section of the Tory party. Mr Major needs time to rebuild his authority after the ravages of Maastricht and of the recession. So he is ready to re-adopt some of the rhetoric of Thatcherism. But Lady Thatcher's assumption that the prime minister's emphasis on traditional Tory values will signal a return to what he has described as a 'golden age that never was' is mistaken. In Mr Major's mind the golden age was represented by the 1950s, not the 1980s. So Mr Clarke will tell anyone ready to listen that whatever the rhetoric of Messrs Peter Lilley, Michael Portillo and Michael Howard, he is not about to dismantle the welfare state. Nor is Mr Douglas Hurd intending to conduct Britain's European policy on the basis of the cheap insults of some who sit around the cabinet table. Thatcherism is not dead. It has an able, if still youthful, standard-bearer in Mr Portillo, a politician who combines Lady Thatcher's gut instincts with some of the intellect of Lords Howe and Lawson. But it will take a general election defeat rather than an image of the recent past through rose-tinted spectacles to reconvert the Tory party to the ideology it rejected in 1990.</p>

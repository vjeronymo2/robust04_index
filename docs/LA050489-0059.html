			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUTTLE READY TO GO; OFFICIALS SCAN WEATHER  </P> <P> Invoking a sense of deja vu after last Friday's scrubbed launch attempt 31  seconds before liftoff, NASA officials said Wednesday that all problems had  been corrected on the orbiter Atlantis and that it is ready for launch this  morning at 10:48 a.m. PDT.  </P> <P> "Here we are again and we are ready to fly again," said NASA's newly nominated  head, Rear Adm. Richard H. Truly.  </P> <P> NASA engineers will have a 64-minute "window" in which to launch Atlantis,  which is carrying the $325-million Magellan probe that is designed to map the  surface of Venus with radar. That is more than twice the 23-minute window that  was available last Friday.  </P> <P> But meteorologists said that there is a 40% chance the launch will be scrubbed  because of weather constraints. The potential threats to the mission include a  chance of low-level clouds that would impede landing of the orbiter at Kennedy  if the mission were aborted after liftoff, a possibility of prohibitive  crosswinds at the Kennedy landing site and a slight chance of rain showers that  would block the launch.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Poor Weather  </P> <P> If the launch is scrubbed today, said Capt. Thomas Strange, an Air Force  meteorologist, the chance that weather would block a launch on Friday is also  about 40%. The possibility of poor weather rises to 50% on Saturday and 70% on  Sunday.  </P> <P> Last Friday's attempted launch was scrubbed when computers detected a power  surge in a pump that cools one of the shuttle's three main engines before  launch. NASA engineers replaced the pump this week, but a close inspection  showed that it had not been damaged, according to Arnold D. Aldrich, director  of the National Space Transportation System.  </P> <P> Technicians found metal particles and shavings, ranging in size from 10  thousandths of an inch to 40 thousandths of an inch, in the pump, but "no signs  of interior scraping or wear," Aldrich said.  </P> <P> He speculated that, in an "extremely unlikely event," one of the metal shavings  short-circuited two electrical leads, blowing a circuit breaker. The resulting  power surge apparently vaporized the piece of metal (which was probably  solder), and the pump would have been functional if engineers could have reset  the circuit breaker, he said.  </P> <P> Engineers this week also replaced a 4-inch-wide liquid hydrogen line through  which the super-cold fuel is returned to the shuttle's external fuel tank after  it is used to cool the engines. Observations of videotapes taken after the  scrubbed launch suggested that the line had developed a leak in its external  covering, allowing air to leak into the liquid-argon insulating line  surrounding the hydrogen line.  </P> <P> But inspection of the line showed no leak. Further studies suggested that a  cavity in the solid insulation of the line had allowed air to condense while  hydrogen was flowing through the line. When the cooling pump shut down, the  line warmed up, evaporating the air and creating the visible plume that  technicians observed.  </P> <P> Neither problem endangered the shuttle or the astronauts, Aldrich said.  </P> <P> The five crew members -- commander David M. Walker, pilot Ronald J. Grabe and  mission specialists Norman E. Thagard, Mary L. Cleave and Mark C. Lee --  returned to the space center from Houston on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they were  reported to be flying T-38 trainers for relaxation.  </P> <P> NASA has until May 28 to launch the Magellan probe, the first interplanetary  probe the United States has launched in 11 years and the first ever launched by  the Shuttle. If it is not launched by then, the agency will have to wait two  years for Earth and Venus to again be in the proper alignment for a minimum  energy trajectory.  </P></p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Observer: No comment In search of an economical way of preparing your Christmas gifts in this recession-hit year? Homes and Gardens magazine has a festive tip in its January edition: 'Try using pages of the Financial Times tied up with upholstery webbing for a stylish and economical wrapping idea.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Headlines" column by Fahd al-Fanik: "Christopher's </F> Article on Sanctions"]    [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  published an article in THE NEW YORK TIMES on 29 April 1994 in  which he attempted to justify the continuation of the inhuman  sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people four years ago.    The secretary of state does not usually publish articles in  the press. He may issue a statement, give a statement, or  answer a question. It is also unusual for the secretary to send  an article to a newspaper while he is conducting a difficult  official mission and travelling between Middle Eastern capitals.  The issue must have been more serious that it looks for the  U.S. secretary to depart from tradition.    The meanings that can be deduced from the article do not  depend much on its content, which was a repeat of the cliches we  hear all the time: Iraq is not implementing the UN Security  Council resolutions and the sanctions must continue. The more  important meaning of the article is that the U.S. State  Department has found itself in a position where it had to defend  a racist policy rejected by the civilized world because it  violates the most basic of human rights. Starting the article  with a "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia" dateline is designed to suggest  that the article is in response to an Arab demand.    The United States failed to give a clear answer to a  specific  question from Tariq 'Aziz: What measures is Iraq required to  take to end the sanctions?    In fact, Iraq has complied with all the UN resolutions,  although they were unfair. But the United States is not  interested in seeing an implementation of the UN resolutions,  which were never implemented by any country besides Iraq.  Instead, the United States wants to change the ruling regime in  Iraq and to impose on the Iraqi people other rulers of [Ahmad]  al-Jalabi's type.    In his unconvincing defense of the continuation of the  sanctions, Christopher admits they are causing real suffering  for the Iraqi people. He, however, lays the blame on the Iraqi  government's policy, as if the U.S. policy is not responsible  for the continuation of the sanctions against the Iraqi people  and for their elongation without any justified reason.    Thousands of the weakest segments of the Iraqi society are  dying because of the U.S. sanctions. These are the children,  the infants, the elderly, and the sick. Iraq's pharmacies are  empty of insulin for diabetics and of medicine for people with  chronic problems. Aspirin is also rare. Surgery in hospitals is  limited because of the lack of anesthetics. All this is a crime  against humanity, unparalleled even by Nazi crimes.    The continuation of the sanctions is purely an American  decision. It does not infringe just on the rights of the Iraqi  people, but also inflicts major damage on Turkey, Jordan,  Europe, and Japan. It also offends anyone with a pan-Arab,  humanitarian, and moral feeling. Trying to defend sanctions is  even worse than the sanctions themselves.</p>

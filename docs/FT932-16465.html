			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Joblessness 'will peak at 3.1m' UNEMPLOYMENT WILL continue to rise for only a few more months, peaking at 3.1m, but will still be about 2.5m by the end of the century, according to the annual review of the economy and employment by the Institute for Employment Research. The institute at Warwick University expects a net 500,000 additional jobs by 2000, most of which will be part-time jobs taken by women in the service sector. The female labour force is expected to grow by 500,000 over the next decade. The movement away from primary and manufacturing industries to the service sector will continue, with manufacturing expected to lose another 600,000 jobs in the next decade. The new jobs will also continue the trend towards a more divided labour market with many being low-pay/low-status jobs and others being relatively high-pay/high-status. The growth in clerical and secretarial work, which now accounts for just over 4m jobs, will stop as a result of new technology, the institute says. It expects an increase of about 150,000 clerical and secretarial jobs by the end of the decade. Skilled manual occupations will decrease by about 500,000 and plant and machine operatives by about 400,000 by the end of the decade. The utilities will lose an estimated 80,000 jobs by 2000, the report says, with the biggest decrease in the electricity industry. An increase of 750,000 posts is projected for managers and administrators with a further 800,000 new jobs in professional and associate professional and technical occupations such as laboratory assistants. Part-time jobs accounted for the whole of the 1.2m increase in employment between 1980 and 1990 and an extra 750,000 part-time posts are expected before 2000. The growth in self-employment, which in the 1980s was concentrated in construction and certain parts of the service sector, is likely to increase again following the decline in 1991 and last year. About 200,000 additional self-employed jobs are expected before the end of the decade. Institute for Employment Research, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL. Pounds 30.</p>

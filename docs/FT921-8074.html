			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Old guard on the retreat in many Labour town halls: Policy shifts by some of the party's top local politicians ALMOST ALL the 57 urban areas eligible to compete for the Pounds 750m of City Challenge funding announced yesterday have Labour councils. Predictably, they joined Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, in denouncing the competition as a 'game show pandering to the whims and prejudices of an egocentric environment secretary'. They will play the game all the same - with enthusiasm, in many cases. In last year's competition, Manchester won cash for renovating its shabby Hulme district south of the city centre. Mr Graham Stringer, Labour leader of the city council, opposes the bidding element in City Challenge but declares himself 'far from cynical' about the process of preparing bids. 'It has brought together government, council, tenants, businesses, churches and voluntary bodies to help find a common solution to our urban problems', he says. 'If Labour wins the general election we need to keep that process. The contacts made are lasting.' It is a typical response. The crusading socialism of the early 1980s is little in evidence among today's generation of Labour council chiefs. Leading lights such as Mr Stringer and Ms Margaret Hodge in north London's Islington, once heroes of the hard left, are arch-pragmatists now. Others, such as Mr Jeremy Beecham in Newcastle upon Tyne, were Kinnockite 'soft left' from the start. 'The old left/right divide is obsolete,' says Mr Rod Hills, Labour leader of York City Council. 'Now the division is generational, between innovators and an old guard.' If Labour wins the election, much more than City Challenge will depend on the respective influence of those two groups. Both are largely united on five priorities: creation of single-tier all-purpose authorities; the return of the fixing of business rate to councils; a general power of competence for councils to act - and spend - as they see fit; abolition of compulsory competitive tendering; and freeing of councils' accumulated capital receipts for them to spend on housing and other programmes. Ms Janet Silet, leader of Norwich City Council, says: 'If they release part of our Pounds 30m in capital reserves, we will start a house-building programme the next day. We have sites designated and already have planning permission.' Mr Gould has warned councils that Labour would relax spending constraints 'progressively'. The rate of progress is likely to cause tension. Mr Gould is also committed to abolishing the compulsory aspect of tendering, a process that highlights the gulf between the innovators and the old guard. The old guard simply wants to be free of it and, like most of the local-government trade unions, hankers for the old days in which work was done automatically by councils' own labour forces. By contrast, the innovators are keen to retain - and even extend - the cost centres, service plans and quality targets that have been part of the competitive-tendering process. Mr Stringer, who is pressing ahead with service plans for every council department in Manchester, says: 'Targets and effective monitoring are crucial. It's amazing that local authorities often don't even know how many they employ, let alone what they do.' Under Mr Hills, York has pioneered a local citizen's charter, customer contracts and annual performance indicators - seen as a models of their kind. He supports Labour's proposed quality commission as a means of spreading best practice, and favours it intervening in badly run authorities. Among innovators, partnership is the vogue word. It underpins a growing commitment to community politics on the one hand, and the European Community on the other. 'When I go to Brussels,' says Mr Stringer, 'I get a much friendlier reception than in Whitehall these days.' Radical attitudes to constitutional change are also evident. Support for regional government, electoral reform and coalition politics is strong and spreading among Labour councillors. Mr Stringer believes most councillors back proportional representation. In Manchester, he says, 'we get 55 per cent of the vote and 86 per cent of the seats - not an obvious recipe for good government.' Ms Hodge thinks on the same lines. As the most likely leader of Labour's proposed Greater London Authority, which would be elected by PR, she may soon be setting the tone for the rest.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Nike improves but share price varies NIKE, the US sports shoe and apparel maker, saw its share price fluctuate yesterday after reporting an improvement in first-quarter profits. Nike lifted net income to Dollars 122.6m, or Dollars 1.60 a share, a 7 per cent improvement from the Dollars 114.4m, or Dollars 1.50, reported a year earlier. Although earnings were strong in a difficult retail climate, they disappointed Wall Street initially. Analysts had been looking for earnings of about Dollars 1.70 a share and, by mid-session, its shares had slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 74 3/4 , but reversed direction to close at Dollars 76 3/8 , up Dollars  7/8 . The company said first-quarter expenses were unusually high, reflecting increased advertising linked to the Barcelona Olympics and the launch of new brands. Mr Philip Knight, chairman, said: 'Management strongly believe that these investments will add to Nike's momentum in key international markets and allow us to achieve out stated full-year earnings growth objective of 15 per cent.' During the quarter, revenues rose 16 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn from Dollars 947.2m. Growth was led by international sales, which soared 44 per cent to Dollars 357.7m. Excluding the impact of dollar translations, overseas revenues rose 32 per cent. In contrast, domestic footwear and apparel revenues advanced only 5 per cent to Dollars 687.7m, while revenues from other brands jumped 30 per cent to Dollars 54.4m. Orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery between September 1992 and January 1993 rose 27 per cent to Dollars 1.36bn. Nike's consolidated gross margin improved to 39.4 per cent, against 38.7 per cent the previous year.</p>

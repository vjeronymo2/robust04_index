			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Li Ka-shing and Citic in joint bid MR Li Ka-shing and Citic Pacific, Beijing's listed conglomerate in Hong Kong, have joined forces to make a HKDollars 8.7bn (USDollars 1.1bn) bid for Miramar Hotel and Investment. Mr Li's Cheung Kong and Citic Pacific are offering HKDollars 15.50 a share and HKDollars 8.50 a warrant for Miramar, which owns the Miramar Hotel on Kowloon and office and retail properties on the peninsula. Mr Li has taken small minority positions in other deals involving Citic but this bid for Miramar is the largest transaction in which he has participated with a mainland-backed company. It underlines Mr Li's growing ties with mainland Chinese power brokers and the decision he has made to concentrate on Hong Kong and China ventures. However, the initial reaction of the Hong Kong stock market was that the offer was too low. Miramar's share price yesterday closed at HKDollars 16 and analysts are advising investors to bide their time. They said Miramar represented one of the best opportunities available in Hong Kong's property market. Miramar's assets are in prime Kowloon locations and have good redevelopment potential. Mr Li and Citic have indicated that they wish to maintain Miramar's listing.</p>

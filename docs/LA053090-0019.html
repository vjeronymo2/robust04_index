			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL STARTS IN ALIEN DETENTION CASE;  </P> <P> COURT: TWO CARLSBAD STORE EMPLOYEES ARE CHARGED WITH UNLAWFUL IMPRISONMENT IN  AN INCIDENT INVOLVING THE HANDCUFFING OF A MIGRANT LABORER OUTSIDE THE STORE.  </P> <P> On the day they handcuffed a farm worker to a railing behind a Carlsbad store,  two store employees were making a legitimate citizen's arrest, defense  attorneys said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The argument was made during opening statements of the trial for Randy Ryberg  and William Zimmerman in Vista Superior Court. The two are charged with a  misdemeanor count of unlawful imprisonment in the Jan. 3 incident at the rural  Country Country.  </P> <P> Lynn A. Behymer told the jury that one of the jobs of his client, Ryberg, was  to drive off the scores of migrant workers who sometimes blocked the entrance  to the store as they sought day labor along El Camino Real, a few miles south  of California 78.  </P> <P> Unlike his brother Rick Ryberg, the owner of the store, Randy Ryberg had never  before made a citizen's arrest but he decided to give it a try after Candido  Gayosso Salas, 27, ignored several warnings to leave the property, Behymer told  jurors.  </P> <P> Zimmerman, an independent meat cutter working at the market, assisted in making  the citizen's arrest, and he and Ryberg handcuffed Gayosso to the rail for more  than two hours, according to his attorney, Robert L. James.  </P> <P> Authorities allege that the pair attacked the undocumented worker in an attempt  to send a message to the great numbers of workers who gather in front of the  store each morning.  </P> <P> Gayosso, a slight man wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt, testified that he was  grabbed about 7:45 a.m. by Ryberg, who stands about 6-foot-6, and dragged to  the back of the store, where he was handcuffed to the rail.  </P> <P> Before being released, he told the court, his hands and legs were bound with  silver duct tape and a bag was placed over his head with a phrase reading "No  Mas Aqui," an ungrammatical Spanish warning to stay away.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. George McFetridge said Tuesday that the attack on Gayosso  was anything but a lawful citizen's arrest. "This was never a proper citizen's  arrest," he said.  </P> <P> "There's no excuse, in any event, for bagging a person like that, no matter  what point they were trying to make."  </P> <P> The Country Store case illustrates the tensions that have grown throughout  North County, where perhaps thousands of documented and undocumented day  laborers from Mexico and Central America live in makeshift encampments, often  within sight of new housing developments.  </P> <P> At least one community has recently passed an anti-hiring ordinance to stem the  impromptu practice of hiring workers from city street corners.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, store worker Katey Dann testified that she saw Gayosso inside the  store earlier that morning and said she heard Randy Ryberg yell several times  for Gayosso and others to leave the market parking lot, where they were  apparently blocking traffic.  </P> <P> "He wouldn't leave the premises," she said. "If he did, he'd leave for a few  minutes and come back after Randy left."  </P> <P> Gayosso testified that he was not inside the store that morning and that he did  not hear Ryberg say anything before being grabbed. While he was being dragged  to the back of the store, Gayosso testified that Zimmerman held him face down  as Ryberg chased off two other migrants who had come to his aid.  </P></p>

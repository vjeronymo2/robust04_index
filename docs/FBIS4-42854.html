			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mario Tedeschini Lalli: "Alarm at Fascism From </F> Croatia And Slovenia"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- No sooner has one rip in the government's  international image been repaired than another has appeared.  The polemic over the statements made by Israel's deputy foreign  minister and by European Commission President Jacques Delors was  just beginning to subside when a crisis flared up again, this  time in the northeast. Slovenia and Croatia have decided to  join forces against "neofascist claims," and have made a point  of stating this publicly through their presidents.    The two republics have never been on particularly friendly  terms. As a matter of fact, according to Slovene President Milan  Kucan, yesterday's meeting with his Croatian counterpart Franjo  Tudjman in Zagreb was "polemical and very tough." However,  faced with the "danger from the West," they found it expedient  to overcome their differences quickly. The more outspoken  statement came from Croatian President Tudjman, who included  "Italian neofascist claims on some Slovene and Croatian  territories" among the reasons making it imperative for Zagreb  and Ljubljana to "coordinate their policies." Kucan was more  subdued, but nevertheless adamant: "The disquieting statements  made by some politicians in Italy" and war in Bosnia require "a  prompt solution to reciprocal problems."    Kucan was obviously referring to National Alliance's [AN]  presence in the majority government as well as to the request  put forward by MSI [Italian Social Movement] member Mirko  Tremaglia (who is now the lower house foreign committee  chairman) to modify the eastern borders. The new Italian  Government has always denied having any such intentions, but the  MSI's statements have underscored Foreign Minister Antonio  Martino's decision to ask for a conclusion to current  negotiations on minority rights and the assets of the 1945  refugees before giving the go-ahead to the two countries' entry  into the European Union.    Tudjman tried to draw a distinction between the government's  and AN's respective positions by stating that he hoped that the  government would "continue to pursue previous governments'  policies based on democracy and friendly relations." However,  he added that "we cannot ignore certain voices in Italy that are  making an open apology for fascism and its imperialist policies."    In short, AN and the positions put forward by some of the  latter's members are beginning to weigh heavily on the  government's foreign policy and leaving its flank exposed to  criticism from such characters as Tudjman who, for some time  now, have been riding the wave of nationalist feeling in their  own countries. As a result, living conditions for Italians in  Istria--now divided between Slovenia and Croatia--may become  worse in the short term. [passage omitted]</p>

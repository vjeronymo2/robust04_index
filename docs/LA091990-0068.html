			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR FORCE'S 2ND CHOICE NOT AS VOCAL  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's preferred candidate for Air Force chief of  staff, Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, was a finalist when the post became available  earlier this summer but lost out in part because Gen. Michael J. Dugan was  judged better able to "tell the Air Force story," a senior Air Force officer  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Given Dugan's firing Monday for indiscretions in an interview with The Times  and the Washington Post, it would seem that the less loquacious McPeak is the  right man at the right time.  </P> <P> With discretion and tact now the watchwords, associates of McPeak who were  contacted for remarks about the man and his record refused public comment.  Still, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said, subordinates should not fear  talking with reporters -- a point he said he had made to commanders and other  Pentagon officials.  </P> <P> "It would be a thorough misreading and a total misunderstanding if anyone were  to conclude that we're trying to discourage people from talking to the press,"  Williams said. "We encourage our military commanders to be open and  accessible."  </P> <P> Air Force leaders may be betting that the 54-year-old McPeak's career record  will speak for itself. In his 33 years with the Air Force, McPeak has received  16 medals and awards, including the Distinguished Service Medal for  exceptionally meritorious service and the Silver Star for gallantry in combat.  </P> <P> A Vietnam veteran and former Thunderbird pilot, McPeak's present responsibility  as commander in chief of the Pacific Air Forces at Hickam Air Force Base in  Hawaii includes the command of more than 60,000 people serving in U.S. air  operations from Japan to the United States.  </P> <P> McPeak, who has more than 5,000 flying hours, was the lead flier for the  Thunderbirds, or U.S. Air Force Demonstration Squadron, in more than 200 air  shows.  </P> <P> After his stunt flying, McPeak reported to Vietnam, where he flew 269 combat  missions and earned several medals for gallantry and service during his nine  months there. He then received his master's degree in international relations  from George Washington University and attended the National War College in  1974.  </P> <P> He was assigned to command U.S. air bases in England and Spain for one year  each and was eventually promoted to chief of staff of U.S. air forces in Europe  in 1981. Returning to the United States in 1982, McPeak served at Langley Air  Force Base in Virginia, at Air Force headquarters in Washington and as  commander of the 12th Air Force at Bergstrom Air Force Base in Texas.  </P> <P> His promotions came quickly after 1981, when he rose to brigadier general. In  July, 1988, he was promoted to full general.  </P> <P> A health and fitness buff, McPeak is married and has two sons.  </P> <P> Williams declined to say how soon President Bush is expected to act on Cheney's  recommendation.  </P> <P> As for Dugan, he will receive a full pension, which for an officer with his  rank and seniority totals about $60,000 annually, officials said.  </P></p>

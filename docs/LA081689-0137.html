			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> DOCTORS HIT GAZA STRIP HEALTH CARE  </P> <P> An Israeli-Arab doctors association today condemned medical conditions in the  Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, citing inadequate services and Israeli military  action against patients and staff.  </P> <P> In a 32-page report, the Assn. of Israeli and Palestinian Physicians for Human  Rights alleged that medical services in the Gaza Strip "are tied to political,  not medical (or) professional policy."  </P> <P> "Since the beginning of the uprising in the occupied territories, a new  tendency has appeared -- the use of medicine as an additional means of  repression against the population," the report said. "This means that medicine  has been removed from the status of a basic human right and recruited as a  means of punishment."  </P></p>

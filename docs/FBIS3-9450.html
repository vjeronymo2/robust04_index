			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wieslaw Kaczmarek, minister for ownership </F> transformations, by Grazyna Saniewska; place and date not given]    [Text] [Excerpt] [Saniewska] Minister, what was the  subject of your talks with representatives of the Jelfa work  force during your visit to Wroclaw?    [Kaczmarek] I was asked whether the issue of the free shares  that the Jelfa work force is supposed to receive will reflect  the value of the input of effort contributed by the employees to  the development of that prosperous firm--also, whether the  minister has the official power to bypass regulations that are  binding for everyone else. It was suggested that I award 15  percent of Jelfa shares free to the work force, or recommend  that the Council of Ministers do so. In addition, the employees  expressed their wish to buy a further 5 percent of their firm's  shares. However, during quite blunt talks that we held with the  firm's representatives, I refused to endorse such a procedure.  This is because I believe that the allocation of shares to the  work force should be decided within the firm on the basis of its  statute. Jelfa's trade unionists tried to persuade me to agree  to different solutions, which depart from the regulations  currently in force.    [Saniewska] But there is no shortage of examples throughout  the country that prove that exceptions are being made to the  rule. Why should Jelfa or Polifarb Wroclaw not set another  precedent?    [Kaczmarek] There have indeed been several precedents,  notably Kwidzyn, Gorazdze, Polifarb Cieszyn, and Tonsil. I am  familiar with the last case from my own experience. I was  obliged to buy out the promissory note drafted by my  predecessor. There, the work force was not able to take  advantage of the chance to buy their own company's shares on the  same principles that had been enjoyed by the employees of the  first five joint-stock companies to be floated on the stock  market. There have been quite enough of these precedents, and I  have no intention of bypassing the regulations set out in  relevant parliamentary acts. The only cases where decisions to  do so can be made at all must be truly exceptional, and I do not  find such a situation at Jelfa--or in other enterprises whose  work forces desire to make a major killing on the stock market  in connection with the current boom. They want to grab as many  shares for themselves as they can, at the lowest prices.  However, such an attitude is very selfish when you consider the  possibilities open to employees of the budget-funded sector, old  age and disability pensioners, or the learned professions. I  would not like to contribute to deepening divisions over  privatization in our society. On the other hand, I intend to  alleviate the effect of certain phenomena connected, for  example, with purchases of company shares. That is why, in  Jelfa's case, we intend to try out a different form of selling  shares in public flotation. So we can avoid share "touts" and  other irregularities and minimize the risk of going wrong with  the selling prices of shares.    [Saniewska] Do you have plans to privatize our copper  industry?    [Kaczmarek] This problem should be viewed from the  perspective of at least 20 years and in terms of an eventual  exhaustion of copper ore. This is because we must be prepared  to bring in alternative solutions to compensate for the  exhaustion of the raw material, so that we can at least make use  of the infrastructure we have created there, including the  copper-metallurgy sector and the entire  copper-product-processing industry. All of this must be  carefully planned so that, in case of economic disaster, that  whole monoindustrial sector does not collapse into the sort of  mess we already have in Mielec and Walbrzych. For the time  being, we do not intend to privatize the copper plant, and, even  more emphatically, we will not privatize its core element--that  is, the integrated technological complex of mines and smelting  plants. On the other hand, it might be that we will privatize  the infrastructure and the firms constituting backup facilities  for the whole complex. In turn, the main elements of the whole  complex require a throrough restructuring to enable its  particular components to talk the same financial language, so  that it should be possible to prepare a detailed costs analysis  of the whole enterprise. After all, it is the cost structure in  the whole sector that will ultimately decide whether we can  adjust to world prices and whether our copper plants do not lose  in competition with their rivals.    [Saniewska] What do you think of the concept of placing  parliament members hailing from parties that form the government  coalition on the board of directors of the copper corporation?    [Kaczmarek] I feel bad about it. This is because I am  forced to apologize for the fact that our coalition members have  not withdrawn from their respective offices in the corporation.  All of the other parliament members have done so because the  law obliges them to do it. Only two of our own colleagues have  not resigned, on the excuse that board members can be recalled  only at a general meeting. Such a position does not become a  member of parliament. Instead of engaging their energies in the  cause of helping the copper sector, they are trying to create  another source of possible unrest around themselves. Neither  Sejm deputies nor senators are permitted to sit on boards of  directors or hold office in joint-stock companies. And  ministers are obliged to uphold these laws. That is why I  consulted the Sejm and Senate speakers over this matter.    [Saniewska] Among the privatization guidelines approved by  the Sejm, there is a provision stating that a joint-stock  company owned by its work force can be set up only if no other,  more advantageous offer has been received by the enterprise.  Does this clause not give officials too many opportunities for  arbitrary decisions? And is it not an attempt to undermine the  emerging joint "employee-owned" companies?    [Kaczmarek] It is certainly not such an attempt because  joint employee-owned companies have dominated our privatization  scene. To every 1,000 of such companies, there are only 100  joint capital companies--that is, joint ventures with a  strategic investor. The provision you mentioned should serve as  a signal announcing the official state strategy. That strategy  must pay priority attention to such elements as investors,  minimum prices, and social benefit packages. When all of these  factors are taken into consideration, employee-owned companies  invariably lose out to solutions suggested by strategic  investors. That is why, in our work on the the Enterprise  Privatization Act, we intend to narrow somewhat the range of  firms in which employees could set up their own joint-stock  companies. They should be set up in enterprises whose work  forces are not larger than 400 and whose annual turnover is  lower than 12 million ECU's. Such preconditions are necessary  if we are to avoid situations similar to that of Winiary, where  a profitable firm could have been owned by a larger group of  shareholders. From the viewpoint of its optimum development  strategy, Winiary needs an aggressive investor. Why should we  sell it to a group of employees? After all, in matters of  privatization, we must not be guided by short-term tactics  designed to soothe the moods of the public. [passage omitted]</p>

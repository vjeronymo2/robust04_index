			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- The air force took  delivery of an undisclosed number of all-weather medium-sized  CN-235m transport planes from Spain in a ceremony held at a base  near Pusan Thursday afternoon, with Chief of Staff Gen. Kim  Hong-nae and other ranking officers attending.    The aircraft, manufactured by Casa Co. of Spain according to  U.S. Air Force technical and operational requirements, will  replace C-54 and -123 [as received] planes to improve the  country's military transport capability.    Gen. Kim, saying modern warfare hinges on military transport  operations, exhorted the air force to train for early tactical  deployment and operation of the new transport planes.    The CN-235m can conduct all airborne operations such as  drops  of paratroopers, military supplies and flares in inclement  weather and at night, as it is equipped with an inertial  navigational system, a satellite navigational data receiver, a  weather radar system and an electronic countermeasure system.    It can carry 48 armed troops and 4,989 kg of supplies and  fly  for 10 hours at a cruising speed of 398 km per hour. Its  maximum altitude is 9.14 km, cruising range 3,314 km and maximum  takeoff load 16,465 kg.    Casa started developing the CN-235m in 1980, test-flew it in  1983 and began commercial production in 1986. It has thus far  sold 140 of this aircraft, including 41 for civilian use, to 16  countries.    The air force, under a plan to improve its military  transport  capability begun in 1989, selected in April 1992 the CN-235m to  replace the obsolete C-54 and -123 aircraft after a comparative  examination of this model and Italy's G-222 model.    When deployed, the new transport aircraft will carry out  normal military transport operations as well as such special  missions as anti-irregular warfare, rescue and airlift  operations to special areas.</p>

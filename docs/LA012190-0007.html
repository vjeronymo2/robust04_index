			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I was shocked when I read one of your viewers' comments on the Dec. 18 episode  of "Newhart."  </P> <P> Talk about a viewer completely missing the point of the show! The viewer  ridiculed the show, claiming that it poked fun at an overweight woman. The  woman was not overweight! She had a perfect figure except for a large derriere.  The show highlighted how superficial people can be, judging each other on  physical traits. Your viewer asked "Whatever happened to intelligent writers?"  I ask "Whatever happened to intelligent viewers?"  </P> <P> Sue Menn, Alhambra  </P></p>

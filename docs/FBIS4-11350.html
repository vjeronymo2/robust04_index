			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, Apr 22 (AFP) -- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister  Ernesto Leal today outlined the dangers posed to the Central  American economy by NAFTA, which was recently signed by the  United States, Mexico, and Canada.    Speaking before the U.S.-Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce,  Leal  said the privileged access of Mexican products to the United  States places Central America at a disadvantage. In turn, he  urged that "a transition period" of about three years be adopted  to allow the region to concentrate on improving competitiveness  while it adheres to NAFTA.    The minister recalled that the presidents of the region had  met with President Bill Clinton in November 1993 and that they  proposed that the region enter the treaty under the same terms  received by Mexico. However, he noted that unfavorable  conditions in Central America -- a postwar economy and a  technological lag -- prevented the region from advancing at the  same pace maintained by more developed countries.    Today, about 50 percent of Central America's exports, which  amount to some $4.5 billion, are shipped to U.S. markets.</p>

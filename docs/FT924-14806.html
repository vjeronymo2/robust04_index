			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Salesmen pound the continental pavements: Machine tools SALESMEN from Bridgeport Machines, the Leicester-based machine-tool maker, are already pounding the pavements of the Continent to exploit a cheaper pound in promoting their products. 'People have left for Germany today to try and cash in on our lower prices,' said Mr Malcolm Taylor, managing director of Bridgeport. 'We are also sending to Italy, though they seem to be more or less in the same boat as us.' The company, whose annual sales are running at around Pounds 30m - half the level recorded in 1990 - exports about 60 per cent of all its machinery. Thirty-five per cent of all sales go to continental Europe. According to Mr Taylor: 'The market is very price-sensitive in recession and the fall of sterling makes an important difference on a machine costing up to Pounds 70,000. We are out there today, aggressively exploiting the situation'. Mr Taylor acknowledges that imports of German and Japanese technology used by his business will cost more, but says the overall impact of sterling's decline is beneficial. 'We have got to where we wanted to be by default. When the pound was higher, we were struggling to sell. Now there are far more opportunities and we are getting back into deals which were previously aborted on price grounds'. Bridgeport is playing the cheaper pound for all it is worth. Salesmen are at the Leipzig machine tool show, supporting the company's German agent and pressing home the advantage of lower prices. Poor sales at the Chicago show revived towards its close because of the falling pound. 'We had almost lost the US market at nearly two dollars to the pound. But we are back to reality and the impact has been immediate'. All Bridgeport wants now is the restoration of some stability to the exchange rate.</p>

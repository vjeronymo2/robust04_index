			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lecture by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova </F> delivered at a meeting of the "HOSPODARSKE NOVINY Club" in  Bratislava on 13 March: "Possibilities of the Slovak Economy"]    [Text] The macroeconomic policy of the government until the  end of 1994 is determined by the goals to achieve zero economic  growth, a 4-percent state budget deficit, and an inflation rate  of 10-13 percent, and to keep the rate of unemployment under 17  percent, to maintain foreign currency reserves, to consolidate  the internal convertibility of the Slovak koruna, and to  maintain a balanced balance of payments. Based on an analysis of  the 1993 results of the economy, the goals for 1994 are  exceedingly demanding and their attainment is associated with a  number of risks. Which of these risks are most serious and what  possibilities do we have to limit or eliminate them?  <H5>  Risk of Failure To Achieve Zero Economic Growth </H5>   The factors of this risk are on the side of demand (low  domestic household demand underpinned by purchasing power, low  demand of the government and entrepreneurial sector, low  external demand), but far greater, in my opinion, are the risks  on the side of supply. They dwell, in particular, in the  inadequate reaction, differentiated according to sectors, to the  long-term transformation changes, short-term cyclical changes,  and other changes in the economic environment. What are the  causes of the entrepreneurial sector's inadequate reaction? The  conduct of an entrepreneurial entity depends primarily on the  internal interest structure and mechanisms of the realization of  differentiated interests therein, according to the  characteristics of the entrepreneurial environment [sentence as  published].    The most radical intervention in the internal interest  structure is a change in proprietary relations. The structure  of proprietary relations determines, to a decisive extent, the  interest structure but the interest structure is also  influenced, to a large degree, by the mechanisms of the  realization of interests of various interest groups. Let us  cite the example of one of the most complex interest structures  -- the interest structure that comes about in a company that has  gone through the process of coupon privatization and in which  the state has retained a certain stake. This structure  comprises the interests of the management, the interests of  individual small shareholders, the interests of investment  funds, the interests of the National Property Fund of the Slovak  Republic, the interests of employees (those who do not  constitute the management), the interests of creditors (in the  event of indebted companies), and, possibly, also the interests  of an individual large owner (such as a foreign investor, for  example). The mechanisms of the realization of the interests of  individual interest groups are still only taking shape and are  imperfect, as are the mechanisms of solving conflicts between  diverse interests. Moreover, the existing mechanisms are being  applied in an environment that deforms their effect. For  example, the low effectiveness of the law on bankruptcy and  settlement is not caused only by some of the law's shortcomings.  The introduction of arbitration proceedings is often being  criticized. This stipulation is contained also in the U.S.  bankruptcy law, where, however, it has been introduced in the  interest of creditors who are insufficiently prepared, or  afraid, to bear the risks arising from bankruptcy proceedings.  The risk of the failure to achieve zero economic growth can be  limited, on the side of supply, by a micro-economic policy of  the state that will establish suitable conditions for more  adequate reactions of the entrepreneurial sphere. The main  focus of the state's micro- economic policy in the  transformation period is, undoubtedly, a change in proprietary  relations. However, it must not be confined to that but must  also center on eliminating various deformations of the  environment such as, for example, its monopolization, and the  like.    In all the transforming economies, this environment is  characterized, among other things, by the so-called "trap of  tough budgetary restrictions." It is a consequence of the  unfavorable combination of several factors: the rapid transition  from a soft budget policy toward tough budgetary restrictions,  companies' inadequate structural adaptation, and soft or  ineffectual legislative conditions. A result of these factors  is drastic growth of inter-company credit indebtedness and an  alarming deterioration of the commercial banks' portfolio. A  solution to the consequences of the "trap of tough budgetary  restrictions" will be effective in the long term only when we  succeed in eliminating its causes. It is therefore exceedingly  important that various approaches to solving intercompany debts  and so-called bad debts be coupled with the part of  transformation policy that establishes conditions for a change  in the conduct of the entrepreneurial sector. Once these  prerequisites are met, it will be possible, as the next step, to  release on a larger scale domestic and foreign credit resources  so as to boost investment demand. The sooner we succeed in  setting these processes into motion, the smaller will be the  risk of failure to achieve zero economic growth.   <H5>    Risk of Failure To Meet Budget Deficit Target </H5>   This risk has been fairly thoroughly analyzed and measures  designed to limit or eliminate it are in an advanced stage of  preparations. A part of these measures is of fiscal nature  (tax-related measures, for example), the other part has, in  addition to fiscal effects, also more fundamental transformation  effects. The tax-related measures are to raise state budget  revenues but, on the other hand, they also entail some  additional risks. There is the risk that the resultant price  increases will reduce demand and there exist social or political  risks. The drop in demand could lower the mechanically  estimated impact of tax adjustments on budget revenues and raise  demands for additional budget resources. The lowering of social  risks, for example, could raise demands on additional social  payments (welfare payments and the like). It is evident that  the tax adjustments aimed at eliminating the risks of budget  management must be carried out so that their positive effects  outweigh their potential negative effects.    Measures that, in addition to fiscal effects, have  transformation effects, too, include the lowering of subsidies  of the prices of electricity, gas, and heat for households.  Maintaining these prices deep below the level of costs does not  encourage energy conservation and, at the same time, it deforms  criteria for the allocation of investments in individual sectors  of the economy. The liberalization of the prices of energy for  households is therefore an important transformation step.    On the other hand, it requires that:    a) steps be taken to prevent monopoly price rises (by  introducing regulation of natural monopolies),    b) steps be taken to limit the impact on households in  general (by promoting energy conservation programs) and on  socially weak groups in particular (by means of various schemes  of protecting the socially weakest strata).  <H5>  Sociopolitical Risks </H5>   The fifth consecutive year of economic decline, and the  resulting continuing decline of employment, growth of the cost  of living, growth in the number of long-term unemployed, growing  number of households whose income is in the range of 1 to 1.5  times the subsistence minimum, and so forth, poses the growing  risk that transformation will become socially unsustainable.  The fact that these processes are in their fifth consecutive  year (with a certain alleviation in the second half of 1992) is  particularly serious. It means that the mitigating effect of  the relatively good starting social standard of households in  1989 is being exhausted. Major risks dwell in:    a) the growth of the socially weaker strata at the expense  of  the middle class,    b) the growing regional differentiation of the social  situation,    c) the impossibility of tackling some needs of the  population  (such as housing needs) from their own resources, in a situation  when other resources not available.    The mounting social difficulties create a fertile soil for  political forces proposing extreme or populist solutions. The  enforcement of such solutions in the actual economic sphere  would, however, further aggravate the risks of the Slovak  economy.    There is no doubt that alleviating the risks in the economic  sphere -- that is, in particular, the risk of failure to achieve  zero economic growth, the risk of higher-than-projected  inflation, and so forth -- is the basic prerequisite for  addressing the sociopolitical risks. On the other hand, it will  also be necessary to take steps in the social sphere that will  alleviate social tension and maintain social peace. Without  maintaining social peace, it is impossible to create by  democratic means prerequisites for the Slovak economy to become,  within an acceptable time frame, a modern and efficient economy  integrated into the European and global economic structures.    The endeavor to maintain social peace makes it necessary to  spread the social costs of transformation over a longer period  of time. This means that some partial transformation measures  with serious social repercussions must be administered in doses,  without, however, being postponed. It is becoming apparent  that, without administration in doses, as it were, costs of the  social safety net can soar and trigger additional risks (for  example, sharply increase the budget risk). A hopeless  situation then comes about.    The estimates of the costs of transformation are often being  compared with the costs of reconstructing the war-ravaged West  European economy [after 1945]. The transforming states cannot  reckon with any new Marshall Plan. Foreign aid represents only  a small fraction of their needs. The magnitude of the costs,  and the social inevitability of spreading them over a period of  time, make it necessary to acquire foreign credit resources. It  is of extraordinary importance under what terms these resources  are extended and on what they are spent.    It is the duty of government policy to ensure that the terms  under which resources are acquired, and the methods of their  use, be as favorable as possible for the Slovak economy.    That is why it will be necessary, in the course of 1994, to  address the risks of the Slovak economy and to demand the  implementation of an economic policy, the aims of which are not  easy to reconcile: maintaining macroeconomic stability at an  adequate level and ensuring that the economic decline does not  continue. The conditions in which the Slovak economy finds  itself in the year 1994 make this task even more demanding.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Two Israelis -- a man and a woman -- were killed  and another was seriously wounded in a terrorist attack near Bet  Hagay, in the Hebron Hills, this morning. The seriously wounded  man, a resident of Qiryat Arba', is being treated at the site of  the incident. The names of the dead have not yet been announced.    As far as is known, the terrorists, driving in a Peugeot,  overtook the Israelis' Fiat Uno and fired several rounds from an  automatic weapon at the Israeli car .    Our correspondents Moti Amir and Aviv Bushinsky report that  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has closed off the area, set up  roadblocks, and launched searches for the assailants. Military  medical crews and three civilian ambulances from the adjoining  settlements were summoned to the site.</p>

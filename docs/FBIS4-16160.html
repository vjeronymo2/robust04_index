			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 13 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- A representative from  the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs today released the  following statement:    Moscow is following the development of events in the former  Yugoslavia and around it with concern and responsibility. The  NATO air strikes of 10 and 11 April have substantially  aggravated the military and political situation. The Russian  side repeatedly warned of this. The international community  must now act urgently to save the situation. Russia's resolve  to continue its initiatives in this direction has been confirmed  by its president and foreign minister, the Russian president's  special representative is working actively in the region.    We are worried that the statements made in support of the  act  of force in Gorazde, by many Western leaders, could lead to  reliance on force in Bosnian and in world affairs in general.  Reports have already appeared about discussions in NATO  headquarters of new ultimatums to the Serbs, by-passing the  United Nations. We do not accept this policy and would put in  its place a policy of genuine partnership and cooperation -- not  just in words but in action, for the sake of stability and  security.    So we insist on an unconditional observation of the  procedures approved by the UN Security Council for bringing  aircraft into action in Bosnia, which stipulate consultations  with the UN Secretary General and members of the Security  Council.    We still expect exhaustive reports from the UN Secretariat  General about what happened in the Gorazde region. The  appropriate instructions have been given to our representative  at the United Nations.    According to information confirmed by the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] leadership, the events in Gorazde began with  provocative activities on the part of Muslim armed formations,  which met with an incommensurate response from the Bosnian  Serbs. The Muslim provocations are continuing even now. The  UNPROFOR headquarters in Sarajevo confirms that on 11 April the  Muslims attacked the Serb-held village of Lapsiza north of Pale,  and on 12 April they mortared Serb positions around Gorazde.    Bellicose pronouncements by the Bosnian Serbs about their  intention to shoot down all aircraft overflying their positions  are also a cause for concern.    We again appeal to all parties to refrain from any  provocative activities, as the UN Security Council has demanded  at Russia's initiative. At the same time all countries  committed to a settlement of the crisis and the world community  as a whole must get the Bosnian parties to behave in precisely  this way and to return to the negotiating table in order to  achieve a durable and comprehensive cease-fire. Opportunities  for this do still exist.    For its part Russia is doing its utmost to promote the  earliest possible settlement.</p>

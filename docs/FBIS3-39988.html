Minister Andreatta -- who is very familiar with the situation  -- expressed satisfaction with the fact that Italy is involved.  He told Minister Granic that Italy has a great deal of  understanding for Croatia's position. The talks resulted in the  realization that relations between Croatia and Italy are being  advanced to a great extent and that Italy can exercise a  positive influence in the process of seeking solutions. The two  ministers talked extensively over a working lunch. The Croatian  side assesses the talks as cordial and very fruitful.    Minister Granic and Ambassadors Rudolf and Livljanic talked  early this evening with Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, the  Vatican's state secretary. The sixth meeting between the two  politicians took place in a very cordial atmosphere. The Holy  See is following developments on the ground with great interest  as well as the diplomatic process for resolving the crisis. It  is paying particular attention to the agreement between Generals  Roso and Delic. In the Vatican there are reports that this  agreement has a good chance of success.    The Holy See reiterated its opinion that a solution to the  crisis should certainly be found, and also that agreement should  be reached between the Croats and Muslims. The pope will be  informed about the talks. Minister Granic has handed over  President Tudjman's message to the pope. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Mexico's ruling party on course for poll win Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party looked set for victory in yesterday's presidential and congressional elections, after preliminary figures from exit polls gave it a comfortable margin over its nearest rival. Turnout in the election was much higher than expected. The leftist Party of Democratic Revolution alleged electoral irregularities, although the centre-right opposition described the process as generally adequate. Most of the complaints arose from special polling booths, in place for voters not on the electoral roll or staying outside their home district, which ran out of ballot papers in the morning. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the ruling party's candidate, described himself as 'very content' with the results of the PRI's own polling. 'I'm happier than I imagined,' he told foreign correspondents last night. One exit poll, carried out for Mexico's Chamber of Radio and Television by the US firm Mitofsky International and Mexican associates, gave Mr Zedillo a strong lead. According to Mr Mitofsky, preliminary figures gave Mr Zedillo about 50 per cent support, the centre-right National Action Party about 25 per cent and the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution under 20 per cent. Pre-electoral polls had indicated a similar outcome. Preliminary results from polling stations are not expected to be released until early this morning. Turnout in the election was preliminarily estimated at about 65 per cent, compared with 48 per cent in the 1988 presidential elections. The leftist PRD alleged in a statement yesterday that there had been a series of irregulaties which it believed were committed by 'electoral alchemists of the ruling party'. It claimed that electors without credentials had voted, that the ruling party illegally took supporters to vote several times at different polling booths and that representatives of their party were expelled from voting stations.</p>

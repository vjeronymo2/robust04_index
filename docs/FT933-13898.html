			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Apple plans cost shake-up in wake of heavy loss APPLE Computer reported heavy losses for its third quarter, after higher than expected charges to cover the cost of 2,500 job cuts announced earlier this month. The personal computer company said it intends to 'dramatically reduce its cost structure' to boost profitability. Apple took a pre-tax charge of Dollars 320.9m for the job cuts and other cost reduction measures. After charges, the company reported a net loss for the quarter of Dollars 188.3m, or Dollars 1.63 per share. For the same period last year, Apple had net profits of Dollars 131.7m, or Dollars 1.07 per share. Net revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.86bn, up 7 per cent from Dollars 1.74bn in last year's third quarter. The ongoing price wars in the PC industry, as well as weaker than expected sales in Europe, contributed to the disappointing third-quarter results, Apple said. It said itmore aggressively on price in its personal computer business, while reducing its cost structure to compensate for lower gross profit margins. 'We're confident we can put our business back on a growth path by aggressively pursuing market share while offering innovative technology. At the same time, we must significantly, and permanently, lower our cost of doing business,' said Michael Spindler, Apple president and chief executive officer. Mr Spindler was appointed chief executive, succeeding Mr John Sculley, who remains chairman, last month. Apple has cut prices on many of its Macintosh products over the past three months, including price reductions on its popular PowerBook portable computers last week. 'Early indications suggest that our most recent price reductions are accelerating our unit shipments,' Mr Spindler said. 'Development of new Macintosh desktop systems and new PowerBook notebook computers are on track.' Apple's new businesses' personal digital assistants, servers, and software products, promise to contribute to revenue and profits in the coming fiscal year, he added. 'As a result, we see excellent opportunities for growth in Apple's future.' For the nine-month period, Apple reported net sales of Dollars 5.8bn, up from Dollars 5.3bn in the same period last year. Net profits were Dollars 83.9m, or 70 cents per share, down from Dollars 432.8m, or Dollars 3.52 per share a year earlier.</p>

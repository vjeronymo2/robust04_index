			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: India remains on its winning streak - Budget hopes are fuelling Bombay's rally Indian shares continued their winning streak yesterday, fuelled by foreign and domestic investors' hopes that next month's budget will give a fresh impetus to economic growth and to the government's liberalisation programme. The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of 30 leading shares rose 24.80 to 3,928.59, in the latest upsurge in the market's strongest rally since the 1992 Bombay securities market scandal. The BSE has now advanced almost 50 per cent since the start of November. The rally has been triggered by foreign fund managers, who have been permitted to invest in the Indian market for the first time in many years as part of the economic reform programme. The surge in foreign buying dispelled the sense of caution that gripped Indian investors in the wake of the 1992 scandal, which ended the previous big rally. Investors were temporarily knocked out of their stride last month by a regulatory dispute, which closed the market for two weeks, and by the political uncertainty caused by the threatened resignation of Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, who offered to quit after he was criticised by a parliamentary report into the scandal but was later persuaded to stay. The effects of these disruptions have proved short-lived. Mr Singh has emerged from the political turmoil with his reputation enhanced by the support he received from politicians and businessmen alike. The regulatory dispute - a row over forward trading between stockbrokers and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets' watchdog - has yet to be resolved. But fund managers say they are not unduly concerned by the argument, as long as it does not lead to another market closure. The market closed in December when stockbrokers went on strike in protest at an order from the securities board to liquidate all positions in the forward market, an order given to stop the market over-heating. The strike ended after it became clear that the securities board would not relent. Nor are investors attaching much importance to a separate argument at the Bombay Stock Exchange which led to the resignation on Monday of Mr GD Desai, the exchange's president. Mr Desai clashed with exchange board members about the scope of his powers. His term was due to end in March. Businessmen in Bombay expect the market to remain strong until the budget, though they do not rule out temporary corrections. Mr Ajit Dayal, a director of the Indian affiliate of Jardine Fleming, the investment bank, forecast the BSE's index would soon cross 4,000. 'Foreign money is piling into the market,' he said. Mr Dayal estimated that foreign institutions invested about Dollars 1bn in the Indian market last year and bought a further Dollars 1.6bn in issues made by Indian companies overseas. He predicted the combined figure could reach Dollars 4bn in 1994. However, more cautious stockbrokers warned that the Finance Ministry is monitoring the rally closely to avoid any repeat of the 1992 scandal when funds were illegally siphoned out of the banking system and into equities. One danger this time is that companies taking advantage of the buoyant market to raise funds will be tempted to invest the proceeds in the stock market, possibly breaking securities regulations which restrict such operations. The flow of foreign direct investment has also increased sharply. The Industry Ministry estimates that foreign companies last year invested Rs16bn, up from Rs6.75bn in 1992. Investments for which approvals were sought, but which have not necessarily been put into effect yet, increased to Rs89bn from Rs38.9bn.</p>

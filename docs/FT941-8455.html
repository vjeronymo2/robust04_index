			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: Austrian carriers in share deal Austrian Airlines will buy a 42.85 per cent stake in Tyrolean Airways, the country's second largest scheduled flights operator. The deal, which must be approved by the companies' boards, is a further step towards restructuring the country's airline industry and will strengthen the Austrian national carrier's position in negotiations over co-operation with Lufthansa. Under the transaction the share capital of Tyrolean Airways will be increased by 50 per cent to Sch135m (Dollars 11.1m). Austrian is believed to have paid close to Sch300m for its stake in the small but profitable Tyrolean, whose Innsbruck-based operations have successfully served as a regional hub for business and leisure traffic. Last year Tyrolean carried 510,000 passengers providing a turnover of about Sch1bn. Mr Rudolf Steicher, chairman of Austrian's supervisory board, said the move would strengthen both companies. Other shareholders will be Gernot Langes-Swarovski, the fine crystal and glass manufacturer, with 42.85 per cent and Leipnik Lundenburger Industrie, pulp and paper producer, with 14.3 per cent. The services of the two airlines will be integrated using Tyrolean's 13 aircraft and 10 of Austrian's fleet - ones which are dedicated to regional services within Austria and to short-range international destinations such as Budapest and Zurich. The 23 aircraft will carry about 1.2m passengers. Austrian is seeking co-operation with Lufthansa following the collapse of attempts to set up a joint airline with Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines Systems and KLM.</p>

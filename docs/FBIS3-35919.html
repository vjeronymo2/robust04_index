According to Geydar Aliyev, the "terms of the  contract are 30 years. That's why before signing such a  contract we have to examine everything in details".

Meanwhile, Western companies, the members of oil consortium  are afraid that such contract would not be signed at all. One  of the officials of oil companies told a TURAN's reporter that  "we will wait two-three more months and then we will wrap up our  work". The same official said in case if Azerbaijan refused to  sign the contract, they would start their activities in  Turkmenistan or Kazakhstan.</p>

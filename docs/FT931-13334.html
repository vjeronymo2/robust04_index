			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Faith in Frisell - Jazz CONTEMPORARY jazz has split into two distinct camps (leaving aside fusion, trad and similar afflictions for the moment). In the one, young musicians like the Marsalis clan, trumpeter Roy Hargrove, and even aggressive saxophonist Steve Coleman all continue a jazz tradition that calls for standards, or their own nervy compositions that could pass for standards, to be interpreted in the conventional bop idiom. In the other camp, lying more languidly, are chamber groups led by people like saxophonists John Surman, Jan Garbarek, or drummer Paul Motian, who have wider terms of reference. They take the essence of folk tunes, pop songs - and sacred standards - and perform on them a musical chromatography. Guitarist Bill Frisell belongs to this group and is more often heard gently dissecting the likes of Bill Evans alongside Paul Motian. In his own latest collection of covers, where Dylan collides with Madonna, Ives with Sousa, he has taken deconstruction toward its limit, however. So hard to swallow are some of the selections that purchasers of the new album, Have a Little Faith (Elektra Nonesuch 7559-79301), are well advised by its title and need to persevere. Set in a quartet consisting of Kermit Driscoll (electric bass), Joey Baron (drums) and Don Byron (clarinets) for this UK tour, Frisell's trademark notes, bent by an assortment of pedals, work hard at suppressing the message of familiar tunes. He releases component parts of a melody tortuously, creating a tension which is then relieved by a slashing power chord and more snatches of the familiar. I never imagined I would be glad to hear Madonna's 'Live To Tell' coming through the ether of improvisation. Vague and fogeyish, Frisell treads this precarious line determinedly, the rhythm section clattering about pleasantly behind and dreadlocked Don Byron squeezing in only occasionally with leaping clarinets. Opening at the QEH with Aaron Copland's Billy the Kid suite, he moved jauntily through the Americana of Muddy Waters, Dylan and Charles Ives, the dislocated arrangements and earnest knob twiddling giving alternately comic and poignant meaning to 'classics'. The resulting abstraction is as fresh and intelligent as that of his peers in the other camp - but is it still jazz? Tour continues to Dartington, Cambridge, Southampton, Leeds, Birmingham andSheffield. Sponsors: Arts Council Contemporary Music Network</p>

Protective Action Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal protective action recommendations provide advice to State and local governments on measures that they should take to avoid or reduce exposure of the public to radiation from a release of radioactive material. This includes emergency actions such as sheltering, evacuation, and prophylactic use of iodine. It also includes longer term measures to avoid or minimize exposure to residual radiation or exposure through the ingestion pathway such as restriction of food, temporary relocation, and permanent resettlement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Role of the Lead Federal Agency (LFA).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The LFA will assist State and local authorities, if requested, by advising them on protective actions for the public. The development or evaluation of protective action recommendations will be based upon the Protective Action Guides (PAGs) issued by EPA and HHS. In providing such advice, the LFA will use advice from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other Federal agencies with technical expertise on those matters whenever possible. The LFA's responsibilities for the development, evaluation, and presentation of protective action recommendations are to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Respond to requests from State and local governments for technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Consult with representatives from EPA, HHS, USDA, and other Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies as needed to provide advice to the LFA on protective actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Review all recommendations made by other Federal agencies exercising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory authorities related to protective actions to ensure consistency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Prepare a coordinated Federal position on protective action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations whenever time permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Present the Federal assessment of protective action recommendations, in conjunction with FEMA and other Federal agencies when practical, to State or other offsite authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Role of the Advisory Team for Environment, Food, and Health.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Advice on environment, food, and health matters will be provided to the LFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the Advisory Team for Environment, Food, and Health (Advisory Team)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consisting of representatives of EPA, HHS, and USDA supported by other Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, as warranted by the circumstances of the emergency. The Advisory Team provides direct support to the LFA and has no independent authority. The Advisory Team will not release information to the public or make recommendations on matters under the jurisdiction of a Federal agency unless authorized to do so by that agency. The Advisory Team will select a chairman for the Team. The Advisory Team will normally collocate with the FRMAC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For emergencies with potential for causing widespread radiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination where no onscene FRMAC is established, the functions of the Advisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Team may be accomplished in the LFA response facility in Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary role of the Advisory Team is to provide a mechanism for timely,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interagency coordination of advice to the LFA and other Federal agencies concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matters related to the following areas:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Environmental assessments (field monitoring) required for developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) PAGs and their application to the emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Protective action recommendations using data and assessment from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRMAC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Protective actions to prevent or minimize contamination of milk, food,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and water and to prevent or minimize exposure through ingestion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Recommendations regarding the disposition of contaminated livestock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and poultry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Recommendations for minimizing losses of agricultural resources from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiation effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Availability of food, animal feed, and water supply inspection programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assure wholesomeness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

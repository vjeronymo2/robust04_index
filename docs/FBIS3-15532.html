In the light of this, speculation about the "collapse  of the Russian plan to settle the Karabakh problem" is emerging.  The warring sides accuse each other of escalating hostilities  and of armed provocation aimed at sabotaging agreements on a  cease-fire and the withdrawal of troops to previously agreed  positions.    So what next? Have all possibilities for a peaceful solution  to the conflict been exhausted? Here is what Colonel General  Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy defense minister, has to say  about the situation which has emerged:    "Agreement on a 1 March cease-fire was reached and honored.  But in respect of the troop withdrawal, there have been  definite problems here. Mutual recriminations will continue  until such times as the rival armies are separated. Acting as a  mediator in this instance, I cannot because of this believe  either side at the moment.    To back up his words Georgiy Kondratyev produced two  telegrams sent to the Russian Defense Ministry by the chairmen  of the Azerbaijani and Armenian military departments concerning  the status of hostilities on the morning of 3 March. The  Azerbaijani Armed Forces chief of General Staff reports that the  Armenian side continues to attack Azeri positions from the  populated areas of Ashagi, Seydakhmeldy, and Kargan. The  Armenian defense minister also reports that hostilities took  place in this region, but makes no mention of the Azerbaijani  Army's offensive reported by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's  military department.    "So who is to be believed?" Colonel General Kondratyev  continues. "Until a 15- to 20-km security zone is set up, units  and subunits from both sides are withdrawn from this zone, and  posts erected with the participation of Russian observers, I, as  a neutral party, cannot accuse either side of violating the  agreements. In other words, until I have my own 'eyes' there, I  cannot say precisely who began the offensive.    As we know, on 2 March the Russian Defense Ministry  delivered  a list of the latest proposals for the cessation of hostilities  in the conflict region. In particular, the first point proposes  that all sides take the necessary measures to continue honoring  the cease-fire regime. In the second and third points it is  proposed that the sides withdraw combat hardware and armaments  to the agreed areas in the period 2 through 4 March. It is also  proposed that in the period 3 through 5 March the parties  implement the mutual separation of the sides' troops in two  sectors, Mardakert and Fizuli, with the subsequent erection  there of mixed observation posts.    The Armenian Defense Ministry wholly agreed to honor all its  commitments -- but only if representatives of the Azerbaijani  Army and the army of Nagorno-Karabakh do the same. In its turn,  the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry categorically refused to carry  out points two and three and demanded the liberation of  territories seized by Armenian armed formations. While the army  of Nagorno-Karabakh, laying down no conditions, expressed a  readiness to take all measures to continue upholding the  cease-fire regime, and by the evening of 2 March it had begun  the partial withdrawal of armored equipment from the front  line....    Obviously, the situation is extremely complex. And without a  more detailed study, Russia cannot honor its commitments  enshrined in the talks protocol ratified by all four sides.  Here, Russia is assigned the right, in the event of a violation  of the accords reached on the cessation of hostilities in the  security zones and monitored areas, to apply all necessary  measures of influence, up to and including military measures,  against formations which have flouted the terms of the current  protocol. This protocol provision cannot work, as the actual  security zone does not exist today; it is marked only on the  maps of the Russian Defense Ministry representatives.    "Even if our proposals are ignored, we will not,  nevertheless, sit back with arms folded," Georgiy Kondratyev  says. "I have already met with Azerbaijan's ambassador in  Moscow and proposed that a plenipotentiary representative of the  highest rank be appointed for negotiations. We will fly with  him to Armenia and resume talks.    As for the Russian soldiers, they will not be seen in the  conflict region, according to a statement by Colonel General  Kondratyev, until the gunfire abates and the hostile sides are  disengaged.</p>

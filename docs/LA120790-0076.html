Kolsky, who was shot and  killed in a robbery of Kolsky's cab two months ago.  </P> <P> "He . . . he wanted to meet people out on the street," said Howitt, 51, who  drove with Kolsky at LA Taxi. "He wanted to be where they were. He liked  people. He was a nice guy who used to encourage the new drivers like me. You  couldn't meet a nicer guy."  </P> <P> Still enraged by the slaying, Howitt and other cabbies stood with Los Angeles  police officials Thursday morning in the 500 block of Coronado Street where  Kolsky was killed to sound a fresh call for help in the investigation.  </P> <P> Police officers said that few witnesses have come forth since the Oct. 12  slaying, despite a $25,000 reward LA Taxi has offered for information leading  to the arrest and conviction of Kolsky's killer.  </P> <P> "LA Taxi put out the reward some time ago," said Los Angeles Police Department  spokesman Lt. Doc Warkentin. "We just haven't received the response we'd hoped  for. We think there are witnesses out there who know something."  </P> <P> Warkentin said Kolsky, 53, was attacked by a robber who police suspect also  held up another cab driver only hours before.  </P> <P> "There was a struggle and Kolsky was shot in the head," said Warkentin. "The  cab slowed, the guy climbed over the back seat and pushed (Kolsky) from the  cab. Then the suspect sped off."  </P> <P> Huddling around one of the lemon-colored LA Taxi station wagons that lined the  block, drivers in neckties and Windbreakers bearing their company logo  discussed the anxiety that has washed over their ranks since the shooting.  </P> <P> "I have a little fear," said Calvin Williams, 29. "I screen my passengers very  carefully now. I'm always looking."  </P> <P> Gorman Gilbert, president of LA Taxi, said the slaying has compelled his  company to intensify its standard safety-education program for drivers. He said  drivers are encouraged to surrender fares quietly if robbed at gunpoint.  </P> <P> "We don't want them to be shot over money," Gilbert said. "Robberies are,  fortunately, rare -- but one is one too many. And a killing. We are extremely  upset that one of our own would be murdered in such a brutal way."  </P> <P> In addition to the company-sponsored program, the cabbies said, drivers are  taking precautions of their own.  </P> <P> "I keep my crowbars up in the front seat with me," Williams said. "It's not  visible to the passengers but it's visible to me. You also got plenty of guys  who ride around with their 'Roscoe' on them.  </P> <P> "You know, their gun."  </P></p>

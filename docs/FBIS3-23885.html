			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Galina Andreyeva: "Oversight of the `Peaceful' </F> Atom"]    [Text] In the constantly increasing revelation of the  "secrets" of our life, one sees more the very belated victory of  common sense, rather than just another "supposed discovery." And  although for the first time many things were spoken of without  the stamp of secrecy at the press conference where the  participants included the managers of all six regional districts  of Gosatomnadzor Rossii [Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear  and Radiation Security], as well as the deputy chairman of this  federal department, A. M. Zhokin, all of whom came to  Novosibirsk for the All-Russian Conference on Questions of  Nuclear and Radiation Safety, nonetheless the secrecy was still  apparent.  <H5>  We Didn't Stand Behind the Price Before and We Still Don't </H5>   Do not believe that some people behave badly just because  they like to. Most often they behave that way for very good  reason, a sage has claimed. But as everyone knows, wise men do  not have all the answers. For what benefit could there be, and  for whom, for example, from the super secrecy with which most of  the "postal boxes" of the military-industrial complex poisoned  the air, water, and land? But even so that sage's claim is not  far from the truth. And it is precisely this "benefit," it  seems, that is the root of all the secrecy whose fruits we are  reaping today. Suffice it to recall the desire, at whatever  cost, to report "launching by the red-letter date" and "early  fulfillment of the construction plan." In itself the desire is  praiseworthy. If, of course, one does not take into account that  as a rule the money and time which were in short supply here  were "saved" in the nature protection complexes which were  supposed to alleviate the technogenic pressure and protect  nature and hence people from the harmful impact of production.  Despite all that, a brave face was put on a sorry business: We  were truly indignant at nuclear explosions near a distant atoll  at the edge of the world, while living almost under the wing of  the Semipalatinsk Test Range in complete confidence of the  purity of our sky.    The truth will out. There were a considerable number of  rumors about PO Box 80, as many citizens out of habit still call  the chemical concentrates plant. But all the same only a few of  the workers even knew that their plant was one of the nuclear  fuel cycle enterprises and that among other "secrets," fuel  elements for atomic power plants were made there. The same ones  which were supposed to replace the smoking TES's [heat and  electric power plants] and other harmful energy sources almost  everywhere.  <H5>  Out of the Frying Pan Into the Fire </H5>   But it would be more accurate to speak of the ineradicable  force of the custom of jumping from one extreme to the other.  And while yesterday we saw the peaceful atom as a reliable  source of heat and light and an aid in medical work and the  medical system, now many people see those very atomic power  plants as nothing but monsters which threaten mankind with  disaster.    The lesson of Chernobyl and Tomsk? Was a great deal of  benefit derived from what happened? In the Siberian Region, on  whose territory in addition to the six nuclear fuel cycle  enterprises there are five nuclear reactors, two industrial  reactors (in Tomsk-7 and Krasnoyarsk-26) have already been shut  down. It seems that such a fate awaits two research reactors  too. Three now in operation have a two-fold purpose: military  and industrial. The reactor in Krasnoyarsk-26 provides all the  electricity and heat to this city, while in Tomsk-7 two other  reactors, in addition, provide one-quarter of the electricity  and almost one-half the heat for greater Tomsk as well.  <H5>  I Left My Grandfather and I Left My Grandmother </H5>   In accordance with a presidential edict, the federal nuclear  and radiation safety oversight service represented by  Gosatomnadzor is supposed to provide monitoring of both the  peaceful atom and the military atom. But although the deadline  for transferring military nuclear installations to the control  of Gosatomnadzor has already passed, the radiation safety  department has certainly not obtained access to army secrets.    And all the same in accordance with existing international  agreements, military reactors are supposed to be shut down in  the near future. However, many of the problems with their  continued use arise when they are switched to a peaceful  footing. The Ministry of Fuel and Energy is already insisting on  unloading present AES [nuclear electric power plant] capacities,  referring to their unreliability. For example, the Balakovo AES,  for which our chemical concentrates plant even supplies fuel  assemblies, ended up at such an impasse.  <H5>  Where Are the `Tailings' Supposed To Go? </H5>   Despite the existing opinion about destroying and not  building, shutting down nuclear production is both a complicated  and an extremely expensive pleasure. And one of the main  problems both for AES's being "temporarily shut down" and for  working nuclear fuel cycle enterprises which use radioactive  sources and products based on them is storing the radioactive  waste. This problem is an acute one for Novosibirsk too.  <H5>  The Chik Is Not So Black as It Is Painted </H5>   Who has not heard of the horrors of the Chik "testing  range,"  although a question about it brings a smile to the people who  know the situation from other than hearsay. It seems that there  is a rigorous plan for storing nuclear materials at the site  where they are "registered." And each region has its own  "tailings storage facility." And we do too. But it is located on  the other side from the Chik. "Small stuff" is stored near the  Chik, for the most part items which contain radioactive sources.  The Radon Firm works on this. If one judges by the fact that  scrap material with radioactive content from Omsk and Tomsk is  stored here and until recently "corpses" arrived from Kazakhstan  as well, the "registration permit" system of the Chik storage  facility is not so very rigorously observed. As for its safety,  according to the chief of the Siberian District of  Gosatomnadzor, P. D. Mintyukov, the test conducted recently by a  major commission found no traces of radioactive contamination,  not even in the ground waters around the storage facility.  Unlike the results of the study of nuclear objects of Russia,  which, according to A. M. Zhokin, revealed a "multitude of  negative aspects" in the handling of radioactive waste. The  materials of this study are being processed, a number of  normative documents have been prepared, and the Law on Radiation  Safety is under study. However, bringing things up to the norm  of course requires major capital investments. Given the present  shortage of such things, it is not difficult to guess that the  steps outlined will be postponed. Until better times.    The shortage of capital investments is an "Achilles heel" in  the safety of our chemical concentrates plant, although it  applies for the most part to the strength of the buildings. That  is to say, if suddenly an airplane falls from the sky, the plant  will not survive. Such a "surprise" does not threaten similar  enterprises in Europe, for example.    As for the safety of our enterprise's personnel and the  level  of the technological processes, it turns out that specialists of  Western Europe and America are working terribly hard trying to  penetrate the secret of how we managed to reach a level which a  similar German enterprise in Hanoi, for example, did not even  dream of.  <H5>  You Pick It Up and It Glows </H5>   Time will show whether Gosatomnadzor and its inspection  offices manage to protect our life from their radioactive ward,  which has convincingly demonstrated its far from peaceful  disposition. But perhaps the "radioactive scoundrel" in our city  played the meanest joke on the so-called pilferer of vegetables.  In recent years Berezovgeologiya [Berezov Geology] specialists  have identified about 200 spots with radioactive contamination  in the city. Such "points" shone most often in Kalininskiy  Rayon. Radioactive anomalies were registered in dacha plots,  private sector gardens, and apartments whose owners got into the  habit of picking up everything that was left untended. A great  deal of material was poorly stored in "PO Box" 80 too. Put to  work by zealous masters, it glowed in the new place as well. But  it glowed in an evil way.    But if the "demon beguiled" the pilferers out of ignorance,  then how can one explain the cases where waste from this  "closed" enterprise was used for fill on roadbeds, for fix up  work in residential zones, and even on the grounds of children's  institutions? By this same ignorance, the natural result of  secrecy, or near-criminal carelessness? And the presence in  almost half of the city's schools of items with a radioactive  content--wasn't that really the same cause and effect series?  <H5>  We Are All Under the Same Atom </H5>   The very same misfortunes are characteristic of all regions  and cities of Russia. According to the estimate of the  specialists of the St. Petersburg Scientific Research Institute  of Radiation Hygiene of the Ministry of Health Care of Russia,  each person in our country on the average receives 0.123 rems  from medical radiation (X-ray examination, fluorography, and the  like) and 0.293 rems from the natural background. Overall that  gives an exposure over 70 years which is almost 300 times  greater than the radiation from the accident at the Chernobyl  AES.    The primary problems linked to radioactive contamination are  radiation disease and oncological diseases. The rate of the  latter is higher in our city than the average for Russia, and  according to an evaluation by the AGIZ-Health Group of the city  sanitary-epidemiological oversight center headed by I. F.  Mingazov, it is on the upswing. But benzapyrine, soot, and  metals are also carcinogenic. And even the smallest dose of  radiation against the background of high chemical pollution  increases its danger many times over. But if the city's  excessive natural radiation background because of its granite  "foundation" is taken into account, they should have been more  careful, as the satirist used to say, not only with radioactive  contamination but with other discharges and emissions as well.  Without that, no Gosatomnadzor will help us.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / No firm US promise for Patten MR Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, said yesterday he had received guarded assurances from the Clinton administration that it hoped its policies towards China would no longer be subject to an annual confrontation with Congress. Reporting on three days of talks with administration officials, including President Bill Clinton, and members of Congress, he conceded it was politically inevitable that renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status with the US would this year be hedged around with conditions concerning external and internal Chinese policies. Given the change of government in Washington, he repeatedly said, US policy 'is unlikely to be what it was last year.' He had put Hong Kong's case for an unconditional renewal of MFN and added that it was possible to 'devise conditions that do less damage' to the colony. The US, he emphasised, was 'still making up its mind' on China. But Mr Patten said that he had been told - though not by Mr Clinton himself  -that the US would prefer 'that the annual MFN debate did not become the centrepiece of US policies towards China.' His discussions have included sessions with the congressional sponsors of the Mitchell-Pelosi bill attaching conditions to MFN renewal, ranging from human rights and missile sale policies, on which the administration must take a position by June 2. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, said she was impressed by Mr Patten's arguments but doubted they would much affect the immediate legislation. The governor said he never expected to change the congresswoman's view. Mr Patten said he had argued that there were US means other than MFN renewal to press for acceptable Chinese policies on weapons proliferation. He noted that the UK, France and Australia were among those nations pursuing 'bilateral dialogues' with China over human rights. Trade issues could also be dealt with on their specific merits. Mr Patten also distanced himself from a recent delegation to Washington from the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, increasingly influenced by Beijing, which had warned of severe consequences for the US economy.</p>

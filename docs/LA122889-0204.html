He said Associate Head Coach Kevin  Cantwell and Assistant Coach Sherman Dillard would take over coaching duties  against Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> "I really wish I could be with the team, but at this moment I really want to go  to New York and be with my family to bury our father," Cremins said.  </P></p>

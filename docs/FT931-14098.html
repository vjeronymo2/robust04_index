			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Backers sought as Glass Glover continues to deliver the goods - A logistics group is returning to the market FIVE YEARS after leaving the stock market by way of a controversial management-led buy-out, Glass Glover, Doncaster-based provider of warehousing and distribution services to retailers like Tesco, is again seeking the glare of a listing. The company has changed considerably since the July 1988 buy-out. The previous management took the company private warning that hard times were ahead, especially in its largest business of fresh produce and growing. The move was soured when Scottish Amicable threatened not to sell its stake, believing the offer price was too low. In retrospect, shareholders may count themselves lucky they got out. By the end of 1988, the fresh produce and growing division was in trouble due to margin pressure. Schroder Ventures, which arranged the buy-out and now owns almost all of the company, demanded action. Senior management was replaced and the fresh produce and growing division sold to concentrate on developing the distribution business. As a result, there should be no unpleasant aftertastes when the company returns to the market, possibly at the end of next month or in March, with a public offer and placing valuing it at between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m. The new-look Glass Glover earns more than 90 per cent of revenues from warehousing and distribution, also known as logistics. The remainder stems from support services like software, security services and vehicle contracting. Turnover has increased steadily, growing from Pounds 45.2m in 1989 to about Pounds 85m in the year to September 30 last year. Almost 75 per cent of sales came from distribution for three clients, Tesco, Littlewoods and Asda. Logistics companies often rely on only a few clients because contracts are long term and depend on close relationships. Tesco, easily its biggest client, accounted for 44 per cent of revenues. Glass Glover runs three of Tesco's eight composite, or multi-temperature, warehouses and is one of Tesco's largest external distributors. Glass Glover is returning to the stock market partly for the prestige of a listing. But it mainly needs to pay off borrowings taken on during the buy-out which have constrained the company ever since. Net debt stands at about Pounds 35m compared to shareholders' funds of Pounds 6m. Although operating profits have increased from Pounds 4m in 1989 to Pounds 5.5m last year, the company continued to lose money after interest costs. Mr David Medcalf, chief executive, said the listing proceeds should leave Glass Glover free of debt. 'We're a well regarded company with an appalling balance sheet. We want to rectify that, to remove the debt and thereby also remove a difficulty in obtaining new business. 'Some clients have looked at our balance sheet, and also the fact we are not a listed company, and wondered if they really want to do business with us,' he said. Mr Medcalf arrived in May 1989 on the recommendation of Mr Eric Walters, a partner at Schroder Ventures and chairman of Glass Glover since 1988. The two had worked together at Grand Metropolitan, the food and retailing group, where Mr Medcalf was director of accounting at IDV, GrandMet's drinks division. He said he joined Glass Glover partly because he wanted to move into general management. Mr John Adamson, managing director of the distribution division, joined in 1989 from NFC, while Mr Chris Ferris, finance director, joined from Hillsdown Distribution. Mr Medcalf said two non-executive directors would have joined the board by the time of the float. Glass Glover's reliance on providing distribution services to food retailers is its main strength, but its exposure to a single sector is also a weakness. The company has tended to specialise in high volume, temperature controlled distribution. Its Tesco warehouse at Doncaster, for example, has temperature controlled storehouses ranging from room temperature for ambient products to minus 30 degrees for frozen foods. It also operates composite trailers which can transport goods at three different temperatures. This kind of distribution is more service intensive and sophisticated than delivering clothing or manufactured products. It is also difficult for new companies to enter the market because of the skills involved and the need for consistently accurate collection and drop off. 'We're only as good as today's deliveries,' according to Mr Medcalf. Glass Glover hopes to use its reputation as a food logistics company to break into other sectors. 'If we can handle perishable food, we can handle anything,' Mr Medcalf said. The first significant non-food contracts were won last month when Glass Glover was appointed by Do It All, the DIY retailer, to manage its transport and national distribution centre, to be built at Tamworth. The four and five year contracts are worth at least Pounds 30m in terms of turnover, the company said. Mr Medcalf believes there is 'enormous opportunity' in new sectors for Glass Glover, and said the company had recently been invited to tender for a contract for a food manufacturer, rather than retailer. Details of the flotation are yet to be finalised, although Schroder Ventures will retain about 10 per cent of the shares, with management holding up to 5 per cent. The prospectus is likely to show profits after tax for last year of Pounds 3.5m on a pro forma basis, which assumes the proceeds of the flotation had cancelled out interest charges. Transport analysts said Glass Glover's respected client list, and its position as one of only a handful of pure distribution companies on the market, suggested the flotation would generate interest. However, the company's turbulent recent history and short track record may frustrate Glass Glover's hopes of gaining a rating in line with the highly regarded logistics sector of about 15 times earnings.</p>

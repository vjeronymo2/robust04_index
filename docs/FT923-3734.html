			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Azerbaijan hopes for oil-fuelled renaissance - Efforts to capitalise on the former Soviet republic's energy wealth STEP off a plane at Baku airport, and you see an oilfield. Hundreds of derricks and nodding donkeys stretch away across the parched landscape like the skeletons of trees in a dying forest. Drive into town, and on the way the warm, humid air is heavy with the smell of crude. In Baku itself, you may drive along Oilmen's Street, and on to Azneft Square, named after the state oil producer. Drop into the Academy of Sciences, moreover, and this week you will find a high-tech exhibition by the BP-Statoil alliance, which on Monday became the second western oil group to sign a deal with Azerbaijan. The former Soviet republic is looking to oil to bring about its economic renaissance, and with a population of only 7.1m but oil reserves that experts believe could be as big as those in the UK North Sea, it may enjoy a prosperous future. Azerbaijan is proud of its oil-producing history. Marco Polo wrote about an oil spring on the Apsheron peninsula as early as the 13th century, which he noted was 'good to burn', but 'not good to use with food'. The first commercial wells near Baku were drilled in 1871, but for much of this century the industry was neglected by Soviet central planners concentrating on the Volga-Urals and Siberian regions in Russia. Now, international companies are streaming back into Baku. Amoco, the US oil major, won Azerbaijan's first international tender in June last year, and is currently conducting a feasibility study into the development of the 1.75bn-barrel Azeri field in the Caspian Sea. A final contract is expected to be signed by the end of the year, and production may begin within 30 months of the signing. After 16 months which have seen Azerbaijan gain its independence and a new president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, BP-Statoil has signed a similar agreement to conduct a feasibility study into the Kaverochkin field, 75 km (46 miles) south-east of Baku in the Caspian Sea, and to explore the neighbouring Shakhovo More prospect. Kaverochkin, which has undergone two name changes in the last three days, first to Dostlug (Friendship), and then to Chirag (Flame) only hours before the deal was signed, is at present estimated to contain about 1bn barrels, but experts believe eventual recoverable reserves could reach 2bn barrels. Mr Rauf Nadirov, an oil expert at Baku's Institute of Geology, says there are several other known fields in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian. One target for foreign companies may be the undeveloped Kapaz field, thought to contain about 250m barrels. Other fields are already producing but may require western technology to maximise production. Gunashli, formerly known as the 28th of April field, is thought to have 1.2bn barrels still in place. The Bakhar gas field is estimated at 2,700bn cu ft, of which only a small proportion has been extracted. There is a host of other prospective structures, including BP-Statoil's Shak Deniz (formerly Shakhovo More), prospect. Onshore, the biggest field is Balakhani-Sabunchi-Ramani. The site of the original Baku oil industry, this has already produced 2.25bn barrels. About 750m barrels are thought to be still in place, but the field is fraught with problems, including obsolete technology, severe water penetration, and environmental damage from pools of oil forming on the surface. Azerbaijan is looking for foreign partners to help salvage the field. Mr Nadirov says 60 per cent of Azerbaijan's territory is believed to be oil-bearing, and onshore areas already producing include Neftachala at the mouth of the Kura river, Muratkhandli, and Syazan, on the border with Georgia. There is already a pipeline to transport oil through Russia, and Azerbaijan is a partner in a pipeline consortium with Kazakhstan, Russia, and Oman. The consortium plans to construct a pipeline to transport oil from Kazkhstan and Azerbaijan to present or future terminals on the Gulf, the Mediterranean, and/or the Black Sea. One idea is a line across Georgia to a new terminal at the Black Sea port of Poti. Another option is a pipeline to the Turkish Black Sea through Iran and Turkey. Azerbaijan has a French-equipped offshore construction yard, ShelfProyektStroi, south of Baku, which recently completed a Dollars 7.5m contract from BP to construct four steel piles to be used in the UK North Sea. It also has a well-established oil equipment industry, although like much of Soviet industry, this has been hobbled by shortages of parts and materials, and the breakdown of inter-republican trade. There was a carnival atmosphere among the thousands of people who greeted Lady Thatcher, the former UK prime minister, as she arrived in Baku this week on a visit to President Elchibey - in time to witness BP's deal. If Azerbaijan can remain politically stable long enough to see the benefits of its new oil developments, it has every reason to celebrate.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports published in Seoul vernacular newspapers on 21 April  reacting to the decision to resume the Team Spirit joint  military exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an  800-word editorial entitled ``North Korea Should Understand the  Significance of the Decision on Team Spirit.'' Asserting that  the most effective means to counter the North Korean nuclear  issue is firm coordination between the ROK and the United  States, the editorial writes military cooperation between the  two countries is imperative in the current situation.    The editorial welcomes the decision of ROK and U.S. defense  ministers to strengthen combined war preparedness writing that  it is a very timely tuning of strategy as suspicions surrounding  North Korea's nuclear development have not been cleared.    Defining the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise as an  ``inevitable decision,'' the editorial stresses that ``such a  security coordination system should remain firm until it is  confirmed that North Korea has no nuclear weapons,'' and that  ``North Korea should stop trying to avoid nuclear inspections  with various excuses.''    The editorial shows concern over foreign reports that the  United States asked the ROK to be armed with modern weapons as  the selection of weapons should be decided by the ROK, not the  United States.    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled ``Reinforcement of Defense Posture is  Fundamental.''    The editorial welcomes the decision of the ROK and U.S.  defense ministers to resume the Team Spirit exercise and to  reinforce the combined forces saying that it was a ``natural,''  ``inevitable,'' and ``appropriate'' decision.    Regarding the issue of purchasing more modern arms, the  editorial writes the decision should be made according to ROK's  conditions and abilities, adding that the Yulgok project may be  adjusted but should not be influenced by U.S. defense industry's  demands.    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 an  800-word editorial entitled ``Unlimited Armament Competition is  Not Appropriate.''    Consenting to the theory that military superiority deters  war, the editorial writes, however, making the Korean peninsula  an unlimited exhibition place of modern arms cannot be tolerated.    Noting the remarks of Edward Warner, U.S. assistant  secretary  of defense, that modern heavy arms will be deployed to the ROK  by the end of summer, the editorial writes the United States is  trying to deploy another new weapon after safely deploying  Patriot missiles as a result of the ``sea of fire'' remarks by  North Korea.    The editorial writes the current situation cannot be  described as a crisis, citing Kim Il-song's recent appeasement  remarks and the fact that South Koreans were not threatened by  the ``sea of fire'' remarks. The editorial notes that it is the  United States that more frequently talks about the possibility  of war on the Korean peninsula.    The editorial concludes by warning that ``excessive  deployment of modern arms might stimulate North Korea's desire  to develop nuclear weapons to overcome the gap in military  capacity in a single blow.''</p>

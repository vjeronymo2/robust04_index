			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Shares fall steeply at Albert Fisher on crops warning SHARES in Albert Fisher plunged by 25p to 41p after the UK-based fresh produce distributor and food processor warned that a glut of fresh produce in Europe and North America would significantly cut its profits. The collapse cut Albert Fisher's market value by nearly Pounds 150m to Pounds 244m, compared with last year's peak of Pounds 790m. The flight from the shares also reflected the City's continuing disillusionment with the company, a stock market star of the 1980s, and with Mr Tony Millar, the executive chairman who built it up by making more than 50 acquisitions. Mr Millar said high crop yields of a wide range of fruit and vegetables, and the expansion by growers of cultivated acreages and early harvests, had led to an unprecedented seasonal oversupply. Sales volumes were in line with expectations, but severe price deflation in Europe and North America would cut profits. Apples, grapes and pears imported from Chile into Europe were particularly adversely affected. Analysts cut pre-tax profit forecasts from Pounds 77m to about Pounds 63m for the year to August 31. The group said: 'Whilst the board considers it inappropriate to make a dividend forecast at this stage of the year, it remains conscious of the importance of dividends to shareholders.' There was some surprise among analysts that the company was not able to be more forthcoming, as the year-end is so close. Mr Millar said he wanted to see how long the oversupply would continue before making the dividend decision in October. Albert Fisher shares have fallen steadily since it was revealed in March last year that Mr Keith Brackpool, chief executive of the group's US operations, personally owed Polly Peck International, the failed trading group, more than Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.8m). Mr Millar has since sought to reassure the City by appointing new chief executives in North America and Europe and two new non-executive directors. Last night the company announced after the market closed that Mr Millar's wife, Judy, and five group directors had bought a total of more than 100,000 shares during the day, at prices between 36.5p and 38p.

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / C&amp;G faces fight on compensation Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society faces the possibility of a legal battle with the Investors Compensation Scheme over millions of pounds paid by the ICS to home income plan investors. The ICS, a scheme for clients of authorised investment firms which have collapsed, said yesterday that it had rescinded an agreement with C &amp; G in September 1992, under which C &amp; G paid the ICS Pounds 545,000 and the ICS agreed not to press for more. ICS had the option of rescinding within two years. The scheme, which is funded by a levy on authorised investment firms, said yesterday that it 'now takes the view that the society's original payment is not sufficient' but has not suggested another figure. It said the way for legal proceedings against the society was now open, should it decide that this is the most appropriate course. The ICS has paid out Pounds 5.5m to 242 investors who took out home income plans on the advice of Aylesbury Associates, a firm of independent financial advisers which went into liquidation in 1992. The mortgages were arranged by C &amp; G. It is believed that the ICS may have to pay between Pounds 7m and Pounds 10m in compensation to wronged Aylesbury Associate investors. The bill may be even higher if the ICS fails in its appeal to the House of Lords against an Appeal Court decision ordering it to pay enhanced compensation to home income plan victims. Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurance company which insured the ICS's liabilities from 1990 to 1992, made an additional Pounds 7.5m provision in its half-year accounts against further claims. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the target of a Pounds 1.8bn takeover bid by Lloyds bank, said yesterday that it had made the Pounds 545,000 payment  - which has been returned with interest - to help speed up payments to those entitled to them. It said: 'We were the lender, we did not make the investments. If the ICS feels it has a case which would stand up in court, OK. That's up to them to prove it.' Home income plans were widely sold during the housing boom of the late 1980s to elderly householders who mortgaged their homes to release capital which they invested in income bonds. These were meant to pay the interest on the mortgage and provide an income. Some plans used roll-up mortgages, which added the interest to the total debt. This type of home income plan has now been banned because of its riskiness.</p>

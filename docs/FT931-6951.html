			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Viasa ends year in red VIASA, the Venezuelan international airline that was privatised in 1991, suffered a loss of USDollars 50m in 1992, according to Mr Rafael Ordozgoiti, the company's vice-president. The Viasa executive said the airline hoped to reduce losses this year to Dollars 25m and shareholders would be asked to raise Dollars 63m in new capital to cover past losses. Viasa, formerly owned by the Venezuelan government, was the first major privatisation carried out by the administration of President Carlos Andreas Perez. In 1991, Iberia, the Spanish carrier, bought 45 per cent of the airline's shares, while a large Venezuelan financial organisation, Banco Provincial Group, acquired 15 per cent (Credit Lyonnaise holds a minority provincial in Banco Provincial). The government retains control of a 40 per cent stake of the shares, part of which is being sold to employees.</p>

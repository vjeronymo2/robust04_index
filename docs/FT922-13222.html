			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Commercial Union expects to trade normally today COMMERCIAL UNION, the company worst affected by Friday's bomb blast, expects to be trading normally today after a weekend of concentrated effort by its executives. Mr Richard Owen, one of a number of directors involved, said: 'We're aiming to be back in a trading position as fast as possible.' CU occupies 10 of the 23 storeys of the Commercial Union tower, its international headquarters. It is possible that CU, along with other UK companies, is one of the building's insurers. CU intends to move its 650 staff who worked in the building to six sites, four of them in Croydon, south London, and two in the City. An advertisement in national newspapers this morning tells staff which office to go to. Mr Owen, together with other UK directors led by Mr Peter Ward, UK managing director, met yesterday morning to plan how to cope with the aftermath of the bomb-ing. An immediate priority is the restoration of telephone communications. The CU tower housed the group's central telephone and computer exchange, linking its branch operations nationwide. By last night, it had been reconfigured and moved to Whyteleafe, Surrey. CU was less affected by the blast than it would have been had it occurred 10 or 15 years ago. The group moved many of its back-office claims and administration functions to Croydon in the early 1980s. The building damaged by the bomb houses CU's London market insurance operations, the group's main asset management divisions, the Quilter Goodison stock-broking subsidiary and central corporate finance and strategic planning units. CU owns 20 per cent of the building as part of a consortium and holds the main lease. Quilter Goodison, the private client and fund management arm of CU, said yesterday it would relocate about 150 of its 200 staff to the Cranwood Street, City Road, offices of ACT, the software bureau, and expected to be operating normally this morning.</p>

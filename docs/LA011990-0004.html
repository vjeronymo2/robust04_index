			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERETHNIC CONFLICT  </P> <P> I am getting a bit tired of reading so many Cassandra-type editorials and  features as we enter the decade of the '90. Joel Kotkin's "New Interethnic  Conflict Replaces an L.A. History of Biracial Politics" (Opinion, Jan. 7) is  another example of this not only boring but harmful trend.  </P> <P> Those of us who have been working in the Los Angeles community during the past  decade know that there is nothing "new" about the potential for interethnic  conflicts in our city. Luckily, many of our responsible citizens disagree with  Kotkin that these conflicts are "inevitable," and they have been doing  something about it.  </P> <P> Proactive efforts at different community levels include the Black-Korean  Alliance, the United Neighborhood Council, the education Consortium of Central  Los Angeles, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Latino-Black  Roundtable, and the Minority Coalition for Responsible Growth. All of these are  examples of pluralistic racial and ethnic organizations that have been working  for the betterment of our city during the past years.  </P> <P> In the 1990s, perhaps we need to move beyond the identification of social  problems and conflicts and focus on the formulation of solutions and  intervention programs, such as offering workshops on intergroup relations to  our educators, students, and members of our work force.  </P> <P> SAMUEL MARK  </P> <P> Assistant Vice President  </P> <P> USC  </P></p>

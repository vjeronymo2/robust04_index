Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In May 1993, a self-regulatory organization task force (``Task Force'') was formed by the AMEX, CBOE, MSRB, NASD, NYSE, and PHLX, which included 12 representatives from a wide range of broker-dealers, to study the continuing education needs of the securities industry. In September 1993, the Task Force issued a report recommending a formal two-part continuing education program that would require uniform, industry-wide, periodic training in regulatory matters and ongoing training programs conducted by firms to keep their employees updated on job and product-related subjects. The Task Force also recommended that a permanent Council on Continuing Education, composed of broker-dealer and SRO representatives, be formed to develop the content and provide ongoing maintenance of the continuing education program. Pursuant to this recommendation, the Securities Industry/Regulatory Council on Continuing Education (``Council'') was formed in September 1993, with representatives from six SROs and 13 broker-dealers. The Council prepared draft rules to implement the continuing education program, which the SROs have filed as proposed rule changes with the Commission. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See proposed AMEX Rule 341A; proposed CBOE Rule 9.3A; proposed CHX Article VI, Rule 9; proposed MSRB Rule G&hyph;3(h); proposed Schedule C to the NASD's By-Laws, Part XII; proposed NYSE Rule 345A; proposed PHLX Rule 640; and proposed PSE Rule 9.27(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule changes would codify the Task Force's recommendations, enable uniform implementation of the continuing education program, and provide a means for the SROs to monitor and enforce the program's requirements. The proposal provides for a two-part continuing education program consisting of a Regulatory Element requiring uniform, periodic training in regulatory matters and a Form Element requiring firms to maintain ongoing programs to keep their employees up-to-date on job and product related subjects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Regulatory Element. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Satisfaction of the Regulatory Element would require all registered persons (unless exempt) to complete a prescribed training program after their second, fifth, and tenth registration anniversary dates. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  The Regulatory Element would be administered using computer-based interactive training techniques and would consist of standardized subject matters covering generally compliance, ethics, and sales practice issues. Failure to complete the program within prescribed time-frames ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  within 120 days after the occurrence of the applicable registration anniversary date, or as otherwise determined by the SROs) would result in a person's registration being deemed inactive and that person being prohibited from performing the functions of a registered person until such time as the person has completed the program. The SRO will terminate administratively the registration of anyone who is inactive for two years, provided that upon application and a showing of good cause, the SRO may allow a registered person additional time to satisfy the program requirements. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Any registered person who has terminated his or her association with a member and who, within two years of the date of termination, becomes reassociated in a registered capacity with a member, would be required to participate in the Regulatory Element at such intervals (two, five, and 10 years) as would apply based upon the individual's initial registration anniversary date rather than the date of reassociation in a registered capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Anyone administratively terminated must requalify on the Series 7 (the General Securities Registered Representative Examination) before such person's registration could be reactivated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Persons registered for more than 10 years as of the effective date of the rule would not have to satisfy the Regulatory Element requirements. Persons registered for 10 years or less as of the effective date of the rule would be required to satisfy the Regulatory Element and complete the computer-based training program after the occurrence of the next relevant registration anniversary date and on any applicable registration anniversary date(s) thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A registered person who has completed all or part of the regulatory Element of the program or otherwise is exempt from participation therein would have to reenter the Regulatory Element in the event he or she is subject to certain disciplinary actions. Such individual would have to complete the computer-based training program within 120 days of such reentry and at two, five and 10 years thereafter. The following disciplinary events would trigger such reentry: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

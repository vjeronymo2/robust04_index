			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (14): A turn in the tide for textiles - Signs of a more buoyant export-driven industry AFTER LAGGING behind the rest of Asia over the last few decades, India's fabric and garments exporters are beginning to wake up to the opportunities that a cheaper currency and the change in economic policies are opening up to them. 'There is going to be a massive boom,' says Mr Hrishikesh Mafatlal, head of the textiles division of the Bombay-based Mafatlal group. The group is the country's largest producer of dyed and printed fabrics and is a supplier to Marks and Spencer in the UK. Mr Mafatlal expects exports, which accounted for 35 per cent of Dollars 1.2bn sales last year, to contribute 50 per cent of turnover in the near future as the group doubles its rate of investment to an annual Dollars 16m a year. At Bombay Dyeing, another of the Bombay groups that survived the massive contraction of sales by the large textile mills that characterised the 1970s and the 1980s, Mr Dinkar Alva, the managing director, also sees a turn in the tide. 'There are expansion opportunities,' he says, with the group likewise basing its investment on upgrading quality and boosting exports. Arvind Mills, an Ahmedebad group and probably the most aggressive of the larger mills, has built a substantial expansion programme on the export of high quality blue denim and on cotton shirting. After Rs500m of exports last year, the group is aiming for Rs5.1bn by 1994-95, by which time it hopes to be among the top ten denim producers in the world. Other signs of a more buoyant export-driven industry are a surge of new investments - particularly in the south which grows fine, long staple cotton  -in spinning. As a result of this, the textile machinery industry is quoting delivery dates of two to four years to provide new spinning machines. Yet this new confidence in the industry has not translated itself into the trade statistics. Notwithstanding a 24 per cent devaluation of the rupee in July last year and a continuing slide in the currency since then, India's textile exports grew by only 4.4 per cent last year to Dollars 5.7bn. Garment exports actually fell in dollar terms by 1.8 per cent. This slow rate of growth was most obviously due to recession in the US (accounting for 24 per cent of Indian textile exports) and in the EC (43 per cent) and to the ceilings placed on Indian textile exports under the multifibre quota arrangements. Another major reason was that exports to the former Soviet Union slumped in the wake of the collapse of that market. But it also reflected the failure of Indian manufacturers to benefit from the devaluation themselves. 'Our exporters passed on the value of the devaluation to the buyers rather than retaining it themselves,' says a senior official in the Ministry of Textiles. While exports of garments fell, there were nonetheless sharp increases in exports of handloom products (up 21 per cent in dollar terms) and of cotton yarn (up 38 per cent). India remains, however, a marginal player in the world textile trade. Its share of world fabric exports actually dropped between 1980 and 1990 from 2 to 1.1 per cent. In garments India achieved a modest increase over the decade and now accounts for 2 per cent of world trade  - a proportion well below China's 8.5 per cent. But if India is a small player on the world stage, textiles are India's single largest export and account for 30 per cent of export earnings. The industry believes that further increases must come through exploiting India's competitive advantages, and by improvements in quality and moving more upmarket. With China and Pakistan, India is one of the few countries in the world to have a substantial surplus of raw cotton. Yields are high in the Punjab but still well below international levels in the south and central India. Compared with 10 years ago, there is greater emphasis on design and quality. Mr Mafatlal says that in his own group 'there has been a sea change in management culture'. He cites a major reason for the greater emphasis on quality as being improved labour relations. 'The single biggest change is in how we treat our staff and in the way we get them to participate,' he says. The government is also more supportive to textile exporters than in the 1970s when its main preoccupation was to curb the growth of large mills and boost employment in the handloom and powerloom sectors. Textile machinery is easier to import. So are the buttons, zips and extras that the garments industry needs. Nonetheless, Indian garment manufacturers face bureaucratic hurdles and other difficulties that put them at a disadvantage with their competitors in neighbouring Pakistan, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka. Ms Mani Mann, a garments exporter, does not see much hope of improvement: 'I am cynical about liberalisation because there is so much political interference. I don't know if we will really go forward,' she says. But her own order book has doubled this year which shows that some purchasers are turning to India more than they were.</p>

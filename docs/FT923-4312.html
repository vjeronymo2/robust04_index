			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / World Trade News: China in deal to launch satellites for Intelsat - The Farnborough Air Show CHINA has signed a contract to launch satellites for Intelsat, the international telecommunications co-operative, Prof Yue Zhuzhen, deputy general manager of the China Great Wall Industry Corporation, said yesterday. The contract is a coup for China in its efforts to break into western markets, because Intelsat, the international satellite consortium owned by national telecommunications bodies including British Telecom, AT&amp;T and Deutsche Telekom, is the world's biggest buyer of international telecoms satellites. It is also a warning to European and US launchers that competition will intensify; Russia has this year tendered for commercial launches of western satellites, for the first time. Ariane, owned by a French-led consortium, is market leader, followed by McDonnell Douglas, General Dynamics and Martin Marietta, all of the US. The launch of the Intelsat 7A on China's Long March 3B rocket is scheduled for 1995. The 3B, an untested variant of the Long March 3, will be the biggest space launcher yet developed by China. Last month, China completed its second international commercial satellite launch - a US-built satellite operated by Aussat, an Australian company half-owned by C &amp; W of the UK. Go-ahead for the Intelsat contract still depends on US goodwill. Washington must first give an export licence for the satellite built by Loral of the US, and agree to extending an agreement between the US and China over the prices and frequency of Chinese launches.</p>

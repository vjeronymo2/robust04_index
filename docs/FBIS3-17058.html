He said the situation was being dramatized to divert  public attention.    Rutskoy spoke of the Soviet Communist Party being used as  bogey three years ago and the Soviets in the second half of  1992. Searches are now under way for someone to take the blame  after the bombing of the previous parliament, he said adding  that no one had ever plotted a coup because one had already been  pulled off.    Rutskoy, who shaved off a beard he had grown while in prison  on charges of organizing last October's rioting in Moscow, was  speaking to reporters while attending an agricultural fair in  Moscow.    Although he described the current situation as  unpredictable,  Rutskoy said he did not want any repeat of what happened last  October. "I had enough time for a rethink and to come to some  conclusions", he said.    Rutskoy believes the situation can still be redressed if the  control of reforms is regained, priorities and incentives are  set and laws strictly observed. "That must be the basis of  today's policies", he said. Although he agreed that "any  solution to vital problems depends on internal stability",  Rutskoy said it was important to know who exactly would be party  to a proposed civil peace pact. "Should there be any compromise  with those who plundered and ruined the country and bombed the  parliament? If so, what sort of compromise and for which  purpose?", he asked.    Asked which of the three he considered himself to be -  president vice president or former vice president, Rutskoy said  he had always believed himself to be citizen first. "If the coup  was lawful, then I am former vice president. If it was unlawful  which it was because of being unconstitutional, then I am vice  president", he said.    Rutskoy described Acting Prosecutor General Alexey  Ilyushenko  as "a swindler who forged documents and filed a false report"  about his involvement in financial irregularities. He said  Ilyushenko must be put behind bars.    On his own political future, Rutskoy said it was early days  yet to speak about it. Asked if he would run for presidency, he  said "let us wait until presidential elections if there are  any". And he added "after all, there must be someone to  nominate my candidacy".</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The current method for distributing the $15 million performance-based funds encourages State agencies to serve large numbers of work registrants (i.e., broad-based) with low cost components such as job search and job search training. When implementing the E&amp;T program in FY 1987, the Department encouraged broad-based programs because existing research indicated that they had a positive impact on a participant's future chances of obtaining employment or ending his or her dependence on public assistance. Given these results, the Department believed the possible benefits participants should be shared by as many participants as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since implementation of the E&amp;T program in 1987, several things have shifted the focus of the program away from the broad-based perspective. One was the implementation of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program for non-exempt recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). With a combination of matching Federal funds of up to $1 billion annually, State agencies must offer a number of mandatory and voluntary components that are generally more intensive than those offered by the Food Stamp E&amp;T program. By October 1992 JOBS had to be implemented statewide throughout the country. Several State agencies have sought to make the two programs more similar. A number have started directing their E&amp;T funds toward a more targeted population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Results of studies assessing the effectiveness of broad-based work programs have been published in recent years, including the Department's evaluation of the E&amp;T program (See ``Evaluation of the Food Stamp Employment and Training Program, Final Report,'' Abt Associates, June 1990). This study concluded that the broad-based E&amp;T program in operation in FY 1988 did not have a significant effect on a participant's ability to find work or increase work hours or earnings. Without a positive effect on employment and earnings, the study further concluded that participation in the E&amp;T program did not significantly reduce a person's need for food stamp benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of these circumstances, Congress made certain amendments to the E&amp;T provisions of the Food Stamp Act that allow, or even encourage, the State agencies to provide more intensive services towards a targeted population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One amendment in the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, (Pub. L. 100&hyph;435, 102 Stat. 1645, September 19, 1988), mandated that the Department implement outcome-based standards in place of the current process-based (i.e., placements) system. As specified under Public Law 100&hyph;435, outcome-based standards would measure job placement rates, wage rates, job retention rates, households ceasing to need food stamp benefits, improved education levels and the extent to which persons volunteer for E&amp;T services. Public Law 100&hyph;435 also required that the outcome-based standards encourage State agencies to serve participants with barriers to employment (e.g., illiteracy or long-term food stamp dependency). Therefore, the E&amp;T provisions under Public Law 100&hyph;435 reflect Congress' concern that, to be successful, Federal work programs must apply resources towards disadvantaged populations with barriers to employment and that performance must be measured in terms of successful outcomes rather than placements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department was required under Public Law 100&hyph;435 to implement outcome-based performance standards by April 1, 1991. The implementation date was later amended to October 1, 1991 through the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;624, 104 Stat. 3359, November 28, 1990). This date was changed again by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;237, 105 Stat. 1818, December 13, 1991). Under section 907(a) of Public Law 102&hyph;237, outcome-based performance standards must be implemented no later than one year after the DHHS publishes final outcome-based performance standards for its JOBS program. This delay will allow the Department of Agriculture and the DHHS to coordinate outcome-based performance standards for the two programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the interim period before outcome-based performance standards are implemented, section 907(b) of Public Law 102&hyph;237 reduced the annual performance standard for States from 50 percent to no more than 10 percent in FYs 1992 and 1993. The provisions show clear Congressional intent that the State agencies no longer be held to a standard requiring service to a large number of participants. Rather, under Public Law 102&hyph;237, the State agencies must be provided the flexibility to target a smaller population with more intensive components. State agencies are not required to implement a more intensive E&amp;T program and may continue to operate broad-based programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 907(b) of Public Law 102&hyph;237 was effective on September 30, 1991. On February 12, 1992, the Department notified State agencies in writing of the reduction in performance standards for FY 1992. The Department will publish a rule implementing the revised performance standards in the near future.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

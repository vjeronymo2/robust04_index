			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Increased pollution fines urged MAGISTRATES are taking environmental pollution more seriously than in the past but fines need to be tougher , the pollution inspectorate said yesterday. The inspectorate announced in its fifth annual report, published yesterday, that last year it prosecuted 18 companies, which were fined a total of Pounds 103,405. Mr David Slater, chief inspector, described the fine of Pounds 1,650 imposed this week on Brookridge Timber, a Devon-based timber company, as 'about right'. The case was the inspectorate's first successful prosecution under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. Mr Slater added: 'I would like to see fines commensurate with the damage caused.' The inspectorate is starting to implement the act's framework of integrated pollution control for industry. Companies and environmentalists have criticised the measures for being too unwieldy and the inspectorate for being too small. Mr Slater rejected suggestions that the inspectorate was 'holding up' the authorisation of British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield. But he said that the recent series of leaks from the Sellafield site had been a strain on staff. 'I don't say (the leaks) are not causing us any resource problems', he said. Mr Slater plans to deliver the inspectorate's report to ministers in May or June. According to the report the inspectorate's income of Pounds 17.3m in the year to March 1992 was Pounds 6.2m short of the level forecast. Because of the recession, 'far fewer new (manufacturing) plants' had been built, Mr Slater said. Applications for new pollution licences under the act, which were expected to bring in Pounds 5.4m, generated only Pounds 937,000. But an internal inspectorate report showed that companies often recouped the costs of prevention equipment within six months. The inspectorate, however, has not recouped its costs. After expenses of Pounds 20.7m, it had a Pounds 3m deficit, and in the current year 'we will still be slightly short of recovering costs', Mr Slater said. The timetable for new rules on licensing waste management was pushed back by two months to June, Mr David Maclean, environment minister, said yesterday. The new rules that a licence holder had to be a 'fit and proper person'  - part of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act - have been held up because of 'complex and detailed' consultations, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Europe: Six Questions to Four </F> Flemish Parties"]    [Text]  <H5>  1. What Should the Role of the European Parliament Be? </H5>   CVP [Christian People's Party]: The European Parliament (EP)  is still too limited in its ability to take action. The joint  decisionmaking procedure, political control of the European  Commission (EC) but not of the Council, and budget control are  all inadequate. The EP must be a legislative pillar.    VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats]: The Maastricht Treaty  strengthened the EP legislative role. This is apparent in the  decisionmaking power it shares with the Council in some areas.  Be that as it may, Europe is led by a small group of national  leaders who are not elected, or at least not directly. We must  lean toward an EP which is on an equal footing with the Council.  The EC must be able to count on a majority.    SP [Socialist Party]: The EP played an important role in the  European unification process. It managed to impose important  measures: Lowering the price of unleaded gas, limiting food  additives, maintaining travel reductions for young people, etc.  Moreover, the Maastricht Treaty granted it new powers.    Live Differently: The EP is working in a situation of  democratic deficit. It does not have the same powers as  national parliaments. We suggest that the future EC president as  well as the future commissioners, be chosen from among the EP  members.  <H5>  2. Europe Has Almost 20 Million Unemployed People. What </H5> Solution Do You Recommend for This Dramatic Situation?    CVP: Unemployment can only be fought with the support of a  strong economy. The redistribution of labor is one path, which  can be adapted to the various sectors. In addition, greater  flexibility as well as a lowering of indirect labor costs  (employers' contributions, etc.) will make our economy more  competitive and will facilitate recruitment. The European  social model of bilateral negotiations offers the best weapon  for fighting unemployment.    VLD: In order to combat this immense problem, both  structurally and permanently, it is essential that wage costs be  reduced throughout Europe. An employment policy must go hand in  hand with an increase in motivation. We must therefore close  the gap between the minimum wage and unemployment benefit  payments. Furthermore, the current regulations governing  working time, professional careers, and the legal retirement age  must be made more flexible.    SP: We want a coherent recovery plan that takes account of  ecological and social issues. Money must be reinvested in  labor, not in speculation. Every year we want to offer 5  million Europeans the chance to get trained or retrained.  However, labor too must be reorganized and tailored to the  workers. Flexibility and the four-day working week must create  jobs. Meeting social needs can also create jobs.    Live differently: While in 1985, the official report on the  Single Market predicted 5 million new jobs, the gap between the  rich and poor has widened. This is proof of the failure of the  traditional vision which holds that economic growth is a valid  solution to the crisis. We advocate the creation of new  "ecological" jobs, the four-day or 32-hour workweek, etc.  <H5>  3. In Order To Slow Down Relocalizations by Businesses, Do </H5> You Support a Social Clause in Trade?    CVP: The basic conventions of the International Labor  Organization (ILO) must be applied across the board (freedom of  trade union association, collective bargaining, ban on forced  work, etc.). We favor positive measures, since negative  measures lead too easily to protectionism.    VLD: The elimination of Europe's internal borders has had a  positive impact on the economy. Tightening up regulations  cannot slow down this development. The development of  homogeneous legislation in the various member states regarding  the siting of businesses (e.g., legislation on the environment)  will be much more effective.    SP: The SP defends the social clauses of international  treaties. Economic development and social progress must go hand  in hand. Social clauses make it compulsory to respect the limits  of social morality.    Live differently: A European economic area which does not  have a strong social dimension will increase imbalances and  reinforce social dumping. We advocate the adoption of measures  to prevent social and ecological dumping, such as the obligation  to include the ILO social clause in all agreements. The Union  must impose customs duties in order to compensate for  differences in social and environmental protection [among  different countries]. Revenue thus generated will be earmarked  for development projects and the correction of factors  responsible for creating social and economic distortion.  <H5>  4. What Are the Broad Lines of Your Economic Policy? </H5>   CVP: There are two essential paths: Coordinating action in  the Twelve (like the overall plan), and developing actions at  European level (continuing the construction of the Single  Market, social dialogue within the Union, etc.). We must  maintain the competitiveness of the European economy, without  slipping into a permanent spiral of layoffs and downgrading of  the people's well-being.    VLD: The consistent increase in the German money supply is  forcing the central banks to keep interest rates high. This,  combined with our low productivity and harsh labor legislation,  plunged Europe into the worst recession in the postwar era. The  member states must lean toward greater economic and monetary  convergence. Moreover, European labor legislation must be made  more flexible.    SP: The current problems are the result of the economic  crisis. Social Europe was never given consideration. Some  people recommend that we let competition have a free rein.  However, this competition risks leading to a debacle in which  the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Europe has a  choice: egoism or solidarity. We are opting for solidarity.    Live differently: The Maastricht Treaty is increasing  economic competition among European states and regions. We  support the development of economic policies that allow the  weakest to catch up with those who are better armed. We do not  support the uniform application of austerity measures. We  advocate a regulation limiting speculation.  <H5>  5. What Is Your Program on Immigration? </H5>   CVP: Refugee rights to be protected, as guaranteed by the  Geneva Convention, must be maintained or even extended to become  a humanitarian status which grants temporary protection. We  need a European policy to channel and curb refugees as well as  combat the reasons for it (prevention of economic refugees). In  addition, the situation of refugees who are not acknowledged but  who have become integrated, must be regularized.    VLD: There is serious tension in our society between various  population groups. Some conceal these problems. Other advocate  inhuman solutions. There is a third way: Integrating  foreigners by having them adapt to our values and way of life  (freedom of expression, the democratic decisionmaking process,  equality of the sexes)    SP: We want Europe to be a completely safe and welcome land  for political refugees. Procedures and guarantees must be equal  for everyone. A European regulation must be implemented for  economic migrants. Europe must prevent and combat illegal  immigration and illegal work. However, refugees fleeing famine,  war, or natural disasters must also be taken in for a limited  time.    Live differently: Europe has to recognize that it is a  region of immigration. A new European immigration policy  (quotas) must replace the halting of immigration that has been  in place for 20 years. Asylum procedures must be unified as  must actions to combat illegal work. We advocate the right to  vote for all immigrants who have been residents for five years.  <H5>  6. What Are Your Three Priorities in Agriculture? </H5>   CVP: 1. Food safety: sufficient and varied production. 2.  Farmer incomes: Sound and well-structured farms must be able to  generate a reasonable income. 3. The environment: Farmers have  a mission to preserve nature.    VLD: The VLD is opting for a liberal agricultural policy  which is socially minded and which respects the environment.  Liberal in that production is tailored to the interplay of  supply and demand to avoid surpluses; aid from the public  authorities must be selective. Social in that we advocate a  maximum level of employment in the agricultural sector; the  system of guaranteed prices should be advantageously replaced by  a system of guaranteed incomes for productive farmers.    SP: The Socialists want another agricultural policy, one  which will help farmers have decent incomes for a qualitatively  better production that respects the environment. We will have  to put the emphasis on income supports, but this goes hand in  hand with a reduction in production. The regions must be able  to follow their own policies.    Live differently: 1. Parity of incomes for farmers and other  social categories. 2. Improvement in the quality of foodstuffs  and safeguards for genetic diversity. 3. The reform of the  Common Agricultural Policy by abolishing export subsidies.  Policies ensuring suitable prices for "ecological" farms.</p>

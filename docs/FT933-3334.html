			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Money Markets: France holds firm EXPECTATIONS of further cuts in French interest rates were slightly dampened yesterday after the Bank of France decided not to reduce either of its main interest rates in its weekly money market oper-ations, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank's 50 basis-point lowering of its discount rate last week had been seen as a reason for the French authorities to ease policy yesterday. So, too, had the franc's strong performance against the D-Mark on the currency markets yesterday morning. However, the intervention rate was left unchanged at 6.75 per cent and the five to 10-day lending rate at 7.75 per cent. Mr Adrian James, international economist at NatWest Markets in London, said the French authorities may still be concerned by the very low level of foreign exchange reserves shown up by the Bank of France's weekly report last week. The December French franc interest rate contract fell sharply on the news that rates were unaltered. It closed at 93.89, some 11 basis points down from its opening level. The story in Belgium was different, following the Belgian authorities' cut in their end-of-day interest rate from 12.25 per cent to 12 per cent. The December Belgian franc contract jumped 30 basis points to finish at 93.05. The Portuguese authorities also eased rates, reducing their emergency lending rate from 12.375 per cent to 12.25 per cent. In German money markets, conditions continued to be tight, partly because the Bundesbank did not help to bring call money down by providing section 17 funds. The cost of overnight lending continued to be high, hovering around the new Lombard rate level of 7.25 per cent. This partly reflected the fact that there has been heavy lending at the Lombard rate level in the last two trading days, amounting to some DM6bn. Dealers expected the Bundesbank to add liquidity in its weekly money market operations on Wednesday. Conditions in the sterling market were fairly easy after most of the Pounds 1.55bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England was removed in the early round. The overnight rate of lending fell as low as 4 per cent at around lunchtime. Three-month money closed at 5 7/8 per cent with a spread of  1/16 percentage point. The December sterling contract ended at 94.35 from 94.38.</p>

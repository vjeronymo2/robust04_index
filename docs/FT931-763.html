			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Holliday Chemical offer popular with institutions HOLLIDAY Chemical Holdings yesterday said institutions had submitted bids for 110m shares in its forthcoming placing and offering of 40.7m shares at 195p. The issue, which values the synthetic dyestuffs and speciality chemicals company at Pounds 161m, will raise Pounds 79.4m, of which Pounds 35m will be for the company. Mr Michael Peagram, founder, chairman and largest single shareholder, said the company decided to increase the amount it will raise by Pounds 5m to reduce debt. This followed City concern that gearing would be unnecessarily high. On a pro-forma basis the capital raising would leave gearing at the end of 1992 at about 34 per cent, and interest covered nine times by operating profits. Net borrowings would be Pounds 15.5m. The venture capitalists, including 3i and County NatWest, which backed the buy-out of Holliday from Holliday Dyes and Chemicals in 1987, will be selling about half of their overall holding. Mr Peagram's 29.1 per cent stake will decline to 21 per cent. Holliday's earnings per share have increased from 4.4p in 1988 to 10.9p last year. In the same period sales rose by Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 97m and operating profit by Pounds 5m to Pounds 14m. The notional dividend would be 3.7p giving a yield on the issue price of 2.5 per cent. Mr Peagram said the group was intent on growing organically and that in the short term there would be no further cash calls to fund acquisitions. He said: 'There is nothing on the stocks at the moment, when we do go for something we will consult with shareholders to see how it should be financed. We believe our next acquisition could be funded with debt, with no need for a rights issue until well into 1994.' COMMENT Holliday has an impressive record of growth since its management buy-out in 1987. Earnings per share growth has averaged 22 per cent over the last five years on a pro-forma basis. Organic growth has been augmented by a string of acquisitions. Some City observers may compare Holliday with MTM. Holliday says it does not have to find targets to grow and points out that its acquisitions have reported increased profits every year instead of contributing one-off benefits. James Capel is forecasting dividend growth in line with increased earnings of about 20 per cent. Although the shares are priced slightly higher than expectations they should still open at a comfortable premium.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: John Labatt losses deepen to CDollars 204m JOHN LABATT, the Canadian brewing and consumer products group, posted a loss of CDollars 204m (USDollars 159.3m) on revenues of CDollars 446m in the fourth quarter ended April. A year earlier, Labatt posted a loss of CDollars 23m on revenues of CDollars 379m. The latest loss stems mainly from continuing problems with Labatt's US dairy business. The loss included a CDollars 173m write-down in the value of this operation. For the whole of 1992-93 the loss was CDollars 70m against a profit of CDollars 101m a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 2.1bn against CDollars 1.7bn. Brewing had an operating profit of CDollars 218m for the year, up from CDollars 178m. Labatt recently spun off its Canadian dairy products operations and classified its US dairy business as a discontinued operation while attempts are made to sell it.</p>

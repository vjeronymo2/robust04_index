			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--The Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators reached an agreement early this morning on the  security arrangements and international protection in the city  of Hebron in the occupied West Bank. They also agreed on the  entry of vanguards of the Palestinian police force into Gaza and  Jericho.    Sources close to the negotiations have told MENA that the  implementation of the two agreements will begin within one week.  The same sources noted that Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the  Palestinian delegation to the talks, and Major General Amnon  Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation, will sign the agreement  at 1000 [0800 GMT] this morning. The same sources told MENA  that Israel had agreed to let 160 observers from Norway,  Denmark, and Italy be deployed in Hebron and that the PLO had  given up on the idea of the entry of a Palestinian police force  into the city. The sources added that the international  observer force will not be entirely dedicated to monitoring.  Some will perform administrative work. Israel earlier proposed  allowing 100 Palestinian policemen and 70 international  observers into the city but the Palestinian side refused.    The same sources noted that an agreement was also reached on  the entry of vanguards of the Palestinian police force into Gaza  and Jericho before the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement. The sources told MENA that the two delegations  started consultations early this morning on the agenda of the  talks on Gaza and Jericho, which have been suspended since 25  February following the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron. The same sources noted that negotiations on this  subject will last all day today and will resume next week in  Cairo. The sources described the atmosphere of the talks as  serious and said both sides worked to reach this agreement as  soon as possible and begin talks on implementing the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    The same sources stressed that there is a mutual desire to  honor the deadline for implementing the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement on 13 April. The sources noted that the drafting of  the two agreements was concluded at 0100 this morning. The  first agreement relates to Hebron and the second to the entry of  vanguards of the Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho.  The delegations had to wait until early this morning to receive  a reply from the Palestinian leadership in Tunis.</p>

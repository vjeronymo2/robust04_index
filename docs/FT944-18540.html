			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Europe to remain in the doldrums - International The dramatic reversal in sentiment in world government bond markets this year has had an equally dramatic impact on the pattern of new issuance in the eurobond markets. While new issuance of fixed-rate eurobonds and of eurobonds denominated in most European currencies has withered in this year's difficult market conditions, yen-denominated bonds, medium-term notes and floating-rate notes have all flourished. According to data supplied by Euromoney Bondware, the volume of new eurobond issues in the first nine months of 1994 totalled an equivalent of Dollars 282.8bn, down from Dollars 304.4bn in the same period last year, although still ahead of the Dollars 212.5bn of the first nine months of 1992. Within that total, however, the volume of fixed-rate new issues fell by Dollars 47.8bn to Dollars 185.9bn, a victim of expectations of higher inflation and the turn upwards in world interest rates. The reverse side of this trend downwards in fixed-rate issues has been an explosion of growth in floating-rate notes. FRN issuance totalled an equivalent of Dollars 76.4bn between January and September this year, compared with Dollars 49.7bn in the first nine months of last year. FRNs offer variable rates of interest which move to reflect changes in short-term money market interest rates. They have, therefore, provided investors with a degree of protection in this year's rising interest rate environment. Probably the most startling trend, in this year's bear market, however, has been the rise in the volume of eurobonds denominated in yen. With the yen appreciating against the US dollar and with exceptional volatility in European bond markets, Japanese investors have concentrated on their own currency sector. The result has been a 50 per cent increase in yen-denominated issues, to Dollars 46.9bn in the first nine months of 1994. The Italian lira is another currency sector which has returned to favour this year. The equivalent of Dollars 13.9bn worth of new eurolira bonds were issued between January and September of this year, compared with Dollars 10bn worth over the same period in 1993. After sharp falls in Italian government bond prices earlier in the year, the market has again stabilised in recent months. Other European currency sectors have experienced sharp falls in eurobond issuance as demand has evaporated at the prospect of higher inflation and rising short-term official interest. In the D-Mark sector, the equivalent of Dollars 22.2bn worth of eurobonds was issued in the first nine months of this year, against Dollars 41.3bn in the same period last year. The sterling sector, which saw the first rise in official short-term interest rates last month, saw issuance between January and September of Dollars 25.9bn, against Dollars 35.8bn in the same period of 1993. Of the top eurobond houses, Merrill Lynch seems to have been the most successful in coping with these difficult and changing market conditions. It lead-managed the equivalent of Dollars 27.9bn worth of eurobonds between January and September, an almost 10 per cent market share, compared with Dollars 12.73bn, or about 4 per cent of market share, at the same stage last year. The direction the eurobond markets will take over the remaining months of 1994 is not clear. Whether the yen sector remains in vogue will depend, in part, on the performance of the yen against the dollar. With European interest rates headed upwards, however, European currency sectors will likely remain in the doldrums, while FRNs can look forward to continued popularity.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        TOP EUROBOND LEAD MANAGERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     First nine months of 1994 Manager                 Dollars bn      Rank       %       Issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Merrill Lynch              27.94          1       9.88       119 CSFB/ Credit Suisse        18.94          2       6.70        66 Goldman Sachs              18.33          3       6.48        71 Lehman Brothers            12.69          4       4.49        58 Nomura                     12.64          5       4.47        83 Swiss Bank Corp            12.31          6       4.35        68 UBS                        11.64          7       4.12        34 Morgan Stanley             10.68          8       3.78        63 JP Morgan                  10.06          9       3.56        49 Deutsche Bank               9.81         10       3.47        48 Industry total            282.79                 100.0      1579  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     First nine months of 1993 Manager                 Dollars bn      Rank       %       Issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Merrill Lynch              12.73          7       4.18        60 CSFB/ Credit Suisse        14.48          3       4.76        65 Goldman Sachs              23.38          1       7.68        81 Lehman Brothers            11.40          8       3.75        60 Nomura                     12.99          6       4.27        49 Swiss Bank Corp             6.54         17       2.15        36 UBS                        10.10         11       3.32        49 Morgan Stanley             14.19          4       4.66        56 JP Morgan                   8.61         12       2.83        42 Deutsche Bank              20.35          2       6.69        64 Industry total            304.35                 100.0      1443  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Full credit to book runner  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Euromoney Bondware  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     EUROBOND ISSUES BY CURRENCY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Total                          Total 1994*               raised      No. of    1993*     raised      No. of Rank   Currency  (Dollars bn)   issues    Rank   (Dollars bn)   issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1     USDollars     117.92        547       1       113.06        557 2           Yen      46.93        370       4        31.11        167 3      Sterling      25.90        115       3        35.83        166 4        D-Mark      22.23         82       2        41.31        114 5           FFr      19.77         72       5        28.92        112 6          Lire      13.93        106       7         9.99         69 7      CDollars      12.54        104       6        24.79        135 8       Guilder       8.60         50       8         9.64         42 9          Ecu        6.65         28       9         5.19         17 10    ADollars        5.02         68      10         2.59         32  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *First nine months  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Euromoney Bondware  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

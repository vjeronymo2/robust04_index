			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Yeltsin sacks finance minister in rouble row President Boris Yeltsin yesterday sacked Mr Sergei Dubinin, Russia's acting finance minister, and demanded that parliament remove Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank governor, as he moved to defuse the political row over the collapse of the rouble. Mr Yeltsin called the 21.5 per cent plunge in the rouble on Tuesday a 'threat to national security' and set up a commission, including the head of the federal counter-intelligence service, to investigate its 'sabotage'. The rouble has lost half of its dollar value in the past two months. However, a rebellious parliament may not approve Mr Gerashchenko's removal when it votes on October 21. Parliament will also hold a vote of confidence on the government on the same day, and yesterday rejected Mr Yeltsin's veto on a law setting broad-based rules for passing next year's budget. Mr Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister and leader of the Russia's Choice pro-reform party, warned that conservative opposition forces might try to manipulate events to destabilise the political climate and seize power. Some senior economic policy officials believe that Tuesday's currency auction was rigged with the collusion of conservative ministers to discredit the economic reform process. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, rushed back from his holiday in Sochi to discuss the economic crisis with his ministers. The rouble recovered ground yesterday, climbing from 3,926 against the dollar to 3,736. Western economists in Moscow said the reform process had now reached a critical juncture and suggested the government had to decide whether to tighten monetary policy and stop issuing cheap credits to industry and agriculture or revert to Soviet-style central economic management. International financial institutions will view Mr Yeltsin's choice to replace Mr Dubinin as finance minister as an important indicator of the government's commitment to reform. The strongly pro-reform Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister who quit the government earlier this year, is a candidate, receiving support in parliament yesterday. But Mr Fyodorov said in London that he would lay down strict policy conditions if asked to return. Mr Jannik Lindbaek, executive vice-president of the International Finance Corporation which acts as the investment arm of the World Bank said yesterday that the currency crisis was unlikely to deter serious foreign investors.

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cummins stock climbs on turnround in income SHARES in Cummins Engine, the world's biggest independent manufacturer of diesel engines, rose sharply yesterday after the US company reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 24m, a sharp turnround from the Dollars 2.3m it lost at the same stage a year ago. The company's earnings in the latest quarter would have been higher, but for the extraordinary charge of Dollars 5.5m Cummins took to cover early retirement of high-cost debt. Despite the charge, however, investors were cheered by the news from Cummins, which has now made a profit in the last four quarters thanks to a combination of cost-cutting measures and a revival in key markets that has helped the company recover from a string of losses. Cummins' shares rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 84 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. For the full-year, Cummins earned Dollars 67.1m, compared with a Dollars 65.6m loss incurred in 1991. The net effect of adopting three new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, however, left the company with a net loss of Dollars 189.5m last year. Sales to the North American heavy-duty truck market, where the company maintains a market share of about 38 per cent, rose in the fourth quarter.</p>

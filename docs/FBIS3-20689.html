			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Zvonko Lerotic: "Sacrificing the First-Born </F> in Livno"]    [Text] The Livno meeting last week was supposed to be the  central event for the Croat people at the beginning of this  year, at which misunderstandings were supposed to have been  cleared up, pains mitigated, and the Bosnia-Herzegovina  "ustashas and partisans" reconciled. One of the sides would  make a sacrifice and renounce its "first-born son," while the  other would renounce its political strategy of an integral and  nonunitary Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, any conciliation between  two fierce opponents can only last a very short time, and as  soon as the common threats recede, they, by the nature of their  missions, will start plotting against each other's lives. This  is why at the Second Congress of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic  Community] Dr. Tudjman simply had to put in completely different  people that did not belong to either line. He recently pointed  out that certain people belonging to the left and right of the  HDZ hoped that the new inexperienced and plain center would  fail. He added that it would not and could not fail. The same  model for nominating the nine-member Presidential Council of the  republic of Herceg-Bosna was used in resolving the conflict  within the Croat corps in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Unfortunately, Boban's policies are not going with him. The  well-informed say that he built his policies on admiring the  Serbs, especially Karadzic, and belittling the Muslims and  Izetbegovic. They say that he simply overestimated the Serb  power, and completely underestimated the Muslim national  element. He trusted Karadzic too much, almost worshipping him.  He and Karadzic mutually encouraged their image of the  state-forming and military incompetence of the Muslims. The  consequences of this have been more than fatal to Croatia and  the Croats. To what extent the war conflict between the Croats  and Muslims arose from the policy of overestimating one side and  underestimating the other will certainly be a subject of future  research, but one thing is certain: If Boban had remained leader  of Herceg-Bosna, NATO would have, after Sarajevo, started  threatening the Croats because of Mostar.    Boban was, with his policies, the symbol of success of the  Croat-Serb relations, but also a hostage of Karadzic's success.  Since he could not keep up with him in the military and  propaganda terms, he had to step aside. Karadzic imposed the  sanctions on Serbia, and Boban realized that he was going to  spare Croatia that punishment if he withdraws. The most fatal  thing for him was overestimating the power of the Herzegovinian  Croats, and underestimating the power of the Church among the  Croats.    Since Boban has left, it is likely that the relations among  the Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina will become more balanced, as  will the relations of the Croats with the Muslims and Serbs.  The NATO decisions of 9 February will certainly have an impact  on that. The NATO ultimatum to the Serbs will present Croatia  with a difficult question: If the West is declaring war on the  Serbs, can Croatia be left out? The other difficult question  concerns the new U.S.-French plan, according to which the Serbs  and Croats should provide about 37 percent of the territory for  the Muslims.    The result of the Bosnia-Herzegovina tragedy is the  increasing insistence of the western world on the integral and  internationally recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina. The entire West  now opposes what VECERNJI LIST presented as the only possible  Croatian policy. According to the editorial in the 10 February  issue, this policy consists of the following: "Let us not  philosophize too much. What is, in a simplified sense, the  issue? (this concerns the political implication of Dr.Tudjman's  sentence "Mate [Boban], be as much a person from Zagorje as I am  a Herzegovinian") On the other hand, Tudjman is offered an  agreement with Milosevic, who is prepared to renounce his  proteges in the Croatian UNPA's [UN Protected Areas], but under  the condition that the accounts be squared in  Bosnia-Herzegovina." It seems that this "squaring of accounts"  will not be at the Muslim expense, and the issue of the UNPA's  is raised as independent of the resolution for  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Will the Croats continue to die by both  Serb and Muslim hand?    Alain Juppe's visit to Sarajevo and Zagreb was intended to  persuade the Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina to reach a  political solution. As far as the Serbs are concerned, they are  left with ultimatums; "it is a question of dignity and honor,"  said Juppe, threatening the Bosnian Serbs. After all the  events, Karadzic defends himself with absurdities, showing that  any rational dialogue with him is impossible. He is a man who  sees dummies instead of dead people. Any attempt to make an  arrangement with him is senseless, and at the expense of the one  who gets involved in a dialogue with him. Those who do not live  in the damnation of lies should not negotiate with this tyrant.  In this light, the policy that states that it would negotiate  with the Satan himself if it is in the interest of Croatia does  not stand a chance. The issue of Mate Boban crops up here.  Karadzic could have made, or even indicated, a concession, and  he would have spared him the resignation. The question is why  Karadzic wrote Mate Boban off, not having given him a chance of  political survival.</p>

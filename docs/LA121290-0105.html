			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Quiksilver Extends Expiration Date: Newport Beach-based Quiksilver Inc. has  agreed to extend the expiration date of its offer to buy the French company  that distributes its surfwear in Europe, Na Pali S.A. Quiksilver said it agreed  to the extension because a pre-closing audit is not yet complete.  </P> <P> Quiksilver Chairman John C. Warner said in a statement Monday that the audit is  expected to be done next month. The two companies "will proceed as rapidly as  possible" to complete the sale, Quiksilver said. Na Pali, which reported sales  of $21 million for its fiscal year ended May 31, agreed to the acquisition in a  deal announced in October.  </P></p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / 'Failure' over miscarriages LAWYERS and law reform groups yesterday attacked the royal commission for being more concerned with efficiency than justice. The proposal to abolish the defendant's right to jury trial was condemned by the Bar and the Law Society and by groups such as the Legal Action Group and Liberty. While welcoming the measures to investigate and correct wrongful convictions, Mr John Rowe QC, chairman of the Bar, said: 'The central failure of the commission's report is that it has not analysed why these miscarriages occurred or made sufficient recommendations to prevent future miscarriages.' The Law Society accused the commission of a 'short-term approach' and of having 'chosen to steer a middle course rather than undertake a strategic review'. The society was pleased that the commission had maintained the right to silence in the police station. Mr Roger Smith, Legal Action Group's director, said the report had been too influenced by the commission's perception that there was a need for greater balance between defence and prosecution. More attention should have been given to preventing miscarriages of justice of the kind that led to the report. 'The commission's package of measures reflects a desire to improve the efficiency of the administration of justice rather than its effectiveness,' Mr Smith said. Liberty, the civil liberties group, attacked the commission's failure to insist on independent evidence to corroborate confessions. Mr John Wadham, Liberty's legal officer, said: 'Uncorroborated confession evidence remains one of the biggest single causes of innocent people going to prison.' Police representatives gave a general welcome to the report, but warned that the service should not be expected to implement its recommendations from existing budgets. Mr John Burrow, chief constable of Essex and president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said it had been estimated that it might cost Pounds 9m to Pounds 10m to meet the single recommendation of putting video cameras in police station custody suites. If proposals with resource implications had to be met from existing police budgets they would 'seriously reduce improvements in other areas of criminal investigation, and take officers away from the fight against crime'. The report makes recommendations on police disciplinary procedures, an issue now under review by the Home Office. In a change of policy yesterday the Police Federation, which represents all ranks up to chief inspector, announced that it would accept a recommendation for a lower level of proof in disciplinary hearings. At present the police service's internal disciplinary hearings require the same level of proof as a criminal court. Mr Kenneth Clarke, before he left the Home Office, was shouted down when he argued for dropping the criminal standard of proof at the Police Federation conference in May. But Mr Alan Eastwood, chairman, said yesterday that the federation's council had agreed to accept a lower level of proof. Mr Burrow said he saw some advantages to the proposed restrictions on jury trial. But the decision was ultimately a political one, which should be taken after an informed public debate.</p>

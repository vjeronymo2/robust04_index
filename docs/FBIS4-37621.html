			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, the chief of staff,  said Hizballah has recently sustained dozens of fatalities and  casualties from the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and SLA [South  Lebanese Army], but continues trying to hit us. The battle  against Hizballah will continue, using all means available. Our  correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that on leaving the Knesset  Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee the chief of staff said  there has been a real decline in terrorism and disturbances in  the Gaza Strip, and a certain decline in Judaea and Samaria, but  noted that he would not count on that in the long run. He  believes terrorism and disturbances in the Gaza Strip will  continue to be on a low level, but might grow in Judaea and  Samaria.</p>

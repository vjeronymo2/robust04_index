			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / OFT calls for new rules on electrical goods warranties The Office of Fair Trading is to seek a new code of practice for the sale of extended warranties on electrical products in a report out later this week. The report is thought likely to attack the high-pressure sales tactics and often misleading claims made by retailers when selling warranties, as well as the lack of pricing information available for customers. It will also call for measures to increase competition in the extended warranties market. For big electrical retailers such as Dixons and Comet, which make significant profits from the sale of warranties - particularly before Christmas - the timing of the report could hardly be worse. However, the OFT has decided against an immediate referral of electrical goods retailers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission or a ban on retailers' selling warranties at the point of sale. Both these measures could be proposed in future by the OFT, should retailers fail to co-operate with its other suggestions. In spite of the recommendations, some consumer groups are likely to criticise the OFT's failure to take tougher action. Some hoped retailers would have had to provide details, at the point of sale, of the reliability of their goods and of alternative warranty policies. Extended warranties are insurance policies that provide extra protection against product breakdown after the standard manufacturers' guarantees have expired. They generally run for five years. Typical extended warranties cost about Pounds 55 for five years' cover for a portable colour television to Pounds 750 for a top-of-the-range personal computer. City analysts have criticised electrical goods retailers for the amount of profits warranties generate. Recent research by stockbrokers Collins Stewart suggests that Dixons makes total gross profits of about Pounds 100m a year from its extended warranties. The OFT report is thought to include: Action on transparency, with prices of warranties and servicing details to be made readily available to customers in stores. Leaflets should be available for shoppers to take away. A long 'cooling off' period, during which customers can cancel their warranty policies. For the first time, the OFT will publish free details of reliability and repair costs for a wide range of electrical goods. A new code of practice to oversee the sale of warranties in the UK. However, high street retailers are likely to be pleased that several more radical reforms have been rejected by the OFT. Those included forcing retailers to disclose the commission they take on the sale of warranties. Warranties may lose earning power, Page 7</p>

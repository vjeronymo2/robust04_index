Inside  the cylinder are thin resistive strips of finite conductivity.  It is assumed that the contours of the cross section of the  cylinder, coating, and strips are of an arbitrary form. The  diffraction of anE- and H-polarized  electromagnetic wave is considered. The results show a possibly  substantial effect of the strips on the scattering  characteristics of metal-dielectric cylinders in a resonant  range. The algorithms described here make it possible to study a  structure with varied electrophysical strip parameters along the  cross section contour. The electron paramagnetic resonance may  be reduced by 10-15 dB without changing the weight a nd size of  metal-dielectric cylinders. Figures 5; references 11: 10  Russian, 1 Western.</p>

A senior working-level meeting on the environment will be  held in Beijing in April, with delegates from South and North  Korea, China, Japan, Russia and Mongolia scheduled to attend.    Three or four delegates of the director-general level from  the Foreign and Environment Ministries will attend the Beijing  meeting and exchange views on energy and air pollution,  management of the ecosystem, training of personnel and  information exchanges.    Following the Beijing meeting, the first inter-governmental  conference under the Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP) is  slated for Seoul in June or July, when South and North Korean,  Chinese, Japanese and Russian delegates will discuss  environmental protection in the Yellow and East Seas.    The five countries held three rounds of preparatory talks  for  the Seoul meeting last year. The meeting is planned because the  waters around the Korean peninsula were selected as one of 12  areas by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) where the  possibility of pollution is very high.    ``Northeast Asian countries have formed a consultative body  on the environment, the first time they have set up such a body  on a specific issue. Moreover, it is significant that both  Seoul and Pyongyang are to attend the two environment  conferences,'' the Foreign Ministry official said.</p>

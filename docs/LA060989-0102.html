			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRINGENT NEW SMOG CONTROLS ON CARS ORDERED  </P> <P> In a major boost toward cleaning up the smoggy Los Angeles Basin, the state Air  Resources Board on Thursday ordered stringent new tailpipe emission controls on  cars and pickup trucks beginning in the 1993 model year.  </P> <P> The standard was approved on an 8-0 vote over the objections of automobile  manufacturers, who warned that it would be too costly and technologically  difficult to meet.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District and some environmentalists  praised the new standard as a major step forward, although they said the plan  does not go far enough and takes too long to go into effect.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expected Effect  </P> <P> The new rules would reduce carbon monoxide emissions from new cars by 50% and  emissions of smog-forming hydrocarbons by 30% by 1997 -- the end of a  three-year phase-in period. The rules, Chrysler Motors engineer Gordon E.  Allardyce told the board, would raise the price of new cars from $200 to $330.  The ARB's estimate is $65 per car.  </P> <P> It was the first time since 1977 that the resources board had tightened its  hydrocarbon standard. The carbon monoxide standard was last revised in 1981.  Hydrocarbons are produced by unburned fuel, such as gasoline vapors that leak  from a car's fuel system. Poisonous carbon monoxide gas is produced by burning  fuel.  </P> <P> 'We think this is one of the . . . most important rules the ARB will consider  in the next two or three years," said Paul Wuebben, manager of the AQMD's clean  fuels program. He called the action "the first significant litmus test of the  ARB's commitment" in supporting the AQMD's 20-year plan to bring the South  Coast Air Basin into compliance with federal clean air standards.  </P> <P> Hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen are the major ingredients of photochemical  smog. Until now, because of limits in technology, the board has focused mainly  on emissions of nitrogen oxides, which also are produced by engine combustion.  </P> <P> The state board also voted to require that auto makers design smog control  devices to control emissions for at least 100,000 miles -- double the current  durability requirement -- beginning in 1993. California would become the first  state to impose such a stringent smog control standard. More than 60% of cars  in California have been driven more than 50,000 miles, and account for almost  70% of pollution from automobiles.  </P> <P> By the year 2010, as the new, cleaner cars replace older models, emissions of  hydrocarbons would be cut by 70 tons a day statewide. Carbon monoxide emissions  would be reduced by 1,000 tons a day statewide.  </P> <P> Half of those reductions would occur in the counties of Los Angeles, Orange,  Riverside and San Bernardino, which make up the South Coast Air Basin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Meeting U.S. Standards  </P> <P> Gladys Meade, environmental manager of the American Lung Assn. of California,  said the state's action is "critically important" to the success of the AQMD's  clean air plan to attain federal clean air standards for carbon monoxide, ozone  and nitrogen dioxide within 20 years. The AQMD board approved the strategy last  March.  </P> <P> The reductions would amount to 10% of the four-county basin's current carbon  monoxide emissions of between 4,500 and 5,000 tons a day, and about 5% of  current hydrocarbon emissions from motor vehicles.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Wuebben said the ARB could have done better. He said the  100,000-mile durability requirement should take effect in 1994, instead of  being phased in through 1997.  </P> <P> "This is simply too long, given the gravity of Southern California's air  quality problem," Wuebben told the ARB.  </P> <P> At one point, Air Resources Board executive officer James Boyd accused Wuebben  of using "inflammatory" language and "grandstanding" in urging the ARB to go  further. Boyd vowed to take up the issue with Wuebben's boss, AQMD executive  officer James M. Lents.  </P> <P> Later, Wuebben said he was astonished and "disappointed" by Boyd's outburst. "I  couldn't believe Boyd, in front of everyone in public, saying those things,"  Wuebben said.  </P> <P> At the same time, John White of the Sierra Club charged that the ARB plan  "reflects excessive caution."  </P> <P> "In my view, the proposal simply does not go far enough fast enough, given the  magnitude of the impact which vehicular emissions have on the severity of  ozone, visibility and atmospheric acidity levels throughout California,  especially in Southern California and the inland valleys of the north," White  said.  </P> <P> Similar objections were raised in a letter to the resources board signed by  state Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) and Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo  Alto).  </P> <P> Earlier, automobile manufacturers generally said they could comply with part of  the new standard requiring cars rolling off assembly lines to meet more  stringent carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission standards. The current  hydrocarbon limit is .39 grams per mile. It would be reduced to .25 grams per  mile at 50,000 miles and .31 grams per mile at 100,000 miles under the new  standard.  </P> <P> The carbon monoxide limit would be pushed down to 3.4 grams per mile at 50,000  miles and 4.1 grams per mile at 100,000 miles. It is now a flat 7 grams per  mile.  </P> <P> But auto makers warned that it would be difficult for them to give assurances  that a tough standard could be met after a car had been on the road for 100,000  miles.  </P> <P> "The proposal would push emission control system development to the very edge  of feasibility," said Joe Calhoun of General Motors.  </P></p>

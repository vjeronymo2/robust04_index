			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark in agreed bid for Milwards C&amp;J Clark, the family-owned shoe company, has made an offer, thought to be worth about Pounds 10m, for Milwards, a privately-owned Reading-based footwear retailer. The move comes ahead of a possible flotation of Clark - perhaps as early as next year. 'There is a growing momentum towards a commitment to an early flotation,' a company source said. Clark's offer has been unanimously recommended by the Milwards board. Milwards runs a chain of 75 shops, mainly in the south of England, and in the year to January 31 had sales of Pounds 24m. Clark's intention is to invest Pounds 5m over the next two years in changing some of the shops to the Clarks and K Shoes formats. Closure of several sites is also expected. 'This development reflects the close and friendly relationships which have existed between the two companies over many years,' Mr Roger Pedder, Clark's chairman, said. Last year, Clark shareholders narrowly threw out a Pounds 184m takeover bid from Berisford International which led to the resignation of Mr Walter Dickson as Clark's chairman. In the year to January 31, Clark's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 121,000 to Pounds 20.8m on sales 5 per cent higher at Pounds 655.3m. Clark is in talks with Mr Peter Bolliger, former managing director of Harrods, about his joining the Somerset-based company. The job he is being considered for is thought to be as general manager of K Shoes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  met in Bonn on Friday [14 January] with Mohamad Javad Larijani,  a leading Iranian politician. During the meeting, the fate of  Helmut Szimkus, the German who is under sentence of death in  Iran, was probably discussed. There have been growing  indications over the last few days that as a result of pressure  from the German Government, Szimkus, who was sentenced for  spying for Iraq, can hope for a pardon.    Larijani, who belongs to Iran's Supreme Defense Council and  plays a leading role in parliament in Tehran, ended a five-day  visit to Germany on Friday. He headed a small delegation of  Iranian parliamentarians that held talks concerning the  development of German-Iranian relations with the government, the  Bundestag, and companies. The meeting with Kinkel was not  originally on their schedule.</p>

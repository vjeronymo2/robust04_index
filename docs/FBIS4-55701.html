			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Lyuben Berov to the National </F> Assembly in Sofia; monitored in progress -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] To implement this cabinet's  intentions until the end of the year, I propose the following  structural changes to the cabinet:    First, in addition to the existing post of one deputy prime  minister who coordinates the solving of comprehensive tasks, I  propose to appoint another deputy prime minister, who will not  be responsible for a specific ministry. He will coordinate the  implementation of the structural reform in our economy and will  facilitate the implementation of the general policy aimed at  finally halting the production decline in industry, agriculture,  forestry, construction, and transportation, under conditions of  protecting the environment. He will also be in charge of  monitoring the utilization of loans received for the purpose of  investment, and the use of the resources of the Reconstruction  and Development Fund.    Second, I propose to appoint a deputy prime minister to  control the country's financial situation, money circulation,  and the implementation of deals and agreements. He will also  monitor prices in the country and the foreign exchange market,  in cooperation with the National Bank. In addition, he will  control trade activity and help to create conditions for  attracting foreign investment. He will also develop the  government's relations with private business organizations.    Third, I propose to adopt an approach of gradually  eliminating the committees which have not been envisaged by the  Constitution, except for special cases, when the committees are  created by a special law. Therefore, at this stage I propose to  form two new ministries -- a Ministry of Power Supply and a  Ministry of Communications -- on the basis of the payroll and  budget of the corresponding existing committees. Three other  committees will be reorganized without transforming them into  separate ministries.    In the final analysis, as a result of all these measures the  Council of Ministers will include 19 members. It will encompass  17 ministries, one of which will be led by a deputy prime  minister, plus a deputy prime minister without portfolio and the  prime minister, making 19 members in all. Until now the cabinet  has had 16 members.    Four agencies, instead of the existing three, will function  at the Council of Ministers, and three committees instead of the  existing eight.    The government will review also the activity of the Agency  on  Foreign Aid and the Committee on Bulgarians Living Abroad, with  a view to improving their work.    Within the framework of these structural changes, I propose  the following personnel changes in the cabinet:    First, to release Valentin Stefanov Karabashev from the  posts  of deputy prime minister and minister of trade.    Second, to release the minister of justice, Petur Zakhariev  Kornazhev.    Third, to appoint Docent Rumen Vasilev Gechev as deputy  prime  minister without any specific ministry under him, in accordance  with the first item of these structural changes.    Fourth, to appoint Kiril Petrov Tsochev as deputy prime  minister and minister of trade, in accordance with the second  item of the structural changes.    Fifth, to appoint Nikita Georgiev Shervashidze as minister  of  power supply.    Sixth, to appoint Gospodin Atanasov Atanasov as minister of  justice.    Seventh, to appoint Krustyu Ivanov Mirski as minister of  communications.    I propose that the National Assembly approves these changes  to the cabinet. Ladies and gentlemen, you may approve or reject  the specific program proposed by the cabinet for the period  until the end of the year. The approval of this program must be  supported next week by an agreement between the cabinet and the  parliamentary factions or individual deputies that support it.  This will be a sign that this cabinet is supported by a solid  parliamentary majority, without which it cannot function  successfully. Thus, the cabinet will not be a hostage to any  parliamentary faction.    The failure to approve this submission will cause the  resignation of the cabinet, the failure of the reform, the  nonimplementation of the mass privatization, and serious  disruption of the country's economic development. In practice,  this will mean assuming an orientation toward early  parliamentary elections.    I have done everything possible to find the best solution  for  the country. I and my team have served Bulgaria to the best of  our abilities. We will continue to serve so in the future if  the parliament so wishes. Thank you for your attention.</p>

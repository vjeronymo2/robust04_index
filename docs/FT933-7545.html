			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Unitas unveils plan for capital injections UNITAS, Finland's second-largest banking group, yesterday unveiled plans to strengthen its capital base by raising nearly FM1.5bn (Dollars 258m) in new equity, and up to a further Dollars 150m of preference capital from international markets. It said the funds would enable it to withstand two more years of losses, and give it the capacity to expand lending when the Finnish economy recovered. 'If we are successful, we have every reason to believe that we will not fall into state hands,' said Mr Markku Pohjola, the bank's senior vice-president. The Finnish government said yesterday it had agreed in principle to guarantee new preference capital issues by both the Union Bank of Finland (part of Unitas) and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank. The KOP guarantee covers an issue of up to FM1.8bn and the UBF guarantee an issue of up to FM1bn. Unitas says it aims to raise FM1.16bn through a one-for-three rights issue at FM10 per share, and a further FM300m through an issue open to both shareholders and non-shareholders. The timing of the offers has been aided by evidence of recovery in the wider Nordic banking sector. This has helped Unitas' share price rise by more than 50 per cent, to FM20 in the last three weeks. The group is being cautious about its prospects, saying it may not show a clear profit until 1996. However, it believes its 1993 loss will be lower than last year's FM2.7bn deficit, helped by a levelling off of credit losses and non-performing loans. In the first seven months of the year, its loss fell to FM923m from FM1.02bn. The bank's capital adequacy ratio at the end of July stood at 11.1 per cent. However, it will rise to more than 13 per cent if its fund-raising plans are successful.</p>

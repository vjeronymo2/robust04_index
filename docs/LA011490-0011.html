			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> What could Cinemax cable programmers have been thinking of when they scheduled  "The Terror of the Tongs"? It is one of the most racially offensive films I  have ever seen. I'm not even a member of the Chinese community and I found the  film (which dealt with a captain seeking the killers of his daughter)  unbearable. It needs to be canned and put in the film archives next to "Birth  of a Nation"!  </P> <P> Nicole Meggerson, Culver City  </P></p>

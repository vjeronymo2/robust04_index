			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television IT IS difficult to believe that the wartime RAF movie The Way To The Stars (6.00 BBC2) was made in my lifetime, since it seems part of a world long lost in the mists of history, and yet it was - just. The evening ends with an even better film which is four years older yet timeless: The Maltese Falcon (11.20 BBC1). Bogart gives his best performance as Sam Spade, and John Huston made a stunning debut as director. In The Company Of Whales (9.00 C4) is a documentary in which conservationist Roger Payne, who brought us the whales' 'songs', gives an update on the global state of the whale and dolphin population. It seems like a saddening story: the polluted oceans and a whale disease akin to Aids. Payne wonders whether it is too late to save not only the whales but the very oceans. The drama which follows, Gummed Labels (10.30), promises 'a bafflingly convoluted plot' about the disappearance of a young girl, with her sister, a detective, a psychiatrist, and a porn-movie director all looking for her. 'The audience becomes increasingly uncertain about where they are going and who they are', we are told. Hmmm.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent Andrey Knyazev </F> under the rubric "Versions": "Who Is Playing the Card of the  Urals Republic?"]    [Text] While visiting Yekaterinburg, ARGUMENTY I  FAKTY correspondent Andrey Knyazev heard several versions of the  declaration of the Urals Republic and the subsequent dismissal  of administration head Eduard Rossel.    The first version is promoted by Rossel himself,  his supporters, and the residents who actively endorsed the  republic's constitution. It goes like this. Unless the  issue of regional independence is resolved, Russia will not move  forward and the economic situation will remain in a dead end.  The main task is to raise the oblast's status, wrangling the  necessary economic rights from Moscow. Rossel and his  confederates' assumption is that Russia could be managed from  Moscow in the environment of a rigid unitary state. Under a free  market system, however, all 89 Federation components must be  given the necessary degree of freedom to conduct economic reform  on their own.    Eduard Rossel states categorically that Yeltsin was not told  in advance of the decision; as to the creator of the Urals  Republic constitution, he had no desire to join Sverdlovsk  Oblast with other Urals oblasts.    According to the second version, which is  supported by the Russian president's representative in the  oblast, Vitaliy Mashkov, as well as the intellectual elite not  connected to commercial structures, the declaration of the  Urals Republic is nothing other than the desire to have  decisionmaking power on all matters regarding selling the Urals'  riches, bypassing Moscow. This is an easier way to enrich  oneself and squander the national wealth.    That is why Rossel's idea was so eagerly welcomed by  businessmen experienced in setting up join enterprises with  foreign companies. There are many facts pointing to the  existence of a clan with a stake in this outcome. Members of  this clan work not only in Yekaterinburg but also in state and  entrepreneurial structures in Russia.    Finally, the third version, which many ordinary  Yekaterinburg residents are inclined to accept. The Urals  Republic was a sacrifice card in Moscow's political game with  Russia's ethnic entities. First federal authorities wanted  to warn Tatarstan, Tuva, and other former autonomies against  becoming too independent. When the situation with the Urals  Republic went too far, however, they decided to reshuffle the  deck. Rossel got too carried away with the idea and became an  irritant for many people.    Meanwhile, Eduard Ergartovich himself hopes for success and  the support of leaders of other oblasts. As to leaflets with the  Urals Republic constitution, they were popular among the  Federation Council deputies--heads of oblast and kray  administration. One cannot rule out that in the near future  there may be a Central Russian, Volgo-Vyatka, Siberian, Far  East, and other republics on the map of Russia.</p>

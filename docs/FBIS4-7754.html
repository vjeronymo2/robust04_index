			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Schutz: "For the Time Being, Meciar </F> Stays"]    [Text] The government of Vladimir Meciar, which is  criticized, damned, and cursed from all sides, can continue to  govern Slovakia in a formal manner. However, it will be  government in quotation marks. That is to say, last week,  parliament, where the anti-Meciar opposition holds a majority,  took a portion of power into its own hands. In other words, as  of last week, Slovakia does not have a government that could  fully carry out its functions. This somewhat bizarre situation  came into being as the result of two "specifics" of Slovak  politics--the absence of the term resignation in the political  vocabulary of today's power elite, and the lack of readiness or,  rather, the inability on the part of the opposition to take on  the responsibility for directing the state. Its hesitation is  more surprising because, in one breath and with unprecedented  sharpness, it speaks of the "catastrophic consequences of  Meciar's governing" and of the need to prevent "the further  devastation of the country."    The political crisis began at the beginning of February,  when  the government coalition of the HZDS-SNS [Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia--Slovak National Party] made use of a  parliamentary filibuster to defeat discussion of an amendment of  the law on large-scale privatization (the dispute involved the  personnel connections between the executive and the National  Property Fund). The coalition decided to take this step at the  moment the Cernak faction within the SNS notified the coalition  that it was canceling its allegiance and when this move resulted  in balancing the ratio of forces within the National Council at  75:75. However, as early as the subsequent termination of the  meeting of delegates, it was clear that, as long as the ratio of  forces did not change, there was the threat of the total  paralysis of the legislative power. This was obviously realized  by Josef Moravcik, minister of foreign affairs, and Roman Kovac,  deputy prime minister, under whose patronage the Political  Realism Alternative (Alternativa politickeho realismu)  parliamentary faction came into being within the HZDS.    The parliamentary session that was resumed last week  confirmed the new distribution of forces. The "Alternative"  faction joined the opposition, and the delegates adopted the  amendment in the form in which it was being asserted by the  opposition. (In practice, this means sidelining the prime  minister from the National Property Fund.) But the subsequent  step--the fall of the Meciar cabinet--did not take place. The  necessity to agree on a date for early elections (the coalition  was proposing June, the opposition suggested November) turned  out to be the prerequisite for the declaration of no confidence.  And shortening election time through parliamentary maneuvering  requires a three-fifths majority (90 votes), and even two  attempts to put such a majority together failed (the first  attempt fell short by 21 votes, the second by seven).    The fact that both the opposition and the coalition agree on  the necessity for calling early elections and, at the same time,  cannot agree on such a secondary matter as the date for these  elections is somewhat absurd. Logically, the question thus  arises as to whether the common desire for early elections may  not be just a mere pacifier of sorts. It is clear that the  dispute over "June versus November" is a pseudoproblem, at least  from the side of the opposition. The argument that June is not a  suitable date for elections because "the political scene must  become crystallized so that the parties can prepare their  programs" and that the "transitional government requires time to  stabilize the country" is, on the face of it, a proclamation  regarding the harmfulness of the continued functioning of  Meciar, which is not trustworthy. After all, anyone who takes  the words regarding the continuing "devastation of the country"  seriously is attempting to remove the government from power as  quickly as possible. Vladimir Meciar is correct when he says  that the crisis needs to be resolved immediately. The problem of  present-day Slovakia actually lies elsewhere than in the  deadline for early elections. It lies in the fact that the  opposition continues unable to agree on the most substantive  matter--on the decision to resolve the situation by making a  radical cut.    Today, the anti-Meciar opposition is divided approximately  into three camps--the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], the  Hungarian parties, and the remainder around Carnogursky's KDH  [Christian Democratic Movement]. Of course, the keys to further  development are only in the hands of the Weiss former communist  SDL. This party was the first to insist that a vote of no  confidence in the government be preceded by a call for early  elections and is currently holding its opposition colleagues  under tension through bilateral discussions with Meciar.  Although Weiss is rejecting Meciar's coalition offers, this is  amply sufficient for purposes of disintegrating the opposition.  Even in the face of efforts to outwardly maintain the appearance  of unity, Ivan Simko, deputy chairman of the KDH, precisely  characterized this situation on Friday: "The situation is  obtuse, particularly thanks to the fact that the SDL is gambling  on all parties. And that is what is decisive at this moment."    As far as Meciar's tactics are concerned, his gamble on  early  elections is, at the present moment, relatively trustworthy.  This week, he is beginning to collect signatures of citizens to  a petition demanding the announcement of a referendum on early  elections. In the tradition of his populism, however, he wants  the referendum to include two additional items: Citizens are to  decide to deprive those delegates who have changed their  political uniforms since the election of their mandate and to  compel adoption of a law proving the source of money involved in  privatization. If Meciar collects the necessary 350,000  signatures--and this is a certainty--the president will have to  announce a referendum involving all three of these topics within  30 days.    The Hamlet-type questions besetting present-day Slovakia  thus  lie elsewhere than in the date for early elections. Even in the  face of everything that is occurring in the country, has the  time already arrived for recalling the Meciar cabinet? And can  early elections in the foreseeable future bring an actual  alternative to the government of the HZDS to the leadership of  the state; can these elections mean a true turnaround?  Understandably, an unequivocal response to the first question  does not exist. It does exist with respect to the second  question: The answer is no.    Arguments for the end of the "broad-gauge" Meciar government  are serious and generally well known, and would be sufficient  for a separate article. Meciar is a permanent threat to  democratic development in the country, a threat that need not  come about, but its very existence is a sufficiently momentous  reason. On the other hand, it is true that Meciar continues to  enjoy the confidence of one-fifth of the population. And so,  even if he were to be removed from the prime minister's position  in the foreseeable future, the new elections cannot prevent the  HZDS from returning to power. Moreover, it is certain that,  should Meciar enter the election campaign from the opposition  end, the preference for his movement would again increase. In a  highly likely preelection coalition with the Klepac Christian  Socialists and the "Andel-Prokes" portion of the SNS, he will  most likely obtain 30 percent of the votes. However, even if he  were to obtain fewer votes--the count will surely not be lower  than 20 percent--the only realistic possibility would be a  government coalition between the HZDS and the SDL anyway.  Anything else is out of the question.    Although the advent of the refined "Weiss boys" will serve  to  improve the overall impression of an old-new government team,  that government team is aiming its policy still further toward  the left. (While today Toth, minister of finance, is barely  adhering to the recommendations of the International Monetary  Fund and is thus at least holding inflation under control, it is  likely that, in an HZDS-SDL coalition, this practice would come  to naught.) The notion that Weiss will wish to avoid a coalition  with Meciar--which would be politically difficult or even  impossible--and would form a common bloc with the other parties  is also not overly encouraging. Additional early elections would  be only a matter of time.    Optimists will surely object to this somewhat catastrophic  scenario by stating that there still remain some 50 percent of  the people who do not want to go to the polls today and whose  votes could change everything. But this is only a hope. A part  of those who are undecided will certainly not vote, and the  remainder, as is shown by experiences involving "nonvoters" in  other countries, will divide their votes evenly between the  strongest parties.    The future of Slovakia lies fully in the hands of the Slovak  voter. Unfortunately, all public opinion polls conducted thus  far and the analyses derived from them signal the fact that  whether early elections are held in June or in November is  completely immaterial. Therefore, for the time being, it is  premature to expect not only fundamental but even partial  changes in the situation as it exists today. Early elections in  Slovakia will truly be premature.</p>

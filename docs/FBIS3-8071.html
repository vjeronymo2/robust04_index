			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mirko Sagolj: "Russians Did Not Come by </F> Chance"]    [Text] The decision of Milosevic's and Karadzic's (general  staff) to withdraw their heavy artillery placed around Sarajevo  before the ultimatum expires, and the way in which Russia is  (again) getting involved in solving the Bosnia-Herzegovina  conflict, is a shock to many. What is especially confusing is  the Russian initiative that actually boils down to protecting  the Serbs in the Balkans, thus securing an indispensable role  for Moscow in solving Balkan conflicts. It seems that fate  would have it that the Russians on one side, and the United  States and Great Britain on the other meet exactly 49 years  after the Yalta Conference, where former Yugoslavia was divided  into two interest spheres precisely on the slopes of Trebevic  above Sarajevo. Yalta was betrayed only in that the demarcation  line was moved from the Drina River to the Miljacka River,  hoping that this is only temporary.    The appearance and role of Russian soldiers around Sarajevo  could confuse and shock only those who are not well acquainted  with Russia and its inner regularities and do not know what is  now happening in this country. Every realistic and proper  analysis would, however, show that events around Sarajevo, as  the key military and political point of Serbian aggression  against Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the presence of Russia in these  parts are evolving according to all rules of logic.    The Russian initiative could have come as a surprise, first  of all, to those who think that the Russian factor became  extremely weak and negligible in December, 1991, when Boris  Yeltsin disbanded the omnipotent Communist Party of the Soviet  Union with two presidential decrees, eliminated communists from  power, and then disbanded the great "socialist empire" -- the  Soviet Union. The former Soviet Federation had 15 federal  republics, spread over 22.4 million square kilometers, had 290  million inhabitants, a mighty army, and ruled over a good part  of Europe.    According to all formal indicators, it was a superpower that  both the United States and China feared. However, it is  fortunate for such a superpower that its strength in the past 50  years was tested in peace, and it was lucky not to have engaged  in military conflicts against the West. If it had been put on  the battlefield against the West, it would have become obvious  that it was a colossus with feet of clay; with a great  potential, it is true, but with an enormous question mark as to  its use.    This evaluation is first of all based on the character of  former authorities in the Soviet Union, which most of the  inhabitants were not satisfied with, as well as on the very  structure of the Soviet Federation. The fact that, after the  collapse of the Soviet Union, not a single former federal  republic wanted to stay in the same country with Russia, best  portrays the strength of the entire Soviet Federation. And that  could be explained: None of the former Soviet federal republics  joined the federation in a democratic manner, of its own will.  They all became its members mostly in times of war and under  presence from Russian tanks. If such a Soviet Union had fought  a war with a more serious opponent, most of its republics would  have turned their backs on Russia. How accessible was the  tissue of the former Soviet military, regardless of all the  stomic might, a German sports pilot Mathias Rust showed in the  most convincing manner when, on 28 May, 1987, he landed at  Moscow's Red Square without any problems whatsoever. During  World War II, the Germans made daily advances of up to 45  kilometers on Soviet territory. Perhaps they would advance even  faster in 1991.    Regardless of the fact that Russia left the Soviet Union  waving the white flag -- almost ravaged materially,  ideologically, politically, and morally speaking -- it is still  more powerful than the former Soviet Union, and definitely more  dangerous. It is indeed a very complex and heterogeneous state  structure, according to the national composition of its  inhabitants, but it is far more homogenous and "coordinated"  than the former Soviet Union, and that is its true strength. It  is more dangerous because empty spaces on its political scene,  vacated when the communist were overthrown, are now mostly  filled by social national demagogues, who promise people they  will return both Vodka and the glory and homogenize them around  that idea. Such a Russia not only does not want to give up any  strategic point of its interests and influence, but wants to  strengthen them. And Trebevic and the "orthodox brothers in the  Balkans" are primary Russian interests, and their presence in  these parts and their role should be viewed in this light.    In former Russian views regarding the conflict in Bosnia-  Herzegovina and ways to solve it, there were significant  differences. There are no more such differences: The Russian  parliament, with all its factions, without exceptions, the  Russian public, President Yeltsin, its government, they all  point out that there is no solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina  without Russia and that they are against using force against  Serb positions.    The world is, therefore, facing Russia again; last time it  was faced with communism as an ideology and now with  Zhirinovskiy.</p>

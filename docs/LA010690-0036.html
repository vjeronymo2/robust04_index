			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORD 'CENSORSHIP'  </P> <P> I am offended by still another reference to the Christian response to "Piss  Christ" as censorship ("Censorship: A Decade of Tighter Control of the Arts" by  Allan Parachini and Dennis McDougal, Dec. 25).  </P> <P> Anyone who cannot be offended has no soul.  </P> <P> When so many other groups are so quick to take offense, why do you call our  voice censorship? When someone sticks Christ's image in urine and titles it  "Piss Christ" and then you call our protesting voices censorship, you are  wrong.  </P> <P> When the Japanese-American community took offense at a work of art to be  installed at MOCA you had no criticism. When Jewish pressure had Vanessa  Redgrave canceled as a performer with the Boston Symphony you did not use the  word censorship. When homosexual groups complained about the script for a  popular TV show, the script was changed and not a word of condemnation was  issued by The Times.  </P> <P> TOM BLAIR, San Pedro  </P></p>

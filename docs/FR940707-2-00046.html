Eastern Shore has separately filed a request for rehearing of the May 19 Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eastern Shore states that the subject tariff sheets are being filed to comply with Ordering Paragraph C of the Commission's Order. Such paragraph directed Eastern Shore to revise its tariff to provide either a Unit-of-Sales or Unit-of-Purchase methodology for computing both its demand current adjustment and monthly deferred demand costs in accordance with &sect;154.303(c)(2)(ii) of the Commission's PGA regulations and file such revised tariff sheets within 30 days of the date of the Order to be made effective prospectively from the date of the Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in Eastern Shore's request for rehearing, Eastern Shore believes its PGA tariff provisions and its PGA filings during the past six years have consistently used a Unit-of-Purchase methodology for computing both the current demand charge adjustment and the monthly demand deferrals. Eastern Shore, however, states it is willing to revise its tariff provisions to be effective May 19, 1994, in accordance with the Commission's Order to further clarify that both its current demand charge adjustments and monthly demand deferrals will be calculated using a Unit-of-Purchase methodology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eastern Shore states that two ``refund reports'' are being filed to comply with Ordering Paragraph D, which requires Eastern Shore to refund with interest its overcharges from November 1, 1992 to the current billing month and to file a report showing how the refund was calculated. Due to what Eastern Shore believes to be an inconsistency or contradiction with respect to the Commission's language in its Order, Eastern Shore has submitted for the Commission's review two separate refund scenarios with significantly different results, each of which it states is arguably in compliance with the Commission's Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eastern Shore states that upon notification from the Commission as to which refund report it accepts, it will credit the appropriate refund amount to its Account No. 191 Demand Refund Sub-Account and refund such amount, as provided in &sect;21.6, ``Rufunds'' of its PGA tariff provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eastern Shore states that copies of the filing have been served upon its jurisdictional customers and interested State Commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington D.C., 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before July 8, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

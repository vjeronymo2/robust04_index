			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 25 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Electric Power  Corp. (KEPCO) concluded a technology cooperation agreement with  its Chinese counterpart in Beijing Wednesday covering the areas  of construction, management and technology of nuclear power  plants, KEPCO officials said.    KEPCO President Rieh Chong-hun signed the agreement with  Jiang Xinxiong, president of the China National Nuclear Corp.  (CNNC).    In addition, KEPCO will sign technology cooperation  agreements with North China Electric Power Group (NCPG) and  Northeast China Electric Power Group Corp. (NEPG) on Thursday in  the fields of construction and management of hydroelectric and  thermoelectric power plants and electric supply.    As Chinese demand for electric power soars, the country  hopes  to expand its electric power facilities with South Korean  technological and financial support.    KEPCO officials expect that conclusion of the agreements  will  accelerate bilateral cooperation in the electric power sector.    Meanwhile, Rieh will visit Yanji city in the Korean  autonomous prefecture on Saturday to sign a letter of intent  with mayor Piao Dongkui on a joint venture for the Yanji  combined heat and power plant.</p>

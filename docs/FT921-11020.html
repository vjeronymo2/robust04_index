			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Companies warned on reporting standards NEARLY 240 companies have failed to comply with a statutory requirement on financial reporting in their most recent annual accounts. Under a 1989 amendment to the 1985 Companies Act, companies must state in their annual report that the accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The Financial Reporting Review Panel, the recently created monitor of accounting standards, has so far warned 238 companies that their most recent accounts fail to comply. Mr Sydney Treadgold, secretary to the panel, emphasised that the companies had not necessarily contravened accounting standards but had failed to make the statement. Several companies made the statement and wrongly assumed that they no longer needed to disclose full details of accounting policies. The panel sought legal advice and last week issued a notice making clear that companies must provide the statement and details of accounting policies. Last week the panel issued its first reprimands against three companies that breached accounting standards: Ultramar, the oil and gas group now owned by Lasmo; Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate; and Shield Group, the property developer and estate agent.</p>

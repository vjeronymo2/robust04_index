			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Tomkins pay-out rise 'bullish' Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, said yesterday he was 'very excited and very optimistic for the future'. He said the 15.2 per cent increase in the interim dividend was 'very bullish'. He predicted the group would continue to generate earnings and dividend growth above the average for the stock market. Mr Hutchings said Tomkins, which acquired Ranks Hovis McDougall, the food group, in December for Pounds 990.5m, would not rewrite its 10-year-old mission statement just because it was out of fashion with the stock market. The integration of RHM was going to schedule. At the half-year end net cash was Pounds 170m, which, Mr Hutchings said, provided the resources to finance recovery, although at present he could see 'very few signs of recovery in the UK and continental Europe'.</p>

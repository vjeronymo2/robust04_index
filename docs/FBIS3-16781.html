According to Soskovets, taxes should be cut down to 45 per  cent, as is the case in civilised countries. "Tax legislation  should stimulate production and not to pave grounds for  concealing taxes, as is the case now," the vice-premier stressed.    Soskovets noted that the government plans to examine the  question of cutting the value-added tax in the near future. He  stressed that it is necessary to "lift customs duties from goods  crossing borders inside the Commonwealth countries".</p>

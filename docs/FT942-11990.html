			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Upward trend dependson local markets - Philips Signs of hesitant recovery in Europe should allow Philips, the Dutch electronics group, to report a rise in first-quarter net profit when it publishes its figures for early 1994 tomorrow. Philips' strong performance in 1993, achieved despite continued economic weakness in Europe, was due mainly to higher operating results in North America and Asia. But the company's ability to extend the upward trend in earnings still depends on the recovery of markets close to home. The first-quarter improvement is expected to rest on a combination of increased demand in some businesses and continued successes in bringing down financing charges through further reductions in group debt. The rise will also be aided by the fact that the 1993 first quarter had been relatively weak, with net profit declining to Fl 103m (Pounds 37m) from Fl 162m in 1992. Some analysts say an increase to Fl 200m or more should be possible for the 1994 first quarter, though much will depend on the company's performance in Germany. The financial markets' confidence in Philips has been boosted by the company's decision to pay a small dividend for the first time since 1990. This should make it easier for Mr Jan Timmer, president, to face shareholders at the annual general meeting in Eindhoven on Thursday.</p>

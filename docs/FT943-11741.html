			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Turnround staged by Solvay in first half Solvay, Belgium's largest chemicals group, yesterday reported first-half consolidated profits of BFr2.91bn (Dollars 86.6m), compared with losses of BFr5.7bn. The results were flattered by exceptional sales of non-strategic businesses worth BFr1bn. These included the wood protection and special tile adhesives businesses. The loss last year included a BFr3bn or restructuring charge. The group predicted profits would continue to improve as long as the European economy continued to pick up. Turnover rose 4.5 per cent to BFr127.5bn from BFr122bn in spite of plant closures. Sales in Europe rose 2 per cent, while those in the US improved 8 per cent and sales in the Asia Pacific gained 74 per cent. But sales in Brazil fell 20 per cent. The company said all businesses, with the exception of peroxygens, increased operating profits. The plastics business had returned from severe losses last year to profit. It had benefited from higher volumes, as well as prices.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Mexican interest rates rise Mexico's interest rates rose for the second week running yesterday after further volatility in the peso/dollar exchange rate, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Rates on short-term government paper rose to 9.3 per cent, up 0.29 percentage points from last week. The rise in rates came as the 48-hour peso/dollar buy rate closed at 3.26 after weakening to 3.30. The peso has lost some 5 per cent of its value in a month, and has been close to its central bank limit of 3.357. Currency traders blame the peso's weakness on low economic growth, mounting political uncertainty in Mexico, and higher interest rates in the US. The low growth has encouraged the government - until the last two weeks - to push interest rates down quickly. The government's revised figures show growth fell 0.8 per cent in the third quarter last year, and 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Base metals ended a generally active LME session mixed, with NICKEL below earlier four-month highs. Dealers said three-month nickel's early advance to a peak of Dollars 7,700 a tonne was largely made on speculative buying once a move through Dollars 7,600 triggered buy-stops. COPPER closed at its highs, aided by news that a strike could start at Poland's KGHM combine on July 20. This helped the market to shrug off overnight news that Asarco had settled with its unions. Comex copper contracts were setting successive lifetime highs following the cut in US interest rates. This sparked speculation that the US economy might soon recover. London's robusta COFFEE futures gained up to Dollars 28 on fund buying, while COCOA made small losses as the recent rally ran out of steam. 'Coffee has potential for more upside, but don't expect it to go anywhere in a hurry,' one trader said. 'Then again, I suppose Dollars 20-odd is almost a rally in London.' New York raw SUGAR futures were firm at midday as short covering ahead of the US Independence Day holiday continued to underpin prices. Traders cited sentiment that the price drop of the last two sessions might have been overdone. Compiled from Reuters</p>

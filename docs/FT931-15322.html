			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Last year's dealing made Soros group Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn THE New York-based financial group headed by Hungarian financier Mr George Soros turned in a profit of between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.3bn and Pounds 1.9bn) last year, one of his top aides said in London yesterday. Mr Stan Druckenmiller, a managing director of Soros Fund Management, said that 'substantially less than half' the profits came from speculation on sterling. The rest came from dealing in other currencies and financial instruments. Mr Druckenmiller denied reports that the fund management group - in which Mr Soros has a one-third stake - had contributed to recent tensions involving the French franc by selling the currency. Last week the franc brushed its floor against the D-Mark within the European exchange rate mechanism, although this week it has strengthened. During last summer's exchange market crisis the fund management group made a profit of about Dollars 1bn from selling sterling before Britain's ERM exit. Mr Druckenmiller said it was wrong to think his organisation had specifically targeted the pound for selling. 'Sterling was one piece in the matrix (of our overall operations),' he said. While in London, Mr Druckenmiller met UK Treasury and Bank of England officials for talks about currency operations, which one UK official described as 'helpful'. Soros Fund Management currently owns a portfolio of more than Dollars 7bn. The total is due to fall over the next few months after profits on last year's operations are paid to shareholders. Mr Druckenmiller said the franc was 'not fundamentally overvalued' in the ERM and that Soros Fund Management 'had no plans' to sell the currency. 'If the ERM did not exist and the franc no longer had a peg to the D-Mark then in our view the franc would not depreciate,' Mr Druckenmiller said.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Russia prepares for privatisation on a grand scale THE Russian government is finalising details of a mass privatisation programme which could place 50 per cent of the shares of Russian industry in private hands within a year, according to one of President Boris Yeltsin's closest foreign advisers. Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University in the US said yesterday that foreign investors would play a key role in the sale of 'dozens' of the largest Russian enterprises in the oil, gas telecommunications and car sectors. Shares in thousands of other industrial enterprises would be offered to workers, management and the public through a system of individual vouchers and investment trusts, similar to those being used in privatisation programmes in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. Prof Sachs, speaking to European journalists by satellite before testifying to Congress in Washington yesterday, stressed that it was essential that a sense of ownership be introduced into Russian industry as soon as possible. Details of the mass privatisation programme would be unveiled in a few weeks, he said. Prof Sachs outlined plans under which most industrial companies with fewer than 500 employees would be sold to their workers and management under favourable conditions. The Russian public would be able to participate in the privatisation of larger enterprises following legal changes later this year defining property rights, creating a civil code and detailing the responsibility of company directors. Prof Sachs repeated earlier warnings about the low level of Western financial support for Russian economic reforms, and said 'the next couple of months will be crucial' to the success of the programme. He said that most west European countries were prepared to back IMF proposals for Russia, but said the US had so far failed to appreciate the need for quick action to support the Russian reforms. 'Russia can escape from hyperinflation,' he said, 'but if the west sits back and leaves the rouble weak, then the industrial and regional collapse already evident in the country could multiply.' Russia yesterday announced plans to more than double the minimum wage, although the new level will still be only half the amount needed for bare essentials, Reuter reports from Moscow. The Russian deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin told parliament the government planned to raise the minimum monthly wage to Rbs750 from next month. The present minimum wage is Rbs342, the same as the minimum pension, which is to be raised to Rbs650).</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: SFO under fire as Cramer is acquitted A TIRED but exultant Mr Guy Cramer said yesterday the Serious Fraud Office had failed to produce any evidence to show that he knew of the fraud at Barlow Clowes, and had based its case against him on 'guilt by association'. Posing for photographers with a bottle of champagne shortly after he was acquitted of one charge of conspiracy and six of theft, the former chief executive of Barlow Clowes' parent company James Ferguson Holdings declared: 'There is not one single piece of paper, nothing, absolutely no shred of evidence that I had any knowledge the funds used by Mr Clowes improperly were in fact clients' funds. 'The prosecution have run this case on a guilt-by-association basis.' Mr Derek Duffy, his solicitor, said he was 'disappointed' at the Serious Fraud Office's handling of the case. 'Had the SFO considered all the issues before it, considered all the documents, then these proceedings would never have taken place and the four years that have gone by and the suffering that Mr Cramer and his family have gone through need not have occurred.' He suggested the SFO might have felt compelled by the publicity surrounding its investigation of Barlow Clowes to mount as many prosecutions as possible. 'We were always very anxious that the jury should take an impartial view and see who had and had not been involved in the mismanagement,' Mr Duffy said. The fact that the jury had acquitted two people, he said, was a vindication of the jury system as 'a powerful force for justice'. Regarding Mr Peter Clowes, convicted on 18 out of 19 counts, Mr Cramer would say only that the jury had reached the 'right decision'. Mr Clowes' image, he said, had always been one of 'extreme wealth and great integrity'. 'Clearly that has been proved wrong now,' he added. Mr Cramer said he would be attending a small celebratory lunch, and then a 'short holiday abroad might not be unreasonable'. He then planned to spend some time rebuilding his family life with his wife and two young children before trying to relaunch his business career.</p>

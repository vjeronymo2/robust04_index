			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / How To Spend It: An Eden for the avant gardener - Today's contrary garden is more than silver bells and cockle shells FOR THOSE who think that gardeners are prone to wallowing in nostalgia for the herbaceous borders of the past, The Oxford Gallery's occasional forays into the world of garden design are a useful corrective. Here is where the avant-garde of the green welly set make their stand. No romantic-style garlanded urns, no cute gnomes, no 'authentic' copies of Byronic statues, but distinctive, innovative ideas from our most contemporary of crafts people. The Oxford Gallery always has some work by contemporary artists for the garden but from time to time it mounts a large exhibition on the theme. Usually the exhibitions have been held at High Walls near Oxford - this time they are bringing their wares to London, to the Barbican Centre, where the sculpture court and a fine conservatory offer a surprisingly horticultural setting for such an urban address. If your idea of decorating your patio is to distribute a few terracotta pots tastefully around the place, then this is an exhibition to make you think. Sally Tarshish of Inscape Gardens sets the mood with some immensely erudite ideas on gardening gleaned from Chinese, medieval and classic Greek texts which she translates into a plant and sculpture garden, Five Walks. A hornbeam grove and a burbling fountain by William Pye lies in the heart of it. The work of the 50 artists and sculptors on show will ensure you never look at gardens in quite the same way again. There are Monica Young's giant-sized pots - a bit out of scale for the average city patio but splendid in a large country garden; there are ceramic kits from Jitka Palmer; stone gargoyles from Alec and Fiona Peever; or what about a carved wooden crocodile by Nick Deans? Materials used range from stone and wood to ceramic and industrial salvage. Prices for some of the special pieces seem high but many of them really are works of art. There will be many smaller, more affordable things as well - willow baskets by Alison Fitzgerald starting at Pounds 30, ceramic tableware ranging from Pounds 15, and lots more. This exhibition is far removed from the average garden centre display. Part sculpture, part decorative, part practical, anybody interested in pushing forward the art of creating gardens should not miss it. The Avant Garden exhibition opens at the Barbican Centre, Sculpture Court, Silk Street, London EC2 on May 16 and runs until June 16. It will open Mondays to Saturdays from 11am to 6pm and on Sundays from noon to 6pm. Admission to the sculpture court is free but there is a 75p charge for adults, and 50p for children, to see the conservatory. All the pieces will be for sale and similar items can be ordered from the artists. If your garden could really do with a gazebo, then Amdega have come up with the answer. A gazebo, according to the dictionary, is 'a structure whence a view may be had', and Amdega's gazebo is worthy of the finest view. Hexagonally shaped, made from Western Red Cedar wood and supported by arches and decorative trellis, it is really a summer house with open sides through which you can admire said view. Around the trellis you can trail whatever you deem to be this year's fashionable climber. The standard design is big enough to take a table and chairs so that you can have tea and cucumber sandwiches in time-honoured style, or perhaps a sundowner, while you admire the view. It has a proper roof of cedar shingle which should protect from mild showers. At Pounds 2,120 (plus Vat) it had better be some view. Amdega is one of the oldest names in conservatories and you can order one of its free colour brochures by ringing 0800-59123. If your idea of summer is some nicely turned steaks or burgers out on the barbecue, you could look at the range of barbecues produced by Barbecue Cuisine. I prefer the old-fashioned home-built brick versions but they do lack culinary flexibility. Barbecue Cuisine has more high-tech barbecue accessories, including the Auto-kebab, a battery-operated device that gently rotates the kebabs over the gas or charcoal barbecue. The unit is 11ins by 16ins, costs Pounds 34.99 and can be fitted to most barbecues. It comes with six stainless steel 18ins skewers, battery-operated motor and recipe leaflet. Available at most garden centres. Finally, the nicest parasols I have come across - and even in this country eating out of the doors in the summer requires some kind of protection from the sun if the mayonnaise is not to curdle and the butter to melt - are Rusco's Palladio parasols. They have a simplicity of design and a grandeur of size that makes them entirely different from those flimsy, dinky brightly-coloured numbers that litter most Mediterranean beaches. They are made from double twill canvas treated against mould and damp so that they can be left outside during the summer months and though I prefer the natural colouring they also come in duck-egg blue, denim blue, burnt sienna, yellow, green, brown, red and old rose. There are several sizes: the smallest, at Pounds 175, is 2.5 metres across; while the largest is 5 metres across and costs Pounds 600. The bases, made from seasoned hard wood, range from Pounds 29 to Pounds 98. The umbrellas are all joisted up (easily, so they tell me) by a pull-up rope. They can be seen at Harrods, Heal's and The Conran Shop in London, but you can order a leaflet or the parasol itself by mail from Rusco Marketing, Little Faringdon Mill, Lechlade, Gloucestershire GL7 3QQ. Those with old curtains they wish to sell through The Curtain Exchange shops, mentioned last week, might like to note that they will get 60 per cent of the sale price and the shop keeps 40 per cent.

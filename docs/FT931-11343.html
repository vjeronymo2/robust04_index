			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Jobs: How living costs vary across the globe - Additional data on housing offered to compensate for effects of unusual journalistic problem TODAY the Jobs column must cast modesty aside and reveal that it has of late achieved something probably unparallelled in the history of journalism. Unfortunately, the exploit is not of the professionally acclaimed kind typified by scooping one's competitors by publishing a story before them. My feat is rather the reverse - having another newspaper scoop me with my own material which had already been printed in this one. How it happened perhaps requires some explanation. Readers taking the UK editions of the Financial Times find this column in the Wednesday morning's paper. In the overseas editions, however, it does not appear until the Friday. So it is possible for the London-based staff of foreign newspapers to pick up something I've printed here on a Wednesday, and have their report on it appear in their home country on the Thursday morning, a day ahead of my arrival there. Such was actually done not long ago, it seems, by a Japanese reporter who further complicated the issue by stating that the data in question had been in 'yesterday's' FT. Hence several people unable to find the item telephoned to inquire, only to be still more mystified by being told that for 'yesterday' they should read 'tomorrow'. I tell you all that as an apologetic explanation about the table alongside, containing the latest 'update' of this column's indicators of world-wide living costs. As before, the figures have been kindly supplied by the P-E International management consultancy which has like data on 142 cities. As I have room for only 30, anyone interested in others should contact Simon McBride at Park House, Wick Rd, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW; tel (0)784 434411, fax (0)784 471404. For each city, my table gives three sets of figures. The first is its cost level shown as an index based on London prices at 100. Next is the latest official inflation rate available when P-E compiled the data. The third is the exchange rate at which the foreign currency has been turned into sterling - which is what I'm apologising about, because numerous of the rates have a distinctly antique appearance. They are in fact those which were in force last October when the information on price levels was collected. That in itself matters little because the prices move only slowly. But the opposite has lately applied to exchange rates which, since they affect the cost-index figures, means that most of the indices in the table are antiques too. Although I've tried to bring them up to date, it hasn't been practicable. It turns out that the only source from which I can get all the rates required is the FT Guide to World Currencies which is published on a Tuesday. And for reasons too tediously complicated to mention, I could not do the updating in time to meet the deadline for this column's appearance in the UK editions on Wednesday morning. Now, while that might seem a fair excuse to readers taking those editions, it would hardly do so to people overseas who don't see my efforts until Friday. They might well think I was being unduly lazy. So I decided to explain about the dual publication days in the hope of persuading them differently. Fortunately, despite the snags, the cost-index figures can still be useful. The price data on which they are based should continue to be a tolerable guide to reality until April or so, and the indices can be updated for currency market changes by a simple calculation. Just take the exchange rate in the table, divide it by the rate currently in force, and multiply the result by the table's index figure. Moreover, there is a bit of added compensation. As usual, because of technical difficulties the living-cost indices exclude outlays on housing. But today I can also shed some light on those outlays, thanks to international consultancy Hamptons Relocation. It keeps check on rentals paid by expatriates in 27 countries, and here are its figures for average rentals in 15 (anyone wanting more data should contact Anita Saunders at Cherry Orchard North, Kembrey Park, Swindon, Wilts SN2 6BL; tel (0)793 619555, fax (0)793 534839.) The rent relates to a three-bedroomed unfurnished apartment in a typical expatriate dwelling area, close to international schools. London examples include Richmond as well as central parts such as Kensington and Chelsea. Exchange rates are as at last Friday.  -----------------------------------------------                      Exchange     Monthly City                   rate         rent                      Pounds 1=     Pounds  ----------------------------------------------- Tokyo                 185.50       4,313 Zurich                  2.21       2,262 Vienna                 16.82       2,081 Milan               2,226.75       2,021 London                  1.00       2,000 Madrid                169.90       1,766 New York                1.49       1,678 Paris                   8.10       1,543 Lisbon                216.50       1,386 Oslo                   10.19       1,374 Amsterdam               2.69       1,301 Brussels               49.30       1,217 Stockholm              10.85       1,106 Copenhagen              9.23         975 Helsinki                8.30         964  -----------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------                          Living      Infla-      Exch'ge                           cost        tion        rate                          index      per cent    Pounds 1 =  ----------------------------------------------------------- Japan, Tokyo             161.6        1.7        203.25 Taiwan, Taipei           104.9        7.6         42.95 Malaysia, K Lumpur        85.3        4.4          4.26 Norway, Oslo             147.3        2.0          9.78 Liberia, Monrovia        104.6        4.5          1.70 Qatar, Doha               85.1        3.0          6.25 Congo, Brazzaville       143.4        0.5        405.88 Bahamas, Nassau          104.4        6.6          1.70 Bahrain, Manama           84.0       -0.1          0.65 Sweden, Stockholm        139.2        2.0          9.10 Italy, Milan             103.5        4.7      2,235.50 Tunisia, Tunis            83.5        4.4          1.43 Switzerland, Zurich      133.1        3.5          2.08 UK, London               100.0        3.6          1.00 Australia, Sydney         83.0        0.8          2.35 Denmark, Copenh'n        130.6        2.0          9.29 USA, New York             98.6        3.0          1.70 Thailand, Bangkok         82.7        3.4         42.80 Ivory Cst, Abidjan       129.9        2.1        405.88 Cuba, Havana              97.7        7.0          1.28 Canada, Toronto           82.4        1.3          2.13 France, Paris            122.9        2.6          8.12 S Korea, Seoul            95.3        5.7      1,352.00 Jordan,  Amman            81.8        6.1          1.12 Libya, Tripoli           121.9        4.4          0.44 Israel, Tel Aviv          93.0        8.3          4.24 UAE, Abu Dhabi            81.8        2.0          6.30 Austria, Vienna          120.3        3.9         16.77 Morocco, C'blanca         92.7        6.0         13.50 Ghana, Accra              81.7       10.3        825.00 Belgium, Brussels        119.9        2.3         49.05 Antigua                   92.3        1.0          4.58 UAE, Dubai                81.4        2.0          6.30 Ireland, Dublin          116.5        2.8          0.91 Barbados, Bridget'n       91.9        8.3          3.41 Indonesia, Jakarta        79.6        9.3      3,519.85 Netherlands, Am'd'm      113.6        3.5          2.69 Singapore                 90.9        2.4          2.71 Trinidad, P of Spn        79.3        2.4          7.72 Germany, Frankfurt       112.2        3.6          2.39 Brunei                    90.8        2.5          2.71 Fiji, Suva                77.0        7.1          2.56 Finland, Helsinki        111.3        2.3          7.70 Phillippines, M'ila       90.5        8.5         41.30 Egypt, Cairo              76.2        9.5          5.68 Seychelles, Victoria     111.1        4.6          8.30 USA, Los Angeles          90.2        3.0          1.70 N Zealand, W'ton          74.8        1.1          3.13 Spain, Madrid            109.2        5.8        170.80 S Arabia, Riyadh          88.0       -2.3          6.44 Panama                    73.7        2.3          1.70 Portugal, Lisbon         108.3        9.3        213.75 China, Beijing            87.6       10.0          9.57 Sri Lanka, Colombo        71.3        9.7         74.90 Luxembourg               106.7        3.0         49.05 Oman, Muscat              87.6        1.6          0.66 Czech'vakia, Prague       65.3        9.3         45.16 Hong Kong, Victoria      105.3        9.2         13.17 Malta, Valletta           85.8        2.8          0.51 Pakistan, Karachi         62.7        9.9         42.60  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

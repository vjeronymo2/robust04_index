			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's industrial  production in March increased 4.6 percent from the preceding  month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  said in a revised report Friday [20 May].    The seasonally adjusted production index for the mining and  manufacturing sectors came to 92.7 against a base of 100 for  1990. The growth compares with a 3.3 percent rise in a  preliminary report released in late February, MITI said.    The shipment index, given as 95.3, increased 4.8 percent  from  February, revised upward from a 3.9 percent rise in the  preliminary report.    The inventory index, at 105.4, fell 1.1 percent against a  preliminary 0.8 percent drop.    The index of the inventory-to-sales ratio, at 112.7,  declined  5.3 percent compared with a 4.5 percent fall in the earlier  report.    With the latest statistics, Japan's industrial output has  scored ups and downs alternately in the past eight months.  Before adjustments, March industrial production decreased a  revised 2.1 percent from a year earlier, extending a record  string of year-to-year declines to 30 months. Unadjusted  shipments fell a revised 2.6 percent from a year before and  unadjusted inventories a revised 3.4 percent.</p>

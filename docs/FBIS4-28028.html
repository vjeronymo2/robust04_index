			<p>BFN     [Text] Malacanang [presidential office] is keeping a  hands-off policy on the issue of whether or not to release  captured communist leader Felimon Lagman. President Ramos says  he leaves it up to the court to decide whether or not to free  Lagman.    He made his statement during an audience he gave to the  family of slain Police Chief Inspector Timoteo Zarcal. Zarcal  was killed on 7 May allegedly by the rebel hit squad Alex  Boncayao Brigade [ABB], which Lagman is the alleged head.    Defense Secretary Renato De Villa said earlier the  government  was not inclined to unilaterally release Lagman as it did to  another communist leader Wilma Tiamzon. Tiamzon had been freed  on humanitarian and medical reasons.    Several sectors including Congress have asked for Lagman's  temporary release but military, police, and justice authorities  said they were still evaluating Lagman's case in terms of  security.</p>

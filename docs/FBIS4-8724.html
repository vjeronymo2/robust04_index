			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Franjo Tudjman by unidentified </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina television journalist; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Journalist] Mr. President, I would first like to  thank you on behalf of Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and Television  for being so kind as to set aside some time to grant this -- as  far as I know -- first interview for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio  and Television. Your statements have often been misinterpreted,  you have often been quoted out of context by foreign news  agencies -- there is a great deal of interest among Sarajevans  in the answers you will give to the questions I will try to ask  prior to your announced visit to Sarajevo.    Let us start from the beginning, in other words from the  time  the Republic of Croatia recognized the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina; let me recall that Croatia was the first to  do so. The date was 7 April 1992, two years ago. The  ambassador was appointed that same year, some five or six months  later. This will be your first visit to Sarajevo -- two years  after recognition. In the meantime President Izetbegovic has  visited Croatia quite often. Why is your visit taking place  now, relatively late in the day?    [Tudjman] I would like to ask you why you are asking such a  question. The reason Mr. Izetbegovic visited Zagreb so often  was because Croatia has been, so to speak, the Bosnian  government's mainstay, Bosnia's mainstay in its struggle for  independence. Generally speaking, Croatia has always extended  its hospitality -- whenever Mr. Izetbegovic had to travel to the  West, whenever he had to go somewhere for talks, it was Croatia  that made it possible [changes thought], for Bosnia-Herzegovina  to organize itself for defense against the aggressor.    In such circumstances, the circumstances Bosnia-Herzegovina  was in, Mr. Izetbegovic neither invited me to Bosnia-Herzegovina  nor could I have come under such circumstances. The exact date  of even this prearranged visit cannot be fixed yet, given the  circumstances. So, those are the reasons why I am visiting  Bosnia-Herzegovina now.    I gladly accepted Mr. Izetbegovic's invitation after the  signing of the Washington accords, but the answer to your  question lies in the situation.    [Journalist] When he invited you to visit, President  Izetbegovic stressed that the Republic of Croatia and the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have a good many issues in  common, or rather questions which should be considered together.  In your view, what are these issues?    [Tudjman] Well, above all the question of the revitalization  of the Washington agreement, the agreement on a federation  between the Croatian and Bosniak Muslim nations in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and also the question of the creation of a  confederation between a federal Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.  These are vital questions which are of vital importance both to  the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and to Croatia.    [Journalist] So this will be the focus of your talks when  you  come to Sarajevo in the next few days?    [Tudjman] Certainly.    [Journalist] The Croatian ruling party and you personally --  at least it is understood this way in Sarajevo, and not only in  Sarajevo -- interpret the Washington agreement as the  continuation of your policy. However, I must remind you, again  from Sarajevo's point of view, that in Bosnia-Herzegovina you  often stress that President Izetbegovic personally proposed to  you at one of the Geneva meetings something similar and  virtually the same as what has now been signed in Washington. I  have to ask you directly, why at that time in Geneva did you not  accept these proposals which in Sarajevo they are saying are the  same, while you have now signed them in Washington?    [Tudjman] Because they are not the same proposals. The  Washington agreement reflects the continuity of Croatian policy  toward Bosnia-Herzegovina: allow me to remind you and the public  in Bosnia-Herzegovina of some facts. Croatian policy and I  personally were in favour of realizing the Cutilheiro proposal  -- not only Cutilheiro's proposal, but we also took part in  working out a proposal on a cantonal system for  Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to resolve the war crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina in this way. Croatian policy and I  personally were also in favor of finding a solution to the war  crisis, the political crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the basis  of the Vance-Owen proposal on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina  into provinces.    When all this came to nothing -- and when, in opposition to  the separation of the so-called Srpska republic in Bosnia, the  idea emerged that the Muslims might be organized as a separate  republic and as a separate state in the framework of the program  that emerged in the European conference on the former Yugoslavia  in Bosnia and also in the framework of the reality which was  unfurling in Bosnia- Herzegovina, in other words in the  framework of these ideas of the creation of a union of republics  of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Muslim leadership developed the  idea that it would be better for the Muslims to realize their  own republic, their own separate state.    So to this end, by way of resistance to Serb aggression, and  in this search for a solution to the crisis of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna was also  created.    It was in this context that Mr. Izetbegovic proposed that  they go for a union between the Srpska republic and a unified  Muslim-Croat republic. And this is quite different from the  current agreement on a Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation. In  contrast to this, I was the one who proposed that there be a  confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia and also  the closest cooperation between the republics -- the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Muslim republic. So this  proposal was also put forward at the Berlin meeting.    Europe, Germany, and the world convinced themselves of the  benefits of this proposal and believed that Croatian policy was  in favor of solutions which would be acceptable both to the  Bosniak Muslim people and to the Croatian people, and which  would have provided prospects for the resolution of the crisis  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. So this is something quite different  from the proposal which you mentioned. However, the vital thing  is that we did reach agreement in Washington on the creation of  a Bosniak Muslim-Croatian federation and a confederation with  Croatia.    [Journalist] Mr. President, if you could tell us more -- it  seems we can never stop dwelling on this problem -- what are  currently the most burning issues in relations between Croatia  and Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Tudjman] First of all we should solve certain material  questions. As you know, Croatia has accommodated several  hundred thousand refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina of which more  than half are Muslims, not only Croats. Croatia has had to  allocate vast sums for the accommodation of those refugees, the  education of the children, for extending medical care to the  wounded from Bosnia-Herzegovina. So, we have to solve these  material questions. However, I should say that -- important as  they may be -- these questions are nevertheless marginal  compared to the task of creating conditions for the birth of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and finding the best ways for  setting up confederal relations between Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Croatia in terms of the economy, cultural links, and overall  communal relations in the search for a new international order  in the region of former Yugoslavia and this part of southeast  Europe.    [Journalist] Mr. President, you mentioned the federation,  which has been agreed on at least in principle and in writing.  When could we expect something similar in the case of the  confederation between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Tudjman] The moment the federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina  becomes established and an overall solution to the crisis in  Bosnia- Herzegovina is found.    [Journalist] Mr. President, I must apologize for my  bluntness  but please answer this -- namely, it often happens that  statements made by your associates and you yourself are  construed in Sarajevo as meddling in the internal affairs of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This particularly applies to your  insistence on your concern for your compatriots in the  neighboring country. From the Sarajevan and Bosnia-Herzegovina  point of view, this sometimes seems like interference in  internal affairs. I would like to ask you whether, after  Washington, we in Bosnia-Herzegovina can expect this to become  confined within acceptable boundaries?    [Tudjman] Is what I said about Croatia making it possible  for  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Sarajevo government to organize their  defense with Croatia's help also meddling in internal affairs?  Is the fact that we accepted several hundred thousand refugees  from Bosnia-Herzegovina meddling? Were we interfering when we  were compelled to extend aid to the Croat population to defend  itself against Serb aggression? At that time, when the Muslims  were not yet prepared and when they did not believe the  Yugo-communist army and Serbia and Montenegro would attack  Bosnia, our Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina were prepared  precisely because they knew what was going on and because  Croatia helped them defend themselves.    And something else -- Croatian territory was threatened from  the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina which in the beginning was  not prepared to defend itself from Serbian and Montenegrin and  Yugo-communist aggression. I am not only referring to the  immediate vicinity of Dubrovnik but to all of southern Croatia,  although this especially applies to the regions east of the  Neretva, around Dubrovnik. So, we had to interfere in order to  defend the Croatian Republic as well as to extend aid to the  Croat people who were threatened with genocide, as they truly  were later on, just like the Muslim people.    Therefore, this was no meddling but a result of the crisis  of  the former Yugoslavia, the disintegration of the former  Yugoslavia. What was at issue here was whether or not the whole  of Bosnia- Herzegovina would be devoured by Greater Serbia. In  this context we held talks with Mr. Izetbegovic and other Muslim  leaders. You probably know that in the course of this series of  talks we signed an agreement on 12 July 1992 in which it was  said that the joint efforts against Serb aggression call for  cooperation, including military cooperation in border areas.    Since we are discussing this issue and since you formulated  your question the way you did, I must recall that we in Croatia  even suggested a direct military alliance at the time. However,  the Sarajevo government did not agree to a general military  alliance but only to cooperation in border areas. So, this is  what it was all about, not meddling. Croatia was extending aid  to Bosnia-Herzegovina, not only to the Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina for their defense against Serb aggression;  this was also aid to the Muslims to stand on their feet, to  organize in their opposition to Serb aggression, and all this  was aimed at creating conditions for the preservation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Journalist] Please let me say that it was precisely the  creation of, as we in Bosnia-Herzegovina say, the so-called  Herceg-Bosna that was perceived by the government in Sarajevo  and the presidency as an intention to partition Bosnia. What is  your comment?    [Tudjman] Your question is again based on the wrong  premises.  A little while ago I explained to you that we favored both a  cantonal and a provincial organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  But when this fell through, in the light of what was going on  on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the war, when these  proposals were not accepted by all three sides in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, then it is understandable that we --  contrary to this ambition of the Serbs to isolate themselves as  a separate republic and contrary, as I said, to the intention,  the Muslim leadership's considerable intention to create their  own republic, their own independent Muslim state -- that the  Croats had to start creating their own republic, Herceg-Bosna.  The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna was created in the  resistance to Serbian aggression. Had it not been for this  resistance the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina would have probably,  as I said, fallen into the hands of Greater Serbia.    Hence, this was not a result of Croatia's choice in favor of  Herceg-Bosna's secession. I will tell you one truth, two  truths. We signed an agreement with Mr. Izetbegovic on 14  September 1993 in Geneva and with the Muslim leadership, a  public agreement on cooperation between the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna and the Muslim republic within the framework of a  union. We also signed a secret agreement -- which does not have  to be secret any longer now, given how the situation has evolved  -- an agreement on a confederation of these republics with  Croatia.    On 16 September, however, two days later, the Muslim  leadership signed an agreement with the Serbs which, in fact,  envisaged the break-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina, its carve-up, as  this agreement stated that in the event of the union being  carved up, the rights of the present Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  rights of its membership in the United Nations, would be vested  in a Muslim republic. Consequently, one cannot, there is no  justification, there are no historical and political reasons for  ascribing this intention to the Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia's policies, that Croatia has  favored a break-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina since the beginning [as  heard]. It was not in Croatia's interest to divide  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    I will even tell you one other thing. Highly responsible  people from the Muslim leadership have told me: You can annex  Herceg-Bosna to Croatia, but on condition that central Bosnia  remains within the framework of the Muslim republic. I refused  to accept this. I took into consideration the Croatian people  outside the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna -- the area which had  then been under direct control [as heard] -- and I believed, for  strategic reasons, that more deeply-rooted joint interests  existed than those regarding the annexation of western  Herzegovina, which had been proposed.    All your questions indicate that there is a lack of  understanding and one-sidedness in the way the Bosnian Muslim  public was being informed about Croatia's policy from the very  beginning of the crisis until today. This Croatian policy has  led to what we have achieved [as heard]. Had it not been for  the Croat republic of Hereg-Bosna, which also took others into  consideration -- the leadership of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna included not only people from Herzegovina, but also  those from central Bosnia and Bosnian Posavina -- we would not  have saved these areas, the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina would  not have been possible, and there would not have been an  agreement on the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation and on the  confederation with Croatia. These are the foundations we should  bear in mind, and it is this policy that we should build upon,  and not upon one-sided and false interpretations of the Croatian  policy.    [Journalist] What are real prospects for the full  implementation of the Washington agreement?    [Tudjman] I think the prospects are good because the  Washington agreement succeeded in coordinating Bosniak Muslim  and Croat interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the  interests of Bosniak Muslims and Croats with those of the  Croatian state.    Furthermore, these interests have been adjusted to the  interests of the western world which did not want to allow the  realization of Greater Serbian plans to incorporate  Bosnia-Herzegovina into a Greater Serbia, nor did it allow --  and these tendencies existed -- extremist-fundamentalist  Mujahedin-oriented plans to create an Islamic state in Bosnia  and in Europe.    In this agreement on the Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation  and on the confederation with Croatia, Croat and Muslim  interests coincided with the interests of the Western world to  create the preconditions for a democratic system and for linking  Bosnia-Herzegovina with Western civilization -- contrary to  aspirations to create a Greater Serbia and contrary to certain  extremist notions that a fundamentalist Islamic state could be  created. These are the guarantees for the implementation of  this agreement.    [Journalist] Mr. President, after Geneva, when you and  President Izetbegovic signed one of the Geneva agreements, your  Minister Silajdzic and Minister Granic were set a task to  implement the agreement. After the Washington agreement, are  there any concrete tasks of this kind? Are there any concrete  plans to implement it?    [Tudjman] For Christ's sake, the agreement is being  implemented daily: the POWs have been released, talks are under  way on the organization of federal power in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  plans exist on how to establish the confederation -- it is clear  that this is a matter involving serious politicians dealing with  serious politics and not the ones dealing with policy-mongering,  who are calling into question this agreement beforehand, not  taking into consideration the strategic elements. The problem  of solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina does not only belong  to Croats and Muslims, or to Croats, Muslims, and Serbs, but  also to the eastern and the western world.    [Journalist] Looking at it from the present perspective,  after all these evils we lived through together, what if  anything would you change in your policy toward  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Tudjman] I answered this question when answering all your  previous questions. I would not change anything. I would only  wish to see that ideas about the necessity of the Bosniak  Muslim-Croat alliance prevail in the Bosniak Muslim policy and  that those are eliminated who went as far as claiming that it  was wrong for the Muslims to enter a federation with the Croats.  I would also like to see the revival of the traditions of  Bosniak Muslim leaders -- political and cultural -- who  advocated the idea that the Muslims had historic ties with the  Croatian people through their origins and their language.  Should I perhaps remind you of Safet Bey Basagic [Bosnian  Muslim poet], I may not be able to quote precisely -- who had  even predicted what I have just spoken of, that this is not just  a Croat-Muslim issue, but also the issue of east and west. He  said in one of his verses, I think: The sounds of my Croatian  language can unite the east and the west, can be the food of  both songs and the mind; if I am not mistaken.    I would like these people to come to the fore, the people  who  would nurture that which both Safet Bey Basagic and many other  eminent Muslim political and cultural leaders have been  nurturing. I knew many of them, I was especially fond of Mak  Dizdar [Bosnian Muslim poet]. The same goes for Croats, for  people like Franciscan [Bosnian Croat priest and poet] Grga  Martic who wrote poems and spoke about unity in the interest of  both Bosniak Muslims and Croats. I will try to remeber what  Grga Martic said: There is no hope for a home lacking brotherly  love, and there is no hope for a Bosnia without Croatia.  Therefore this idea has survived despite everything that  happened between the Croats and the Muslims in history. Because  of this division between east and west and because of the  geopolitical links, there is a need for a federation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and for a concept of a confederation. For  this to be achieved, it is necessary for both Muslims and Croats  in Bosnia-Herzegovina to get used to the idea that this is a  historic necessity and that today's world needs it, so that they  could coordinate their actions in this direction and know how to  overcome all minor details which are different and which we  discussed in part in this interview.    [Journalist] Mr. Tudjman, I would like to thank you and ask  you one last question: At one of your regular monthly news  conferences, you said that you would be happy to go to Sarajevo.  Do you still think you would be going there happily?    [Tudjman] I am still happy to go, but I will be going with  the feeling that in this way I would be implementing the policy  which I have been conducting right from the beginning. This  policy has also been advocated by far-sighted people -- both  Croats and Muslims, as I said. I personally have known Croatian  politicians who have played an important role not only in the  political life of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- I am thinking of Dr.  (Barisa Smojan) or Dr. (Juraj Sute) -- but in Croatian politics  generally. I have also known Muslim politicians and cultural  workers.    My visit to Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina will therefore  be  the continuation of the tendencies that unless there is a  resolution of our future as envisaged by the Washington  agreement, there would be no peaceful life together in this part  of southeast Europe, and without this no new international order  would be possible, not only on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia but there would also be no peace in this part of  Europe.    So it is with this sense of the historical necessity of  implementing this agreement, and life together as envisaged in  the Washington agreement, that I am going to Sarajevo, in the  hope that my visit will contribute to the implementation of  these ideas and subsequently to the overcoming, as soon as  possible, of not only the political but also the war crisis we  are faced with at present and which the whole world is concerned  with, and the whole world is requesting that we do this.    [Journalist] Mr. President, thank you for the conversation  and bon voyage to Sarajevo.    [Tudjman] Thank you.</p>

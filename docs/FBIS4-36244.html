			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Ali Jamalu from Damascus] </F>   [Text] Arab League Assistant Secretary General 'Adnan  'Imran has criticized the biased U.S. position which favors  Israel in the ongoing peace operation. He stressed that the  Arab boycott of Israel will continue and will not end until its  goal of making the occupation disappear is reached. Concerning  the Yemeni war, he said the Arab League's position is  illustrated by its call for a cease-fire and resuming dialogue.    In an interview with AL-SAFIR in Damascus, 'Imran commented  on U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent Middle  East tour by saying: "Every effort made by the parties capable  of putting pressure on Israel is welcome. However the role of  sponsor, or intermediary, requires basic specific qualifications  that might prove very important in attaining the desired  objective. The primary qualification is impartiality. If we  examine this point, we will notice a fatal flaw. Israel almost  totally and continuously lives on absolute U.S. backing. In  this connection I wish to express regret over the recent U.S.  arms deals for Israel which seem to suggest that the coming  climate will be one of war, not peace."    'Imran continued: "The seriousness of this issue lies in the  fact that Israel interprets such arms deals as encouragement for  its intransigence, rejection, prevarication, and  procrastination. This is how Israel interprets the U.S.  Administration's unjust and unfair attitude to Syria and several  other Arab countries which the U.S. State Department puts on the  list of countries that support terrorism. This is a  questionable, political list."    The Arab assistant secretary general continued: "This  contravenes the logic of neutrality and balance in relations  that a mediator must possess. At any rate we would like this  mediator's role to continue but would like the U.S. sponsor to  reconsider its attitude."    On the Arab boycott of Israel, 'Imran said: "We do not  boycott Israel for the fun of it. At the same time we do not  want to surrender or abandon Arab rights. This explains our  statement that ending the boycott hinges on ending its causes.  These causes are the occupation and Israel's defiance of the  international community through its continued aggression. When  the cause disappears, the consequence will end. Furthermore,  the boycott is not something we invented. We have merely copied  about five percent of the boycotts carried out by the United  States worldwide with and without justification. We hope that  the boycott will end along with its causes when a just,  comprehensive, and lasting peace is attained and UN resolutions  are implemented.    On Qatar and Oman's hosting of two Israeli delegations,  'Imran said: "We did not arrange these visits. What we stick  by is that all Arab countries, including Qatar and Oman, during  official meetings should affirm their adherence to peace that  leads to withdrawal and ends aggression. They also should not  have any dealings with Israel under any circumstances, as long  as it is an aggressor and occupier and does not adhere to the  stipulations of international law. These are important points  and I believe that no normalization of relations should take  place by any country that adheres to our central cause, be that  from the point of view of patriotism, religion, or heritage. By  this, I mean the Arab and Islamic countries. All occupied  territories must be regained, including Jerusalem, before  normalizing relations with Israel."    'Imran said: "All of Israel's desperate attempts to set up  bridges between it and some Islamic countries must fail. I can  safely say that such bridges are weak and will certainly  collapse. Israel is fooling itself if it believes that it will  realize any gains in this direction. In fact, such a method  will reveal to what extent Israel will indirectly feel that it  is an aggressor and that it has no pride when grovelling for  relations with any of these countries."    On the role the Arab League is playing to stop the Yemeni  war, 'Imran said that the Arab League's initiative did not fail,  but was not complete. "The Arab stand was clear. It demanded a  cease-fire and called for dialogue to preserve the unity of the  Yemeni people."    He added that it was not easy to reach Sanaa. "We overcame  all the difficulties of our objective. There also, our mission  was not easy. The Arab League Secretariat's delegation exerted  its utmost efforts through a series of meetings it held with the  Yemeni leaders. These meetings were crowned by a meeting with  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. The delegation presented the  League's stand, which included a message from the secretary  general to Salih and provided additional explanations of the  Arab stand, as unanimously expressed by the Arab countries  during the extraordinary Arab League session."    The Arab League assistant secretary general said that our  mission's first stop was successful, despite the atmosphere of  fighting which is not constructive. "I cannot make an  evaluation as to whether or not the mission failed at our second  stop, because so far, we have not received a satisfactory or  final answer to the Arab initiative presented by the Arab  League's delegation. We were hoping to get a commitment to a  final cease-fire; however, we realize that situations under such  circumstances cannot be resolved with the ease that we would  like. These difficulties require greater efforts, which is what  the secretary general is currently doing, through his daily  contacts with the Arab leaders to establish a speedy mechanism  for implementing the Arab League Council's resolution issued  during its extraordinary session."    'Imran said: "The Arab initiative has not ended at all. We  hope that the end of the initiative will be when its goals,  which I pointed out earlier, are realized: Immediately halting  the fighting, working on restoring dialogue, and preserving the  unity of Yemen.</p>

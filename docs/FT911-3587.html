			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Australian air sell-off due this year AUSTRALIA'S two gov-ernment-owned airlines are likely to complete the sale of significant shareholdings to overseas investors before the end of the year, airline executives said yesterday. 'We should be able to come to some conclusions within the next two or three months,' said Mr Ted Harris, chairman of Australian Airlines, the government-owned domestic carrier. The government plans to sell 100 per cent of Australian Airlines, of which 40 per cent will be placed with overseas buyers, with a ceiling of 25 per cent on individual foreign shareholdings. It also wants to sell 49 per cent of Qantas, the international flag carrier, of which 35 per cent will be placed with overseas airlines. The balance of the shares will probably be floated later. Qantas and Ansett Australia, the domestic airline owned jointly by TNT and News Corporation, will be barred from buying shares in Australian Airlines. Both government-owned airlines are to be recapitalised before the sales go-ahead, probably through the assumption of debt by the government in return for shares. The detailed plans for the sales, announced in statements by Mr Ralph Willis, finance minister, and Mr Kim Beazley, transport minister, are largely in line with privatisation proposals announced in December. However, the government rejected a request from the Qantas board for permission to acquire up to 25 per cent of Australian Airlines to protect its access to domestic traffic. Officials said ministers rejected the proposal because it would have undermined the privatisation of Australian Airlines, and blurred the division between domestic and international operations. The decision angered Qantas, which said it would be placed at a competitive disadvantage to foreign airlines. 'It is difficult to understand why Qantas has been specifically excluded from participation in any form in domestic aviation in Australia while its foreign competitors are being encouraged to do just that,' said Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman. The government's decision to recapitalise the airlines in advance of the sale of shares will increase their attractiveness to investors by reducing the high gearing both have incurred as a result of re-equipment programmes. The extent of the recapitalisation has not been determined, but Mr Beazley said last year that repairing the airlines' balance sheets would cost around ADollars 600m (USDollars 465m) for Qantas and ADollars 300m for Australian Airlines. Qantas is understood to have had talks with British Airways, Japan Air Lines, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, of the US, and Garuda, the Indonesian flag carrier. The same airlines head the list of potential shareholders in Australian Airlines, but the government is unlikely to allow airlines to acquire holdings in both Qantas and Australian.</p>

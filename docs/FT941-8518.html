			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / US ambassador takes hard line with Tokyo Mr Walter Mondale, the US ambassador in Tokyo, yesterday indicated mounting frustration at the US-Japan trade impasse, but stressed that the two powers' political and security relations must not be harmed. 'We're waiting for Japan to take the initiative to open its market. We have said, and we mean it, that the status quo is unacceptable,' he said. Mr Mondale had earlier supported attempts to strike a compromise with Japan on government procurement, an important aspect of the trade dispute, but without success. The hardening in his stance directly influences the US position, since Mr Mondale, a former US vice president, has a closer relationship with US president Bill Clinton than is usual for ambassadors. Washington would continue to insist on numerical measures to gauge the increase in foreign goods' market share, said Mr Mondale. 'I don't want to hint that we're willing to get off indicators. We have to have some way to measure progress,' he said. Despite the growing disarray of Japan's seven-party coalition, Washington would keep up the pressure. 'At some point, nations have to do business with each other,' said Mr Mondale. He would not speculate whether the deadlock would be loosened by the Japanese government's latest plans to improve access for imports, expected to be unveiled shortly, but warned: 'We need and must have a response that opens this market in a decent interval,' he said. The Japanese government plans to draw up market opening emergency plans, possibly in time for the meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Frankfurt next Saturday. 'The ball is in Japan's court,' admitted Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary. The measures are expected to include simplified import procedures, promotions of imports and foreign investment, more open government procurement and tougher anti-trust rules.</p>

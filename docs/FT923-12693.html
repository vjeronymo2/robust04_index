			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Special Report on Property Management (3): New sources of profit - Corporate portfolios Some of the UK's largest property portfolios are in the hands of commercial and industrial companies. For instance, according to a recent report from surveyor Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, the UK corporate sector owns as much as Pounds 225bn worth of property. This compares with the Pounds 60bn total for the traditional property investors - the institutions. But despite the fact that, in some business sectors, property accounts for more than 50 per cent of all tangible assets in the balance sheets, in all too many cases it is still seen as an incidental, generating costs but with little value, rather than as an asset which requires active management. Attitudes are, however, changing, partly because of sheer necessity to control costs in a continuing recession, and partly because of the evolution of management techniques. In addition, some larger organisations are adopting pro-active management approaches aimed not only at controlling costs, but also at releasing not inconsiderable value, to produce a much-needed boost to the bottom line of the corporate balance sheet. Of the big clearing banks, Barclays reckons it is ahead of the field in this respect. In January 1991 it set up a new company, Barclays Property Holdings (BPH) to run its Pounds 1bn plus property portfolio. The rationale was that the bank's very valuable portfolio should not only generate a return, but also that property should be a source of potential profit instead of a cost centre, says Mr David Turner, BPH managing director. BPH controls some 3,000 individual properties: a branch network of some 2,400, together with a core investment portfolio containing some 400 properties. The company acts as landlord to the branches and other bank operations. There are no formal leases; instead, BPH tenants are governed by documents governing terms and conditions of occupancy. But in practice, says Mr Turner, the relationship is very similar to that of any other tenant with its landlord. Rents, fixed at market levels, are reviewed every five years. In addition to rent, BPH also generates income through fees - again charged at market rates - for services such as alteration to and fitting or re-fitting of branches. BPH will also take a developer's profit when appropriate. For example, it developed 150,000 sq ft of offices in three buildings at Westwood Business Park just outside Coventry, when an operational decision was taken to re-locate 1,000 Barclays jobs. BPH's flagship development is the 300,000 sq ft redevelopment at 54 Lombard Street in the City of London. Here, too, Mr Turner says that BPH is building as a developer, not as an owner occupier. The building is on time and on budget for completion to shell and core by late April next year. The decision to go for this type of finish was taken, says Mr Turner, on property investment rather than occupational criteria. The bank will occupy three quarters of the building; the remainder will be let to outside tenants. Careful analysis of the portfolio has also led to strategic sales, amounting to some Pounds 40m of this so far. In days when covenant strength is a prerequisite for property investors, BPH is in an enviable position to do sale and leaseback transactions where the bank is the sitting tenant - although the individual property does not fit the company's long term investment strategy. BPH made Pounds 24m pre-tax profit last year from a combination of rental income and consultancy income. Consultancy, Mr Turner reckons, should contribute a growing proportion of profits as the company offers its range of expertise and services to outsiders in competition with firms of surveyors, architects and other professionals at, of course, market rates. Total staff numbers are 188 - only 12 on the investment side, the rest in development and consultancy. There are also some 500 staff engaged in day to day facilities management for which Mr Turner is also responsible. (This activity, however, is subject to an on-going review, with an increasing number of services likely to be sourced externally at a lower cost.) Not only the clearing banks, but also several of the high street multiple retailers are sitting on large, valuable, property portfolios. Some of these are now looking to maximise the value of their assets, and none more so than Boots, which formed Boots Properties in 1989 in order to increase the return on a portfolio which represents something in the order of 60 per cent of the group's net assets. The company, now a separate division within the group, organised so as to reflect the strategic individual functions of operational estate management and property asset management, holds the freeholds or long leaseholds of some 900 properties; last revalued (in 1989) at Pounds 889m. This compares with a total of 2,350 properties actually occupied by the group in the UK. As with Barclays, Boots Properties' in-house occupiers are not subject to formal leases. Nevertheless, the occupancy agreements arranged in-house place landlords and tenants in a relationship broadly similar to that of their open market counterparts. The agreements provide for reviews of the modern rent charge of one fifth of the portfolio every year. Reviews are to reflect market rents and may be upwards or downwards. A nine month notice provision offers the retail occupier flexibility should he or she wish to cease trading from the property. Under Mr Mike Rudell, Boots Properties managing director (and a Boots PLC main board director), the company concentrates on three areas of operation: investment, development and finance/systems. Mr Peter Baguley, who leads the investment team, says that great emphasis is placed on research, using discounted cash flow techniques and a rental forecasting model developed jointly with Jones Lang Wootton, surveyors. In addition to such detailed, location-specific research, Mr Baguley also believes that Boots Properties has a distinct advantage over other property investors when making decisions to buy or sell, because it also has access to retailer performance data. As he points out, retailer profitability drives rental growth - a key component of property investment performance. Boots Properties sticks to what it knows best. Investments are restricted to the retail sector which, Mr Baguley says, is generally underpinned. Over the last three years the company has been a net investor, committing some Pounds 40m annually. Some of the money has gone towards consolidating existing ownerships in towns such as Canterbury, Winchester and Lincoln. But new investments have been made in multi-occupied properties such as the Magnolia Centre in Exmouth and retail parks in Burnley and Bromborough in the Wirral. In its development activities Boots Properties, with financial backing from the group, clearly has more than a competitive edge in the current market. Here again local market research is an essential ingredient, according to Mr Tony Edwards, development director. Recent completions include a 120,000 sq ft fully-let retail park at Castle Meadow, Nottingham. And in Glasgow the former Boots the Chemist store at the corner of Argyll and Union Streets has been redeveloped to provide new stores for Dillons, Kentucky Fried Chicken and a small Boots branch among others. Last year the company was selected as developer for Caerphilly town centre where a total of 135,000 sq ft of floorspace is planned - to include a big supermarket, some 30 smaller shops and parking for 600 cars. Last month Boots Properties announced trading profits of Pounds 69.5m for the year to March; a 15.5 per cent increase on the previous year. And it looks well placed to be in an enviable position when the property market finally improves.</p>

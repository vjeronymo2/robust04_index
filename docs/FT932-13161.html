It warned that their profits would be dampened for several years by bad debts.

The banks with the best rating are DKB, Mitsubishi Bank, Sanwa Bank and the Bank of Tokyo, which all have Aa3 rating.

The long-term ratings of the bank's guaranteed international subsidiaries were lowered to A1 from Aa3. Fuji Bank's long-term debt and deposits were downgraded to A1 from Aa3.

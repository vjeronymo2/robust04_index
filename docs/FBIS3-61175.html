The volume of  imports fell off by 47 percent in current prices and amounted to  R19.8 billion. The positive foreign trade balance of the  Commonwealth countries as a whole increased from $2.6 billion in  January-October 1992 to $17.8 billion over the corresponding  period of 1993.    The main foreign trade partners of almost all Commonwealth  countries are the European Union countries, the United States,  China, and Japan, which account for 60 percent of all  export-import operations.    The most important commodities which form the bulk of the  countries' exports (more than 80 percent of exports) remain  mineral products (crude oil, products of oil refining, natural  gas), machine building (electric machinery and means of  transportation) and chemical industry (mineral or chemical  fertilizer) products, nonprecious metals (nonferrous metals and  items made of them), as well as textile and textile items  (cotton fiber). Prevalent among imports are machine building  products, products of plant origin, ready-to-use food products,  and the chemical industry output; these commodity groups account  for 70 percent of imports.    As of 1 November of this year, employment services of the  Commonwealth countries had 1.5 unemployed persons looking for  work registered with them. The number of job vacancies reported  by enterprises to the employment service amounted to 800,000.  The correlation between supply and demand in the labor market in  the Commonwealth countries changed in October as compared with  the beginning of the year as follows (in thousands of persons):                  Total Number of Unemployed   Of That, Those Granted      Enterprises' Labor Needs                                             the Status of Unemployed    Reported to Employment                                                                         Services                 January    October           January    October          January    October   Azerbaijan    35.0       43.9              6.9        18.8             10.4       11.8   Armenia       67.8       105.7             61.8       98.6             0.9        5.4   Belarus       31.4       65.8              31.4       65.8             20.6       20.0   Kazakhstan    ...        ...               35.6       39.1             43.4       56.5   Kyrgyzstan    6.0        8.0               1.9        3.2              4.4        4.4   Moldova       19.7       13.8              14.2       10.8             1.1        0.8   Russia        1,028.8    994.2             628.0      728.4            301.1      453.0   Tajikistan    31.0       108.4             8.6        18.0             1.0        18.9   Uzbekistan    23.9       31.3              10.8       14.1             22.0       32.2   Ukraine       143.7      128.8[.sup]1[/]    73.2       78.7[.sup]1[/]    126.6      184.4[.sup]1[/]   [.sup]1[/] September      On the average in the Commonwealth, 70 percent of nonworking  persons had the status of unemployed; of them, in Azerbaijan 73  percent, Armenia--93 percent, Belarus--100 percent,  Kyrgyzstan--40 percent, Moldova--78 percent, Russia--73 percent,  Tajikistan--17 percent, and Uzbekistan--45 percent.    There were 3.7 nonworking persons per job vacancy in  Azerbaijan as compared with 3.4 in January; in Armenia,  respectively, 19.7 and 74.6; Belarus--3.3 and 1.5;  Kyrgyzstan--1.8 and 1.3; Moldova--18.3 and 18.5; Russia--2.2 and  3.4; Tajikistan--5.7 and 32.6; and Uzbekistan--1.0 and 1.1.    Of persons with the status of unemployed, 57 percent  received  unemployment benefits.  <H5>  Industry </H5>   As compared with the corresponding month of last year, the  total volume of industrial production in the Commonwealth in  October fell off by 13.9 percent in comparable prices. The  average daily output in October declined as compared with  October of last year by 11.8 percent; as compared with September  of this year (eliminating seasonal fluctuations in production),  it increased by 1 percent.    Overall, over January-October the total volume of industrial  production was 14.8 percent lower than that over January-October  of 1992, and the average daily output--13.9 percent lower (there  were fewer working days this year than last). As compared with  January-October of 1991, the industrial output declined by 30  percent.    Production of consumer goods in sale prices on average in  the  Commonwealth declined by 9 percent as compared with  January-October of last year. The output of foodstuffs declined  by 11 percent, alcoholic beverages--by 2 percent, and nonfood  items--by 9 percent, including light industry output by 14  percent, and cultural and household goods by 6 percent. Food  products account for 46 percent of the total volume of consumer  goods production, nonfood items--48 percent, and alcoholic  beverages--about 6 percent.    Changes in the production of consumer goods over  January-October 1993 as compared with the level of the  corresponding period of 1992 in the Commonwealth countries are  characterized by the following data (in percents):                           Consumer    Including:               Of Them                         Goods                                      Foodstuffs    Nonfood    Light       Cultural,                                                   Items      Industry    Personal,                                                              Goods       and                                                                          Household                                                                          Items   Azerbaijan             89          92            96         92          99   Armenia                72          53            78         78          77   Belarus                97          92            100.1      98          102   Kazakhstan             88          85            92         93          91   Kyrgyzstan             79          75            86         93          77   Moldova                86          85            99.8       100.8       99   Russia                 89          89            89         79          93   Tajikistan             88          92            86         87          82   Turkmenistan           105         103           108        114         81   Uzbekistan             112         107           117        116         121   Ukraine                80          78            81         77          84  (January-September)      As compared with January-October 1991, the output of  consumer  goods on average in the Commonwealth declined by 25 percent,  including in Russia--by 26 percent; in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan,  and Moldova--by 32-35 percent; Kyrgyzstan--by 47 percent; and  Armenia--by two-thirds.    The output of foodstuffs has declined. Industrial production  of meat in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan was lower than over  January-October of 1992 by 8 percent; in Belarus and Russia--by  16 percent; and in Moldova--by 37 percent. The output of whole  milk products in Russia declined by 17 percent, Kazakhstan--by  36 percent, and Kyrgyzstan--by 41 percent. The output of  vegetable oil, commercial edible fish products, flour, macaroni  items, and cereals has declined in most Commonwealth countries.    Production of the main varieties of light industry products  has declined. On average in the Commonwealth as compared with  January-October of last year, the output of all varieties of  fabrics fell off by 26 percent, and footwear--by 25 percent. In  Russia, the output of fabrics fell off by 32 percent; the output  of footwear declined in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan by  30-33 percent.    The output of certain categories of complex home appliances  increased somewhat in a number of states. Production of  television sets, refrigerators, and freezers in Russia increased  by 11 percent as compared with the level of last year's  January-October. The output of washing machines in Uzbekistan  and Belarus increased by 14-15 percent, and in Moldova--by 26  percent. Kazakhstan produced 17 percent more tape recorders, and  Moldova--13 percent more refrigerators and freezers. At the same  time, production of some categories of these items declined as  compared with January-October 1992: The output of tape recorders  in Russia declined by 16 percent and of radio receivers by 28  percent; in Belarus, the output of tape recorders declined by 33  percent and television sets--by 24 percent; and in Kazakhstan,  that of washing machines by 24 percent.    Electric power generation in January-October across the  Commonwealth declined by 6 percent as compared with the  corresponding period of 1992, including in Armenia--by 31  percent, in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan--by 10 percent, and in  Turkmenistan--by 8 percent.    Coal production over 10 months declined in Russia by 10  percent, and in Kazakhstan--by 11 percent, including that of  coking coal--by 14 percent and 11 percent. Gas production in  Russia was 4 percent below that of the corresponding period of  last year, while this figure rose 4 percent in Uzbekistan and 18  percent in Turkmenistan. As compared with January-October of  1992, the output of oil in the Commonwealth has declined,  including in Russia by 13 percent, in Kazakhstan by 10 percent,  and in Turkmenistan by 14 percent. The decrease in production of  oil led to reduced volumes being refined and reduced output of  basic petroleum products. On the average across the  Commonwealth, primary refining of oil decreased by 16 percent,  the output of automotive gasoline by 15 percent, diesel fuel by  16 percent, and furnace fuel oil by 14 percent. In Belarus the  output of automotive gasoline declined by 33 percent, diesel  fuel by 34 percent, and furnace fuel oil by 38 percent; in  Turkmenistan, these indices were 23 percent, 31 percent, and 33  percent, respectively. Production of the main categories of  petroleum products in Uzbekistan increased as compared with last  year's levels.    The output of finished rolled ferrous metals decreased by 7  percent as compared with January-October of last year. The  decline in the total volume of production in machine building  has not been halted. Output of metal-cutting machine tools in  Kazakhstan fell off by 25 percent, in Russia by 18 percent, and  in Belarus by 14 percent; of drop forges by 19 percent, 55  percent, and 68 percent, respectively. Production output of  tractors in Russia declined by 25 percent, in Uzbekistan by 36  percent, and in Kazakhstan by 59 percent.    The lag in production of chemical products continues. Output  of mineral fertilizer declined over 10 months in Russia by 21  percent, Belarus by 34 percent, and Kazakhstan by 68 percent.  There was a 25-percent decline in production of chemical thread  and fibers in Russia as compared with January-October of last  year; the output of calcinated soda declined by 24 percent, and  of caustic soda--by 22 percent. In Belarus the output of  chemical thread and fibers declined by 22 percent, and of  synthetic resins and plastics--by 23 percent. Production of  construction materials has declined. For instance, the output of  cement on the average across the Commonwealth--and in  Russia--declined by 20 percent; in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan--by  35-39 percent; and in Tajikistan--by half.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   In a number of Commonwealth countries grain crops remained  unharvested on a considerable area; part of the potato and  vegetable crops also perished, which may be seen from the  following data for the Commonwealth on the whole (in millions of  hectares):                         Area Sown         Harvested          Unharvested Area,                       (Planted) With    (Threshed) as of   thousands of                       1993 Crops        1 November 1993    hectares   Grain crops          93.2              89.1               3,756  (without corn)   Sunflower            4.4               3.6                762   Sugar beet           2.9               2.8                156  (industrial)   Potatoes             1.3               1.2                118   Vegetables           0.7               0.5                116      In Russia, more than 3 million hectares of grain crops  remained unharvested (81 percent of the total unharvested grain  crops area in the Commonwealth countries), as well as 621,000  hectares of sunflower (81 percent), 66,000 hectares of sugar  beet (42 percent), 78,000 hectares of potatoes (66 percent), and  42,000 hectares of vegetables (36 percent). By 1 November,  considerable acreage of grain crops and sunflowers remained  unharvested in Kazakhstan--410,000 and 86,000 hectares,  respectively; and in Ukraine--176,000 and 43,000 hectares.    Overall across the Commonwealth, the total yield of grain  from the threshed area (in initial book weight) amounted to  174.3 million tonnes (not counting corn), which is 12.6 million  tonnes less (by 7 percent) than of the same date in 1992. The  average yield of grain per hectare of threshed area amounted to  19.6 quintals as compared with 20.2 quintals in 1992.    By the middle of November, 50.2 million tonnes of grain had  been delivered to grain procurement facilities (99 percent of  last year's level). As compared with 1992, grain procurement  increased in all Commonwealth states except Kazakhstan and  Armenia. In Russia, 26 million tonnes of grain had been procured  (8 percent more than in 1992); in Ukraine--14 million tonnes (28  percent) more; and in Belarus--1.7 million tonnes (4 percent)  more. Grain procurement in Kazakhstan amounted to 6 million  tonnes (49 percent of last year's level).    Below are data on procurement of other agricultural crops in  the Commonwealth states as of 22 November (in millions of  tonnes):                            1992            1993            1993 as a                                                          Percentage of 1992   Sugar beet              39.0            39.0            99.9  (industrial)   Raw cotton (total)      6.01            6.33            105   including fine-fiber    0.46            0.35            77  variety   Potatoes                4.2             2.8             66   Vegetables              5.3             5.6             106      In the total volume of sugar beet procurement, root-crops  purchased from Ukrainian farms account for 76 percent, and from  Russian farms--19 percent.    Procurement of raw cotton from main cotton-growing regions  is  characterized by the following data (in thousands of tonnes):                            1992             1993             1993 as a                                                            Percentage of 1992   Azerbaijan              335              282              84   Tajikistan              300              498              166   Turkmenistan            1,283            1,339            104   Uzbekistan              4,042            4,175            103      In most Commonwealth states the winter crops sowing for the  1994 harvest and fall plowing has decreased as compared with  1992. By the beginning of November throughout the Commonwealth  states winter crops at the farms were sown on the area of 28.3  million hectares, which is 3.9 million hectares, or 12 percent  less, than as of this date in 1992. Fall plowing has been  completed on the area of 60.6 million hectares, which is less  than last year by 7.2 million hectares, or 11 percent.    Winter crops sowing and fall plowing in the Commonwealth  states as of 1 November are characterized by the following data  (in thousands of hectares):                    Winter Crops Sown                 Fall Plowing Completed                   1992      1993      1993 as a     1992      1993      1993 as a                                      Percentage                        Percentage                                      of 1992                           of 1992   Azerbaijan      449       425       95            ...       ...       ...

At the same time, as compared with last year, the  rate of production decline slowed down somewhat. For instance,  while over January-October of 1992 production of meat had fallen  off by 22 percent as compared with the analogous period of the  preceding year, that of milk--by 19 percent, and that of  eggs--by 16 percent, over January-October of this year as  compared with 1992 these indices measured at, respectively, 15  percent, 8 percent, and 10 percent.    Overall over the elapsed 10 months in the Commonwealth as a  whole, agricultural enterprises produced 9.8 million tonnes of  meat (in live weight), 45.9 million tonnes of milk, and 33.8  billion units of eggs. This is less than the volume produced  over the analogous period of 1992: meat--by 1.8 million tonnes  (by 15 percent); milk--by 4 million tonnes (by 8 percent); and  eggs--by 3.9 billion units (by 10 percent).    The volume of animal husbandry products output at  agricultural enterprises in the Commonwealth states over  January-October has changed as follows (in thousands of tonnes):                           Meat (in Live     Milk                Eggs (million                         Weight)                               units)                          1992     1993     1992      1993      1992      1993   Azerbaijan             64       44       200       144       223       101   Armenia[.sup]1[/]       10       2        12        5         76        9   Belarus                974      852      3,613     3,234     1,698     1,721   Kazakhstan             837      800      2,277     2,213     1,680     1,513  (January-September)   Kyrgyzstan: all        310      296      818       772       501       336  categories of farms   including              107      82       321       253       270       132  agricultural  enterprises   Moldova                150      108      627       441       378       211   Russia                 6,293    5,436    29,076    27,071    26,002    24,095   Tajikistan             40       30       170       107       218       97   Turkmenistan           63       75       182       187       146       116   Uzbekistan             202      187      807       809       815       669   Ukraine                2,811    2,100    12,688    11,400    6,163     5,100   [.sup]1[/] Without peasant (private) farms, which account for more than 90  percent of the total volume of agricultural production      Overall in the Commonwealth in January-October of the  current  year, the state has purchased fewer products from all categories  of farms than over the same period in 1992: livestock and  poultry (in live weight)--by 1.8 million tonnes (by 17 percent);  milk--by 3.4 million tonnes (by 8 percent); and eggs--by 1  billion units (by 3 percent).  <H5>  Construction </H5>   In the 10 months of the current year, state enterprises and  organizations across the Commonwealth completed the construction  of about 20 million square meters of housing, which amounts to  90 percent of that over the corresponding period of last year,  as well as general education schools for 374,400 pupil  accommodations (98 percent), preschool facilities for 59,400  accommodations (66 percent), hospitals with 12,100 beds (128  percent), and outpatient facilities for 31,500 visits per shift  (91 percent).

Only in  Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, where for a long time state  regulation of prices for a number of basic necessities remained  in effect, did the rate of consumer price increases and the  population's monetary income remain approximately the same.  <H5>  Prices </H5>   On the average across the Commonwealth, wholesale prices of  industrial enterprises in January-October were 10.8 times as  high as those over the corresponding period of last year. As  compared with September of this year, wholesale prices in  October increased by 23 percent.    In October, prices for consumer goods continued to rise in  all Commonwealth states.

In Turkmenistan,  Tajikistan, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and  Belarus prices for foodstuffs increased over this period  1.1-1.4-fold, and for nonfood items--1.2-1.5-fold.    Prices rise faster in major industrial centers and capitals  of the Commonwealth states. For instance, as registered on 2  November, beef prices in Almaty stores rose 2.5-fold over just  one month (as compared with 7 September), in Minsk--2.2-fold,  Tashkent--twofold, and Novosibirsk--1.5-fold. Prices for butter  increased 1.3-1.6-fold in Chisinau, Nizhniy Novgorod, Volgograd,  Chelyabinsk, Yekaterinburg, and Novosibirsk, and 1.8-2.4-fold in  Tashkent, Almaty, Bishkek, and Minsk; prices for vegetable oil  increased 1.8-2.2-fold in Almaty, Bishkek, St. Petersburg, and  Voronezh, 3.4-fold in Minsk, and fivefold in Chisinau. Prices  for rye bread in Moscow went up 2.1-fold, Chelyabinsk--2.2-fold,  and Novosibirsk--2.4-fold; and for wheat bread--1.9-2.5-fold in  Kazan, Novosibirsk, Moscow, and Tashkent.    In Ashgabat the greatest rises in regulated prices for basic  foodstuffs were registered with respect to sugar--almost  ninefold--as well as for beef, vegetable oil, butter, and  milk--by a factor of 10-12.5, and for wheat bread made of  highest grade wheat flour--20-fold.    Seasonal price increases at city markets in October as  compared with September amounted to 21-39 percent in Kyrgyzstan,  Moldova, Armenia, and Uzbekistan; and 44-46 percent in Belarus  and Kazakhstan; in Turkmenistan, prices at city markets almost  doubled. On average on the territory of Russia prices at city  markets rose by 17 percent.    Overall in January-October as compared with the same period  of last year, prices for agricultural products at city markets  in Azerbaijan, Moldova, Russia, and Kazakhstan increased by a  factor of 11.3-13; in Belarus, Armenia, and Uzbekistan--by a  factor of 13.4-13.7; in Kyrgyzstan--almost 20-fold; and in  Ukraine--by a factor of 33.4.

The greatest  price increases were registered in Tajikistan (by 54.6 percent  and 15.8-fold, respectively) and Belarus (by 50.3 percent and  22.6-fold). Prices increased with respect to all categories of  paid services. Prices went up the most with respect to services  that represent basic necessities--municipal services, passenger  transportation, consumer services, and preschool child care.

The greatest  price increases occurred in Belarus (19.7-fold and by 47.6  percent, respectively) and Tajikistan (18.5-fold and 24.3  percent), and the smallest--in Uzbekistan (10.4-fold and 28.7  percent) and Azerbaijan (10.8-fold and 16.8 percent).  <H5>  Trade and Services </H5>   Over the elapsed 10 months the volume of retail turnover  (including public catering) in current prices across the  Commonwealth increased 9.1-fold as compared with the same period  of last year; its physical volume (in comparable prices)  declined by 4.8 percent as compared with January-October of last  year, and by 36.6 percent as compared with the same period of  1991. In most Commonwealth states the cost of retail commodity  turnover rose as a result of higher prices.    Some consumer goods are sold by individuals outside of  officially registered trade. The volume of such sales in Russia,  for instance, amounted to an estimated R1.9 trillion over  January-October of this year, which comprises 7.6 percent of the  total trade turnover in the republic.

As of 1 November the value of current inventories of  consumer  goods in the retail trade network of the Commonwealth countries  measured at about R8 trillion and could sustain trade for 44  days (based on average daily turnover in October) as compared  with 42 days as of the same date last year. Inventory levels in  the trade sector fluctuated between 35-38 days in Armenia,  Moldova, and Ukraine, and 43-46 days in Russia, Belarus, and  Kazakhstan to 63-74 days in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and  Turkmenistan, 86 days in Kyrgyzstan, and 104 days of trade in  Azerbaijan.    The value of realized paid services in the Commonwealth as a  whole amounted to R3.8 trillion and was higher than that in  January-October of last year in current prices and rates by a  factor of 10, while in comparable prices and rates it declined  by one-quarter.

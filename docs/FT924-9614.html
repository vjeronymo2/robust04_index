			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / BT poised to sell shares in McCaw Cellular to AT&amp;T BRITISH Telecommunications will sell its 22 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications of the US if moves by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph to buy a 33 per cent stake in McCaw are successful. AT&amp;T is negotiating a Dollars 3.8bn deal as part of a broad alliance. If the alliance goes ahead it will represent a dramatic plunge by AT&amp;T, the largest long-distance telecommunications company in the US, into the rapidly growing wireless communications market, which is dominated, apart from the independent McCaw, by large local telephone companies. It will also take AT&amp;T back into the local telecommunications market which it left in 1984 under a court-ordered break-up, which spun off from it seven local 'Baby Bell' telephone companies. For McCaw - an entrepreneurial company which has grown extremely fast from modest origins to become the biggest company in the US cellular telephone market - the alliance opens up great opportunities to tap the brand name and technological resources of AT&amp;T. It will also get a Dollars 2bn cash infusion which will allow it to pay the Dollars 5.3bn of debt on its balance sheet. The two companies yesterday claimed that the pact would speed up the development in the US of the first seamless wireless communications network  -allowing cellular subscribers to communicate easily with other parties anywhere else in the nation. Mr Barry Romeril, finance director of British Telecom, which bought its stake in McCaw in 1989, said McCaw and AT&amp;T were complimentary and AT&amp;T would not be affected, as BT had been, by US regulatory restraints on foreign ownership. 'This is an excellent opportunity for BT to realise shareholder value from its investment,' he added. BT, which bought its 35.8m class A and B stock for Dollars 41.50 a share, would sell at Dollars 49. AT&amp;T would pay McCaw Dollars 42 a share for a further 47m newly issued shares and would have the right to later acquire control of the group from Mr Craig McCaw, its chairman. The two sides hope to complete the deal in the first or second quarters of next year. Before news of the deal McCaw shares were suspended yesterday at Dollars 26  3/4 , up Dollars 2  1/8 . AT&amp;T shares closed down Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 42 3/4 .</p>

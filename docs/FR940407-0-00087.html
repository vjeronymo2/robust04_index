			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Monitoring, Recordkeeping, Reporting (MRR)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rules were based on the premise that EIP's depend more strongly than traditional control programs on MRR to ensure compliance and to allow for adequate enforcement because they are inherently more flexible and less prescriptive than traditional technology or performance standards. The proposal recognized that while a wide range of MRR approaches are available that can be used to show compliance for different types of sources, no one approach is necessarily the most appropriate, or even technically feasible, for all types of sources that may be included in an EIP. Thus, the proposal explicitly allowed for alternative monitoring methods, while soliciting comments on criteria for adequate MRR requirements for EIP's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comments focused on whether EIP's do depend more strongly on MRR and on whether CEM's should be required for any or all sources covered by an EIP. Several industry commenters disagreed with the premise that EIP's depend more strongly on MRR to ensure compliance, and, therefore, felt that no more stringent MRR requirements should be required in EIP's than those required in traditional programs. These commenters supported the provision allowing a range of MRR requirements to be used in EIP's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One State commented that EIP's should be limited to source categories for which emission quantification and compliance methods are available and reasonably accurate. This State felt that the use of CEM's was the optimal monitoring method, although it recognized that other unit-specific field monitoring methods could be acceptable. An environmental group commented that the rules should require use of the most accurate available CEM's on every source involved in any emissions trading program. Further, this group felt that the maximum amount of CEM measurement inaccuracy should be reflected in a program discount factor. On the other hand, some industry commenters urged that EIP's not require the use of CEM's for any sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rules retain the proposed flexibility for alternative monitoring approaches that allow for adequate compliance determinations and provide for effective State and Federal enforcement. As discussed above (see paragraph IV.D.1.), innovation and flexibility would be unduly restricted if CEM's were a prerequisite for all sources in any emissions trading program. In the development of adequate MRR requirements, criteria should be considered to assure that quality-assured, representative monitoring data will be obtained that can be used to determine compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA recognizes that special consideration should be given to developing MRR requirements for small sources to avoid undue burdens, consistent with assuring that all EIP sources are required to comply with adequate and effective MRR requirements. For mobile source programs, the State should refer to program-specific guidance from EPA, if applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. State Implementation Plan (SIP) Creditability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rules identify various types of uncertainties associated with different categories of EIP's, and required that States apply discount factors in calculating SIP credit based on the uncertainties inherent in the design of any given EIP. The proposal separately addressed compliance-related uncertainty, through a rule compliance factor, and programmatic uncertainties associated with quantification methods and projected market responses, through a program uncertainty factor. The proposal compared the need for a rule compliance factor to the historical use of a rule effectiveness factor, generally set at 80 percent for traditional stationary source SIP programs. The proposal identified an option of setting presumptive norms for these factors in lieu of the requirement that the State develop and justify program-specific factors. The proposal solicited comments on criteria for the development of such factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters expressed different concerns with the proposed approach to dealing with uncertainty. Some commenters interpreted the proposal as allowing credit only for emission-limiting programs (e.g., emission trading), and argued that credit should be allowed for market-response programs (e.g., emission fees) and even directionally-sound programs (e.g., those that benefit the environment but cannot be quantified). One such commenter, an environmental group, urged not only that credit be given for emission fee programs, but that they must be encouraged since they offer the most attractive opportunity for environmental progress. In fact, the proposed and final rules allow credit for market-response as well as emission limiting programs, and encourage States to consider all such types of programs. The proposed and final rules also encourage the use of directionally-sound programs, but specify that SIP credit cannot be taken until sufficient experience with the program results in the ability to adequately quantify the results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some State commenters expressed general concern with the use of any up-front discounting of SIP credit, urging instead that alternative approaches be allowed to account for uncertainty. In particular, some State commenters recommended that the program audit procedures be used to provide information on actual emissions reductions resulting from program implementation. Such audit results would feed back into updated emissions inventories, be compared to initially projected program results, and if appropriate, result in additional credit or the need for additional reductions if the audited results differ from those credited to the EIP in the SIP. One State commenter recommended that the State be allowed to adopt various back-up provisions in an EIP instead of applying up-front discount factors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

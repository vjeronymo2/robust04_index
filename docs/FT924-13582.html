			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / TUC acts to rally opposition to British Coal plan THE Trades Union Congress last night called an emergency meeting of its general council for Saturday morning to try to give a lead to widespread union and public opposition to British Coal's plan to close 31 of its 50 pits. The executive of the National Union of Mineworkers has called for a demonstration on Friday outside the pits earmarked for closure and for a mass lobby of parliament. 'We call on all our members and their families to demonstrate at the pits to stop these immediate closures,' said Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM leader. Today a special delegate conference of the NUM will almost certainly back a call by the union's executive for a strike ballot against the closures. There is considerable doubt as to whether NUM members will support the strike call, which would jeopardise redundancy payments of up to Pounds 37,000. It is even less likely that friendly unions will challenge the government's employment laws and take unlawful industrial action to support the miners. However, Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT rail union, after a meeting with NUM leaders, said the direct effect of pit closures on railwaymen could be so severe that 'the prospect of industrial action is left open'. Some union militants have even called for a link-up between the fight against pit closures and the public sector unions battle against a possible pay freeze in the public sector. But TUC officials acknowledge that the only real weapons that the unions have are public opinion and the courts. Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the TUC, yesterday called for a 'cooling off' period while the future of Britain's energy industry could be considered. 'I do not think the government should underestimate the intensity of the anger at this situation,' he added. Mr Willis also said the TUC switchboard was jammed yesterday morning with members of the public expressing outrage at the closures. Union leaders and Labour politicians estimate that at least 50,000 additional jobs could be lost as a result of the pit closures. The Union of Democratic Mineworkers, the Nottinghamshire-based union which broke away from the NUM during the 1984-85 strike, is preparing to apply for an injunction to stop the immediate closures. The NUM and the UDM are not, however, likely to bury their differences and unite to fight the closures. The UDM's solicitors argue that the speed of closure is unlawful - disregarding both British Coal's own colliery review procedure and the Employment Protection Act 1975 which requires 90 days' notice of closure. The union is also considering filing a complaint to the European Community over the recent gas supply agreement and alleging an abuse of monopoly power by the electricity industry. The UDM is unlikely to win an injunction which would prevent any closures before a full hearing could take place, but it hopes for a full hearing within a fortnight. Nacods, the pit supervisors' union, is also thinking of applying for an injunction against the suspension of the colliery review procedure. Bitter memory, Page 8 Letters, Page 19</p>

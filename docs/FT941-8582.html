			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drifts lower in absence of foreign buying Uncertainty over the yen's course against the dollar kept investors sidelined, and share prices lost ground on small-lot selling in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average was finally down 120.72 at 18,931.39 after opening at a high for the day of 19,026.50 and falling to a low of 18,809.98 in the afternoon. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 5.55 to 1,553.55, while the Nikkei 300 shed 0.59 to 287.06. Arbitrage unwinding overwhelmed foreign buying, which has dwindled during the past few days. Japanese investors were wary of US threats to impose trade sanctions due to its closed mobile telephone market. The US administration has announced that it plans to restrict imports of Japanese communications equipment over Japan's alleged violation of a bilateral cellular market accord. In spite of fears that the dollar could fall below the Y100 level, the foreign currency market had a quiet day. The dollar closed Y0.38 up at Y103.48 after moving around the Y103 mark. But traders remain worried about the impact of the yen's strength on the expected economic recovery, which has supported recent buying. Volume was 300m shares, against 372m. Declines led advances by 696 to 293, with 176 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.46 to 1,282.41. Nitsuko, a telephone manufacturer belonging to the NEC group, was the most actively traded issue, declining Y180 to Y1,280. NEC fell Y3 to Y968 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y12,000 to Y886,000. Other export oriented high-technology issues were also lower. Sony lost Y60 to Y5,800 and Canon declined Y10 to Y1,580. However, some car stocks were higher on bargain hunting: Toyota Motor gained Y10 to Y1,900 and Honda Motor advanced Y40 to Y1,620. Drug issues lost ground on profit-taking with Takeda Chemical falling Y20 to Y1,230 and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical losing Y40 to Y2,110. Short-term investors traded speculative favourites. Nippon Shokubai, which was traded on the 'environmental theme' rose Y30 to Y1,050, but Takuma declined Y40 to Y1,410 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 179.08 to 21,036.75 in volume of 59.2m shares. Roundup Turnover in many of the region's markets continued to fall back or remain below recent average levels. HONG KONG ended a day of roller-coaster trade with the Hang Seng index recovering 152.44, or 1.4 per cent to 10,786.58, after swinging between a 185-point gain and a 157-point loss. Turnover fell from HKDollars 6.48bn to HKDollars 5.59bn. Domestic professionals said that US speculators were playing futures, destabilising the cash market. February futures closed at a big premium to the spot market at 10,935, up 325, on heavy volume of 17,000 lots. The contract gyrated in a 480-point range between 10,470 and 10,950. TAIWAN, too, had higher share prices and lower activity, the weighted index ending 42.86 up at 5,905.49 after an early low of 5,822, and turnover falling from TDollars 58.31bn to TDollars 47.39bn. The financial sector stabilised after recent sharp falls but domestic and foreign institutions continued hunting for selected industrials. The paper sector led gains after Long Cheng Paper said that profits rocketed in 1993, and the shares rose TDollars 1.20 to TDollars 25.90. BANGKOK's most active stock was Bangkok Bank, currently on a roadshow in support of its Euroconvertible issue, up Bt3 at Bt200 as the SET index rose 16.09 to 1,445.20. Turnover was Bt12.3bn. BOMBAY recovered on fresh buying by Indian financial institutions and mutual funds, the BSE 30-share index closing up 59.97 at 3,867.39. Dealers said that investors were anticipating another rally ahead of the Indian budget in ten days' time. AUSTRALIA took a late tumble and the All Ordinaries index, after rising 10 points during morning trade, ended 8.1 lower at 2,240.9. One broker said that a fall in domestic bonds, and mixed company interim results had added to the drop. Turnover was ADollars 553.7m. NEW ZEALAND followed London and New York, the NZSE-40 index closing 12.98 higher at 2,324.91. Brierley sold 30m Skellerup shares, which rose 2 cents to NZDollars 2.70, and the sale boosted market volume from NZDollars 57m to NZDollars 135m. KARACHI closed the last session before the two-day weekend break in a cautious mood, with some investors unnerved by the possibility that the coalition government in the North West Frontier Province might be voted out of office. The KSE 100-share index shed 19.98 to 2,382.72. COLOMBO continued its bull run with a further gain in the all-share index of 29.47 to 1,306.89. Turnover weakened from SLRs362m from SLRs398m.</p>

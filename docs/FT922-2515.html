			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Traders heartened after equities rally INVESTMENT confidence was tested again in the UK stock market yesterday as the new trading account opened against a gloomy international and domestic backcloth. However, there was little selling pressure and the FT-SE 100 Index rebounded comfortably from a new resistance level, with traders sounding unperturbed by the day's loss of 10.1 on the index, which closed at 2,593.6. Nevertheless, turnover remained very thin as the season for holidays and sporting highlights began to attract attention. Many share prices were hardly tested and the second half of the session saw substantial recoveries in some areas when marketmaking houses picked up cheap stocks. Fisons, for example, weathered a fresh selling bout to trim significantly the early loss. Seaq-reported volume was slow to advance during the morning and the final total of 359.5m shares compared poorly with Friday's 497.7m. Stock index futures played a less forceful role as Friday's expiry deadline for the FT-SE June futures contract drew near. The market trod a somewhat erratic path in early trading, opening about 15 Footsie points off but soon steadying almost to its overnight level. The lack of support then made itself felt and the index gave ground to reach the day's low of 2,577.8, off nearly 26 points. In addition to worries over results from leading UK companies, which upset the market last week, investors were discouraged by developments on the wider economic scale. An upward revision of the UK trade deficit for the first quarter of the year did nothing to soothe worries about the domestic economy. Hopes for another cut in UK base rates were not helped by warnings from the Bundesbank president that he saw no room for a reduction in German rates at present, nor from the Bank for International Settlement's rejection of suggestions that other European Community countries might undercut German rates. However, the stock market successfully withstood the assault on the Footsie 2,580 mark, which is regarded as an important defence line. After seeing the 2,650 and then the 2,600 levels swept aside, traders were clearly relieved to see yesterday's rally. Very modest buying, mostly from within the market community rather than from genuine investors, proved enough to take the index ahead steadily in spite of a poor opening to the new Wall Street session. When the Dow Average turned from an initial loss of 10 points to a net gain of 3.5 in UK trading hours, London closed in good form. The head of a leading Japanese house said: 'There was no serious selling, and we could respond strongly to any positive news.' Several of the recent share price casualties turned in better performances yesterday. Midland Bank steadied as arbitrage activity finally died away, leaving the market to await formal completion of the merger with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking. Pressure on oil shares also eased, leaving BP only pence lower on the day and Shell edging ahead as buyers came in at the close.</p>

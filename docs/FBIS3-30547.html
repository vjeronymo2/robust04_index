I am not trying to escape from this  tragedy, but I am telling you that it is technically difficult  [to say where the shell came from]. The day before this attack  the shell that landed on Dobrinja came from Serbian positions.  Everyone knows that. It killed 10 people. It is a difference  of degree, but we know that that shell was Serbian.    [Hourdan] And we do not know about this one?    [Cot] Technically no. I cannot tell you any more.    [passage omitted]</p>

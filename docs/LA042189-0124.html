			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN ADVANTAGE;  </P> <P> KINGS CAN'T BELIEVE THAT GOAL CALGARY SCORED WITH TRAINER ON ICE STOOD UP  </P> <P> Of the many goals scored Thursday night by the Calgary Flames, none upset the  Kings more than the fourth.  </P> <P> For those who watched the Kings' 8-3 loss on television, that was the one that  put the Flames ahead, 4-0, just 11 minutes 35 seconds into the first period and  prompted a stream of obscenities from Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> What set him off?  </P> <P> He thought the Flames had too many men on the ice.  </P> <P> And he was right.  </P> <P> The trespassing Flame was trainer Jim (Bearcat) Murray, who ran onto the ice  while the puck was still in play to tend to injured goaltender Mike Vernon, who  was punched by the Kings' Bernie Nicholls.  </P> <P> Referee Bill McCreary, his right arm raised to signify a delayed roughing  penalty against Nicholls, appeared to see Murray run onto the ice but allowed  play to continue as the Flames moved the puck toward the Kings' goal.  </P> <P> Only seconds later, Al MacInnis took a centering pass from Hakan Loob and fired  the puck over the left shoulder of King goaltender Kelly Hrudey and into the  upper right corner of the net.  </P> <P> The Flames were flying, well on their way to a Game 2 rout that put them ahead,  2-0, in the best-of-seven Smythe Division final series.  </P> <P> And Gretzky was about to throw a screaming fit.  </P> <P> But according to John McCauley, the National Hockey League's supervisor of  officials, McCreary handled the play correctly.  </P> <P> NHL rules, McCauley said, do not forbid trainers from running onto the ice  while play is in progress.  </P> <P> "There are rules covering coaches and managers coming onto the ice after the  start of the game," said McCauley, who watched the game from the press box,  "but there's nothing about trainers.  </P> <P> "(The officials) don't have to stop play automatically. Calgary had possession  of the puck, so (McCreary) waited until possession changed. As it turned out,  the Flames scored."  </P> <P> Murray said that he assumed the play would be blown dead and he ran out onto  the ice so quickly because he though Vernon was more seriously injured than he  turned out to be.  </P> <P> Vernon stayed in the game, and Nicholls' punch, which knocked the goaltender to  the ice, was all but forgotten, resulting not even in a penalty.  </P> <P> What prompted Nicholls?  </P> <P> "I have no idea," Vernon said. "You'd have to ask him. I had my stick out so he  wouldn't come into my crease, and all of a sudden he whacked me one.  </P> <P> "He wound up from right field, for crying out loud."  </P> <P> Nicholls, though, said that he was hit first by Vernon, and not for the first  time. Vernon, he said, frequently attempts to clear out the area in front of  the net by poking trespassers with his stick.  </P> <P> "For him to hit me then, when we were killing a penalty, I didn't think it was  called for," Nicholls said. "But there's no use hitting him in the stomach or  the pads. He deserved what I gave him."  </P> <P> Vernon, whose jaw was clipped, said he was surprised to be punched because,  "usually with Bernie, it's a stick."  </P> <P> In fact, in the third period of Game 1 Tuesday night, Vernon said, Nicholls  whacked him over the head with his stick.  </P> <P> True enough, Nicholls said.  </P> <P> "Usually, I've hit him in the pads, and that didn't get my point across,"  Nicholls said. "Tonight, I think I got my point across."  </P> <P> But even with Murray on the ice, it didn't help the Kings, some of whom said  they stopped on the play, believing the action would be blown dead.  </P> <P> "A guy was hurt," said Nicholls, who was in position to know. "Why they didn't  blow it dead is beyond me."  </P> <P> The officials couldn't explain it. When McCauley is in attendance, one of them  said, they are not allowed to speak to the media.  </P> <P> So, the explanation was left to McCauley, a former official who was forced to  retire in 1979 after being punched in the eye by a fan, his vision forever  altered.  </P> <P> And he said he's never experienced anything like it.  </P> <P> "Very unusual," he said of the play. "Very, very unusual. It was a very unique  happening that happened."  </P> <P> That just about summed it up.  </P></p>

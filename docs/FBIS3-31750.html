			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lubo Rabay in Beijing: "Asian Opportunity"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Slovak delegation made  use of the 16-hour flight to Beijing with stopovers in Moscow  and Tashkent for working meetings with representatives of Russia  and Uzbekistan. As Prime Minister Meciar confirmed to us later  on the plane, the talks with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Y. F.  Yarov concerned, above all, the issue of reducing Slovakia's  trade deficit with Russia, which amounts to approximately 30  billion [Slovak korunas]. "In the course of 1993 we had  prepared 26 legal documents in the interest of a new quality of  cooperation between Russia and Slovakia. The time has finally  come to apply them in practice," Vladimir Meciar stressed.    The talks at Moscow airport also concerned privatization  plans and, in particular, further cooperation in nuclear  engineering. "The Russians are ready to accept payment in kind  for nuclear fuel and they will also accept spent fuel from us,"  Vladimir Meciar specified in reply to a question from PRAVDA.  "The issue of Russian participation in the completion of the  Mochovce nuclear power station remains disputed. While the  first and the second unit are 90 percent complete, the question  of the other two units remains open. The Russians' interest in  further participation in the Slovak nuclear program was  emphasized in exceptionally strong terms. They offered us an  interest-free loan of $100 million."    In view of the known fact that French and German partners  are  to participate in the completion of the first two units of the  Mochovce nuclear power station, which is to be covered by a  credit of 1.3 billion German marks, we asked how the nuclear  safety of the other two units should be dealt with, under this  Russian proposal. "The technology of the power station would be  Russian but the safety equipment would be from Siemens. This  would be interesting for the Russian side because they would  then be able to use this model in building and rebuilding their  own nuclear power stations." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Abbey National aided by drop in provisions A steep fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts largely accounted for the 41 per cent increase in pre-tax profits at Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, from Pounds 301m to Pounds 423m in the six months to June 30. Provisions in UK retail banking fell to Pounds 26m, against Pounds 78m in the first half of 1993, while provisions for the group's continental European and offshore operations fell to Pounds 15m (Pounds 81m). Pre-tax profits in UK retail banking rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 314m (Pounds 300m), but there was a sharper rise in profit from the group's life insurance operations to Pounds 47m (Pounds 18m). At 9.8 per cent of the UK net mortgage lending market in the first half of this year, Abbey's market share was lower than usual. Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, said that in the early part of the year, when fixed-rate mortgages had been popular and had carried very slim margins, Abbey had deliberately not competed aggressively. Since then the emphasis had shifted back towards variable rates and Abbey's success would show through in market share figures for the second half of the year. But both he and Lord Tugendhat, chairman, underlined that the company wanted to be 'judged on profitability, not by market share'. Abbey's share of the UK retail savings market was an estimated 14 per cent, following a marketing drive, but this could slip back in the second half. Pre-tax profits from the treasury operation were just 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 70m (Pounds 66m), while there was a 33 per cent increase in average assets. Abbey intends to apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US later this year for registration of public funding issues. Group net interest margin fell to 1.6 per cent (1.86 per cent) and net interest income slipped to Pounds 642m (Pounds 645m), but Mr Birch resisted the suggestion that there was pressure on margins. He pointed to the growth in the treasury operation where margins were smaller, and said that overall margins after provisioning had been fairly flat for some time. Abbey had 'demonstrated that we are able to manage that margin fairly well'. Abbey said its continental European operations now centred on the mortgage lending operation in Italy and a refocused banking operation in Spain. Nationwide Building Society, the UK's second largest, said yesterday that it had acquired from Lehman Brothers a Pounds 70m mortgage book made up of 940 UK residential mortgages. See Lex</p>

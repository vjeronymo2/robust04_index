			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Kaizer Nyatsumbra] </F>   [Text] Will Thabo Mbeki or Cyril Ramaphosa be deputy  president of South Africa in a month's time? And if it's  Ramaphosa, will Pik Botha hang on to his post as Foreign  Minister?    The imminence of the election -- now just 17 days away -- is  sparking furious debate in political circles about who will be  occupying key posts in the new coalition Cabinet after the  voting is over, according to reliable sources. Intense interest  is focused on the race for one of two deputy presidencies  provided for in the Interim Constitution.    Polls suggest that F.W. de Klerk, as leader of the party  likely to come second in the election, will win one of the  posts. But ANC leader Nelson Mandela -- the overwhelming  favourite for president -- will have to choose the second deputy  president from his own ranks. Mbeki and Ramaphosa are regarded  as the top contenders, with Mbeki's seniority in his favour, and  Ramaphosa's stronger showing on the ANC list boosting his  chances.    The outcome could affect Botha's future. If Mbeki were not  to achieve the deputy presidency, he would be a very strong  candidate for the Foreign Ministry. As incumbent president, De  Klerk's most senior Cabinet Minister, Botha -- now the  longest-serving foreign minister in the world -- is certain to  be one of the NP MPs to be included in the Cabinet which is to  be announced early next month.    ANC sources said debate on the new Cabinet was now at an  advanced stage within the organisation.    The national executive committee had been scheduled to  discuss the issue and make recommendations on the issue this  week, but the meeting was postponed until next week because of  yesterday's four- way summit of leaders to discuss "the Natal  problem".    Mbeki and Ramaphosa are the two main candidates for the  position of South Africa's first deputy president, who will come  from the biggest party if no more than one other party wins more  than 20 percent of the vote. The ANC sources said there were  sensitivities over this discussion, with each man's camp making  a strong claim for the position. Ramaphosa's backers argued  that as the candidate placed immediately after Mandela on the  ANC's national election list, he should be heir-apparent to the  septuagenarian ANC leader. Mbeki's supporters -- many in the ANC  Youth League -- said he had been placed second on regional  lists, and claimed that as the list which saw Ramaphosa  leap-frogging to second spot was a result of the national  conference attended by party bosses, it did not represent "the  will of the people".    Should Mbeki get the deputy presidency, Botha -- whose only  other challenger is said to be ANC deputy international affairs  director Aziz Pahad -- is almost assured of the Foreign Affairs  post.    In terms of the Interim Constitution, South Africa's new  president will be obliged to appoint Ministers from parties  which have polled at least 5 percent of the vote "on the advice  of the parties to which the relevant portfolios have been  allocated."</p>

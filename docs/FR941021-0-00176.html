Other Terrestrial Services provided outside of the United States <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 159. In sixteen countries throughout the world, the 1550&hyph;1645.5 MHz band is allocated on a primary basis to the fixed service pursuant to international Radio Regulation RR 730. <FOOTCITE>207</FOOTCITE>  Ground-based aeronautical radionavigation services (ARNS) are also operating throughout the world in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band pursuant to RR 732. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 207 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These countries are Austria, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Germany, Guinea, Hungary, Indonesia, Libya, Mali, Mongolia, Nigeria, Poland, Romania, Senegal, Czechoslovakia, and the former U.S.S.R. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 160. The Committee concluded that existing fixed stations operating in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band pursuant to RR 730 and ground-based ARNS stations operating pursuant to RR 732 will not cause harmful interference to MSS operations. It also concluded that MSS operations will not cause harmful interference to these terrestrial services. Consequently, we proposed only to reiterate in Section 25.213(d) of our rules the general obligation that MSS stations shall not cause interference into stations operating under RR 730. The requirement that MSS stations shall not cause interference to, or claim protection from, stations operating pursuant to RR 732, (international Radio Regulation RR 732 encompasses both ground-based and satellite-borne ARNS), was addressed by proposed rule section 25.213(c)(1), which was adopted earlier in this order. <FOOTCITE>208</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 208 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See para. 128,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 161. Constellation contends that we should not adopt proposed &sect;25.213(d) since there are no U.S. systems operating pursuant to RR 730. <FOOTCITE>209</FOOTCITE>  We disagree. We have repeatedly emphasized in this proceeding that the operation of LEO MSS systems is inherently global. Though there are no systems operating in the United States pursuant to RR 730, it is important that we make clear the obligations of Big LEO operators to coordinate their systems worldwide. Our rules do not elsewhere address coordination of Big LEO systems with systems operating pursuant to RR 730. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 209 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Constellation Reply comments at 47 and Constellation Comments at 53. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 162. We therefore adopt Section 25.213(d), as proposed, with the caveat that the coordination and notification procedures fall under Resolution 46 (WARC&hyph;92). <FOOTCITE>210</FOOTCITE>  International Radio Regulations RR 731E and RR 731F require, respectively, that MSS uplink transmissions in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band and MSS downlink operations in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band be coordinated and notified pursuant to Resolution 46 (WARC&hyph;92). Also according to RR 731E, MSS mobile earth terminals may not cause interference to terrestrial stations operating in accordance with RR 730 and they may not claim interference protection from these terrestrial stations. We note that all transmitting MSS subscriber terminals will be subject to the regulatory requirements of those countries in which they are operating. User countries will be responsible for undertaking all necessary coordination with neighboring countries to protect fixed or terrestrial aeronautical radionavigation operations from MSS mobile earth terminals in those neighboring countries. Any secondary MSS downlink operations in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band also may not cause harmful interference into terrestrial services operating pursuant to RR 730 or 732. Nor may a MSS mobile earth terminal which receives secondary downlink transmissions claim protection against harmful interference from these terrestrial operation unless a particular country has agreed to provide this protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 210 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Motorola Comments at 56. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> C. Feeder Links <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 163. In addition to the mobile links connecting customers with the MSS system, one or more ``gateway'' or central earth stations are needed to complete the transmission paths, process the information being transmitted, and interconnect the system with other communications networks or with other user transceivers. Without these ``feeder links,'' an MSS system would be useless. Because feeder links operate with gateway stations at fixed locations, the feeder link operates in frequency bands allocated to the fixed-satellite service (FSS). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 164. The six applicants requested a variety of feeder link frequency bands and bandwidths. In their applications, Constellation, Ellipsat, and LQP each requested 66 MHz of spectrum in each transmission direction in the 5/6 GHz C-band. Motorola and TRW and each requested approximately 100 MHz in each direction the 20/30 GHz Ka-band. AMSC requested an unspecified amount of spectrum in the 12/14 GHz Ku-band. <FOOTCITE>211</FOOTCITE>  We note, however, that four of the applicants, in the Joint Proposal, indicate that their feeder link spectrum requirements have increased significantly since they filed their original applications. As recognized in the Notice, the FAA has opposed use of the 5 GHz portion of the C-band for space-to-Earth feeder links because of the interference potential between the feeder links and a navigation system it is considering developing in this band. <FOOTCITE>212</FOOTCITE>  The 27.5&hyph;29.5 GHz portion of the Ka-band was the subject of a recently completed Negotiated Rulemaking involving various terrestrial and satellite interests seeking to use the band. The Negotiated Rulemaking Committee was unable to devise sharing criteria that would satisfy the feeder link requirements of more than one Big LEO applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 211 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Committee Report, Annex 3, Report of Working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Group 3, at 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 212 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Notice, note 2, supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at para. 75 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 165. In the Joint Proposal, the parties nevertheless request the Commission to proceed with licensing. They state that licenses can be issued to those applicants requesting to operate in feeder link bands that are available for assignment at the time of licensing. They suggest that conditional licenses be awarded to applicants requesting to operate in feeder link bands that are not available. According to the parties, the license would contain a range of feeder link frequencies that the licensee will be able to use provided that those frequencies become available for Big LEO feeder links and are assigned to that licensee by the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 166. We agree that we should award Big LEO licenses as quickly as possible. While we are optimistic that sufficient spectrum will be identified to support Big LEO feeder link operations, we are not certain when this will occur. It is very likely that we will not be in a position to assign specific feeder link spectrum to any qualified applicant by our target date for licensing in January 1995. Even if we were able to assign specific feeder link spectrum to some, however, we would not issue unconditional grants to some and conditional grants to others as the applicants suggest. Until we are certain that the feeder link requirements of all qualified applicants will be met, we will not foreclose our options by assigning spectrum unconditionally. <FOOTCITE>213</FOOTCITE>  We will permit applicants to notify us whether they would prefer to have conditional feeder link frequencies included in their authorizations or whether they would prefer their initial license to be silent on this issue. We envision granting unconditional licenses, including specific feeder link frequencies, at the earlier of two events: (1) Domestic allocations sufficient to support all Big LEO systems are available, regardless of frequency band or (2) the completion of the upcoming World Radio Conference in the Fall of 1995 (WRC&hyph;95) assuming sufficient spectrum is made available to satisfy these feeder link requirements. If sufficient feeder link spectrum to support all licensed Big LEO systems is not identified by the completion of the WRC, we will need to develop a further processing mechanism to assign feeder link bands to Big LEO licensees. In the interim, we will continue our international efforts to identity feeder link spectrum at or below 15 GHz. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 213 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We will, however, take action on requests for waiver of the construction permit requirement under Section 319(d) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 319(d). If an applicant's waiver request were approved, it would permit the applicant to commence construction of its system, including the feeder links, at the applicant's own risk. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

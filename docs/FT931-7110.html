			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Unita in continued attack on Huambo THE central Angolan city of Huambo was under constant shelling yesterday and the streets were full of decomposing bodies from fighting between government troops and the rebel Unita movement, write Michael Holman in London and Reuter in Luanda. In one of the first eyewitness accounts from Huambo, Angolan journalist William Tonet, trapped in the besieged city since early January, said the residents were in danger from Unita shelling whether they stayed at home or went out in the streets to look for food. He estimated that 10,000 to 13,000 people had been killed there. A report published in London today says neither the MPLA government nor Unita can win an outright military victory. Compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit, the report concludes that both sides will ultimately be 'obliged to compromise.' It says that the resumption of the peace process will require a larger role for the United Nations. The UN has been monitoring the 1991 agreement which paved the way for multi-party democracy. Oil, diamonds and other minerals, and an abundance of arable land, make Angola one of Africa's most richly endowed countries: 'If Angola enjoyed political stability and good management, its economy should prosper'.

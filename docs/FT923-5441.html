			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Personal View: France to the rescue When the financial history of the 20th century is written, French and British disagreements about how to manage the Germans are likely to rank high on the list of factors which contributed to international monetary crises. During the inter-war years, France was so determined to inhibit German recovery that it used the threat of gold withdrawals from London to discourage Britain from reducing Germany's war reparations burden. As Britain's balance of payments was already under strain, because of the decision to return to the gold standard at an overvalued exchange rate in 1925, such French monetary mischief forced Britain to keep interest rates at undesirably high levels and thus contributed to the economic crisis which culminated in the abandonment of the gold standard during September 1931. As a result of the forthcoming referendum on the Maastricht treaty, France is poised once again to have a profound impact on the conduct of British economic policy. But in contrast to the deflationary bias of French policy during the early 1930s, the Maastricht referendum provides France with an opportunity to break the exchange rate mechanism's monetary gridlock, which is now strangling the British economy and retarding growth elsewhere in Europe. If France votes against the Maastricht treaty, there would be so much turmoil in the currency markets that European governments would have a politically convenient excuse to accept the ERM realignment that should have occurred at the time of German unification. Such a realignment would then set the stage for a significant decline in the level of interest rates throughout Europe. As in the inter-war years, French relations with Germany have played a big part in creating the current European economic crisis. The French political elite has been among the strongest advocates of European monetary union, because it views this as additional reinforcement for creating strong European federal institutions to control unified Germany. But while such attitudes are historically understandable, they have encouraged France to adopt a policy towards exchange rate realignment that has crippled the process of economic adjustment in Europe. As a result of France's opposition to any form of comprehensive D-Mark revaluation, Europe's exchange rate target zones have increasingly become a political totem promoting competitive deflation rather than a clearing price for goods and capital maximising European trade and output. The fact is that Germany has needed far more exchange rate flexibility since 1989 than the ERM permitted. Since unification, the government deficit has expanded from barely 1 per cent of gross national product to about 7 per cent and the large pre-1989 current account surplus has disappeared. Germany has been reliving the Reagan fiscal experiment under the constraint of a semi-fixed exchange rate system despite the need for significant real exchange rate appreciation to reallocate resources from its tradeable goods sector to government consumption. In countries with weaker central banks than Germany's, such an adjustment in the real exchange rate would have occurred through higher inflation. But because of the Bundesbank's determination to contain inflation, Germany has experienced a large rise in real interest rates, not the real exchange rate. The D-Mark's real exchange rate has risen by only 5 per cent since 1989 compared with more than 30 per cent for the dollar during the early Reagan years. The British government was aware of the financial strains created by German unification when it joined the ERM, but it clearly underestimated the economic trade-offs they would pose compared with the perceived political benefits of being an ERM member. The results of this error are clearly apparent. The level of real interest rates is approaching 7 per cent despite the most protracted recession since the 1930s, the bankrputcy of thousands of entrepreneurial companies launched in the Thatcher years, severe real estate deflation, and a rapidly growing stock of non-performing bank loans. Britain's current account deficit is also at such high levels that the country will soon be an external debtor, despite the large accumulation of overseas assets which followed the North Sea oil boom of the early 1980s. The deflation occurring in the British economy will ultimately create the preconditions for improved competitiveness and economic recovery, but probably not until the second half of the 1990s. As a result, the UK government deficit is likely to rise to 6 to 7 per cent of gross domestic product this year and remain there for much longer than official forecasters now recognise, despite the Maastricht requirement that public sector deficits converge towards 3 per cent of GNP during the mid-1990s. Britain's forced convergence with German fiscal policy will help to compensate for the weakness occurring in private investment, but these large new budget deficits will be far less stimulative than the interest rate decline and currency depreciation which offset the much maligned Thatcher tax increases of 1981. The fact is that British household and corporate balance sheets differ so profoundly from Germany's that the UK cannot escape from recession until interest rates fall sharply. Such a decline will not occur until Germany also experiences a slump or the ERM is realigned. The problem for the British government is finding a face-saving way of correcting its 1990 error. The government has invested so much political capital in the ERM that it would be impossible for it to pursue a unilateral realignment without the resignation of the chancellor. But if France votes No, the UK government will have the perfect excuse to promote the realignment of European exchange rates which the Bundesbank itself advocated more than two years ago. How would the financial markets react to such a development? Perhaps the most instructive guide is how they reacted to Britain's decision to abandon the gold standard in 1931. As the gold standard had been the dominant monetary regime for several decades previously, the psychological trauma associated with the decision to abandon gold greatly exceeded the trauma which would follow a decision to realign the ERM. The authorities themselves were so apprehensive about the risk of a financial panic that they closed the London stock market for two days, but when it reopened share prices immediately rallied in expectation of an improved economy. The bond market fell initially because of concern about the threat of inflation but shortly thereafter it entered a multi-year bull market. After peaking at 5 per cent in 1931, UK government bond yields fell steadily to 3.08 per cent in 1934. Short-term interest rates also fell from 6 per cent to 2 per cent. There is little reason to doubt that an ERM realignment would produce a sustained rally in British equity prices. The outlook for the currency and bond market would depend upon the ability of the UK government to produce a multi-year strategy for promoting economic recovery without reviving inflation. Such a programme would probably have to include a more independent Bank of England in order to ensure that monetary policy did not remain excessively stimulative after economic recovery began. It also would be easier to revive the movement towards European monetary union later in the 1990s if the leading players had exchange rates and interest rates consistent with steady non-inflationary growth, not the disequilibria and depression which have resulted from the impact of German unification on the current system. As a result of the previous tensions between Britain and France over the issues of Europe and international monetary relations, there is rich irony in the fact that Britain may now depend upon a popular referendum in France to correct the ERM policy error which has produced the current slump. But the Maastricht vote will not be the first time that France has helped to inspire a benign change in Britain's monetary regime. After all, the Westminster parliament created the Bank of England during 1694 in order to finance a war with France.

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson Pounds 21m rights to cut borrowings BROWN &amp; Jackson, which owns the Poundstretcher discount retail chain, yesterday surprised the market by announcing its second rights issue in just over a year to raise Pounds 21m. The 2-for-5 cash call at 12p will be used to reduce borrowings and finance a store opening programme. The existing shares slipped  1/2 p to 14 1/2 p. Mr Ian Gray, chief executive, said: 'The last rights took us far enough out of a hole to see daylight; we are now going forward.' Shareholders were last tapped for funds after the company's restructuring was completed in April 1992. The group established a three year plan to maximise the profitability of its 260 stores. The group, which has undergone a management shake-up as it reverted to a December year-end, recently reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 967,000 on turnover of Pounds 241.9m in the 15 months to December 31. Mr Gray said new finance was needed to take advantage of opportunities in the market. Some Pounds 13m of the new proceeds will be used to buy 15 new stores this year and a further 45 the following year. Borrowings, which averaged Pounds 19m last year, will be reduced by Pounds 6m. The remaining Pounds 2m is expected to be used for further acquisitions. Mr Gray said he was confident that the Pounds 21m was enough to fund working capital for growth. 'We are not about to take a nibble now only to come back for a nibble next year. We have had our rescue rights and we are now having one for growth'. The existing stores will continue to be upgraded. The electronic point of sale system has been extended from 57 to 195 stores in the last year and is scheduled to be installed in all stores by the end of the year.</p>

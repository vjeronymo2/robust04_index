Security Council to "launch a  full-scale peace-keeping operation in the whole territory of the  Abkhazian region," says a letter of Georgia's permanent  representative at the United Nations Pyotr Chkheidze, circulated  here on Thursday as a Security Council document.    According to the letter, the war in Abkhazia "has brought to  a critical condition the economic situation of the Republic of  Georgia and turned hundreds of thousands of people into homeless  refugees. There are no visible signs that their situation is  improving." The letter pointed out that this situation "may  create serious preconditions for spontaneous actions on the part  of 300,000 refugees and displaced persons," and may bring to  naught the agreements reached by the two sides in Geneva.    "Taking into account those circustances and facing a real  danger of another wave of violence in that region, the Georgian  Government is urging the world community to render assistance in  launching a full-scale peace-keeping operation on the whole  territory of the Abkhazian region, using the U.N. force or, if  this problem cannot be resolved quick enough, using any other  force sanctioned by the U.N. As is known, this approach has been  recorded in a communique on the second round of talks, held in  Geneva," the letter said.    "Quoting provisions of the communique and taking into  consideration the understanding of this request, displayed by  the Russian leadership, as well as its direct interest in  preventing the spreading of the conflict outside the Georgian  territory and, in the long run, in the stabilisation of the  situation in the whole area, the Georgian leadership is  welcoming Russia's readiness to take part in the peace-keeping  operation in Abkhazia with a view to attaining that goal.  Contingents from other countries may be attached to Russian  peace-keeping units, along with the participation of U.N.  military observers, in accordance with a Security Council  resolution," the Georgian representatve wrote.</p>

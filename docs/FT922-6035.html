			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy Any lingering doubts that recovery is under way should have been dispelled by yesterday's trade figures showing import volume grew an underlying 4 1/2 per cent in the three months to April. That, however, is about the extent of the good news. It might be possible to interpret the import surge as a sign that recovery is already robust, but that would scarcely be consistent with other available data. The depressing conclusion is that even a weak recovery is enough to push the trade figures heavily into the red, possibly because loss of capacity during the recession has left the economy with bottlenecks. Granted, a large trade deficit does not matter in the short term because foreign money is flowing abundantly into post-election Britain. There is a reasonable chance that the estimates for invisible earnings, which have been running at Pounds 300m a month since the start of the year, will be revised upwards. By contrast, export performance has not yet been affected by any slowdown that may hit the rest of Europe as a result of the Bundesbank squeeze. Heavy inflows into the gilts market may have created a breathing space but adjustment will be inevitable before long. Since ERM membership gives the UK little independent control over its monetary policy, the brunt will have to be born on the fiscal side.</p>

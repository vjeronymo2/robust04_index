That is fine, but your economy is  coming apart--the strings have been tightened too much, no more  is possible." This is how Croatian businessmen in the Zagreb  region, specifically those who export their products, talked to  Prime Minister Nikica Valentic and the competent minister, along  with representatives of the National Bank of Croatia [NBH] in  the meeting organized in Zagreb on Tuesday by the Croatian  Chamber of Commerce.    Some 50 businessmen in the state and private sectors were  straightforward, frank, and at times temperamental in expounding  to Valentic how they are managing to do business within the  framework of his stabilization program. The list of problems  pinching them in conduct of their business is lengthy. The  businessmen were unanimous in letting Valentic know that the low  rate of foreign exchange is causing them the greatest losses in  doing business with foreign countries. So that they might do  business with the outside world successfully, the businessmen  want the exchange rate to be at least 4,000 dinars for 1 German  mark [DM], because a lower rate, in their experience,  jeopardizes not only the operation of their firms, but indeed  the entire government program.  <H5>  Tax Evasion </H5>   Ante Pesa, director of the firm Mega, cited the example of  his firm, which has superb technology, but still cannot cover  operating costs because of the low exchange rate of the mark. He  reproaches Valentic for having wanted to achieve many objectives  all at once with his program, in spite of the small market and  the low purchasing power of our public: stabilization of the  dinar and growth of production, and he warned him that if the  unrealistic exchange rate is maintained, we will experience  complete economic collapse instead of the goals that were  planned. Pesa therefore proposes an exchange rate of 5,000  dinars per mark and a slow rate of inflation that would  stimulate production. Marko Zupan, representative of Export  Drva, reminded Valentic that a firm must meet its obligations to  the budget every 15 days, while it must wait as long as two  months for money it earns through sales abroad. And while the  NBH and commercial banks are making charges against one another  because of difficulties in making payments, the firm must borrow  money even at an interest rate of 10 percent to support its  regular business operation. The businessmen call upon the banks  in future to pay them money collected 24 hours after the money  is credited to the account.    Ante Kljajic of the firm Unitas blames the NBH for having  created a shortage of dinars artificially, thereby also causing  a drop in the exchange rate, because there are no clear records  of the money supply. He proposes that the operation of firms  which have uncollected claims from the other republics of the  former Yugoslavia be given relief through collection of those  claims from those Croatian firms which have debts to the other  republics, and later the government, when relations with the  other states are normalized, would settle this through bilateral  treaties. He also said that government-owned firms are carrying  the heaviest burden of appropriations for the budget, while the  private firms are evading taxes. He publicly asked the president  of the city chamber of commerce how many private firms in Zagreb  have been shut down because of tax evasion?    Zdenko Pervan, representative of Almerija, a leather and  footwear factory, asked the prime minister why the competent  government departments are allowing 2 million pairs of shoes to  enter Croatia through smuggling channels every year without  customs duties or tax, with a large amount of this being sold at  booths in open-air markets under the very eyes of the Financial  Police? Unless the government controls smuggling channels for  distribution and sale, the Croatian economy, Pervan says, will  quickly turn into a speculative economy. For all these reasons,  production in Croatia is dropping, as the statistics show. In  1993, production was on the average 5.9 percent below 1992, and  in last December alone that drop was all of 11.9 percent. The  businessmen warn the government of a drop in exports as well: In  January of this year, they were down 27 percent from January of  last year.  <H5>  Financial Rescue of the Banks </H5>   Nikica Valentic thanked the businessmen several times for  their frankness and promised that the government would do  everything to guarantee them market-oriented conditions for the  conduct of their business, but he stuck to the view that he will  not yield to demands that jeopardize the basic goal of the  government economic program -- stabilization of the Croatian  currency. The alternative to that goal, Valentic said, is  uncontrolled printing of money and financial chaos. According to  the prime minister's promise, the government will try to ease  the troubles of the businessmen through numerous measures on a  smaller scale. According to the government decree, as of 1 April  the maximum interest rate must not exceed 50 percent, and all  the conditions for the conduct of business will be known before  the summer. Valentic will request from the NBH the clearest  possible monetary production for the coming period in order to  put an end to the constant sliding of the exchange rate. In the  coming period, the government will try to restore the banks to  health, which is a precondition for restoring the health of the  entire economy. The government plans to set aside DM70 million  in cash and DM50 million in bonds from this year's budget for  financial rescue of the banks.    The government will also provide an injection of money for  shipbuilding, DM500 million will be furnished for spring  planting, the government will also help preparation for the  coming tourist season, and it was announced that construction is  being invigorated. Over the next 10 years, in Croatia, according  to Valentic, 30,000 new housing units are to be built. The  government will take extreme measures to speed up the  privatization of large government-owned firms, but the strongest  light of hope for the Croatian economy is coming from  international financial institutions. According to the prime  minister's promise, by the end of this month Croatia will know  how much aid it will get from international financial  institutions. There are prospects of a loan of $500 million, and  Valentic is issuing firm guarantees that not a single dollar  will go for government expenditure, but all will go for the  infrastructure and investments.</p>

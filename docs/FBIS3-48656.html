Kim Yong-sam the traitor has made himself the enemy not only  of the South Korean people but also of the whole nation by  seeking dependence on outside forces and North-South  confrontation and bartering away the dignity and interests of  the nation to outside forces to gratify his greed for power,  notes the paper in an article.    The author of the article says:    He earned himself the hatred and grievances of the South  Korean people by establishing "civilian" fascist dictatorship  which is little different from the preceding military  dictatorship. While waxing eloquent about "civilian politics,"  he extended in actuality the military fascist dictatorship of  the "Fifth Republic" and the "Sixth Republic" without  modification.    It is clear to everyone that the reactionary rulers who  suppress the people and encroach upon their interests are  rejected by the popular masses. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique  landed itself in a hopeless isolation by committing treacheries  against fellow countrymen.    The traitor has trampled upon the agreement with  nonaggression as its core and the joint declaration on  denuclearisation by seizing power after the adoption and  effectuation of these historic documents between North and  South. And he has broken up the North-South dialogues, which  had continued even in the days of the regime of military  dictatorship, raising a hue and cry over "suspected nuclear  development" by the North. And he resumed the "Team Spirit"  joint military drill which had been suspended toward the end of  the "Sixth Republic" and staged a chain of North-targeted  nuclear war exercises codenamed "Ulchi," "Ulchi Focus Lens,"  "Foal Eagle-93," "Hwarang," etc., thus aggravating the  North-South relations and leading the situation to the brink of  war.    Out in front in the nuclear clamor raised by the imperialist  reactionaries to stifle the DPRK, the traitor Kim Yong-sam  sought "an international cooperation system" and displayed  feverish activities to have "sanctions" taken against it.    When countries and nations were advancing toward  independence  in the international arena, he entreated the United States to  shelve its "troops cutback program" by offering a burden share  to the tune of more than 3,000 million dollars for their  maintenance and "protect" South Korea with the "nuclear  umbrella" and, in the relations with Japan, he absolved the  Japanese imperialists of their crimes in aggression on Korea and  sought tieup with the Japanese reactionaries, thus standing  naked as a pro-Japanese lackey.    In a little more than ten months of his office, Kim Yong-sam  stripped himself bare to reveal his ugly color as "a civilian  puppet," "a civilian fascist," "a civilian separatist," "a  civilian warmaniac" and "a civilian traitor."    He is doomed to be thrown into a dustbin of history like his  predecessors.</p>

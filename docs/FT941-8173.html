			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Observer: Journo-list The race is on for the top editorial job at Le Monde, the venerable French daily paper. Jacques Lesourne, who resigned earlier this month after months of wrangling over cost-cutting, was the first non-journalist ever to hold the post of publisher. Although Lesourne managed to cut Le Monde's heavy losses, he was unable to tame the paper's rather eccentric team of journalists. No surprise then to see Le Monde returning to its old form. The two candidates for the top job are both journalists - Bruno Frappat, editorial director, and Jean-Marie Colombani, his deputy, who has bid for the post before. Le Monde wants to avoid a repetition of the six-year-long power struggle which preceded Lesourne's appointment in early 1991. In the past, the paper's staff has chosen its candidates in Swiss-style primary elections. This time the management dispensed with that formality and asked its own candidates to stand. The journalists will choose between Frappat and Colombani on March 4. On past form, the management succession seems unlikely to proceed as smoothly as the timetable suggests.</p>

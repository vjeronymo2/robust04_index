			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUDIS WILL PUMP MORE OIL, SUGGEST U.N. MOVES  </P> <P> With tens of thousands of soldiers already deployed in desert encampments near  the Kuwait border, a clearly more confident Saudi Arabia called Saturday for  the United Nations to explore military options against Iraq and said that the  kingdom is ready to pump an extra 2 million barrels of oil a day to help ease  international shortfalls.  </P> <P> Shedding some of the diplomatic caution that has so far hushed the kingdom's  public response to the Persian Gulf crisis, top Saudi officials declared that  diplomacy had "failed" to dislodge Iraqi troops from Kuwait and said "the issue  of peace and war" depends on Iraq's response to the crisis.  </P> <P> "We have tried in every way possible, through direct contact with the Iraqi  leadership and multiple contact with other Arab countries, to prevent the  consequences. We have failed," said Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al  Faisal. "We have failed for one simple reason, that throughout these efforts  Iraq has refused . . . a solution to the problem, which is withdrawal from  Kuwait and restoration of its legitimate leadership.  </P> <P> "Any diplomatic contact without these two principles," Faisal added, "is  diplomatic contact that is doomed to die."  </P> <P> The Saudi foreign minister took note of suggestions by some U.N. members that  the United Nations go beyond its call for economic sanctions and authorize  military enforcement of the embargo against Iraqi trade. "We wholeheartedly  support that action," he said.  </P> <P> Saudi officials called for an immediate meeting of the Organization of  Petroleum Exporting Countries to respond to an anticipated worldwide shortfall  of 4 million barrels of oil a day resulting from an international embargo on  Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of the tiny Persian  Gulf emirate.  </P> <P> Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazir said Saudi Arabia is prepared to pump an extra  2 million barrels of oil a day if OPEC fails to find some other resolution to  the shortfall. But OPEC countries are still likely to fall short of meeting the  worldwide shortage by as much as 1 million barrels a day at current production  capacity, Nazir said.  </P> <P> "We do not necessarily want to take unilateral action. We prefer to go through  OPEC. But if they refuse to meet, then we have no alternative," the oil  minister said. "If we discover that there is an obstinate position on the part  of some of the OPEC countries, we are not going to let the Third World  countries and other countries go down the drain."  </P> <P> Saudi officials also for the first time declared that Iraq's oil pipeline to  the kingdom has been shut off, lending official sanction to the effective halt  in operation of the 979-mile facility since an international trade embargo  nearly eliminated buyers for Iraqi oil.  </P> <P> The Saudis, previously reluctant to antagonize Iraq, had not made any official  announcement earlier, but last week quietly declined to send out tugboats to  allow two Iraqi tankers to dock at the pipeline loading facility on the Red Sea  coast at Muajjiz.  </P> <P> On Saturday, in an unusual, daylong session with American and British  television networks, newspapers and news agencies, Saudi Oil Minister Nazir  announced, "The pipeline is closed, and will remain so until the crisis is over  and the U.N. says so."  </P> <P> Privately, Saudi officials admitted that they had been waiting for American and  Arab troops to move into defensive positions before making any pronouncements  likely to antagonize Iraq, which has 170,000 troops in Kuwait, many massed near  the Saudi border.  </P> <P> Now, many Saudis are prepared to take an even harder line. The foreign minister  asserted that even if Iraq agrees to withdraw from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia will  demand "international guarantees" to assure that it is a permanent withdrawal.  </P> <P> Though Saudi Arabia has said it has no desire to interfere in Iraq's internal  affairs, some officials conceded privately that the guarantee Saudi Arabia most  wants to see for Kuwait's security is an end to the regime of Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia is providing aid to resistance fighters in Kuwait and is also  supporting efforts by the Kuwaitis to destabilize the government in Iraq,  including radio broadcasts into Baghdad, said one high-ranking Saudi official.  </P> <P> "The preparedness for such activities are under way," he said. "In our view, if  Saddam Hussein goes, his system will go with him . . . the whole structure of  the Baath Party in Iraq will fall."  </P> <P> Saudi intelligence reports for the first time show that tanks and other armored  vehicles have been deployed along Iraq's border with Saudi Arabia. Previously,  all military activity had been confined to the Kuwait-Saudi Arabia border, and  Saudi officials have not determined how to interpret the new deployment, which  one official said is still relatively small.  </P> <P> Iraqi troops in Kuwait appeared to be stationed in a large arc beginning at the  Kuwaiti capital and extending westward and then south toward the Saudi border.  Most are "dug in" in defensive positions, and the nearest large troop  concentration is about 25 miles from the Saudi border, said one official.  However, the Saudis remain alert because Iraq's troops were similarly deployed  along the Kuwaiti border shortly before the Aug. 2 invasion, he said.  </P> <P> Saudi officials have also detected the movement of large numbers of Iraqi  troops away from Iraq's border with Iran in the days since Hussein made  peacemaking overtures to end Iraq's 10-year-old conflict with Iran that halted  in a grudging cease-fire last year.  </P> <P> There is no evidence yet to show that troops from the Iranian front have been  redeployed to the Kuwaiti border, but Saudi intelligence reports do show an  estimated five or six divisions of Iraqi troops massed at the Iraq-Kuwait  border near Basra "which can reach us very quickly," one official said.  </P> <P> Iraqi troops have been seen in Kuwait with protective gear against chemical  weapons, he added.  </P> <P> Acting to contain a worldwide pricing spiral that has driven oil prices past  $28 a barrel, Saudi Arabia has asked for an "immediate" OPEC meeting to resolve  what Nazir acknowledged is "a destabilized market . . . a crisis."  </P> <P> Saudi officials maintain that the price spirals are a result of "panic pricing"  but are strongly critical of OPEC's slowness to convene a meeting to discuss a  resolution.  </P> <P> "We honestly don't see how an organization which is in a crisis refuses even to  meet to discuss the crisis," Nazir said.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia, currently producing 5.38 million barrels a day, has had requests  for production of 7.9 million barrels a day in the weeks since the crisis  began.  </P> <P> Nazir said Saudi Arabia can gear up to meet about half the  4-million-barrel-a-day shortfall caused by the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil to  the world market. "In a very, very short time, days," Nazir said. Other OPEC  countries such as Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates can, by Saudi  estimates, produce an additional 1 million barrels a day, he said.  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth, our numbers don't show so far that they can (make up  the remaining shortfall)," he said. "I'm not so sure they can completely make  up the shortage."  </P></p>

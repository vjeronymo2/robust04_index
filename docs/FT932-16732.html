			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Primitive times - Salon de Mars NO FEWER than 30,000 Parisians turned up last Tuesday for the opening night of the fifth annual Salon de Mars art fair, spread out as usual under a huge, white and badly-ventilated tent near the Eiffel Tower. They were interested in socialising, not buying, and dealers complained that collectors were unable to squeeze through the crush to the stands. But recession, competition from other fairs, slow turnover and a dearth of new items have all taken their toll this year on a Salon which started out determined to become a big international event. This year's Salon, which ends on Monday, has only 92 galleries compared with 115 last year and 120 in 1991. It quite simply lacks a lot of top dealers who used to come - like pre-Columbian expert Galerie Mermoz and antiquities dealer, Emmanuel Koutoulakis, of Paris, for example, or ancient Chinese art specialist, Gisele Croes, from Brussels. None of the really big Paris furniture dealers is present this year and a dozen stands are manned by French provincial dealers offering the sort of 18th century furniture, much of it alarmingly well varnished, which the Parisians do far better. Five British dealers, however, came over for the fair and were content. 'This is more elegant than Grosvenor House. French buyers take far greater interest in art than the British, they actually know about it and are prepared to buy it,' one of them said. Chinese art specialist Michael Goedhuis sold nearly Pounds 90,000 of art on the first day to an American and two French collectors. His neighbour, Robert Hall, from London, is showing tiny 18th and 19th century Chinese snuff bottles, which have become so popular with collectors over recent years. Carved in a variety of semi-precious materials, they are priced from a couple of hundred to over Pounds 10,000 - the most expensive one being in brilliant white and green jade, which the Chinese call 'pine needles in snow'. Martyn Gregory, from London, the world's leading gallery dealing in Chinese coast paintings - mainly 19th century works by anonymous artists in Canton for export to the West - is over for its first show in Paris. The art includes highly-imaginative Chinese portraits of a Spanish and a French couple of 1760 in gouache at Pounds 4,800 a pair, landscapes and even views of St Helena and Napoleon on his death-bed, inspired by prints, for Pounds 1,100. The Salon de Mars originally aimed to give pride of place to contemporary art, but there are only a handful of dealers this year showing many works which have been seen before elsewhere. In the field of 19th century paintings, London's Stoppenbach &amp; Delestre were alone this year with Barbizon school paintings - one Diaz and five Daubigny landscapes at FFs120,000-300,000 - and watercolours by Harpignies for FFs35,000-90,000. Mediaeval statuary is beautifully represented by Boccador and Bresset, from Paris, and the Salon has two leading dealers in the rarified field of top Art Deco furniture: Paris's Galerie Vallois has an articulated table by Printz and two lamps made by Muthesius for an Indian maharajah. The Parisian gallery, Arc en Seine, has a pair of leather armchairs by Ruhlmann, their shape inspired by an elephant's head, furniture by Jean-Michel Frank and alabaster lamps by Chareau, which quickly sold. It is in primitive art that the Salon de Mars is proving strongest, thanks to dealers such as Dutko, Ratton et Hourde, Monbrison, Dulon, Deletaille and Guimiot, from Brussels. The latter is showing 14th and 15th century bronze objects from the Lower Niger and some outstanding wooden Sepik sculptures from New Guinea - one, a bird-like flute plug, was held to embody the voice of an ancestor. Anthony Meyer, whose Left Bank Paris gallery, the only one in Europe specialising in Oceanic art, brought objects such as a Korvar, the statue of an ancestor wrapped in a scrap of the latter's shroud, and the sculpture of a mythological hero by the Yimar people, of New Guinea.</p>

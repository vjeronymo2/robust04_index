African National Congress Secretary General Cyril  Ramaphosa said a TEC team should be sent to Ciskei immediately  to relieve Brig Gqozo of his post.    He was supported by government delegate Roelf Meyer. He said  the South African Defence Force could become involved in  restoring law and order in the territory.    Ciskei representative Mickey Webb said the homeland had  requested South African Police and SA Defence Force intervention.    Mr Meyer said a South African Government representative,  Foreign Affairs Director General Rusty Evans, should be  dispatched to the homeland.    Mr Webb said it was not a hostile takeover. He said Brig  Gqozo was in agreement with the move because he wanted to save  lives and prevent destruction of property.    He said the Ciskei cabinet should draft a decree giving  effect to the TEC's resolution.    Mr Ramaphosa said the Ciskei government had lost control in  the homeland. "There is no way Brig Gzozo can begin to reinstate  himself as head of the area. It is not out of kindness that he  is stepping down."    TEC Chairman Pravin Gordhan said the TEC acknowledged that  Brig Gqozo was stepping down.    He said a two-member team from the management committee  would  be sent to Ciskei. The TEC team would be assisted by Mr Evans as  well as trade unionist Philip Dexter and Administration minister  Sam de Beer who have been appointed by the TEC to oversee civil  service rationalisation.    Mr Webb said Brig Gqozo's proposal that he step down was  tabled to the TEC at lunchtime.    Mr Ramaphosa confirmed that the SAP's [South African Police]  Internal Stability Unit had been deployed in the homeland and  suggested it be withdrawn as there were indications that they  would clash with Ciskei government troops.</p>

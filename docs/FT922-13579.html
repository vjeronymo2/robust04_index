			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour set for Militant clash LABOUR'S battle against Militant and other former members of its left wing will resume in Liverpool next week as campaigning begins for the May 7 local government elections. Twenty-one members of the Broad Left grouping are challenging Labour candidates in 20 of the city's 33 council wards. Only seven of Broad Left's 25 councillors are fighting to retain their seats. Since five of the other 18 won against official Labour opposition last year, it could be four or five years before Labour can eliminate the Broad Left at the ballot box. Last year, only one of the Broad Left's six challengers failed. Its organisation was strong and candidates stood under 'ward Labour' banners, confusing many voters. Labour hopes this time for a spillover of image from the general election campaign to counter the well-run pockets of Broad Left strength in Liverpool's inner city and poorer suburbs. 'The biggest boost for our campaign against them will be the general election results,' Mr Mike Graham, one of the party's regional officials at its north-west headquarters in Warrington, said yesterday. On the Broad Left slate is Ms Lesley Mahmood, who lost last year's Walton by-election against Mr Peter Kilfoyle, the full-time party official whose last position was as Labour's Militant-finder-general. Ms Mahmood is standing in Netherley, a ward of largely modern council housing, which was the power base of Mr Derek Hatton, the Militant-supporting, former deputy council leader. Heavyweight opposition is coming from Mr Joe Devaney, who almost won Mossley Hill from the Liberal Democrats in the 1987 general election. Mr Devaney is one of the 47 Liverpool councillors disqualified in 1987 for losses incurred when the Militant-dominated Labour group was late in setting the 1985 rates. Now that their disqualification time is up, nine of the 47 are standing - six for Labour and three for the Broad Left. Mr Devaney is one of five Labour candidates facing a Broad Left opponent.</p>

He  added that this tragedy is also a disgrace to all those who  could put an end to this issue, but do nothing and stand as  spectators. This came, during a meeting yesterday, with His  Excellency Pablo Puente, the Vatican's ambassador to Lebanon and  envoy of Pope John Paul II. The president added that the  position of America and Europe will forever remain shameful and  disgraceful. He said: In fact, their position is disgraceful  from top to bottom.    The president said: These countries not only refrain from  helping or protecting the oppressed party, but they ban it from  receiving arms to defend itself and its property. In fact,  these countries, which have the military power to deter the  oppressor and assist the oppressed, do not support justice. It  is as if they are helping the oppressor against the oppressed.    Shaykh Zayid added: The Islamic nations, which witness and  follow up these daily massacres that are taking place under the  eyes of the European countries, believe that there is a  tendentious plot against the Islamic minority in Europe. The  Islamic nations also believe there is an attempt to suppress and  liquidate the Muslims. He said: Such a thing cannot take place  in the Islamic world against any minority because Islamic law  bans any coercion against the Christian minority. At the same  time, however, Muslims each day see the Muslim people of Bosnia  being slaughtered like sheep. God may give someone time, but He  will never forget.    Regarding the dialogue between Muslims and Christians, his  highness the president of the state welcomed this dialogue for  the sake of peace and mankind's prosperity, noting that the  teachings of the heavenly religions should be applied. He said  that the Islamic world is committed to implementing Islamic law,  God's book, and the prophet's sayings. Therefore, he added, the  Christians should also apply the sound teachings of their  religion, follow their holy book, and work for the well-being  and prosperity of mankind. [passage omitted]</p>

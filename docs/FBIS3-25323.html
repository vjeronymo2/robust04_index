			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boaventura Macaulze in Nampula] </F>   [Excerpts] Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], has reiterated his  accusations against Eduardo da Silva Nihia, Mozambique  Liberation Front [Frelimo] first secretary for Nampula Province.  Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo had said Nihia is training 1,000 men to fight  Renamo if it wins the upcoming October elections. Ngonhamo said  those men were being trained in area [poligono] number two, in  Nampula District.    Addressing Mozambican reporters at Nampula airport this  morning, Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo added that Nihia had tried to train a  riot police force on the outskirts of the city of Nampula with  the aim of intimidating people during the elections. [passage  omitted]    The reporters asked Ngonhamo to discuss in depth Nihia's  alleged involvement in the training of men to destabilize the  Mozambican peace process.    [Begin Ngonhamo recording] [words indistinct] the 1,000 men  who were in area number two. Mr. Nihia was controlling that  group. On 2 February, Mr. Nihia met with those men in area  number two. It was not the provincial commander who met those  men. It was not Mozambique Armed Forces Chief of General Staff  Hama Thai or General Tobias Dai who came from Maputo to see  those men. It was not some other commander, like Defense  Minister Mr. Chipande, for instance. Instead, it was Mr. Nihia.  Why was that? [words indistinct] can it be that Mr. Nihia was  involved in a political ploy when he met those 1,000 men in area  number two? Did he go there to convince them to join Frelimo  and vote for it at the upcoming elections? (?This is the) truth.  What was being dealt with at that camp was plans to destroy the  peace process. Mr. Nihia told those soldiers that they would  not have to go into assembly areas, they would stay put in that  area, Frelimo would pay them well and they would get good  accommodation and food until the elections had been held. If  Renamo should win, those men would take up positions and attack  the Renamo government. That is precisely what happened to that  group of 350 men. There was no police commander controlling  that group. Such a police commander may have been there as a  subordinate to Mr. Nihia, who was responsible for the training  of those men. [end recording]    It has not been possible to get Nihia's response to Lt. Gen.  Ngonhamo's latest accusation, because (?Nihia is still) in  Maputo. Ngonhamo said that this morning he went to (Mupila)  assembly area, in Zambezia Province, where he found that his men  were very keen to join the future national army. He also noted  that his men were facing salt shortages. This afternoon Lt.  Gen. Ngonhamo went to Nacala to inspect the training ground for  the special forces. Noting that 62 Renamo men are already in the  city to take part in that training, Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo added that  the other men will be there by tomorrow. Renamo and the  government are each supposed to provide 300 men to the Special  Forces Battalion.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / US growth revised upwards to 3.4% The US economy grew more vigorously than previously thought in the first quarter, at an annualised rate of 3.4 per cent in real terms, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Personal consumption grew at an annualised rate of 5.2 per cent between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, an acceleration from the growth recorded in the second half of last year. The growth in gross domestic product in the first quarter was initially estimated at an annualised rate of 2.6 per cent and subsequently at 3.0 per cent, before yesterday's revision to 3.4 per cent. Similar upward revisions occurred in the fourth quarter when growth was finally put at 7 per cent, up from an initial 5.9 per cent. Employment growth figures have also been revised up in recent weeks. The latest GDP revision is significant because it confirms the economy was growing well above its long-run potential rate of expansion in the first quarter, when output was artificially depressed by a severe winter and the Californian earthquake. Despite the soft tone of recent figures for retail spending and industrial production, many forecasters are projecting growth at or above the first quarter rate in the present quarter, partly reflecting a rebound of construction and other sectors affected by adverse weather. If employment data next week are strong, hopes of a deceleration of growth in the second half could begin to fade, putting renewed domestic pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again. Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said the annualised growth rate was now probably about 4 per cent. Growth was likely to remain above trend for the next two to four quarters, reflecting lean corporate inventories, strong domestic demand for labour and economic recovery in Europe and Japan. He predicted the Fed would raise short-term rates by at least a quarter point next week, possibly by half a point to 4.75 per cent. The main upward revisions in the first quarter were for personal consumption and business investment. Federal spending and exports were revised down slightly. Broad estimates of inflation were little changed: the 'fixed-weight' GDP deflator rose at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent. In the first quarter, GDP, personal consumption and non-residential fixed investment stood 3.8 per cent, 4.4 per cent and 13.2 per cent above the same period last year.</p>

The SDRP Presidium stressed such a system should not be  aimed  against anybody but has to function effectively in order to  solve the existing conflicts and counteract potential threats  and international crises.    In this context, the SDRP said it supported Poland's  strivings for joining NATO and added that from the point of view  of Poland's interests it considered the "Partnership for Peace"  a step in the right direction though not a fully sufficient one.  The SDRP said that the initiative needs to be appropriately  specified and Poland should actively participate in this process.    "We believe that the content of the "Partnership for Peace,"  which will be specified with the participation of all the  interested parties, will produce a system of mutual links which  will provide solid foundations for a common and effective  security system on the European continent. We are aware of the  significance of Russia's participation in this extremely  important process," the SDRP said and added that it was  particularly important to create a favourable and constructive  political climate around the initiative so that the "Partnership  for Peace" plan could ensure security and stability of  democratic development to the states participating in the  process.</p>

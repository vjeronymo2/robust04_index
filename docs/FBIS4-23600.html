			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 9 SAPA -- South Africa's nine  provinces would receive their first powers on Friday, provincial  premiers said after a meeting with government ministers at the  Union Buildings in Pretoria on Thursday. "Certain powers are  definitely coming our way. They are not half as many as we  wanted to get," KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose said.    He said the first powers would be gazetted on Friday. He  referred to these as phase one powers.    PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo  Sexwale said it was not correct that premiers were up in arms  about the delay in receiving powers. He said the first powers  allotted to the provinces would be powers that allowed the  provinces to set up their administrations.    Although the provinces have been assigned certain powers by  the constitution, all powers have been temporarily assigned to  central government departments. They will be re-assigned to the  provinces when the provinces are able to prove that they have  the administrative capacity to exercise the powers.    The premiers' meeting was attended by Constitutional  Development and Provincial Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer and  Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya. Also  in attendance were Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo, the  Deputy Minister of Constitutional Development Mohammed Valli  Moosa and the deputy minister of finance, Alec Erwin.    The premiers were given a presentation of the government's  white paper on reconstruction and development which acting North  West Premier Satish Roopa said had set out structures for the  implementation and monitoring of the RDP [Research and  Development Program].    According to a statement issued by Mr Meyer and Dr Skweyiya,  Mr Naidoo gave an overview of the RDP "with a view to  encouraging development planning on provincial and local levels".    Many of the objectives of the RDP will be implemented by the  provincial governments at local level.    Not all the provinces would receive all their powers at the  same time, Mr Sexwale said. It depended on their administrative  capacity.    Eastern Transvaal Premier Mathews Phosa said the provincial  powers were "no longer an issue".    "They will be given out in phases," he said. The premiers  had  been satisfied by their meeting.    Mr Skweyiya said the assignment of powers "will be based on  the responses from the provinces before 17 June, 1994 to  submissions made by the public service commission.    "The assignment of powers can now start taking place on the  assumption that the administrative capacities to assume these  powers are in place."    The statement said government ministers would visit the  provinces over the next fortnight to discuss issues.    "A permanent forum between relevant central government  ministers and provincial premiers is to be implemented. This  forum will meet on a monthly basis," the statement said.</p>

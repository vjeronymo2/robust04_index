			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Banks in France cut interest rates to 9.75% FRANCE'S commercial banks yesterday responded to the recent fall in money market rates and to Tuesday's reduction in the Bank of France's repurchase rate by cutting base rates from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur told the National Assembly he would do 'everything possible to make sure this fall in interest rates continues'. The reduction was triggered on Tuesday night by Credit du Nord and yesterday followed by other banks. French base rates had been held at 10 per cent since December as the French authorities battled to defend the franc from speculative attack in the run-up to last month's parliamentary elections. The franc has strengthened since the conservatives' return to power and the announcement last week of Mr Balladur's economic reform package. Yesterday the D-Mark closed unchanged on the day at FFr3.380. However the French stock market slipped on profit taking, following its surge on Tuesday. The CAC 40 Index fell by 0.17 per cent to close at 2,015.43. The base rate reduction is too small to alleviate the pressure on the French economy, still squeezed by sluggish consumer spending and investment. Mr Philippe Toussaint, chief executive of Credit du Nord, said the cut was 'an essential gesture'.</p>

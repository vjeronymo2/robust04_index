			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDELMAN BLASTS PROPOSED REMAP;  </P> <P> REDISTRICTING: CONSERVATIVE SUPERVISORS PUSH PLAN TO SATISFY COURT AND PROTECT  THEIR MAJORITY. APPROVAL IS EXPECTED TODAY.  </P> <P> With a court-imposed deadline just hours away, a bitterly divided Los Angeles  County Board of Supervisors is expected today to adopt a redistricting plan  that would place liberal Supervisor Ed Edelman in a new, predominantly Latino  district.  </P> <P> Edelman broke his silence Tuesday to angrily denounce the plan, which he said  is being pushed by the board's conservative majority. The board, after meeting  behind closed doors, delayed a vote on a plan until this morning.  </P> <P> Conservative Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana said they expect the  plan to be approved by a 3-2 vote. "The idea is to maintain our majority," Dana  said.  </P> <P> The board's third conservative, Pete Schabarum, would not say how he will vote,  but remarked, "Mr. Edelman has been a target of mine for years."  </P> <P> Supervisors face a deadline of 3 p.m. today to submit a new redistricting plan  to a federal judge, who ruled that current supervisorial district boundaries  discriminate against Latinos.  </P> <P> The plan under consideration Tuesday would expose Edelman, a 16-year board  veteran, to a strong challenge from a Latino. It also would change the  political representation for many of the county's 8 1/2 million residents.  </P> <P> Edelman said he was hopeful of persuading his colleagues to approve an  alternate plan that would expand the board from five seats to seven. "What  they're doing is preserving the conservative majority at any cost," Edelman  said angrily. "This is a sham. I can probably win (in the new Latino district).  It's not going to lead to a Hispanic victory."  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon has scheduled a July 5 hearing to decide  whether to accept the plan. He has said that if the plan fails to correct the  violations of the federal Voting Rights Act, he will redraw district lines  himself after consulting with plaintiffs in the case.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs -- the U.S. Justice Department, the Mexican American Legal  Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union -- have  until the July 5 hearing to respond to the plan.  </P> <P> Kenyon earlier this month ruled that the five Anglo supervisors intentionally  discriminated against Latinos by drawing district boundaries in 1981 in a way  that weakened the political influence of the county's 3 million Latinos. The  supervisors, who have spent $4 million fighting the case, are appealing the  ruling.  </P> <P> Under the conservatives' proposal, a new Latino district, bearing the  designation of Edelman's 3rd District, would stretch from El Sereno and Lincoln  Heights through downtown Los Angeles, east to El Monte and San Gabriel and  southwest to Montebello and Pico Rivera.  </P> <P> Edelman referred to the new district as "octopus-shaped" because it would have  tentacles reaching out from the Latino core around downtown Los Angeles into a  number of neighborhoods. For example, Edelman said his Westwood home would be  linked to the new district by a long "finger."  </P> <P> Supervisors refused to make the map public.  </P> <P> Edelman complained that his colleagues sprung the map on him without warning at  a closed-door meeting Tuesday.  </P> <P> "They're doing a job on Ed," said Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who said he will  stick with his fellow liberal in opposing any plan that places Edelman at  political risk.  </P> <P> Edelman said he favors carving out a Latino district from Schabarum's 1st  District, noting that Schabarum is retiring. The conservative supervisors fear  that such a move would tip the balance of power on the board.  </P> <P> Dana said the supervisors delayed a vote until today "because we're still  making minor adjustments."  </P> <P> Edelman's district currently runs from heavily Latino East Los Angeles to  affluent Bel-Air and includes portions of the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Under the board's plan, Edelman would lose parts of the affluent and liberal  Westside that form a large part of his political base. Those neighborhoods  would be added to Dana and Hahn's districts.  </P> <P> In such a new district, Edelman could face a strong challenge from a Latino.  Los Angeles City Council members Richard Alatorre and Gloria Molina and U.S.  Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) have expressed interest in running for  supervisor in a new Latino district.  </P> <P> Under the plan, Antonovich would pick up San Fernando Valley neighborhoods from  Edelman. Dana's district would extend into a small portion of the Valley for  the first time.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs have asked Kenyon to throw out results of the June election for  two supervisorial seats and schedule a November election in the new 1st and 3rd  districts. If the judge agrees, filing for the seats would be reopened.  </P></p>

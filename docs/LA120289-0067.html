			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STOLZ DECIDES NEW MEXICO STATE DOESN'T HAVE RIGHT JOB FOR HIM  </P> <P> Denny Stolz, former San Diego State football coach, said Friday he has  withdrawn from consideration to fill the coaching vacancy at New Mexico State.  </P> <P> "Both professionally and financially, it was an attractive opportunity," Stolz  said. "But it just was not the right job for me now."  </P> <P> Sources had said that Stolz was the leading candidate to succeed Mike Knoll,  who was fired two weeks ago after an 0-11 season and a 4-40 record in four  seasons.  </P> <P> Stolz and his wife, Cena, took a two-day visit to the New Mexico State campus  in Las Cruces last week.  </P> <P> "We gave it a lot of thought," Stolz said. "It was not an easy decision."  </P> <P> Stolz, 55, said he would prefer to look for an opportunity in professional  football but currently has no offers.  </P> <P> The late-afternoon announcement apparently caught New Mexico State officials by  surprise.  </P> <P> Reached at his home Friday night, Athletic Director Al Gonzales, said: "I have  no statement until I speak with him."  </P> <P> Stolz was fired last year in his third year at SDSU. Stolz had a 16-19 record  and led the Aztecs to the 1986 Western Athletic Conference title. He has  remained at the school as the men's golf coach.  </P></p>

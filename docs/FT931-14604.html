			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Major may face MPs' demand to divert cash into coal RADICAL proposals for the government to assume direct responsibility for financing the decommissioning of ageing atomic power stations while diverting some funds to the coal industry are contained in the draft of a report by an influential committee of backbench MPs. The eagerly-awaited chairman's draft report - sent to MPs on the trade and industry select committee this weekend - calls for the government to take over from Nuclear Electric more than Pounds 8bn of liabilities relating to future decommissioning costs. In return, the state-owned utility would stop receiving the sums raised from the nuclear levy, a charge designed to cover these liabilities which will be paid by all electricity consumers until 1998. The draft coincides with strains within the cabinet on how to rescue some of the 31 pits threatened with closure without compromising the government's long-standing opposition to state intervention to prop up ailing industries. Some senior cabinet members - backed by the Treasury - are fiercely opposed to suggestions from the Department of Trade and Industry that a new levy or an overt subsidy might be introduced to keep open loss-making pits for several years. They see the issue as a crucial test of whether Mr John Major is ready to stick by free-market principles which guided Conservative policy during the 1980s. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, underlined at a cabinet committee meeting last week his opposition to anything beyond a strictly limited one-off payment to the coal industry. His stance is backed by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, and by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary. The MPs' draft report says the bulk of the money raised by the nuclear levy would continue to be set aside by the government for nuclear decommissioning. But a portion would be channelled into coal to help finance the 'greening' of the industry and to provide a lifeline for currently unprofitable pits. The proposals are thought to be driven in part by the assumption that actual decommissioning costs will be less than previously supposed. Money no longer likely to be needed for this could therefore be earmarked for coal without asking electricity consumers to pay more to underwrite the subsidy. It remains to be seen how Tory MPs on the committee - who include Sir Cranley Onslow, a former 1922 committee chairman, and Mr Michael Clark, former chairman of the energy select committee - will react to the draft report when the cross-party body meets to discuss it line-by-line tomorrow. Tory committee members indicated yesterday that while disagreement was likely on certain specific details, there was general agreement that the market for domestic coal must be expanded. They expressed doubt that anyone's reservations would be strong enough to insist upon tabling a minority report. Other recommendations are thought to include: postponing liberalisation of the regional electricity market; changing arrangements enabling France to supply up to 6 per cent of electricity sold in England and Wales; and stopping the switch to oil-based fuel for power stations. The report is also believed to advocate establishing an energy commission to oversee energy markets. The DTI is known to have played down the idea of diverting part of the nuclear levy to other purposes such as subsidising cleaner coal technology. Pit strike ballot, Page 7</p>

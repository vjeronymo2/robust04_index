			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Observer: Jolly frustrated Nice try. Next February being the 50th anniversary of Yalta, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute wanted to mark the famous meeting between FDR, Stalin and Churchill in some special way. The plan was to invite a troupe of scholars, historians and survivors of the original event to Ukraine. Sadly, however, commemorating the accord which essentially delineated cold war Europe has proved unfeasible in the chaos that is the post cold war era. So it fell to Verne Newton, director of the FDR Library, to call the thing off. Livadia Palace 'offers a beautiful setting', he writes, but the conditions sound like a challenge even for the most ambitious conference organiser. 'Water is trucked into villages such as Yalta because of a drought that has dried up the springs and other sources of water. The fuel shortage is also acute which means there is little heat available.' There are other problems as well, apparently, 'such as an outbreak of cholera'. Hence the tentative rescheduling to either Ditchley or Cambridge, in April. Not the same, somehow.</p>

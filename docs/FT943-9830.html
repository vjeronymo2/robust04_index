			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Language is all at sea Sir, With reference to Mr Jacques Toubon's somewhat quixotic campaign to purify the French language, I recently attended a meeting in Paris where the rather suspect word 'leadership' cropped up. When its meaning was queried by one the participants it was quickly translated by another member of the group into the French equivalent of 'the chairman's yacht'.

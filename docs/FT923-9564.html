Mr Michael Mates, Ulster security minister, said after visiting the scene of the double bomb attack, which caused Pounds 3m worth of damage, that it was 'almost impossible to guard against' such activity. The first bomb went off after an IRA warning. As clearing up was under way, the second exploded without an alert.</p>

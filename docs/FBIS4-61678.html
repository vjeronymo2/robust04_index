			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No 86 (576)] </F>   [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk hopes that the Supreme  Soviet of a new convocation will ratify the agreements on  economic cooperation between the United States and Ukraine  signed this January during Kravchuk's visit to the United  States. Kravchuk declared about this during his meeting with  the head of the U.S. economic delegation Nicholas Burns in Kiev.  The delegation of the American experts came to Ukraine to get  acquainted with the economic situation in the republic and to  determine possibilities to use economic aid to Ukraine totaling  350 million dollars.    After this meeting Kravchuk reported to journalists that the  United States intends to render assistance to Ukraine in order  to re-struct [as received] its economy and to develop  cooperation with the republic in the field of trade and  investments.    In Burns' words, a Ukrainian-American fund in support of  entrepreneurs in Ukraine will be created this summer. It will  grant credits and loans to Ukrainian private entrepreneurs.    Our Interfax correspondent reports from Kiev that at the  negotiations with the members of the American economic  delegation underway in Kiev the Ukrainian party proposed to use  part of the allocated credit as a pledge to receive credit from  one of the large foreign banks. According to Ukraine's  Economics Minister Roman Shpek, Kiev is not ready "to use 350  million dollars in the near future."    Leadership of the Ukrainian cabinet was critical of  Washington's position which presented too many provisions in  order to grant concrete economic assistance. In particular, as  Vice Premier Valentin Landik said, in accordance with the  proposals of the American party 95 million dollars in support of  private undertaking would be allocated only after refusal from  rent as a means of denationalization of property.    In the opinion of the American experts, rent can hinder  "voucher privatization" which they view as the most efficient  method to reform the property.    Landik called members of the American delegation to decline  the above mentioned provisions and private calls "to start  reforms."    In Landik's words, diminishing of the inflation to 5.7  percent and beginning of privatization testify to the fact that  reforms in Ukraine have been started and they need concrete  support.    At the negotiations the American party also persisted in  introduction of a market exchange rate of the Ukrainian  karbovanets with respect to hard currency. For his part, Landik  declared that "the state will preserve regulation of the  karbovanets rate in the course of the crisis' surmounting."    In his interview with Interfax on Thursday Landik declared  that the resolution of the Ukrainian government On Urgent  Measures to Surmount the Payment Crisis issued on Wednesday  called to grant an opportunity to enterprises "to unfold their  wings" and to go out of the non-payments' crisis peculiar to all  former Soviet states.    According to Landik, lowering of tariffs for the value added  tax (to 20 percent) and replacement of income tax for profit  (since January 1, 1995) should assist in improving financial  situation of the Ukrainian enterprises.    As Landik noted, introduction of increased rates for customs  tariffs for import of alcoholic beverages and tobacco goods is  primarily intended to protect a Ukrainian producer. At the same  time he pointed out that this measure does not concern import  from CIS countries, including Russia. "From now on import  tariffs will be revised every week, this will help to quickly  react to the market's economic conditions," Landik reported.    Commenting the situation on the introduction of state  monopoly for production and trade with alcoholic beverages,  Landik said that Ukraine's Cabinet of Minister had examined  Russia's experience but it would predominantly use Austria's  experience.</p>

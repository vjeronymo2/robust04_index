			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Military impact area. This definition of military impact area is the general definition the Department has been using for some time. Although few areas have been designated as military impact areas, the ones that have been so designated have been isolated markets with little housing market other than the military base. However, based on the comments, we have revised the interim rule language to clarify and expand the definition of military impact areas. The administrative instructions will also discuss procedures for making of military impact determinations based on these regulatory standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 266.210&blank;HUD-retained review functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters 3 and 9 expressed concerns about the review functions retained by HUD. The commenters believe that the ``dual processing'' will result in processing delays, stating that this may limit the program's effectiveness. Both commenters commended the Department's efforts to seek statutory changes in the legislation that would eliminate any legal requirements for the dual processing system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The major HUD-retained review is the environmental review. At the time of the interim rule, HUD was not authorized to delegate this review. The Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 has now provided authority to delegate this review. The Department currently is developing a rule to implement this new delegation authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 266.215&blank;Functions delegated by HUD to HFAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments (1, 7) addressed the rule's requirement that cost certification functions be performed subject to terms specified by the Commissioner, and a provision in the draft handbook that the cost certification be in a form acceptable to the HFA. The commenters recommended that these two provisions, which seem to be conflicting, be clarified. The commenters believe that, under the statute authorizing the program, HFAs are to use their own underwriting standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation and handbook procedures which relate to cost certification referenced by the commenter are not in conflict with one another. Each provision relates to a different stage of the cost certification process. The handbook provision sets forth what procedures that a mortgagor of a mortgage insured under section 542(c) must follow when submitting cost certification to the HFA. Section 266.215 sets forth what standards (those established by the Commissioner) the HFA must follow in developing cost certification procedures to impose on mortgagors of projects to be insured pursuant to section 542(c). HUD standards require that HFAs establish cost certification procedures which take into consideration the underwriting procedures utilized by the HFA to process the loan. These cost certification procedures are designed to ensure that the actual costs approved were in fact incurred by the mortgagor and that such costs bear a direct relationship to the underwriting utilized in processing the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 266.225&blank;Labor standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters (1, 6, and 7) objected to the requirement that HFAs monitor the administration of the Davis-Bacon Act. Commenter 6 stated that compliance monitoring should not be delegated to entities without authority or compensation for its enforcement. Commenter 1 objected to the provision that HFAs bear financial responsibility for violations, stating that compliance with Davis-Bacon is the responsibility of the owner and contractor. Commenter 7 agreed, stating that no financial liability should be placed on HFAs except for gross negligence in fulfilling reasonable responsibilities to notify applicants of the applicability of Davis-Bacon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD Responses.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Risk-Sharing program delegates to HFAs, to the maximum extent possible, the responsibilities for processing, underwriting, servicing and other aspects of program operation of projects. The ministerial functions of labor standards requirements comprise one of those delegated tasks. While HUD retains the enforcement function for labor standards, HFAs are delegated the payroll review and routine interviews generally carried out as part of the construction inspection function. This is consistent with the Department's long-standing delegation of routine Davis-Bacon functions to States and localities under the Community Development Block Grant program. The financial liability provision is the same as other delegations of labor standards functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Disease fear as Bosnia fighting flares AN 11-YEAR old girl was killed and 11 children were wounded yesterday during a renewed Serbian bombardment of Sarajevo, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. Relief workers reiterated that the situation was becoming unbearable in the besieged Bosnian capital. They said blood plasma could not be kept without power to run refrigerators. UN officials have also expressed grave concern about the possible outbreak of typhoid and cholera because of the lack of electricity and running water. Meanwhile, General Rasim Delic, commander of the Moslem-led Bosnian army, ordered his troops to grant safe passage to two Bosnian Croat commanders blockaded inside a Canadian UN base in central Bosnia. Sarajevo radio said UN officials mediated their release in exchange for four Moslems held by Croat troops. Elsewhere in Bosnia, Serb and Croat forces used 'all available weapons' to step up joint attacks on Maglaj, Zavidovici and Zepce, the strategic triangle of towns in north-central Bosnia, Sarajevo radio reported. At least five people were killed when fighters from the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) shelled Mostar in the south-west. Trapped Moslems were 'literally dying' without water or food in soaring temperatures, the radio said. Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the French president, yesterday travelled to Belgrade to plead for the release of Mr Vuk Draskovic, the jailed opposition leader. Government physicians yesterday said Mr Draskovic's condition had 'deteriorated.' He began a hunger strike at the weekend to press the Serb authorities to release him.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Yeltsin signs decree on free sale of land PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday signed an historic decree allowing the free sale of land, in a move crucial to the reform of Russian agriculture, writes Leyla Boulton from Moscow. The decree follows two years of wrangling, during which the now-dissolved Russian parliament had accepted private ownership of land but set a 10-year moratorium on its sale by private citizens. Yesterday's decree lays the foundations for a mortgage system, enabling banks to lend money to farmers using land as collateral, and sets out reforms to the state and collective farms which still dominate Russia's ailing agricultural sector. However, Mr Victor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, said the decree - which has yet to be published in its final version - does not allow foreigners to buy land. They would be allowed to lease it 'under certain conditions', which he did not spell out.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking unsettles equity market THE latest government fund-ing via the gilts market, some Pounds 2.5bn of stock, diverted attention away from an equity market still suffering from the lingering effects of post-election profit-taking and worries about a wave of rights issues. The FT-SE 100-share index ended a much quieter session than has been the case during the past two weeks a net 12.8 lower at 2,625.8. Dealers said equities began on a defensive note and stayed that way for the rest of the day in spite of closing well above the session's lowest levels. It was also pointed out that activity in the Footsie future, which has hit record levels over the past couple of weeks, was much reduced yesterday. The Footsie kicked off with a 21-point decline at 2,617.6, mirroring persistent weakness on the Tokyo market over the Easter holiday period, and a poor showing by Wall Street on Monday, when that market came under pressure. At its worst level the Footsie was down some 23 points within minutes of the official opening. Little real selling pressure emerged after this marking down, however, and the market quietly clawed its way back around midsession before slipping again and then picking up approaching the close. Wall Street, which opened higher but then began to lose ground as London closed, was seen as one of the reasons behind the UK market's uncertainty. Turnover levels provided the real clue to the day's activity. By five o'clock turnover had reached a miserable 420.1m shares. This figure compares with the near 900m shares that changed hands last Thursday, London's most recent trading session, and the previous day's 829m shares. Official figures released by the Stock Exchange showed that the value of retail, or customer, business on the London market last week increased from Monday's Pounds 1.22bn to Pounds 1.77bn on Thursday. Marketmakers were by no means depressed by the decline. 'We have had to deal with more than a touch of dullness from Tokyo and a poor showing by Wall Street, and we have come through it very well,' said one trader. He added that the market was happy to accommodate a bout of profit-taking and that any prolonged selling pressure would uncover some strong institutional demand. 'The market feels good, as good as at any time in the past few months, and has not been shaken by Tokyo or Wall Street; they are all accoun-ted for,' he went on to say. Agency brokers adopted a similar tone. One said that since the election result 'the market has gone up in a straight line, any correction has got to be seen as healthy'. Pharmaceutical stocks, notably Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, led the market's retreat, upset by what were viewed as poor figures released last week by US drugs group Merck. The steep declines in the two drug groups were said to have been responsible for around 9 points of the market's fall. Store shares made good progress, a specialist commenting: 'The consumer is not dead and buried yet.' Property issues, apparently boosted by broker Kleinwort Benson, were especially firm.</p>

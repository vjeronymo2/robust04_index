			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Zvenigorod (Moscow region) TASS -- The Communist  Party of the Russian Federation came out against the memorandum  on civic peace and accord, which is to be signed on April 28.  Participants in the Communist Party's two-day national  conference, which was completed on Sunday, said the party  regarded itself as "component part of the union of Communist  parties -- CPSU aimed at gradual consolidation of Soviet  Communists."    Delegates to the conference passed a total of seven  documents, including theses to the Communist Party's programme  "from crisis to steady development," a resolution "on patriotism  and attitude towards the ruling regime," a document "the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation on the way to accord  for Russia," as well as a reolution on the results of the recent  meeting of communist leaders of former Soviet republics.    The conference was held not exactly in the way the Communist  Party's leader Gennadiy Zyuganov expected to. Although his  moderate patriotic line was not subjected to open criticism, the  documents adopted by the conference contradict in certain  respects the course pursued by the current party leadership.    First, some amendments were introduced into the draft theses  to the party's programme, which shifted the "state-patriotic"  accent towards a greater "international" character of the  programme. Second (which was to a considerable degree due to  member of the editing commission Anatoliy Lukyanov, one of the  August 1991 coup plotters), excluded from the draft document  "the Communist Party of the Russian Federation on the way  towards accord for Russia" was a provision saying early  elections may become unnecessary if effective agreement on civic  peace is reached at the negotiating table.    The resolution on the results of the recent meeting of  communist leaders from former Soviet republics was passed also  on Lukyanov's proposal. The meeting was held in Zvenigorod,  outside Moscow, on April 22. The resolution says the Communist  Party "regards itself component part of the Union of Communist  Parties, but retains organizational autonomy and its own  programme and charter." According to Lukyanov, this is  "essential advance as compared with associate membership."    Zyuganov did not seem very enthusiastic about the prospect  of  the Communist Party's joining the Orthodox Union of Communist  Parties headed by Oleg Shenin. Instead, he backed the idea of  setting up a new association to unite communist parties of the  former Soviet Union, which is to be called a "Union of  Internationalists." This issue is most likely to be raised at  the coordinating meeting of communist leaders of former Soviet  republics this coming May.    However, all this by no means proves to any split in the  party: All documents were approved nearly unanimously. But the  general impression was that the Communist Party obviously lacks  unity, and its leader finds it rather difficult to combine the  party's new parliamentary image with feelings of grass roots  members and certain leaders.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak's planned visit to Japan in mid-April is likely to mark  "the new phase of closer and deeper ties" between the two  countries, an Egyptian state minister said in Tokyo Friday [1  April]. "Japan should play much more central role in the  economic development in Egypt," Yusuf Butrus-Ghali, state  minister for international cooperation, said at a press meeting.    During his four-day stay in Japan prior to Mubarak's  scheduled visit, Butrus-Ghali met with Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and senior officials of  the International Trade and Industry Ministry and other  ministries and agencies.    He also spoke to Japanese business leaders about their  on-going economic reform programs in Egypt at an investment  seminar organized by the Federation of Economic Organizations.  Ten Egyptian business leaders are also accompanying  Butrus-Ghali, he added.    The state minister said he briefed Japanese Government and  business leaders about the successful results of economic reform  program in Egypt towards self-sustaining and marketed-economy.    "We have great faith in the way Japan has achieved its  economic success," Butrus-Ghali said. "We are here to request  Japan help us to achieve the similar success through technical  assistance."    He cited "export promotion, industry policy management and  management of monetary policy" as the fields of possible  Japanese technical assistance. However, when he was asked about  diminishing U.S. aid to Egypt, he said that the current economic  reform program aims at a "self-sustained economy without  reliance on external assistance."    Butrus-Ghali also said President Mubarak will discuss with  Japanese leaders "all aspects of bilateral relations," Middle  East and African issues as "Egypt represents Middle East and  Africa."    Butrus-Ghali is scheduled to return to Cairo on Saturday.</p>

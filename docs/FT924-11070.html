			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Letter: Infrastructure, not houses Sir, I must disagree with Mr A J Gooding (Letters, October 23). I believe that it would be unwise to increase house building at this time. We have never had so many empty houses - the problem in getting people to buy them] The fact is that purchasers are not prepared to pay the asking price for the properties on offer. What used to be a commendable objective to own your own home had become in recent years a path to untold riches, or so we were led to believe. And it was double MIRAS which helped to fuel this myth. I do not accept that additional tax incentives should be offered. I believe that property prices must continue to fall until they become affordable. The only other option would be to allow inflation to increase in order to ease the mortgage repayment problem. The high price of property does not relate to the cost of production but to the expectation of capital gains. Too much of Britain's wealth is tied up in property. However, there are many desperately needed infrastructure projects in the pipeline which would improve our manufacturing ability and provide employment in the construction industry. We should take advantage of the competitive rates on offer. David Brown, 302 Ford Green Road, Stoke on Trent ST6 8LS</p>

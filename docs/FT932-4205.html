			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: SmithKline Beecham SmithKline's sale of two batches of consumer brands seems odd. Sara Lee appears to have negotiated a striking bargain in picking up a business with trading margins of 22 per cent on a multiple of just 9 times after-tax profits. The price of the disposal to Wella was not disclosed. But it is a fair bet that the two deals will dilute SmithKline's earnings this year. SmithKline's logic is that it will now be able to rationalise the manufacturing plants in its consumer products division. A hefty Pounds 100m rationalisation charge emphasises the scale of the task. Whatever the industrial sense, SmithKline will have to work hard to generate better financial returns than those squeezed from bubble baths and Brylcreem.</p>

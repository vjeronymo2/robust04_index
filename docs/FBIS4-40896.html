			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Mykhaylo Pavlovskyy, chairman of Ukraine's  Supreme Council Commission for Nuclear Safety and Nuclear  Policy, informed a UNIAN correspondent in an interview on 20  June that the main tasks now facing the commission are the  organization of the safe work of nuclear power stations (the  burial of nuclear waste is included in this too) and the  elaboration of a concept of the development of power engineering  as a whole, and nuclear power in particular.    Regarding parliament's possible rejection of Ukraine's  accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as a  non-nuclear state, Pavlovskyy replied: "This issue will not be  raised. There can be no going back." (As UNIAN has already  reported, deputies from the Union of Officers of Ukraine are to  address an initiative to parliament on Ukraine returning to  nuclear status.)    Concerning international assistance in converting facilities  of the military-industrial complex, in the opinion of the  commission chairman, efficient assistance is that which is  directed at specific programs. However, he believes that one  can hardly expect such targeted assistance in the near future.</p>

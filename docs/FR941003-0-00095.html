The couplings or equivalent devices must be installed at all fuel tank-to-fuel line connections, tank-to-tank interconnects, and at other points in the fuel system where local structural deformation could lead to the release of fuel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The design and construction of self-sealing breakaway couplings must incorporate the following design features: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The load necessary to separate a breakaway coupling must be between 25 to 50 percent of the minimum ultimate failure load (ultimate strength) of the weakest component in the fluid-carrying line.

The attachment of fuel tanks and fuel system components to local rotorcraft structure, whether frangible or locally deformable, must be designed such that its separation or relative local deformation will occur without rupture or local tear-out of the fuel tank or fuel system component that will cause fuel leakage. The ultimate strength of frangible or deformable attachments must be as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The load required to separate a frangible attachment from its support structure, or deform a locally deformable attachment relative to its support structure, must be between 25 and 50 percent of the minimum ultimate load (ultimate strength) of the weakest component in the attached system. In no case may the load be less than 300 pounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A frangible or locally deformable attachment must separate or locally deform as intended whenever its ultimate load (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is applied in the modes most likely to occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) All frangible or locally deformable attachments must comply with the fatigue requirements of &sect;29.571. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Separation of fuel and ignition sources. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To provide maximum crash resistance, fuel must be located as far as practicable from all occupiable areas and from all potential ignition sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other basic mechanical design criteria. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Fuel tanks, fuel lines, electrical wires, and electrical devices must be designed, constructed, and installed, as far as practicable, to be crash resistant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rigid or semirigid fuel tanks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Rigid or semirigid fuel tank or bladder walls must be impact and tear resistant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Section 29.963 is amended by removing paragraph (b); by redesignating paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) as (b), (c), and (d) respectively; by revising redesignated paragraph (b); and by adding a new paragraph (e) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;29.963  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Fuel tanks: general. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Each flexible fuel tank bladder or liner must be approved or shown to be suitable for the particular application and must be puncture resistant. Puncture resistance must be shown by meeting the TSO&hyph;C80, paragraph 16.0, requirements using a minimum puncture force of 370 pounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Each fuel tank installed in personnel compartments must be isolated by fume-proof and fuel-proof enclosures that are drained and vented to the exterior of the rotorcraft.

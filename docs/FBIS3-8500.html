			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian </F> Democratic Movement, by Peter Toth; place and date not given:  "Shall We Be the Pariah of Europe?"]    [Text] [Toth] You have returned from a meeting of the  European Democratic Union [EDU] Steering Committee. Did you  discuss with Andreas Khol, the EDU secretary general, the  petition for a referendum [initiated by the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia], which he had called undemocratic a few  days earlier?    [Carnogursky] I discussed this issue with Andreas Khol at  the margin of the meeting. He confirmed his position that the  EDU and the Council of Europe would consider the exclusion of  elected deputies from parliament undemocratic. The issue of the  observation of democratic rules in Slovakia would be raised in  the Council of Europe in that case. As a matter of fact, this  problem is known also from Albania, where a group of deputies  broke away from the Democratic Party. This party, too, wanted  to deal with this problem like Vladimir Meciar, but it finally  abandoned its intention on the basis of warnings from  international organizations. These deputies now represent an  independent club of deputies in the Albanian parliament.    [Toth] You have spent approximately one week in the West.  What is the view there of Slovakia, which is experiencing a  crisis?    [Carnogursky] Slovakia is slowly but surely becoming the  pariah of Europe. Compared with all other countries of the  continent, it is declining.    [Toth] The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] used to have  a relatively good position in the EDU, particularly from the  viewpoint of lobbying. Do you think that your credibility, or  the effectiveness of KDH lobbying, might suffer, in view of the  political and economic crisis in Slovakia?    [Carnogursky] The KDH's credibility will not suffer, but the  effectiveness of lobbying will because it can only be done to a  certain degree. Simply, when Slovakia gets itself into too many  "troubles," these cannot be mitigated by lobbying.    [Toth] What does this mean for us, and what should be  changed for Slovak diplomacy to gain scope for lobbying?    [Carnogursky] A wide range of steps is involved, which I am  unable to enumerate at present. But rendering impossible a  legislative amendment that would allow the exclusion from  parliament of deputies [who have left the party, on the ticket  of which they had been elected] would definitely be one of these  steps. In economic policy, the generation of a budget deficit  and the borrowing of money from abroad that is not reasonably  covered must not continue. And a foreign policy must not  continue, about which it is not clear where it is heading.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Pretty penny on the price of a pinta: A shake-up that will unleash competition on the UK milk market As 300 dairy farmers converge on London's Queen Elizabeth conference centre today, for the last annual general meeting of the Milk Marketing Board, they fear that the milk market is about to turn sour. The meeting coincides with final passage of the Agriculture Bill, which will abolish the board and its statutory monopoly over milk purchasing in the UK. The end of the monopoly under which farmers must sell their milk to the milk board, which then sells it to dairies, will unleash free-market forces on an industry which has been strictly controlled for 60 years. Competition could encourage a confusing free-for-all, which could, ironically, lead to consumers paying a higher price for a 'pinta'. Quoted dairy companies have already seen their share prices fall as investors fear the new regime will hit profits. The changes in the milk industry bear the hallmarks of the government's privatisation of the energy industry, particularly British Gas, which has faced years of regulatory struggle and investigation by competition authorities because it was privatised as a monopoly. The milk board system - the sole milk outlet for the UK's 29,000 dairy farmers - was set up in 1933, when five boards were formed; one covering England and Wales, which now accounts for more than 80 per cent of the UK's milk production, three in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. All five are to be abolished. Their monopoly developed because farmers needed to forge themselves into a strong sales body to counter the buying power of the large dairy companies. According to one dairy executive: 'In the 1930s farmers were crudely abused by the dairy companies,' which were buying milk when they needed it, but refusing to take it in slack periods. The board system brought order to the market. Farmers sell their milk to the board, which pays them the same 'pool' price, regardless of the quantity of milk sold or the distance the tanker must travel to their farm. Farmers have come to rely on the daily tanker collections and monthly milk cheque. 'The milk board system is strong in the farmer's culture, and farmers are conservative people,' said one dairy executive. Farmers are worried about the effect of the reforms. 'I can well remember my father pouring milk down the drain and, frankly, it frightens me to death does this new set-up,' said one Yorkshire dairy farmer. The milk board for England and Wales will become Milk Marque on April 1 next year, reformed as a voluntary co-operative. Its final proposals have still to be agreed by the government. The other boards are expected to announce similar plans. Milk Marque hopes to sign up most of the farmers selling to the board and so retain more than 80 per cent of milk production in England and Wales. If it achieves that aim, it will give farmers the security of price and collection many seek. But it could be open to accusations of abusing its dominant market position if it forces up prices to dairy company buyers, which in turn may pass them to consumers. Several dairy companies and food processors - such as Northern Foods, Nestle and MD Foods - plan to challenge Milk Marque by buying their milk direct from farmers or setting up their own co-operatives. They argue that Milk Marque will, in effect, be merely a milk broker, which will add to consumers' costs without providing any benefits. The battle to sign up farmers has begun. Advocates of Milk Marque are playing on some farmers' fears that the difficulties of the pre-1933 era will return. 'We're dealing with some large and very powerful buyers and our only hope is to stand united,' said Mr Meurig Raymond, whose South Wales farm has 500 cows. 'As a farmer, if you tie your fortunes to just one company, you will rise and fall with the success of that company and not have the broad selling power that will be associated with Milk Marque,' said Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of the Milk Marketing Board who will head the new organisation. 'We're not just a milk broker; we're the farmer's marketing and distribution department.' Mr Dare is hinting at higher prices as an inducement for farmers to join him. He believes a more competitive market will mean price increases of up to 10 per cent. In 1992-93 the 'pool' price was 21p a litre, and is expected to be 22p-23p this year. That could rise to as much as 25p a litre by 1995, according to Mr Dare. Still higher prices are being suggested by the Northern Milk Partnership, the leading rival to Milk Marque, set up as a 50-50 joint venture between Northern Foods and the farmers who will supply it. 'Northern will pay a milk price higher than the Milk Marque pool price,' promises the brochure sent by the partnership to 17,000 dairy farmers. It also assures farmers of daily collections and monthly cheques. Northern Foods buys 2bn litres of milk a year, 17 per cent of total production in England and Wales, and aims to secure all its supplies through NMP. Mr Neil Davidson, senior operating executive in charge of milk policy at Northern Foods, said it is 'very confident' of getting the milk it needs. Some dairy groups - such as Northern Foods, Unigate and Avonmore Foods  - believe they can offer more to farmers for their milk because they already pay a premium to the Milk Marketing Board under the current arcane system. Milk is sold at different prices according to its use. Liquid milk costs more than milk for cheese and butter so some companies pay more for supplies. Farmers are thus in the enviable position of seeing milk buyers squabble over their loyalty. But who pays for the higher prices that farmers may receive for their milk? Mr Dare contends that increased payments for farmers will not necessarily mean a rise in customers' prices. He says that dairy companies and processors - particularly butter and cheese makers - should absorb the higher costs because they will be getting a better service and assured supplies. Dairy companies believe that Milk Marque should absorb some of the potential price rise by cutting costs, something Mr Dare is committed to achieving. Northern Foods on the other hand pledges to pass increased costs to the consumer. Mr Davidson said: 'Any increase in milk prices will have to be recovered from the marketplace.' Prices could rise anyway, because of the tight market for milk in the UK. When the milk board system was set up there was a surplus of milk, giving the dairy companies the upper hand. Now, after nearly 10 years of European Community milk quotas, the UK produces only about 85 per cent of its needs, with most of the rest imported as butter and cheese. Dairy processors are eager to secure milk supplies to keep their factories running at full capacity, and thus operating as efficiently as possible. One dairy executive expressed his fears: 'We are likely to find quite a scramble for milk from April 1 next year to keep the processing plants going. The first year will be difficult and milk will get more expensive.' Many dairy executives privately admit they expect Milk Marque to capture more than 80 per cent of the milk supplies, at least initially. But several observers believe that, once farmers see some of the advantages to be gained from competition in the marketplace, they could start splitting off to form local or regional co-operatives similar to those in continental Europe. Some critics believe the government should not allow Milk Marque to become a national monopoly once the Milk Marketing Board's hold on the market has been removed. Competition could develop more effectively if it were split up into regional units. Otherwise, UK consumers could end up paying for a freer market in milk, while farmers enjoy the benefits of security and stable prices.</p>

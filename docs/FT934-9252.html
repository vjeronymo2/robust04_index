			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / White-knuckle ride for fantasyland investors: The scale of Euro Disney's financial crisis Investors in Euro Disney have stomached a stream of bad news since the theme park opened its doors on the eastern outskirts of Paris last year. But the scale of losses and write-offs announced yesterday shocked even the most hardened of them. Exceptional charges of FFr3.62bn (Pounds 420m), which sent losses to FFr5.3bn for the year to September 30, knocked a large chunk off the company's capital. The net asset value per share now stands at less than FFr10 compared with yesterday's closing price of FFr38, down 13 per cent on the day. The depressing figures mean that without a financial restructuring, and soon, there is a question mark over the company's survival. For the moment, Walt Disney, the US entertainment giant which holds 49 per cent of Euro Disney, seems prepared to step into the breach. 'Walt Disney has agreed to help fund Euro Disney for a limited period to afford it time to attempt its capital restructuring by spring 1994,' the European company said yesterday. The American group simultaneously announced that it was taking a Dollars 350m (Pounds 230m) charge against fourth-quarter earnings to cover both the winter funding commitment and receivables due from the European business. Walt Disney is a reluctant saviour. From the beginning it has sought to distance its investors from the risks at Euro Disney, supplying less than FFr1bn of the group's original equity capital. Industry analysts, believe, however, that the US group will provide support for Euro Disney, fearing the effect that failure could have on its reputation. 'They have to look after their own investors,' says Mr Nigel Reed, leisure analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London. 'But they cannot afford to let a company with the Disney brand name go under.' The depth of the problems revealed by yesterday's figures means it is crunch time for Walt Disney. 'They pretty much have to help and it seems they are now prepared to,' says one banker close to the company. Walt Disney's provision of winter funding buys time for Euro Disney, and the large-scale write-offs should reduce depreciation charges, improving future profits. But a capital restructuring remains problematic. The central dilemma is that the most likely means of restructuring remains a share issue, probably a rights issue. But the weakness of the share price complicates such a solution. 'It would have to be a very big issue to raise the sort of money that Euro Disney needs,' said one merchant banker in Paris. As a result, a restructuring package is expected to include other measures, such as a renegotiation of the terms of the company's FFr21bn debt with its bankers. They are also being asked to consider swapping loans into equity. One further solution involves the injection of fresh capital from a new partner. The group's financial problems, however, suggest it will be hard to find ready investors. The task is made all the more difficult by depressed trading conditions. 'Europe-wide recession, high interest rates and mounting unemployment have all served to reduce disposable incomes,' Mr Philippe Bourguignon, Euro Disney's chairman, said yesterday. 'Inevitably tourism has been hit very hard.' For Euro Disney the problems have been compounded by the effects of the strong franc, which has reduced visits from the UK and Italy in particular. At the end of last month, BA Holidays, the package tour subsidiary of British Airways, announced it was abandoning sales of holidays to the struggling theme park. The depressed state of the French property market has prevented the company from realising anticipated revenues from property development. 'Euro Disney is in a vicious circle of high interest-rate costs and disappointing revenues,' says Mr Reed at Paribas. 'The company is in serious trouble.' Mr Bourguignon is responding with a cost-cutting programme. Last month, the company announced it would shed 950 of its 11,100 staff. It has also frozen plans to extend the French theme parks, although Mr Bourguignon has reiterated that the second phase of EuroDisneyland remains a cental part of the strategy. The belated decision to write off its pre-opening costs should improve the prospects for profitability in the future. Mr Bourguignon has also taken encouragement from the sharp rise in French visitors to EuroDisneyland. In the past two months, they accounted for about 45 per cent of the total. But the bright spots at EuroDisneyland remain few and far between. They will mean little if Mr Bourguignon fails to pull off his restructuring.

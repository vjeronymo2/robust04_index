In a lecture at the party's headquarters, Kono said, "(the  agreement) is a product of compromise. I don't know whether  this will have an effective impact on Japan's prolonged business  slump."    Kono said his doubts about the effectiveness of the tax cut  have been spurred by the row he has seen among the coalition  partners over the past few days on how to finance the tax cut.    Following the agreement, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  told a press conference the government will carry out the 6  trillion tax cut for 1994.    The accord calls for enacting by the end of this year a new  tax law that will include a clause specifying how the revenue to  pay for the 6 trillion yen cut is to be raised.    Meanwhile, LDP Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Sadatoshi  Ozato said that while the LDP supports the tax reduction itself,  the amount is insufficient for pump-priming.    Ozato also said it is unclear who will foot the bill for the  tax cut because the ruling parties held over the decision on how  it will be funded.    Ozato said he cannot believe such a bill will be enacted by  the end of the year, judging from what he called the weak  performance of the administration led by Hosokawa.</p>

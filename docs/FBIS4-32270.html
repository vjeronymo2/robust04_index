			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Brendan McNally: "Without Inducements, </F> Multinational Moves In"]    [Text] An international electronics company's  decision to relocate a manufacturing facility from Germany to  east Bohemia casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that  governments must vie with one another--through tax breaks and  other concessions--to attract business and industry.    An international electronics corporation will invest more  than $30 million (870 million Kc) into a Czech factory, making  it the largest British investment in this country to date.    AVX, a Japanese-American conglomerate with its European  operations based in Great Britain, decided to move its  manufacturing plant from Germany to Lanskroun, east Bohemia,  despite the Czech government's flat refusal to provide tax  breaks or other financial inducements.    Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, speaking at the official  opening of the factory May 12, said the project's success was a  validation of his own free-market philosophy.    "I am glad such a success could take place just on general  achievements, without any help from the government. And this is  the way we'd like to demonstrate that it's not necessary to ask  for special advantages or for a new trade policy. I think [AVX  Czech Republic General Manager Jiri] Skala doesn't need my help  or my expertise, because I would not be able to give it," Klaus  said in English to a crowd of Czech, British, Japanese and  American company officials.    While clearly disappointed that the government would not  offer help, AVX company officials already consider the project a  success. In just three months, the factory has become one of the  world's largest producers of tantalum chip capacitors, a  component used in cellular telephones, hearing aids and other  electronic products.    "There were no tax advantages, nothing," said Ernest  Chilton,  senior vice president for AVX's tantalum capacitors division.  "Our only inducement was comparative advantage."    Cheaper labor costs in the Czech Republic as compared to  Germany was one of many factors that led the company to move its  operations to Lanskroun, Chilton said.    "There are places with lower labor costs than the Czech  Republic. But if you take the skills and the education level, we  found that this has been the best place we can come to," he said.    AVX's Czech and British personnel described the opening as a  significant achievement because the factory was up and running  in only nine months, 14 months ahead of schedule.    "When we made the decision to come here, we took a chance.  We  knew about the Czechs' great industrial tradition, but we didn't  know if it had all been lost over the last 40 years," Chilton  said.    The skill and willingness of AVX's Czech work force to solve  the myriad problems they faced bringing the factory on line  proved management had made the right decision, he said.    "Last June, we had an empty building, and in nine or 10  months we built it up from zero," Chilton said.    "Bringing the factory on line was a daunting task," said  Peter Collis, production manager for AVX Lanskroun. "Our plans  were complex and required meeting certain deadlines without  fail."    Collis characterized the modern global electronics industry  as "a cutthroat business" in which manufacturers vie  relentlessly to keep a competitive edge while continuing to  maintain stringent quality control. As a rule, prices for  components usually degrade by 15 percent each year, forcing  manufacturers to find new ways to make parts better and more  cheaply. This is what led AVX to Lanskroun.    Tesla Lanskroun had been building tantalum capacitors for  the  Eastern market since 1963. AVX hoped to take advantage of both  the low labor costs and the expertise of the local work force in  manufacturing these chips.    The first AVX representatives visited Tesla Lanskroun in May  1990. Initially, the company considered a joint venture with  Tesla, and in June 1992, AVX and Tesla signed a Tantalum  Assembly Agreement and AVX began leasing floor space from Tesla  for subcontracting operations. By June 1992, 400 Tesla employees  were subcontracted over to AVX.    Ultimately, AVX rejected a joint venture with Tesla,  choosing  instead to start up its own company, AVX Czechoslovakia, which  was headed by Skala, a former manager at Tesla.    "We propose to double our production in the next two years.  It will increase our market share, but we certainly won't double  it. The market is growing too fast," said Chilton.    AVX Lanskroun currently employs about 1,000 workers.    "The factory operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  We're only closed three days a year--Christmas, Boxing Day and  New Years'. You can't do that in Germany," said Chilton.    Other Western high-tech companies may soon follow in AVX's  footsteps, said Chilton. "For European companies, to use the  Czech work force is a tremendous opportunity. Our biggest  problem is learning the Czech language," he said.    AVX Czech Republic is a subsidiary of the U.K.-based AVX  Europe, itself a subsidiary of the American AVX Corp., which is  in turn a member of the Japanese Kocera Group. The Kocera group  has some 26,000 employees worldwide and a yearly turnover of $30  billion (870 billion Kc).</p>

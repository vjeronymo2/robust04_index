			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK group urges easier access for foreign companies in Japan A GROUP of visiting British executives yesterday called on the Japanese government to ensure that foreign companies have the same access in the country as Japanese companies have in the UK market. The six-company group, headed by the Duke of Kent and Mr Michael Perry, the chairman of Unilever, and including executives from Glaxo Holdings and SG Warburg &amp; Co, presented a list of proposals to Japanese industry representatives and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti). In an 'Agenda for Action by Japanese Business', the executives expressed their confidence that British companies will expand Japanese market share 'unless that market is distorted for political reasons or because of excessive bias towards Japanese domestic suppliers'. However, Mr Perry said the delegation, in Tokyo as part of the Priority Japan campaign, does not regard Japan as a 'problem' but as an 'opportunity' and that British industry does not 'want to argue about the rules of the game'. UK exports to Japan had grown from Pounds 1.49bn to Pounds 2.63bn from 1987 to 1990, but the slowing of the Japanese economy and a resultant fall in demand for luxury goods and industrial machinery led to a decline to Pounds 2.26bn last year. For 1991, Japan's exports to the UK were Pounds 6.75bn, down from Pounds 6.76bn. The text of the Agenda for Action reflected UK concerns that Japanese equipment purchases, including aero-engines, satellites and semiconductor technology, could be influenced by the political pressure applied by Washington.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Senator Thomas Eddy Dupiton objects to charges  implicating him in the murder of businessman Antoine Izmery. The  legislator has asked the people in charge of the civilian  mission in Haiti for clarification of the article in the weekly  magazine, JEUNE AFRIQUE, which quotes the United Nations [UN]  regarding this case:    [Begin recording] [Dupiton] Everytime there is a question of  change in the Senate of the Republic, these kinds of attacks  arise against Sen. Dupiton. However, this case arises at the  right time. This is going to show you on what level these people  who are acting can benefit from the complicity of the  international community. Since it was published about a month  ago, the UN must have known that something was published in  JEUNE AFRIQUE mentioning a UN report. It was only yesterday that  I saw this article. That is perhaps why reactions came from the  Senate. But the UN was aware of this. It has even been said that  articles were commissioned and that these gentlemen distributed  those articles. I am speaking of those who have an interest in  disseminating this message.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you think it is a plot against  you?    [Dupiton] It is a huge plot, not only against me, but  against  the country, since the police have been put into action. If the  police do their work, they must, based on this UN report,  investigate the matter, if the UN sources are verified. It is  therefore a huge plot against the institutions in charge of this  country. [end recording]    [Announcer] That was Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton. It should be  pointed out that according to the article in the weekly  magazine, JEUNE AFRIQUE, Sen. Dupiton had taken in the murderers  of Antoine Izmery on the eve of the 18 September crime.</p>

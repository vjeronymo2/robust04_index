			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DEPUTIES HELD NOT NEGLIGENT IN STANDOFF  </P> <P> A Torrance Superior Court jury has concluded that sheriff's deputies were not  negligent when they failed to warn Lawndale residents that a man ranting about  a bomb had barricaded himself inside a nearby office building.  </P> <P> Several residents of an apartment complex across the street from where the  suspect, Roy J. Coker, was surrounded on Oct. 27, 1984, sued the Sheriff's  Department after Coker suddenly began firing shots from his office window,  killing a woman and seriously injuring a man.  </P> <P> Victim Mark Luna, 45, testified during the three-week civil trial that deputies  would not tell him what they were doing in the neighborhood, but that they did  say it was safe for him to walk across the complex's courtyard.  </P> <P> Luna was shot in the elbow when he walked into the courtyard.  </P> <P> Resident Flory Manzano, 48, heard Luna's screams and opened the door to her  apartment after he was shot, witnesses testified. Coker shot and killed her  when she entered his line of sight.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies testified during the trial that they do not recall Luna's  ever asking whether the courtyard area was safe. They said they did not  evacuate the area in front of Coker's window because they did not know he was  armed.  </P> <P> Coker, who made video and audiotapes of much of the standoff that were played  back during the trial, was killed when deputies stormed his office.  </P> <P> "Jurors indicated to us that they felt that the sheriffs were doing the best  job they could," Anthony Nicklin, principal county counsel, said. "The  plaintiffs were wonderful people, and it's a sad day when you have injured  people who don't receive any compensation . . . but, overall, the jury felt we  did all that we were required to do."  </P> <P> Attorney John Julius, who represented Luna and Manzano's relatives, said he  intends to appeal the jury's decision.  </P> <P> "Two detectives allowed my client to go into an area that they knew was unsafe  and they didn't tell anyone what was going on," Julius said. "Essentially, you  had two civilians testifying to one thing and deputy sheriffs testifying to  another and the jury chose to believe the deputies."  </P></p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Letter: No good reason for advocating that Lord Weinstock should retire Sir, Your series of articles on GEC comes to the fairly obvious conclusion that it is a successful, well-run company and that much of its success is due to the energy and wisdom, over many years, of its chairman, Lord Weinstock. Nevertheless, you seem to believe that Lord Weinstock, who is 67, should retire and you say that the main institutional shareholders in GEC say that 'there is no question of Mr Simon Weinstock succeeding his father'. Both these statements are controversial to say the least. There are many successful companies which have, at their head, chairmen who are in their late 60s and 70s. Equally there are companies where son succeeds father over a number of generations. The Rothschild and Sainsbury families are examples, and there are others. So far as age is concerned, you may be interested to know that I founded my own company, ISYS, when I was in my late 60s, and created a product which has revolutionised the implementation of computer application now used by the world's largest corporations daily. On my board is a previously retired personality, who has proved most successful. Likewise my charitable foundation's director is a retired communal executive who is doing well in his new career. Your own article (Man in the News, July 11) about Taikichiro Mori who, at 88 and still active, is the richest businessman in the world, is a further indication that age need not be a barrier to success.

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Closure of reactors ordered RUSSIA has ordered a military atomic plant to shut down two of its three reactors as a danger to civilian health and the environment, a government spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. The plant in Krasnoyarsk, a central Siberian city of 1m people, produces weapons-grade plutonium. Two of its old-fashioned reactors cooled by water taken from and pumped back into a big waterway were ordered to close within months. The Yenisey river, already heavily polluted by industry in a region where millions of people live, flows 1,250 miles through Siberia. Local authorities had complained of danger to health and the environment in towns nearby. Plutonium, a fission fuel for nuclear weapons and reactors, acts as a deadly poison by collecting in bones and altering white blood-cell production. The decision was the latest in a series of safety measures reflecting expert consensus that Russia's nuclear technology is outmoded and dangerous. It comes less than a month after a nuclear accident released radioactive gas near the nation's second city, St Petersburg.</p>

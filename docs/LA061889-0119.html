			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COOPERATION IN NAMING SUPPLIERS WEIGHED BY JUDGES;  </P> <P> DRUG OFFENDERS ASKED TO 'JUST SAY WHO'  </P> <P> Nancy Reagan urged kids to "just say no" to drugs, and national drug policy  chief William J. Bennett said it's OK to "just say who" is using. Now judges  want drug offenders to name their suppliers.  </P> <P> A month after judges in Knox and Anderson counties began asking it, they say  the question is worthwhile. But defense attorneys and even the Knox County  sheriff wonder whether it violates protections against self-incrimination, ends  judges' neutrality, puts defendants at risk and threatens other cases.  </P> <P> "It seems to me there's everything to gain and nothing to lose, assuming I'm  not trampling on their constitutional rights," said Knox County Criminal Court  Judge Randy Nichols, who figures most of his criminal cases boil down to drug  use.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Modeled on Nebraska Program  </P> <P> Criminal court judges in the two counties on May 5 began asking people  convicted of possession or sale of drugs to name their suppliers in a program  modeled after one in Columbus, Neb. The judges consider defendants' cooperation  in deciding plea bargains, and refusal could earn a contempt of court charge,  punishable by up to 10 days in jail and a $50 fine.  </P> <P> In Columbus, Platte County Juvenile Court Judge Gerald Rouse says more than 40  other jurisdictions have called for information on the county's year-old policy  requiring offenders to name suppliers of drugs or alcohol.  </P> <P> "Frankly, we don't have to do it very often. Once the word got around and the  first two went to jail, we didn't have much of a problem," Rouse said.  </P> <P> The policy has led to only a half-dozen supplier convictions, he said.  </P> <P> In Tennessee, if a supplier's name surfaces, it's up to a prosecutor to take it  down and decide whether to investigate further, Nichols said. So far only a  handful of cases have evoked the question.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sought Probation  </P> <P> When James Daugherty of Oak Ridge sought probation on a charge of selling  cocaine, Anderson County Criminal Court Judge James Scott asked it.  </P> <P> Daugherty named "Crazy Joe" as his supplier. "Crazy Joe" Newton, it turned out,  had been found dead earlier in the year.  </P> <P> Scott gave Daugherty four years in prison, not because of his answer but rather  his background. Daugherty may have been telling the truth, Scott said, but he  notes the convenience and wonders whether there will be an onslaught of  "phantom sellers."  </P> <P> Nichols asked the question May 17 of Jeffrey Clark Evans, who agreed to plead  guilty to robbery, assault and marijuana charges in exchange for a 17-year  sentence. Defense attorney Bob Simpson objected and told his client not to  answer because the judge was no longer neutral. Simpson also said the question  violated his client's Fifth Amendment right because police could go to the  supplier, who in turn could implicate Evans on unrelated crimes.  </P> <P> Nichols took no action and scheduled another hearing on the case.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Policy May Be Killed  </P> <P> Other defense attorneys, including Bob Ritchie of Knoxville, believe appeals  courts may kill the policy.  </P> <P> "For 200 years we have administered criminal justice by the investigative  method," Ritchie said. "To require a person to give evidence of any kind is an  inquisitorial method of criminal justice. That is abhorrent to the basic  foundations of freedom on which this country is founded."  </P> <P> Nichols said conviction means loss of Fifth Amendment rights, and that the  judges aren't interested in further charging that person. "If he tells me Joe  Jones sold it and another week someone else tells us Joe Jones sold it, that'll  be useful information for the attorney general," he said.  </P></p>

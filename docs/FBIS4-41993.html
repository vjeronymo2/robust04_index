			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- Chairman of the Duma  Parliamentary Committee for Information Policies, Mikhail  Poltoranin, described the idea of extending the Federation  Council's term in office as "an arrogant proposal."    In an interview with ITAR-TASS Poltoranin said that the  prolongation of the powers of power structures can be discussed  on condition that certain guarantees are fulfilled and important  problems faced by the Russian people are resolved.    Poltoranin reminded of the fact that before the agreement on  civic accord was signed, he had addressed lawmakers of the State  Duma, suggesting that this agreement be supplemented by  commitments made by each branch of power for a concrete period  of time. In his opinion, this agreement should include a  concrete plan of actions of power structures for the second half  of 1994, the entire 1995 and the first half of 1996. Trade  unions might have pledged to refrain from strikes during this  period, Poltoranin said.    The public chamber might assume control over the fulfillment  of commitments, including the dismissal of the branch of power  which fails to fulfill its commitments. On the other hand, if  the economic and social situation stabilises by the middle of  1996, he problem of crime in Russia is resolved and the  necessary legislative basis created, the public chamber might  initiate the prolongation of the powers of the president, the  government and the parliament, since "enough is as good as a  feast," as the saying goes, Poltoranin said.    Poltoranin believes that a congress of social forces might  be  convened which would appeal to Russians to hold a referendum  which would be a legitimate basis for the prolongation of  powers. Having noted that this idea was never realised,  Poltoranin added that "being in high posts without making  commitments and being detached from Russia's public and social  life is, at least, strange."</p>

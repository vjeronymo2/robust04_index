			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAKIA -- A LOOK BACK  </P> <P> 1946  </P> <P> May -- The Communist rise to power in Czechoslovakia begins with elections. The  party wins 114 of 300 seats in Parliament and dominates the resulting coalition  government.  </P> <P> 1948  </P> <P> May -- Popular sentiment turns against the party, but before scheduled  elections, the Communist leadership reorganizes the government in an effective  Communist revolution that established a repressive Stalinist system.  </P> <P> 1968  </P> <P> January -- Alexander Dubcek is appointed Communist Party leader amid growing  anti-Soviet sentiment as a result of alleged economic exploitation. He is known  as a bold reformer.  </P> <P> April to June -- Dubcek prods the party to adopt a program to restore a measure  of democracy but runs afoul of Moscow. Dubcek is then asked to abandon his  "Prague Spring" reforms, but refuses.  </P> <P> August -- Soviet troops, with token units from other Warsaw Pact countries,  enter the country on the night of Aug. 20-21 and effectively crush the reform  movement.  </P> <P> 1969  </P> <P> April -- Dubcek is replaced by Gustav Husak.  </P> <P> 1970  </P> <P> June -- Dubcek is expelled from the party and goes on to live in virtual  seclusion in his native Bratislava, working as a low-level employee of the  state forestry services.  </P> <P> 1987  </P> <P> Spring -- With the rise to power in the Soviet Union of President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev, and his declaration of economic and political reforms, Husak  grudgingly accepts the need for some changes at home.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Dubcek cautiously returns to the public eye. He appears on Hungarian  television, accusing former Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev of deceiving him  before the 1968 invasion.  </P> <P> December -- Husak retires as party chief and is succeeded by Milos Jakes. Jakes  is seen as a bureaucrat and party functionary whose speeches and personality  make little or no public impact. It was Jakes, however, who presided over the  purge of about 500,000 rank-and-file party members, including Dubcek, after the  1968 invasion.  </P> <P> 1988  </P> <P> Jakes refuses dialogue with a growing number of independent political groups,  although signs of discontent grow as the whirlwind reforms in East Europe blow  across Czechoslovakia's borders.  </P></p>

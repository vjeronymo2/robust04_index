			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVING A PRECIOUS RESOURCE  </P> <P> The Casitas Municipal Water District board and staff are composed of a  distinguished group of business persons, engineers and farmers. This group has  graciously agreed to work with district constituents regarding water rationing  measures necessary to effectuate the laudable purpose of conserving our state's  perhaps most precious resource.  </P> <P> The characterization in the Los Angeles Times of district constituents as  "violators," and the implication that the district board intends to punish  anyone, is inappropriate and wrong. The Concerned Citizens Committee for the  Casitas Municipal Water District thanks the district board, general manager and  staff for their willingness to tackle difficult and complex matters, and  applauds their efforts.  </P> <P> MICHAEL J. SMITH, Esq.  </P> <P> Attorney for the Casitas Municipal Water  </P> <P> District Concerned Citizens Committee  </P></p>

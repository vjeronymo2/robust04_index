			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> ON THE MOVE:  </P> <P> Another company goes south: O'Connell Landscape Maintenance, in Santa Ana since  1971, is moving to Rancho Santa Margarita.  </P> <P> More companies are following their employees into the relatively undeveloped  southern portion of the county, where most of the new housing is being built.  </P> <P> That trend has meant a boom for industrial parks south of the Costa Mesa  Freeway too.  </P> <P> The company bought a 1.3-acre site and will spend $1.3 million to build a  12,600-square-foot building. In O'Connell's case, picking a new address in the  big planned community was attractive because most of its customers are in South  County. Still, development in South County has exceeded roads' capacities to  handle the traffic. However, new roads are being planned or built.  </P></p>

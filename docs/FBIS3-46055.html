Industrial enterprises are called upon to further readjust  their production patterns to meet market demand. As a result,  large industrial groups will be formed and overseas economic  contacts will be greatly enhanced, the officials said.    The city is now making efforts to promote some of its pillar  industries, such as automobiles, program-controlled telephones,  facilities for power stations and computers.    A number of leading state enterprises, especially some  chemical firms, will co-operate with established international  companies to turn out high-tech products with great market  potential.    Statistics show that last year the total industrial output  of  Shanghai increased by 18 percent over the previous year after  three years of two-digit growth. The growth rate has been set  above 15 percent this year.</p>

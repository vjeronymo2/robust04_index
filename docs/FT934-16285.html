			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Council bids guide criticised THE government's new guidance on the Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) regulations will allow local authorities to 'drive a coach and horses' through competitive tendering rules, it was claimed yesterday. Where Tupe applies, a successful bidder must take over the workforce on the existing terms and conditions. Under proposed guidelines released last week, if a local authority has legal advice that Tupe applies but the bid assumes that it does not, the contractor should be invited to reconsider the bid. If the contractor refuses to revise a bid, the authority can reject it even if it is the cheapest. Mr John Hall, director general of the Business Services Association, said: 'The draft guidance would allow a local authority to determine whether it considers Tupe applies to a contract, and then reject any tenders which do not conform to its own interpretation.' He added: 'The uncertainty of the law is such that, for almost any given contract, an authority could obtain a legal opinion one way or the other - and then use this opinion to reject competitive bids. This proposal will allow authorities to drive a coach and horses, along with their direct services organisations, through the government's competitive tendering policy.' Mr Simon Brocklebank-Fowler, finance committee chair for Westminster city council, said he sympathised with some of the contractors' points, but disagreed that competitive tendering could not produce savings and improvements if Tupe applied. The Labour-led Association of District Councils also criticised the guidelines for 'not producing any more certainty'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidestskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau June 6 TASS -- Turkish President Suleyman  Demirel arrived here for an official 3-day visit today.    He is expected to sign with Moldavian [Moldovan] President  Mircea Snegur a treaty on friendship and cooperation between the  two states. The two heads of state will also discuss conditions  for large Turkish investments in the Moldavian economy, most of  which will be used to develop the southern regions, inhabited by  Gagauz, an ethnic group of Turkic origin.    The agenda of Demirel's first day in Moldavia includes  meetings with President Mircea Snegur and parliament speaker  Petr Luchinskiy. The Turkish president is also expected to  address Moldavian parliament members. On the next day, together  with the Moldavian president, Demirel will visit the southern  part of the republic, inhabited mainly by Gagauz. He will be  shown several enterprises and farms there. On the last day of  the visit Demirel will attend the opening of the Turkish embassy  in Moldavia, which will be followed by the signing of  Turkish-Moldavian treaty.    "Moldavia and Turkey have every chance to pursue a policy of  rapprochement, to promote cooperation, and the current visit  will turn a new page in the development of relations between the  two countries," Demirel stated. "We back the process of  negotiations now under way between the Gagauz population and the  Moldovan central administration," he added. "It is intended to  make our brothers live in their native land with due respect for  the territorial integrity of Moldavia, to give them a legal  status, contributing to their development. These negotiations  are Moldavia's internal affair. The Gagauz, for their part, can  serve as a solid bridge of friendship between our two countries."    "The treaty of friendship and cooperation between our two  countries will give a fresh impetus to bilateral relations and  will help overcome the difficulties of the transition period now  experienced by Moldova," President Snegur stated today.  "Problems linked with the creation of a Black Sea economic  cooperation zone will also be discussed during the visit."    Snegur noted the Turkish leadership's balanced and well  thought out policy towards separatist tendencies in some  regions, which threaten peace. "Proceeding from the fact that  the Moldavia top leadership is also confronted with this  problem, we move to discuss all the possible ways for its  effective settlement. We hope that the granting of a special  legal status to populated localities inhabited by the Gagauz  population will create a precedent for districts on the  left-hand bank of the Dniester river, where the centrifugal  tendencies are even stronger. The development of relations of  kinship with Turkey will allow the Gagauz population to  safeguard and pass on their extremely rich traditions and  culture to the rising generation."    Much hope is pinned on the current visit by the head of the  Kamrat (Gagauz) administration Viktor Volkov. He said that the  Turkish side had assumed a commitment to make investments in the  construction of telephone lines and roads, and in the  re-equipment of the Gagauz processing industry.    The Turkish president is accompanied by representatives of  Turkish legislative bodies, government, business circles, and  public organisations.</p>

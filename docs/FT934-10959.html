			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / High-tech jobs for former pit MORE THAN 600 high-technology jobs are to be created on the site of the Cortonwood colliery near Barnsley, South Yorkshire. The closure of this colliery sparked the national miners' strike nearly 10 years ago. Tunstall Group will build an Pounds 11m factory to make electronic equipment for Mion Electronics, a wholly owned subsidiary. It will be partly financed by a Pounds 2.5m grant from the Department of Trade and Industry and a five-year European Community loan. Tunstall already operates a factory at Whitley Bridge, Pontefract. During the past two years it has built up a business making electronic products under contract for other companies, such as domestic satellite decoders, energy-saving devices and telecommunications equipment. The Cortonwood site is in the Dearne Valley between Barnsley and Doncaster, part of the core of the former South Yorkshire coalfield. The valley was one of the first 11 areas to receive funding for economic reconstruction through the City Challenge scheme devised in 1991 by Mr Michael Heseltine when he was environment secretary. Tunstall's factory will be part of a new 16-acre industrial estate. Tunstall said it had chosen the site from several possibilities within the EC because of its good local labour supply and the government grant. Some 400 jobs should be filled by the end of the year. A further 211 will follow. Mr Michael Dawson, Tunstall chairman, said contract manufacturing was now worth Pounds 1.4bn a year in the UK.</p>

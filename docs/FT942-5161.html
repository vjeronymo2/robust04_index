			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The Markets: Little pressure to trim cocoa output - Commodity Market Report Most of the world's cocoa producers meeting in London this week will throw the focus on a market which has been overshadowed this year by the dramatic increase in coffee prices. Producing countries will be discussing their efforts to manage output as part of a new 5-year pact which came into force in February. However, with cocoa prices at their highest levels for 6 years, producers are under little pressure to trim output. Cocoa prices at the London Commodity Exchange have risen since the beginning of the year by Pounds 50 to Pounds 1,040 a tonne. While this increase has been dwarfed by coffee's Dollars 1,000 a tonne upswing, traders report that hedge funds are increasingly turning their attention towards cocoa. World demand for cocoa is expected to outstrip supply by at least 160,000 tonnes this year and many commentators are predicting a shortfall of 300,000 tonnes for next year. Tight supplies should underpin prices for some time since it takes several years for newly-planted bushes to mature. Fears in the gold market about central banks dumping some of their huge holdings of the precious metal have been subsiding. Nevertheless, the market will be studying carefully some of the papers to be presented by bankers at the FT Gold Conference today and tomorrow in London. According to the latest market review from the Gold Fields Minerals Services consultancy, central bank sales added a net 475 tonnes of gold to supply in 1993. This was down from a net 626 tonnes in 1992 - but that was the year when the Belgian and Dutch central banks between them sold 600 tonnes. Meanwhile, officials from the International Primary Aluminium Institute (IPAI) will be in Moscow on Thursday and Friday to continue negotiations about Russia supplying aluminium production statistics to add to those provided by western producers to the institute. The International Zinc Association has organised an 'international zinc day' in Paris tomorrow and Wednesday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaime Flores in Baja California; from the "ACIR </F> Radio News" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Unidentified announcer, at the Radio ACIR studios  in Mexico City] At noon, we reported on a news conference by  Sergio Ortiz Lara -- now under arrest -- a news conference he  gave as the deputy prosecutor of Baja California, not as a  prison inmate. Ortiz Lara was arrested last night on charges  linked to drug trafficking, the 3 March shootout, and the  release of two people involve in this shootout. He is also  accused of administrative crimes. At 1400, Baja California  Governor Ernesto Ruffo also held a news conference. Jaime  Flores, can you tell us what he said?    [Flores] Governor Ernesto Ruffo's news conference ended not  more than five minutes ago. He came from the capital to meet  with the press and give his views on Sergio Ortiz Lara's arrest  yesterday, as you have already noted. Mr. Ruffo said he  considers the Federal Attorney General's Office as being  completely politically irresponsible in the way it has handled  these conjectures. Ruffo said the arrest is based solely on  theory and not on hard facts. In a sense, he supports Sergio  Ortiz Lara.    Ruffo has asked the federal government for more transparency  and openness in its actions. He said that coordination -- as  required between state institutions and the federal government  -- must exist in incidents such as this. I questioned Mr. Ruffo  during the news conference on the statements made this morning  by Sergio Ortiz Lara. Ortiz Lara had indicated that these  actions not only harm the Attorney General's Office, but they  also harm other federal institutions and Ernesto Ruffo's  government. In this regard, Ruffo said openness and  transparency were needed, and he added that the government needs  to avoid conjectures or empty theories because it cannot operate  under such conditions. Ruffo said authoritarianism is not the  way such issues should be handled. He added that on this  occasion the authorities had fallen into authoritarianism.    In conclusion, he said -- after I had asked him whether this  problem had become imminently political in nature -- that the  current situation of confrontation will prevent democracy from  progressing. The truth is that one must not act on conjectures.  He said that soon he will try to meet personally with President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari and with Government Secretary Jorge  Cartizo.    He also said that, from his point of view, there is no  relation between Sergio Ortiz's arrest and the murder of  Municipal Security Director Federico Benitez. As everyone  knows, Benitez was gunned down last Thursday at La Mesa while  travelling with this bodyguard in an official vehicle. The  state governor does not agree with the Federal Attorney  General's Office handling of Ortiz Lara's arrest. He said this  action is based on conjectures and not on hard facts.    He also said the matter of Cristine's disco, which was  mentioned by Attorney General Diego Valades, is nothing more  than speculation because there is no specific information  involving Sergio Ortiz Lara.    Unofficially, I would like to tell you that it has been  learned that an arrest warrant has been issued against former  Prosecutor Juan Francisco Franco Rios. As I already mentioned,  he is considered responsible for having sold identification  credentials to drug traffickers, in this case, to criminals who  were killed at Cristine's during the shootout.    [Announcer] What party is Juan Francisco Franco linked to?    [Flores] Juan Francisco Franco Rios was, up intil two weeks  ago, justice prosecutor. Of course, he belongs to the PAN  [National Action Party] administration. This incident occurred  barely one year after Ernesto Ruffo became governor. He has  always been linked to drug trafficking matters. This  information I am giving you is unofficial, although we will try  to confirm it. A tight lid has been placed on this case.  Deputy Prosecutor Sergio Ortiz Lara depended on former Justice  Prosecutor Juan Francisco Franco Rios. This news is unofficial.  It is very suspicious that just over a week ago, he left his  post and now no one know his whereabouts. The current  prosecutor is Pedro Vidal Rosas.    [Announcer] Furthermore, Jaime -- please allow me to make a  comment and remind our listeners of this -- I read a report two  weeks ago in which the governor of Baja California referred to  rumors linking his brother to drug trafficking. He said that if  this were true he would put his brother in jail. Now we are  hearing that, according to investigations and the events of the  past few days, there is an apparent connection between members  of PAN -- and, remember, this assertion is not mine -- and drug  trafficking, which has also been linked to the arrest of Baja  California Assistant Attorney General Sergio Ortiz Lara. You  also pointed out and wondered whether this is not becoming a  political or partisan issue and whether both sides -- government  officials and the PAN -- should be called upon to fully adhere  to the law.    [Flores] Well, reporter Ana Patricia asked Mr. Ruffo about  that very same thing. His answer was this: Oh, the famous  Claudio. He said it jokingly; he was smiling and calm. He said  the only thing he knows about his brother is that he owes a debt  to the Finance Secretariat involving some property he owns in a  small town called Rosarito, 30 km south of Tijuana. He says his  brother Claudio Ruffo's problems are exclusively under the  jurisdiction of the Finance Secretariat, to which he owes an  unspecified amount of money, and he admitted that his brother is  living on the other side of the border. He said, however, that  he is not aware of any lawsuit against Claudio, adding that  action should be taken against his brother or anyone else  charged with drug trafficking. Ruffo added that he has 18 more  months in office and that his goal is to combat crime. This is  exactly what Mr. Ruffo said about his brother.</p>

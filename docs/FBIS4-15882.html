			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- President of Kazakhstan  Nursultan Nazarbayev will not attend the CIS summit opening in  Moscow on Friday, TASS learned from reliable sources on  Wednesday, The Kazakh delegation will be headed by  Vice-President Yerik Asanbayev.    Although official reasons are not announced, sources in Alma  Ata [Almaty] said the decision of Nazarbayev was caused by his  dissappointment with the CIS.    During his recent visit to Moscow Nazarbayev voiced an idea  of creating an Euro-Asian Union instead of the CIS. Later,  during a visit to Japan, he said the Commonwealth of Independent  States has played its role and again advocated the idea of the  new union.    Nazarbayev believes that the CIS has ensured a more or less  stable transformation of former Soviet republics into  independent states. Now the states which are ready for close  ties should think about the Euro-Asian Union, according to the  president of Kazakhstan.    [Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 0700 GMT on 13  April carries the following report: "Kazakhstani President  Nursultan Nazarbayev's initiative to set up the Eurasian Union  will be one of the main subjects for discussion at the Moscow  meeting of CIS heads of state scheduled for 15 April.

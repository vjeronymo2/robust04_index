			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan tackles its forestry crisis - The planting and protection initiative The quiet of the night is broken by the birds and voices of forest guards about to begin their chores of the day. The grind of cars, trucks and buses bring in the first traces of modern day influence to the forest. This is Changa Manga forest. It is unique because it is one of the remaining hopes in Pakistan's battle against deforestation, which is beginning to show its effects on the country's economy and the environment. The forest has recently played host to the first initiative in Pakistan to protect this resource in a government-sponsored seminar to encourage farmers to grow more trees. 'There is some sort of a forestry crisis in this country. We are short of forestry resources,' says Mr Rafiq Ahmed, deputy inspector-general of forestry in the federal government. The challenge of developing forests in Pakistan has grown in importance since a tightening of budgetary resources, which have in turn intensified pressure to cut down imports. Pakistan imports wood and wood products worth Rs3.5bn (Dollars 116m) annually. The government claims that up to 5 per cent of the country's territory is occupied by forests. But according to independent economists and forestry experts the actual figure is significantly less due to large scale deforestation. The disappearance of the country's trees inevitably brings environmental problems. Mr Khalid Siddiqui, director general of the Pakistan Forestry Institute in Peshawar said: 'The prime example (of effects of deforestation) was the floods in 1992 when there was high rainfall in the North, and in the absence of tree cover on the hills, all the water came rushing down and it caused havoc in the plains.' The government's initiative is to provide sapplings at subsidised rates to farmers, to encourage 'agro-forestry'. The target is to double the land under forests within the next 15 years. It is not yet clear, however, how successful the campaign will be. 'People are not aware of agro-forestry. They think that if they grow trees, because of the shade they may not be able to have their regular crops,' said Mrs Nasrin Ayub, a farm owner who has just begun planting sapplings on her farm. Many other farmers have complained that lack of proper marketing would leave little profit once planting expenditure and tree protection over several years is taken into account. Mr Maqbool Khichi, president of the National Farmers Council said: 'If the marketing is done properly, the government will not need to import any wood, because proper incentives will attract farmers.' Most of the forest areas are located in the mountainous belt of Northern Pakistan where just under 10 per cent of the country's population lives. The long cold winters have prompted the local people to cut the trees. In addition, a group of powerful traders known as the 'timber mafia' are allegedly responsible for illegal chopping of trees from forest land. 'There is a need for forests and there is a greed for forests,' said Mr Siddiqui. He added that while the people in many areas chop trees out of necessity, for others, it is an important business. He argued for development of alternative sources of energy and employment as a step to changing the trends. Others call for a strong clampdown on illegal timber traders.</p>

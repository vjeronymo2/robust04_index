			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hamdan al-Haj in Amman] </F>   [Text] Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, Jordan's ambassador to the  United States and chief Jordanian negotiator to the peace talks  with Israel, has expressed hope that the siege of al-'Aqabah  Port will be eased soon. He also hoped that practical  alternatives will be found to inspect al-'Aqabah-bound ships in  order to solve the 44-month old problem.    Al-Tarawinah said in a telephone interview with AL-DUSTUR  that U.S. State Department officials have always stressed that  the decision in this regard will be positive and that it will be  made as soon as possible.    Asked about the visit to the region by the U.S. secretary of  state, Dr. al-Tarawinah noted that the visit depends on the  results of the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo and  the final signing between the two parties. If the signing is  decided, he added, it will be attended by U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher.    Dr. al-Tarawinah added that the Palestinian side insists  that  the signing takes place before 13 April, however, this would be  delayed for a week. In light of this, the U.S. secretary's  visit will be decided.    Dr. al-Tarawinah noted that the U.S. secretary's visit is  expected to take place in mid-April. In light of the results of  the secretary's visit, he added, the date for resuming the  Arab-Israeli talks in Washington will be set.    Dr. al-Tarawinah expects the Arab and Israeli negotiators to  return to the negotiating table at the end of this month if no  new obstacles appear.</p>

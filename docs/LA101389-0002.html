			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A PLACE WHERE SCRATCHED VINYL CAN BE GOLDEN  </P> <P> The Rev. Lawrence Bausch says the sources of life's wisdom are often  surprising. He said a fountain of insight might be right there in front of you,  and you won't even know it.  </P> <P> So, for his universal truths, he often heads to El Cajon Boulevard, to what  used to be a massage parlor.  </P> <P> It's now a record store -- Off the Record. You can buy a Beatles album for $450  or sell one of your Johnny Mathis records for 10 cents. Actually, Johnny might  be Mathis non grata at this place.  </P> <P> But Bausch isn't. He's a loyal, paying customer, who finds nuggets of  revelation tucked away in envelopes that don't -- unfortunately -- take away  the scratches that work on the soul like fingernails on a blackboard.  </P> <P> But as the man behind the counter points out, with a frizzy-haired shrug, life  isn't perfect, is it?  </P> <P> Bausch bought one of his favorite albums -- "Riding With the King," by John  Hiatt -- at Off the Record, which revels in the offbeat, the forgotten and the  never-knew-about, whether it's new, used or on album, tape or compact disc.  </P> <P> Off the Record is the sort of store where the Severin Browne and Livingston  Taylor sections are likely to be bigger than that of their brothers (Jackson  and James).  </P> <P> It's by no means the only vintage record store in the county, but, Bausch says,  it's one of the best. And it is, as David Ritchie, one of its customers,  pointed out this week, "funky to the max."  </P> <P> "It's really one of the best in Southern California," said Bausch, the priest  at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Ocean Beach. "I grew up in Los Angeles, but  I've lived in San Diego since 1966, and I love music, so I've been to lots of  stores like this."  </P> <P> A few years back, Bausch happily discovered the Hiatt album, parts of which  have made their way into Ocean Beach sermons.  </P> <P> "There's this great song on there called 'You May Already Be a Winner,' " he  said. "This guy keeps getting all this sweepstakes junk mail, like we all get,  with the headline, 'You May Already Be a Winner!' He talks to his wife about  it, and they laugh about it, and then he realizes that, because of the way they  care for each other and the love that they feel, they're winners in a way that  money can never duplicate."  </P> <P> Larry Farkas said that Off the Record, which he co-founded with Richard  Horowitz in 1978, has brought them exactly that kind of happiness. He and  Horowitz were working for Wherehouse Records, which Farkas said simply refused  to stock the marginal, the bizarre or the in-your-face "punk" music that they  longed to sell.  </P> <P> They opened on El Cajon Boulevard 11 years ago, added a "used" store next door  five years ago and have since invaded Encinitas and Hillcrest, where a new  store opens next month.  </P> <P> Farkas is proud of the fact that the Irish rock band U2 was on the shelves at  Off the Record long before the masses discovered the group. He likes the  store's status as an "underground" shop, where even the artists themselves  occasionally wander in. Band members from Husker Du and singer Henry Rollins  are among the faithful who Farkas says often find what they need at Off the  Record.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unusual Singles Found  </P> <P> In the singles rack, you can find a category for Paul and Paula, a bubble-gum  '60s duo, whose one hit was "Hey, Paula." Incredibly, you can't find that one,  but you will find a string of other Paul-and-Paulaisms, such as "Holiday  Hootenanny."  </P> <P> "We like being thought of as an alternative place," store manager Keith Larson  said. "We're really not for the people who like to listen to Whitney Houston or  George Michael. In our new section, we tend to start where Tower (Records) and  (the) Wherehouse stop. And, in the used building, well, you might find Frank  Sinatra and the Sex Pistols side by side."  </P> <P> Bausch says he's found records at Off the Record, which caters largely to a San  Diego State University crowd, that he could find nowhere else: The early work  of country artist Nanci Griffith and Irish classics by the likes of Tannehill  Weavers and Ossian. He says he shops at Rockaway Records, Lou's Records in  Encinitas and the Blue Meanie in El Cajon. He likes them all but says "Off" is  No. 1.  </P> <P> Farkas, 38, said he has so many record albums that he didn't want to say for  publication how many.  </P> <P> "That many?" someone asked.  </P> <P> "That many," he said with a worried look.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Worried About CDs  </P> <P> He says the business has been a thrill, but he worries about the impact that  compact discs may soon have on discount houses such as his. He carries CDs, but  the vast majority of sales are records.  </P> <P> "It's going to be real interesting to see what happens," he said. "It could end  up like baseball cards, where it's a market mainly for collectors. Ten-year-old  kids are no longer getting record players for Christmas. They're getting CD or  tape players. I find that kind of sad.  </P> <P> "I love records. As a kid, I loved watching them spin around on the turntable.  I'd like to think there will be this huge market for vinyl, but 78 (r.p.m.)  records are worthless and eight-track cassettes are worthless, so will  long-playing records be worthless, too. Five years from now, it may be that one  part of our store will be new stuff -- CDs -- and the other part will be vinyl  meant for collectors. Like me."  </P> <P> It may be, as Farkas pointed out, that lots of records will cost as much as the  Beatles album on the wall with a price tag of $450. It's the original "The  Beatles: Yesterday and Today," which bears a rarely seen cover with the Fab  Four wearing butchers' outfits.  </P> <P> "It's the genuine article," Farkas said, with Bausch noting that that's pretty  much what the store is.  </P></p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Bank mortgage lending rises after long decline Leading British banks undertook slightly more mortgage lending in February than in January, but the increase was almost certainly seasonal, the British Bankers' Association said yesterday. Figures from the BBA showed gross lending at Pounds 1.04bn last month, up from Pounds 1.01bn in January. This rise of almost 3 per cent arrested the trend of seven successive monthly falls, but still represents the second-lowest figure since the BBA began compiling the information on a monthly basis last spring. Seasonally adjusted figures for net lending fell again, to Pounds 576m in February from Pounds 588m in January. But mortgage approvals - which are seen as an important indicator of the state of the market - rose sharply last month to 24,935 approvals with a value of Pounds 1.20bn. The comparable figures for January were 19,297 approvals with a value of Pounds 914m. Mr John Ecklin, BBA director of statistics, said the figures for bank mortgage lending reflected some 'fightback' by building societies in regaining market share they had lost to the banks in 1993. Their extra share came partly from the popularity of fixed-rate mortgages, but also indicated a more general recovery. 'If you put together approvals and commitments, it looks as though the overall market is getting relatively healthy,' Mr Ecklin said. One sign of the recent shift in market share is that the building society sector is beginning to show year-on-year increases for the monthly mortgage lending figures while the figures for banks are broadly similar to a year ago. The Building Societies Association reported an increase in net new commitments last month to Pounds 2.93bn - the highest level since July last year, and some 8 per cent higher than February last year. The leading British banks include eight of the 20 largest mortgage lenders in the UK.</p>

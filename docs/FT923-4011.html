			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Medeva trebles to Pounds 14.1m and beats expectations MEDEVA, the rapidly growing pharmaceuticals company, yesterday beat market expectations with a trebling of profits and a doubling of earnings per share. Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, described the first half as a 'corker' and a sound platform from which the group could develop into a significant international pharmaceuticals company within the decade. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 4.02m to Pounds 14.1m on sales up 82 per cent at Pounds 57.7m as the benefits of recent acquisitions came through. Earnings per share were 4.77p basic (2.26p) or 4.58p fully diluted. The interim dividend is raised 50 per cent to 0.75p. The profits comfortably exceeded the highest market expectations but the shares slipped 12p to 186p, following a strong recent run ahead of the announcement. The group also reported a sharp increase in profit margins from 38 per cent to 58 per cent, reflecting an improvement in the product portfolio, Mr Taylor said. The results included another difficult period at the intensely competitive Evans-Kerfoot unbranded generics business which incurred losses. Sales fell 28 per cent to Pounds 12m due to price decreases, product line rationalisation and some stock shortages. Mr Taylor said the board had resolved to return this division to profitability in the second half. 'We must not just restrict ourselves to shaving costs further,' he said. The group enjoyed particularly strong growth in the US where advances at Adams Laboratories and MD Pharmaceutical led to sales of Pounds 25.5m, an 80 per cent increase on a like-for-like basis. Mr Taylor tried to respond to some criticism that Medeva has little more to offer than acquisition-led growth. 'We are able to get growth from what we buy with the result that we are not simply the sum of the parts.' he said. COMMENT The impressive doubling of earnings per share suggests, perhaps for the first time, substantial short term organic growth potential from recent acquisitions, particularly those in the US. This hint of inner strength was essential given that sizeable paper and debt-financed acquisitions will be much harder to make at the current share price and following recent increases in debt. Probably Medeva should be trading at a premium to the market, rather than roughly in line, as is implied in full year forecasts of earnings of 11.8p from pre-tax profits of Pounds 34.5m, though not at the kind of premiums commanded by mainstream pharmaceutical companies with greater security and quality of earnings. But it will be difficult for Medeva to regain the momentum it found earlier this year while riding a wave of US infatuation with the sector. On the other hand, the bulls could soon stir again if Medeva extricates itself gracefully from its unbranded generics business, which would be no small feat with the intense competition in the sector.</p>

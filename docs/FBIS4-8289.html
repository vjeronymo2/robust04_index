			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 11 -- Presidential press spokesman  Andrzej Drzycimski said Monday that President Lech Walesa would  be willing to meet representatives of the government coalition  if a new candidate for the post of finance minister was put  forward.    He added that the coalition should look at matters anew and  consider a new approach to the problem of who is to replace  Marek Borowski as finance minister. President Walesa has  already refused to accept the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati from  Premier Waldemar Pawlak.    Asked whether Walesa had finally decided whether or not to  sign the budget law, Drzycimski replied, "The president still  has time for this under the Constitution, he is considering the  matter."    According to the "small" interim Constitution the president  signs a law within 30 days after it has been presented to him  having been passed by both houses of parliament. According to  Andrzej Gliniecki from the legal office at the president's  chancellery, the budget law was presented to Walesa on March 28.</p>

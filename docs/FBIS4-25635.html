			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Wang Rudeng Says There Still Will Be Press </F> Freedom in Hong Kong After 1997"]    [Text] Wang Rudeng, assistant director of the XINHUA Hong  Kong Branch, emphasized yesterday that the Chinese Government  would ensure that Hong Kong enjoyed freedom of the press and  freedom of speech after 1997. He did not think that Hong Kong's  mass media organizations would exercise self-restraint or press  censorship for fear of offending the Chinese side, but he  reaffirmed that while enjoying press freedom, we should be  particular about the objectiveness and truthfulness of the press  and speeches, and that journalists should be abide by the law.    Wang Rudeng discussed press freedom after attending a  ceremony to present prizes at a dragon boat invitation  tournament held by the Central and Western District yesterday.  He emphasized that in the past, the Chinese Government and the  XINHUA Hong Kong Branch have always greatly respected freedom of  the press and freedom of speech in Hong Kong. He also believed  that after 1997, the Chinese side would try its best to ensure  local freedom of the press and of speech. He pointed out,  however, that while enjoying freedom of the press, we should be  particular about the objectiveness and truthfulness of the press  and speeches. He said that while enjoying freedom of the press,  we should not distort facts at will and make groundless  accusations, nor should we publish biased speeches. He held  that journalists should be abide by the law, and that if they  violate the law, they should be punished according to the law.    When asked about the incident that occurred in the News  Department of Asia Television Limited [ATV] not long ago  [reference to resignation of several ATV journalists in light of  TV station's decision not to air a Spanish TV documentary on  Tiananmen -- a decision later rescinded], Wang Rudeng said that  it was purely an issue of the ATV administration itself and did  not concern freedom of the press. He also said that he did not  think the mass media organizations in Hong Kong would exercise  self-restraint or censorship for fear of offending the Chinese  side because everyone could see the respect of the Chinese  Government and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch for local press  freedom. He also emphasized that there would not be any problem  for the media to criticize the Chinese side after 1997.    On the other hand, Wang Rudeng criticized as groundless and  irresponsible Legislative Councillor Emily Lau's accusation at  the "City Forum" last month that he had intervened in press  freedom. He pointed out that at the City Forum last month,  Emily Lau accused him of inviting persons in charge of some mass  media organizations to a meeting a few years ago, and of asking  them to intervene in the news coverage carried out by their  subordinates. In that year, Emily Lau made a telephone call to  him to ask about the matter and to make the accusation, but she  was not able to provide strong and concrete evidence, such as  with whom he met, or when and where, or what issues he discussed  that constituted an intervention in press freedom. He held that  Emily Lau was irresponsible to have brought up this matter again  on a public occasion and to have made a groundless accusation  against him.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Hangover after champagne and chips: Alan Cane and Stewart Dalby discuss the factors behind Texas Instruments' pull-out Texas Instruments executives broke out the champagne in Bedford only last month as they unveiled a superchip which they believed would give them a lead in the race to supply components for the nascent multi-media revolution. Today there is only disappointment and sadness after Thursday's announcement that the US company - which has been in Bedford for 38 years and is its largest manufacturing employer - is pulling out with the eventual loss of 800 jobs. All that will remain in Bedford will be a low-technology power transistor plant, employing some 200 people, which Texas hopes to sell wholly or in part. 'The decision is devastating. Mention Bedford and Texas Instruments was the company that came to mind,' said Mr Philip Hendry, Conservative leader of Bedfordshire County Council, speaking for all shades of political opinion. In spite of the undoubted quality of much of the work at Bedford, the facility's fate was sealed by: The age and inflexibility of the Manton Lane factory. The unco-ordinated way the facility has developed - every kind of business in which Texas is involved is represented, each with its own management infrastructure. It has never been selected as a centre of excellence for a main product line. Investment decisions in the late 1980s when Italy triumphed over other European countries as the site for the US company's principal European semiconductor plant. Texas Instruments is one of the world's oldest electronics companies specialising in semiconductors, calculators, small computers and software. But profitability in recent years has been depressed by the company's delay in moving to more advanced methods of semiconductor production and by an uneconomic European structure, with business units duplicated in each country. Bedford is the principal victim of the company's moves to rationalise its European organisation. Mr Norman Neureiter, a senior Texas executive seconded to Bedford to assist what the company describes as a 'phased withdrawal over two years', said yesterday it was clear as early as 1980 that European operations would have to be restructured. The company has followed a shared investment strategy, seeking government grants and forming joint ventures where possible to help defray the huge costs of keeping up to date with technology. In the late 1980s, the company decided to concentrate production of semiconductor memory, one of Texas's principal product lines, at Avezzano in Italy. A factory has been built there at an eventual cost of Dollars 1.5bn, of which the Italian government is contributing some Dollars 700m through regional aid. Simpler chips are manufactured in volume at Freising, Germany, while chips for special applications in telecommunications, automobile and computer markets are manufactured in Nice, France. Texas's UK software business is located at Ashford, near London's Heathrow airport where it employs some 300 software specialists. Texas published its best quarterly results as it announced the withdrawal from Bedford - evidence, Mr Neureiter said, that the company's shared investment strategy and assault on costs was working.</p>

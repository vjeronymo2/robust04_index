			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Ford to sell stake in AC Cars FORD is to sell its stake in AC Cars, the Surrey-based specialist sports car company in which it took a 50.96 per cent stake for Pounds 1.3m nearly five years ago. The holding is being sold, for an undisclosed sum, to Mr Brian Angliss, AC Cars' managing director. He also controls Autokraft, a private company which holds the minority stake in AC Cars. Ford yesterday gave no explanation for its decision to return the holding, but said it would continue to assist AC Cars with the supply of engines and components for the AC Ace, a sports car under development for some time. Mr Angliss said last night that the sale had been agreed amicably. That is despite a long-standing apparent clash of cultures which led Ford in 1990 to seek the winding-up of AC Cars. The application is only now being withdrawn. Mr Angliss intends to seek a new partner to put the AC Ace into commercial production at volumes of 500-600 a year. AC, formed in 1901, is one of the oldest carmakers still in existence. It was attractive to Ford partly because it originally made the Cobra, a powerful Ford-engined sports car of the 1960s which became something of a legend. Ford will retain the right to the Cobra name in North America.</p>

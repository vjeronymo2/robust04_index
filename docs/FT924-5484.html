			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Audi favours Hungary for engine parts plant AUDI, the executive car division of Germany's Volkswagen group, has chosen Hungary over eastern Germany as the likely location for a large new engine components plant. Audi's supervisory board yesterday gave approval in principle for an investment of DM320m (Dollars 200m) in Gyor in western Hungary to establish the facility. The board said a final decision would be made after 'concrete negotiations' between Audi and Hungarian authorities over the precise site and other conditions. Audi hopes to begin production of up to 220,000 engine cylinder heads a year starting in mid-1994 with a workforce of 200. Audi referred to the planned DM320m investment in engine component production as 'a first stage'. There has been speculation that the company could eventually move to full engine assembly at the site. Audi said that Hungary won out against eastern Germany and Austria, the other two competitors to host the plant, because of the 'cost advantages'. Mercedes-Benz decided last month to suspend plans for a DM1.5bn truck plant in eastern Germany because of costs and a more cautious assessment of growth potential in the German truck market. Mr Rudolf Bohn, state secretary at the economics ministry in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt, went further by conceding that lavish subsidies offered to induce Audi to eastern Germany had not been sufficient to make up for high wage levels. Contemplation of a new plant outside Germany comes at a sensitive time for Audi, which last week announced job cuts of up to 4,000, or 10 per cent of its workforce. The reduction in employment is likely to particularly affect the plant at Ingolstadt in Bavaria, where Audi has previously concentrated engine and cylinder head production. The opening up of eastern Europe to investment has particularly highlighted German all-in labour costs, which in carmaking are six to 10 times the Hungarian level, for instance. The decision to invest comes despite a sharp downturn in earnings at VW in the third quarter and a profit warning for the last quarter of the year. On the other hand, VW reported this week that output at Audi rose 13 per cent in the third quarter compared with 9 per cent growth for the whole group.</p>

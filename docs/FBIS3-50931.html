			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Ismael Echague [Colorado Party -- Concepcion]  this morning denounced that "at approximately 2000 local time,  on the eve of Blas N. Riquelme's resignation from office as  Colorado Party president, we received a message from Government  House to the effect that the [Colorado Party] Executive Board  would be taken over and [Second Vice President Juan Manuel] Cano  Melgarejo would be named party chairman unless Riquelme tendered  his resignation."    Ecahgue, a member of Riquelme's faction within the party,  further stated that one of the conditions for Riquelme's  resignation -- imposed by Riquelme himself -- was that he would  be replaced by Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, the party's first vice  president.    Echague concluded by saying that "the pressure exerted from  Government House was the main factor determining the former  president's resignation, especially if one bears in mind that  ministers and high-ranking government officials were already in  favor of this proposal at that time."</p>

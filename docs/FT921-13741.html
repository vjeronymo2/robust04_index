			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Maxwell trust 'eager to help' inquiry THE Liechtenstein-based Maxwell Foundation said yesterday that it was eager to co-operate with investigations into the disappearance of Pounds 1.3bn from the public companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Werner Keicher, a director of the Foundation, confirmed that his firm, Allgemeines Treuunternehmen (General Trust Co) of Vaduz, was involved with all six Maxwell related foundations, Corry, Allandra, Baccano, AKIM, Kiara and Jungo, named in a Financial Times article last Thursday. The accounting firm Arthur Andersen, which is investigating the disappearance of funds from the Maxwell public companies and pension funds, believes these foundations were used to conceal the source of funds invested in, among other things, propping up the share price of Maxwell Communications Corporation (MCC) last year. Allgemeines Treuunternehmen also has close ties with Verwaltungs und Privat Bank in Vaduz. The FT published portions of a statement of an account held at VP Bank by Corry showing rapid transfers of large sums and purchases of MCC shares. Mr Keicher said his firm had 'absolutely nothing to hide' and would co-operate as much as it could with the investigations under way. However, under Liechtenstein law, it could do so only if the beneficiaries or mandatories of the foundations willingly waived their right to secrecy or if the British authorities requested co-operation in connection with a criminal inquiry. At the moment, it could not reply to inquiries from Arthur Andersen. 'We hope to be able to talk as soon as possible. We do not like to read in the papers all this speculation,' Mr Keicher added. Although it has a reputation for shielding shady financial operators, Liechtenstein is concerned about its image and has shown its willingness recently to co-operate in overseas criminal investigations. In late 1989, it helped the US Securities and Exchange Commission track down an insider trading offence when Mr Christian Norgren, then a director of Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), routed a large purchase of shares and options of Combustion Engineering of the US through a Liechtenstein company. At the time, ABB was preparing a takeover offer for Combustion. 'We have to play with open cards in cases like this,' a Liechtenstein based lawyer said yesterday. There have been suggestions that the use of the Maxwell foundations for share price manipulation was in breach of Liechtenstein law which states that the purpose of a foundation must be narrowly defined. 'In my opinion, there has not been an abuse of the law,' Mr Keicher said. 'We did not know if there was manipulation.'</p>

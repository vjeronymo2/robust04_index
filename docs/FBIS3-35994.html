			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Valentyna Pysanska report: "Energy Sources: Payment Is </F> the Only Problem"]    [Text] According to Mykhaylo Kovalko, chairman of the State  Committee for Oil and Gas, the situation that is presently  taking shape with regard to oil and gas extraction in Ukraine,  deliveries from Russia, as well as processing looks hopeful. At  a recent news conference, he said that the branch had completed  the past year successfully. The situation with the extraction  of oil and gas had stabilized and the rates of construction had  not decreased.    Agreements have been signed on the deliveries of natural gas  from Russia in amounts similar to last year's; agreements on oil  deliveries will be signed soon.    Do not ask me about prices or tariffs, because they  constitute a commercial secret. I will only say that the  agreement is mutually advantageous and will enable our national  economy to function successfully. If only there are funds --  there will be energy sources!    This year, it is planned to purchase 32 million tonnes of  oil  from Russia. The Committee for Material Resources will be in  charge of the deliveries -- partly through direct purchases and  also in accordance with so-called Surgut [geographical name]  agreements. A large part of the deliveries will be made through  the group of companies "Nordex," which, last year, pumped 1.74  million tonnes of oil, for which Ukraine has a debt of $123  million.    The committee pins great hopes upon the implementation of  the  national program "Oil and Gas by the Year 2010," which specifies  priorities in the development of the branch.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / BT offers 'price list' for rivals BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday proposed a 'price list' of charges for rival operators to gain access to its network, to avoid the need for detailed negotiations in each case. The idea is BT's response to plans published this month by Oftel, the telecommunications regulator. Oftel wants rival operators to have a right of appeal to it if they believe BT is overcharging them. The number of BT competitors is increasing rapidly, so the terms on which they gain access to BT's network are critical to the future shape of the industry. BT wants to publish two price lists. The first would cover services over which it has in effect a monopoly, such as the use of local networks in most of the country. Prices would be set in agreement with Oftel but with no right of appeal for competitors. In the second list, covering services for which competition exists  - such as trunk lines  - prices would be set by BT on a market basis, with no role for Oftel at any stage. BT argues that appeals to Oftel 'involve a considerable administrative burden and result in still further delay and uncertainty for both parties'. Mr Ray Smith, BT's director of carrier services, said: 'Our proposals provide a predictable, open and fair method of setting and making available interconnection charges.' Competing carriers needing access to BT's network are unlikely to support the proposal to deny them access to the regulator in cases of dispute.</p>

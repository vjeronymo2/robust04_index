			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs attack banks over Maxwell cash  -Pensioners say government aid plan inadequate THE COMMERCIAL banks were put under heavy pressure yesterday as MPs on both sides of the Commons put the onus on them to recognise their moral obligation to the Maxwell pensioners. The government also faced unease from both Labour and Tory MPs when Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, was unable to give an assurance that the government's measures would mean that all pensioners would continue to receive a full pension indefinitely. That concern was echoed by a number of pensioners in Robert Maxwell's company pension schemes, who hailed the government's announcement of an interim aid package, but said that it fell far short of what was needed. In the Commons, Mr Lilley defended the offer as a move to tackle 'a particularly acute short-term pressure which is unique to this case'. Mr Richard Page, the Tory co-chairman of the all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners, and other backbenchers, urged Mr Lilley to keep up the pressure on the banks. Other MPs from both sides of the Commons expressed anger at the position of members of the Maxwell family. Mr Frank Field, Labour co-chairman of the all-party group and chairman of the cross-party social security committee in the last parliament, welcomed Mr Lilley's enthusiasm 'for shaking warmly by the throat the banks, financial institutions, companies, individuals and members of the Maxwell family who have done so well out of the Maxwell years, in order to get contributions to rebuild the pension funds'. National Westminster Bank, one of the banks that holds shares claimed by the Maxwell pension funds, said it had been considering a voluntary fund launched by government and the City as a way of helping Maxwell pensioners without admitting liability for their losses. It added, however, that it had to put the interests of its shareholders first and therefore could not transfer to the pension funds shares in Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical company, which are claimed by the funds. They are also being claimed by the administrator of the Robert Maxwell Group, the parent of the Maxwell private interests, as well as by the liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, trustee of the pension funds. Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, said he was confident that banks and financial institutions holding some Pounds 217m in securities belonging to the pension funds would return those assets. 'I'm taking a bet that the banks will return the Pounds 217m,' he said, adding that even then pensioners would still need more than Pounds 200m to meet all obligations. He was critical that the government's measures appeared to exclude all those who were not pensioners when the schemes collapsed but have retired since. 'A 64-year-old with 30 years' service who retires tomorrow will not be helped,' Mr Trench said. The scope of the measures will be tested by MPs today in the Commons debate. Mr Field will be among those to press Mr Lilley for an assurance that if the trustees say that the Pounds 2.5m announced yesterday is inadequate, then the government will not end the scheme without making a further statement to MPs.</p>

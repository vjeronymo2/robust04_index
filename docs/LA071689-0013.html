			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSIDE CAA  </P> <P> Regarding "Inside the Agency," Michael Cieply's July 2 article about CAA, the  Hollywood talent agency:  </P> <P> The guys at Creative Artists do nothing all day but stroke people they like and  "kill" people they don't like. They wield a ridiculous amount of power over the  minds of an entire nation.  </P> <P> Their power is derived not from ability or excellence or even intelligence. It  comes simply from forming a coterie -- it's all "who you know."  </P> <P> You can see why this sort of thing has such a negative effect on the Hollywood  "product." In the case of CAA, they usually sacrifice artistic integrity for  increased company profits. When they "package" a deal, putting the script, the  actors and the director together, more often than not all of these "elements"  are in-house.  </P> <P> The game is money and power. The American public gets lousy programming as a  result.  </P> <P> RAY MASON  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

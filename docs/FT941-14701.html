			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Observer: Marching orders Amid the claims pouring in from stricken Californian residents following Monday's quake, Lloyd's syndicate Barder &amp; Marsh stumbled across a shopping list from one US name, detailing losses of Dollars 30,000. Appended to the fax was a request for his London friends to hurry along to Michael Sutty in Burlington Arcade and replace his bone china military band. Sutty, whose clients include Lady Thatcher, is the only place in the world where you can buy perfectly accurate, hand-made bone china replicas of military figures - which set you back up to Pounds 6,950 apiece. Half its produce winds up in America but little goes to the West Coast precisely because of the wobbly nature of the terrain.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Abbey rises to Pounds 298m LLOYDS ABBEY Life, the life assurance group, announced profits before tax of Pounds 297.6m for 1992, a rise of 4.2 per cent on the previous year's Pounds 285.5m, restated under new accounting standards. The total dividend remains at 17.3p via a proposed maintained final of 11p, payable from earnings of 28p (29.1p) per share. Black Horse Financial Services, a 'bankassurance' company which sells products only to customers of Lloyds Bank, registered a 23.5 per cent growth in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 89.5m to Pounds 110.5m. However, profits at Abbey Life, its other UK life assurance division which sells mostly through a direct sales force, rose by only 2.4 per cent to Pounds 146.4m (Pounds 142.9m). Abbey Life's relatively poor performance was attributed to expenses of new regulatory requirements on training and competence, which led to a reduction in the sales force from 3,507 to 3,200. Lloyds Bank Insurance Services, which sells general insurance, increased pre-tax profits by 7.7 per cent to Pounds 58.8m (Pounds 54.6m). Profits before tax at Lloyds Bowmaker, the finance company affected by a Pounds 100.5m bad debt write-off, dropped from Pounds 22.3m to Pounds 16.2m. Black Horse Agencies, the estate agency, saw losses reduced from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 10.6m. The worst results were suffered by Trans Leben, the group's German life subsidiary, which incurred a loss of Pounds 14.1m (profits of Pounds 7.5m). This reflected strict reserving requirements for its 'with-profits' business. See Lex</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Books: A life conducted in complexity REGGIE: THE LIFE OF REGINALD GOODALL by John Lucas Julia MacRae Books Pounds 18.99, 254 pages REGINALD GOODALL, one of the leading British conductors of the century and one of the elite among postwar Wagnerians, began his career with great (if unevenly acknowledged) spurts of promise. He ended it, in advanced old age, with a knighthood, magnificent recordings of The Ring (this month re-issued on CD), Tristan and Parsifal to his credit, and the reverence of almost all British Wagner-lovers. In between, he endured a period of cruel neglect ' a staff conductor at the Royal Opera House misunderstood, sidelined and eventually shelved, who for ten years found his conducting dates there dwindled to non-existence (between the 1961 Boris Godunov revival and the 1971 Parsifal). Even during that time, of course, he was not reduced to total artistic ineffectiveness. Otto Klemperer demanded his presence as assistant on those late Klemperer recording sessions - the admiration between the two was mutual, as it had been between Goodall and another leading conductor, Erich Kleiber, and as it was to be between him and Kleiber's son Carlos. More to the point, in his little eyrie at Covent Garden (nicknamed, naturally enough, Valhalla) Goodall continued on the ewige Werk begun in the middle 1950s - the schooling of successive generations of British and Britain-based Wagner singers to eloquence and international fame. But then came the 1968 Sadler's Wells Opera Mastersingers - unforgettable in the small theatre, repeated to even more splendid effect when the company moved home to the Coliseum, where already the glorious adventure of the English-language Ring was set to unfold. Those performances, and the Welsh National Tristan and Valkyrie and ENO Tristan and Parsifal of the late 1970s and '80s, amounted to a revelation of long-lined, lovingly rehearsed, sagaciously sustained Wagner performance - every instrumental line suffused with lyricism, every voice part unforced, every word and note audible. These unforgettable evenings placed Goodall in the grand line of Wagnerian conductors. The Goodall 'galley years' at Covent Garden, as a chapter-title in John Lucas's new biography aptly calls them, are therefore the more depressing to contemplate when one holds them in the light of both the late triumphs and the early career progress. In truth, little in his upbringing seemed likely to promote that musical career; and the hand-to-mouth conditions, blinkered British-is-best tastes and unwarranted self-satisfaction that obtained in the musical life of this country for much of Goodall's early adulthood seemed designed positively to frustrate it. In spite of that, and of the combination of shyness, eccentricity, and intransigence in search of high musical standards that marked his personality, Goodall's achievements as choirmaster at St Alban's, Holborn, and with the short-lived Wessex Philharmonic Orchestra forced him, gradually, up the British musical ladder. The peak of thatearly period was his conducting of the 1945 premiere of Peter Grimes: the Britten connection led him in the postwar years to the newly formed opera company at Covent Garden. But later that connection was broken (Britten took offence at some small slight) and the gradual but inexorable decline in his fortunes as a conductor set in. This is a tale alternately saddening and exhilarating to read. Lucas - husband of Anne Evans, Goodall devotee, a former Observer Arts Editor - tells it excellently: even for those British opera-lovers who think they know the ins and outs of it already, his Reggie will surely prove a compelling and fascinating read. The picture painted of Britten and his circle in the Grimes and early Aldeburgh years is full of incident (some of it new to print), intrigue and passions running high on all sides. Lucas does not shirk the snobbery, prevarication and shady dealing that operated at Covent Garden in the Webster-Drogheda era, nor the rough treatment Goodall underwent at the hands of Solti on his arrival there in 1961 - had it not been for a handful of obstinate Goodall champions, among them the critics Andrew Porter, David Cairns and the late Peter Heyworth, and then the Sadler's Wells visionaries Stephen Arlen and Edmund Tracey, Goodall's name would surely have been swept off the Royal Opera masthead sooner or later. But above all, this is the portrait of an extremely odd man, and it is undertaken with commendable frankness. However much one regrets the many chances missed, one comes to appreciate the number of obstacles placed by Goodall himself in the way of his own steady progress. Foremost among these must stand his pre-war fascist sympathies and his post-war reluctance to accept the full extent of the horrors unleashed by his beloved Germany. To his unbounded credit Lucas never shrinks from the issue. Neither does he sensationalise it - and indeed, the admiration Goodall could feel for such Jews as Klemperer does point to the self-contradiction and simple muddle that Lucas discerns at the core of his political ideals. In sum, this is a first-rate biography, painstakingly researched, judiciously balanced, crisply and lucidly written - and, as always in such cases, it illuminates much more than simply the remarkable main subject.</p>

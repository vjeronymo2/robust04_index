			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / DTI starts talks about Post Office The Department of Trade and Industry has begun consultations to help the government decide whether to include a bill to change the Post Office's status in next year's parliamentary timetable. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is one of a number of ministers involved in meetings aimed at determining how to proceed. One individual familiar with the position said: 'The department is keen to come to some conclusions.' Ministers were 'coming to a period' where the question of whether to legislate in the autumn parliamentary session 'has got to be decided upon'. Pressure on the government to determine a course of action is mounting both because ministers are already in the preliminary stages of drawing up a list of bills for the next session and because of the comments of the Post Office's senior management. Mr Bill Cockburn, the organisation's chief executive, last week fired the latest shot in a long-running campaign for privatisation by claiming that a quarter of the UK's 20,000 post offices could close unless the corporation was given commercial freedom. The government - which has been reviewing the Post Office's future for 21 months - will have to decide between about five options, ranging from the status quo to full privatisation. Mr Heseltine has made clear that he favours privatisation but many Tory MPs for rural areas believe the Post Office would close uneconomic sub-post offices after privatisation.</p>

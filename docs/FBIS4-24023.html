			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Enid Rhodes] </F>   [Text] Bloemfontein June 20 SAPA -- It would be the painful  task of the Orange Free State [OFS] Provincial Legislature --  within the parameters of the law -- to put an end to the culture  of anarchy, plunder and murder that began in the old order. Its  task would be to stop the rotting process from affecting the  healthy parts of Free State society and then to build on them  into the future, OFS Premier Patrick Lekota said in his state of  the nation address at the second sitting of the Provincial  Legislature in Bloemfontein on Monday [20 June].    Mr Lekota said that since the election there had been a  pattern of events that suggested there were several conceptions  of the meaning of freedom. These conceptions differed from that  of the legislature and of that of the negotiators and authors of  the interim Constitution and violated the provisions of that  Constitution. It was a conception that could only be described  as a "general free-for-all, dog-eat-dog and the devil gets the  hindmost".    That was the only way to describe the wholesale plunder and  theft of movable public property, the vandalism of immovable  property, unauthorised occupancy of public buildings, the  setting up of kangaroo courts in the jurisdiction of recognised  traditional leaders, the extortion of monetary contributions to  fake funeral funds by dubious characters masquerading as  activists of well-known political parties/organisations and the  commandeering of minibus taxis by groups of thieves, bent on  selfish motives, said the premier.    Mr Lekota said there was deep concern with the wholesale  occupation of property of individual farmers, property  developers, church property and that of business. This  destroyed black and white property owners alike. While  sensitive to the plight of deprived communities, this approach  could not be encouraged. It was a violation of rights enshrined  in the Constitution.    He said that in QwaQwa there were people who had occupied  public homes before the election. Proper rental had not been  collected from the occupants because of the ineptitude of those  who had composed the political leadership. This situation had  been inherited by the new government, but it could not allow it  to continue. Urgent steps had to be taken by the minister for  local government to negotiate proper rental and ensure that it  was paid.    A second category of illegal occupants of public property  were those who took advantage of the uncertainty of transition  after the election. People who were using public facilities for  private gain had to vacate these facilities with immediate  effect or the legislature would be compelled to act against them.    It would be a breach of faith and a crime against the people  if members of the Legislature allowed friends or relatives undue  access to public property or any other resources.    Mr Lekota said he was resolute that his administration  should  live up to the standards of public honesty and fairness that the  people of the OFS deserved. If they "lacked the guts" to  protect the property of the people against a few individuals  then they deserved none of the trust placed in them.    The OFS administration would not fire anyone from employment  without proper procedures of hearing. The principle of "audi  alteram partem" [hear the other side] would guide its actions at  all material times. But those who, after a proper hearing, were  found unable to account for their actions could and must expect  action against them.    Mr Lekota made this point in the light of the "nonchalant  and  lackadaisical manner" in which sections of the civil service had  been reported to have approached their work since the election.  Those who conceived of freedom as a condition of permanent  holiday, endless drinking sprees, laxity of group and individual  discipline, salary without service, sluggishness, general  collapse of order and organisation had to "revisit their  orientation". They were in the wrong place in the OFS.    The OFS intended to deliver on the promises made before the  elections. This meant hard work and there was no room for the  lazy or reluctant fellow-travellers. Everyone had to prove on a  daily basis that they deserved their job. Otherwise the  deserving unemployed should get a chance to prove themselves.</p>

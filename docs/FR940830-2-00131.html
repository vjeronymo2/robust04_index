			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Exhibit A <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Card Industry Directory: The Blue Book of the Credit and Debit Card Industry in the United States (Faulkner &amp; Gray) pp. 23&hyph;24, 1993 Edition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> the resources needed to promote use of their cards. Old-line retailers are particularly hard-pressed, and those programs have born the brunt of market retrenchment. New competitors such as specialty stores typically secure the services of third-party private-label card issuers instead of managing their own store-card programs, so that segment of the market is gaining on single-store cards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Major issuers of Visa and MasterCard are as likely to fill the role of third-party issuer as any other entity, and some of them are scoring remarkable successes. One standout program is the Select card issued by First of America Bank in partnership with home-improvement retailers such as furniture stores, carpet firms, and home centers. Those merchants sell the type of big-ticket items that are most likely to need revolving credit, so the profit potential is significant for the issuing bank. The merchants pay a flat monthly charge for acceptance, so they save money on their discount rates. And cardholders get a lower APR than most Visa and MasterCard cards command. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bankruptcy filings continued to take a toll on private-label cards, both proprietary plastic and third-party cards. Zale Corp.'s bankruptcy filing and liquidation in 1992 eliminated a major portion of the private-label portfolio at NationsBank, which also ranks as the 10th largest bank card issuer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> BANKS' DIMINISHED MERCHANT ROLE <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In the merchant processing business, consolidation is accelerating, with the five largest processors commanding more than 60% of the market. This part of the credit-card distribution system has come to be dominated by firms not controlled by banks, a trend that concerns some executives in the banking community. The trend is continuing, with Citicorp leaving the merchant arena in mid-1992. It sold Citicorp Establishment Services to venture capitalists who also own the industry's largest independent sales organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> But the trend has an up-side for some issuers. The growth of third-party processors has helped smaller card issuers maintain a niche in the market, analysts point out. Those issuers have been relieved of the need to maintain in-house processing services while still enjoying the efficiencies of scale those processors bring. The biggest third-party processors also are the most frequently cited merchant and cardholder processors used by the top 250 card issuers: FDR rates 85 mentions in Chapter 4, and Total System is cited 60 times. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sheer size enables the largest issuers to process in-house, and efficiencies of scale are getting better for many of them. Three major bank mergers affected the 10 largest bank card issuers since the directory's third edition was published. Manufacturers Hanover Trust, the 10th largest a year ago, was merged into Chemical Bank to form the eighth largest issuer. NCNB and C&amp;S/Sovran combined to form NationsBank. And BankAmerica maintained its position as the fourth largest card issuer on the strength of its April 1992 merger with Security Pacific Bank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mergers will keep the consolidation trend going. Comerica Bank already has merged with Manufacturers National Corp., and card operations were consolidated in August 1992. Security Bank &amp; Trust merged with First of America in April 1992, with merger of the respective credit card operations expected by mid-October. On May 2, 1992, Merchants National Corp. merged with National City Corp., adopting the name National City Indiana in October. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The portfolio sale which drove consolidation in recent years became a non-factor after mid-year 1991. Whether they return to their old prominence might depend on the overall health of the banking industry. A survey of banking executives conducted in 1991 found 23% of those with total assets of $5 billion or more expected to sell their card portfolios by the end of the decade because of a need to raise capital. If capital conditions become more favorable, either through market forces or regulatory changes, many of those banks could decide to retain their portfolios. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> AFFINITY CARDS ON THE WANE <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A credit card trend that may have run its course is the affinity card. Affinity programs reported by the 250 largest card issuers in the 1992 survey totaled 2,654, a moderate improvement from the previous year's 2,404. But if the marketing efforts of a single issuer, MBNA America, are factored out, a net loss occurred. MBNA lead the industry with 1,530 affinity programs, but a score of issuers report fewer affinity programs now than a year ago. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All but two of the 250 credit card issuers in Chapter 4 are Visa/MasterCard issues, and the dominance of Visa plastic continues to grow. In the directory's first edition, 54.5% of those issuer's card were Visa. The following year the ration jumped to 57.1%., then 57.5%. In this latest survey, the Visa share has climbed to 58.4%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One other trend not readily apparent in the pages that follow is the decline in the average number of cards per credit-card account. When the first edition of the directory was published three years ago, the top 250 issuers averaged 1.5 cards per account. The ratio has steadily declined in the intervening years and know stands at 1.44 cards per account. That tent is more likely a reflection of the social trend toward more single-person households and greater numbers of women in the labor force than any concerted effort by card issuers to issue fewer cards per account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Likewise, the outlook for credit and debit profitability will probably be dictated by economic circumstances beyond the industry's control. But industry competition will also play a major role, and the chapters in this directory give the most complete presentation, segment by segment, of who the major competitors are and how they compare to the rest of the industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The more specific concerns of commenters opposed to the proposed regulations may be summarized as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The proposed regulations are overly prescriptive and excessive in detail and either exceed the statutory authority of the Secretary or significantly expand the statute beyond Congressional intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The proposed regulations will force institutions to engage in excessive and duplicative information gathering and reporting, at considerable cost, with no net increase in the quantity or quality of information available to the public, and will result in the diversion of institutions' already scarce resources away from their primary mission of providing a quality education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The proposed regulations compromise the integrity of accreditation as a voluntary system of peer review and institutional improvement; they dilute the focus and purpose of accreditation by requiring accrediting agencies to assume responsibilities that are more appropriate to the State or Federal government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The proposed regulations will create undue, duplicative, and costly burdens on accrediting agencies for which they will receive no reimbursement from the Federal government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The proposed regulations give the Secretary approval authority over accrediting agencies' standards, which commenters believe is expressly forbidden by the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The proposed regulations threaten the diversity of American higher education and fail to focus oversight properly on vocational institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to receiving comments in opposition to the proposed regulations, the Secretary received many comments supportive of the NPRM. Some commenters, for example, believed the accreditation process needed a major overhaul, that accrediting agencies were far too secretive in their actions, and there was genuine need for substantially increased accountability of accrediting agencies to students and the general public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Secretary received suggestions from several commenters that the Department should strongly encourage all triad members to work together and adopt the same or similar language for the various standards, should collect the necessary data through a common source such as readily available public information or IPEDS, and should use common methodologies for various calculations such as completion or withdrawal rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As suggested by several commenters, the Secretary has carefully reviewed each requirement in the proposed regulations in light of statutory intent. The Secretary has also carefully considered both the burden of the proposed regulations on institutions and accrediting agencies, in terms of cost, duplication of effort, and the added recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Similarly, the Secretary has considered the benefits of the proposed regulations, not just to institutions and accrediting agencies but to students and the general public as well. A particular concern of the Secretary has been how to ensure that the regulations hold the three members of the triad accountable for the manner in which they fulfill their responsibilities under the HEA yet still provide each member of the triad the flexibility to determine the appropriate means to carry out those responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the Secretary has responded to the concerns of commenters by eliminating much of what was perceived as excessive detail in the NPRM, thus providing accrediting agencies more flexibility to meet a particular requirement in the manner that best suits their needs and the needs and individual circumstances of the institutions or programs they accredit. At the same time, however, the Secretary has increased the accountability of agencies, as, for example, by strengthening the requirements that accrediting agencies must have effective standards and must monitor institutions or programs carefully for continued compliance with those standards. The final regulations make it quite clear that the Secretary regards accrediting agencies as having primary responsibility for educational quality, but they also make it clear that the Secretary holds accrediting agencies accountable for the quality of the institutions or programs they accredit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has also responded to the concerns of commenters by eliminating a number of the specific reporting and recordkeeping requirements the proposed regulations would have imposed on both accrediting agencies and institutions and by allowing agencies and institutions to work together to determine realistic requirements for reporting and recordkeeping. At the same time, the Secretary holds agencies accountable for the effectiveness of those requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

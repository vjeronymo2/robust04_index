			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["jsc"-attributed commentary: "The `Finlandization' of </F> NATO"]    [Text] When NATO formulated its Partnership for Peace  offer, it never thought of Sweden or Finland. And yet these two  countries have seized the opportunity and joined the  Partnership, thus taking a step that would have been  unimaginable a few years ago.    From the Finnish angle, this move no longer seems  spectacular  because Helsinki abandoned the concept of neutrality that it  felt obliged to pursue because of the Soviet Union's proximity a  long time ago. At that time, the Finns' freedom of decision  only went as far as the border of Soviet interests. At the same  time, by doing business with the Soviets, Finland developed into  one of the most prosperous nations in Europe. Today, Finland is  struggling with its worst industrial crisis for decades. The  Finns are seeking a way out of this crisis by orientating  themselves westward.    On the other hand, Sweden's policy of neutrality was not  created out of necessity, but out of a conviction that this was  the only correct path to take. Neutrality was Sweden's second  pillar, the first being the welfare state. Many Swedes still  recall proudly that neutrality protected the country against war  for hundreds of years. But today there is not enough money to  maintain the Army, so the Swedish military is pleading for  closer links with NATO. Neutrality, too, has lost its purpose  since the end of the Cold War. The welfare state has already  shrunk, and now Sweden is bidding farewell to its second  fundamental principle. It is to be expected that Sweden will  gradually abandon its neutrality for the purpose of joining NATO.</p>

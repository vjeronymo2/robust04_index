			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (3): Overheads are still too high - The banking sector has been slow to adjust to change OF all Peru's sectors, banking has been one of the slowest in adjusting to the new economic climate. In spite of the rapid contraction of the economy, which has seen the amount of money handled by the financial system shrink to one-third of mid-1980s levels, many of the 20 commercial banks have been flat-footed in their attempts to cut overheads. 'Operating expenses are still high,' says Mr Luis Cortavarria, the banking superintendent. 'They are falling, but not by as much as we would expect. Some banks are planning to cut jobs and to reduce their size. But this is happening slowly and it has not gone far enough yet.' Failure to rationalise partly explains Peru's gaping interest rate spreads, as financial institutions try to compensate for hefty overheads. Banks also have to contend with high taxes and the dead-weight of non-performing loans, which make up more than 20 per cent of total portfolios. The result is borrowing rates of at least twice international levels; a crippling burden for companies already battered by recession. Authorities believe Peru is still over-banked. It has sought to encourage consolidation by waiving a series of fees for merging banks, a dispensation likely to be extended by a further year to the end of 1994. The government has also attempted to refinance the commercial sector's non-performing loans  -which total at least Dollars 300m - by introducing a debt restructuring scheme. Funds of Dollars 100m in cash and Dollars 100m in bonds have been made available, but only about Dollars 30m has been disbursed. Mr Cortavarria says that further restructuring will probably rely on bond emissions, not cash release, because of fiscal restraints. 'Restructuring hasn't been handled as fast as we expected,' he says. 'We are expecting positive results down the road, but it is too early to say how successful the programme has been.' He hopes the process will quicken with the introduction of a scheme intended to allow banks to exchange problem loans for equity in debtor companies. The initiative should come into effect 'within the next few months'. Alongside the general 'demonetisation' of the financial system, a situation described as 'catastrophic' by one banker, there has been a marked shift towards 'dollarisation.' The result of lack of faith in the Peruvian sol, together with fears that inflation has not yet been killed off, has been that more than 80 per cent of bank deposits have been made in dollars. Mr Cortavarria is philosophical. 'This is something that we have to live with for a few years. It is going to take time for people to gain confidence in the sol - and this is perfectly understandable, given the hyperinflation of 1989. It is tough for Peruvians to have faith in their national currency.' Similar to the public's mistrust of the sol has been its drift towards a parallel banking system. The most spectacular unlicensed institution was the Clae Bank, under investigation by the superintendent since April, which was offering real interest rates of 150 per cent a year. The authorities, which admit they still do not know how the Clae sustained such rates, say they cannot allow banks to operate outside official regulations. The clampdown reflects other regulatory action taken over the past few years, aimed at 'cleaning up the financial sector'. In March 1991, rules were introduced requiring banks to employ international standards in assessing their loan portfolios, and authorities closed down debt-ridden home loan institutions and savings co-operatives. Four state development banks, which had run up huge bad loan portfolios, were scrapped. Authorities also put the Banco de la Nacion, which formerly monopolised state sector accounts, on an equal footing with commercial banks. In practice, little business has transferred to the private sector, which is extremely wary of taking on state customers. There has been international pressure for Banco de la Nacion, which maintains more than Dollars 400m of non-performing loans, to be closed. This is unlikely to happen; officials argue privately that the bank, which maintains Peru's largest network of branches, plays a social role which could not be filled by the commercial sector. The superintendent has also tightened up reserve requirements and lending criteria, further reducing liquidity. Authorities deny that such measures have pushed interest rates higher, arguing that most banks would rather lodge their money with the central bank than risk adding to their bad loan portfolios. Renewed attempts to shake up the financial system are expected this December, when Interbanc, the country's fourth largest, is put up for sale. The government's attempt to privatise Banco Popular last year ended in failure when the bank was liquidated after no buyers could be found. Authorities are hoping to have more success with Interbanc and with Banco Continental, the second-largest commercial institution, slated for sale in the first half of 1994. The timetable, however, looks in danger of slipping. It is unclear if there will be foreign interest in entering Peru's personal banking sector, given the existing structural problems. Banks such as Citibank, which has been in Peru for 73 years, have shown a preference for investment and corporate transactions. Some analysts expect interest from other Latin American banks wishing to expand in the region. Others have speculated that institutions such as Citibank and Banco de Lima, majority-owned by Credit Lyonnais, may seek to use their debt paper to buy up one or both banks. Mr Cortavarria admits that 'there has not been too much interest at this time,' but feels sure that 'it will come'. He believes foreign banks will be attracted by Peru's 'very strong economic potential' and by the prospects of investment banking as the country re-establishes international links. The hope is that foreign banks will set up branches in Lima as multinationals return and as Peru's privatisation drive gathers momentum. The entrance of foreign banks, plus new financing opportunities provided by recently established private pension funds, could help to reduce interest rates as well as injecting greater competition. According to one analyst: 'As people look for alternative means of financing, Peruvian banks will have to wake up.'</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Work accident reporting changed The Health and Safety Commission is proposing to improve its workplace accident reporting system to cover incidents that have been missed when compiling statistics. The addition of 15 types of accident mainly involves North Sea and railway incidents. The commission hopes the proposals will help clear up problems with under-reporting. While all 309 fatal accidents at work in the UK were reported last year, the commission believes there has been significant under-reporting of injuries that cause absences of more than three days.</p>

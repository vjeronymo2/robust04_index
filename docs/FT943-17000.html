			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / People: Burgess takes on worldwide role at Andersen Consulting Keith Burgess, head of Andersen Consulting in the UK, is to take on a new role as one of the worldwide firm's managing partners from the start of September. He will become managing partner for business integration and practice competence, which he says means 'making sure what we do and how we do it is right'. His replacement as managing partner for the UK will be James Hall, 39, who joined Andersen as a graduate trainee in 1976. Hall (right) says his theme is 'continuity'. The change is part of a restructuring of top jobs within Andersen Consulting, with the creation of a managing partner for 'packaged knowledge' and two other managing partner roles (market developments, and technology and products) being combined in Burgess's new job. It reflects its international growth and represents a shift away from the firm's predominant US roots; several other UK partners have recently taken on senior roles in the international firm. Burgess, 47, who has spent 24 years with Andersen since he gained his PhD in solid state physics, has been UK managing partner since 1989. He was approached about the new job by Andersen Consulting's chief executive on a lakeside walk during the annual meeting in Geneva in May. 'I am very excited about what we have done. Being able to operate and shape the worldwide firm were challenges I found irresistible,' he says. He will continue to be based in the UK but will spend more time travelling and co-ordinating activities around the world.</p>

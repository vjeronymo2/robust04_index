			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Smith wins victory on block vote MR JOHN SMITH, the new Labour leader, yesterday won a bloodless victory at the first meeting of the party's national executive committee that he had ever attended. Members decided unanimously to press ahead with plans to cut the unions' block vote from 90 per cent to 70 per cent of votes cast at party conferences. It was agreed before the general election in April that the change would take effect next year even though there was a widespread belief that some union leaders wanted the process delayed so that it could be considered as part of the reform of the party's links with the unions that is due to be brought forward at next year's conference. But while some NEC members said after the meeting that they wished the issue had been scheduled to be wrapped into the full review, a truce had clearly been reached in the meeting itself. It means that the unions' vote will have been reduced before the party conference debates their future role in party affairs. Mr Tom Sawyer, deputy general secretary of Nupe, the public employees' union, said he would have liked the issue to be part of the fuller review. But he added: 'The unions are unanimous in welcoming a change in the balance of power. This is only the first step.' Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, said: 'The mood throughout the party is in favour of this move . . . It does not pre-empt or preclude wider and further reforms to modernise the relationship between the party and the unions.' The NEC also agreed that a strategic document on the party's political direction under its new leader would be presented to the conference. Before then, it will be considered at a special NEC meeting in September. Mr Larry Whitty, Labour general secretary, said that the party had agreed increases in the full subscription and in the union affiliation fee from the beginning of next year as emergency measures to deal with Labour's Pounds 2m overdraft. The full subscription will rise from Pounds 15 to Pounds 18 a year and the affiliation fee from Pounds 1.60 to Pounds 1.70. At Westminster, the party is in negotiations about a review of the 'short money' funds it receives from the government for carrying out parliamentary opposition duties. The NEC also agreed the arrangements for the conference to discuss the general election and the party's membership and finances.</p>

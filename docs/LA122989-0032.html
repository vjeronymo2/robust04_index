			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WHERE IS $9.99-MILLION LOTTO WINNER?  </P> <P> Somebody, presumably a North County resident, either stands to become a  millionaire or suffer the most crushing loss in the five-year history of the  state lottery.  </P> <P> Whoever bought a Lotto ticket at an Encinitas supermarket on Dec. 20 and picked  the numbers 44-14-23-27-21-12 has won $9.99 million but has not yet contacted  lottery officials to claim the prize.  </P> <P> "There really is no way to track the person," lottery spokeswoman Carolyn  Walker said Thursday. "You don't have to sign any register or anything when you  buy the ticket, so we have no way of seeking people out."  </P> <P> If the winner doesn't appear, the erstwhile wealth will be returned to the  prize pool for someone else to win. In this case, it would be the biggest sum  that slipped away since the Lottery began in 1985.  </P> <P> "It's only happened a couple of times before," Walker said.  </P> <P> In June, 1988, a winning ticket in Hawthorne went unclaimed and $4.7 million  went back into the kitty. So, too, in January, 1987, when a ticket purchased in  San Francisco's Chinatown was never turned in and somebody lost $3.9 million.  </P> <P> "We never heard from them," said Walker.  </P> <P> Some overnight millionaires can't wait to let the world know they've gone warp  speed into a new tax bracket.  </P> <P> "We get people who call the press before it (the winning ticket) gets  validated," said Walker.  </P> <P> Just as typically, though, people either don't immediately know they have a  lucky ticket or choose to bide their time before they step into the limelight.  </P> <P> "This time of year, the person could be on vacation or any number of things  like that. It's hard to know," said Walker. "We did have someone, not long ago,  wait a couple of weeks. First, he talked to his tax person and a financial  adviser and did some planning."  </P> <P> The $9.99-million winner, who beat one-in-14 million odds, still has time to  come forward, as the lottery allows 180 days from the draw before a ticket must  be surrendered.  </P> <P> Whomever bought the $1 ticket from the Alpha Beta store on El Camino in  Encinitas would receive, after 20% is deducted for taxes, an annual $400,000  check for 20 years.  </P></p>

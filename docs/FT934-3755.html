			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / EU agrees research share-out The European Union agreed yesterday how to distribute research funds in the next five years, with information and communications technologies receiving the most, Reuter reports from Brussels. The research ministers' decisions were conditional on agreeing an overall budget, EC officials said. The ministers were also still discussing how to reform the EC's Joint Research Centre. The European Commission has proposed spending Ecu13.1bn (Pounds 10bn) on the so-called 1994-98 Fourth Framework Programme, which will channel money to companies and research institutes across Europe. But Britain, France and Germany, the biggest contributors to the research budget, say that is too high. The ministers agreed information and communications technologies should get 28.2 per cent of the budget; energy 18.15 per cent, industrial technologies 16 per cent; and biotechnology and other life sciences 13.1 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) --  Argentine President Carlos Menem today called for "a change"  toward democracy in Cuba and he underlined that "no country" in  Ibero-America "has achieved economic growth under a  dictatorship."    Menem, addressing the heads of state and government who are  attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de  Indias, Colombia, also defended his state reform policy as a  means of fostering development.    The Argentine president delivered his message after calling  for a 10-minute recess that was granted by host President Cesar  Gaviria, despite the delays that are piling up on the summit's  agenda.    "The economic deterioration process will be irreversible if  policies are not guided by a democratic government," Menem  underscored in an apparent response to the previous message by  Cuban leader Fidel Castro.    After explaining that "it is not my intention to meddle in  the affairs of other countries," Menem said that "politics, the  art of the possible, and socially projected economics, should  not be contemplated separately because they complement each  other."    The "profound" state reform that was set in motion in  Argentina "has not only strengthened the state's role but has  been an efficient weapon in combating corruption," he said.    Menem said that each of the large Argentine Government  institutions that were turned over to national and foreign  private investment "were true monuments to corruption."    Carlos Menem pointed out that he will ask the Ibero-American  heads of state and government to "join him in a campaign to  defend life."    "For me, life begins at the moment of conception, but we  will  discuss that at our work meetings," concluded Menem, who wants  the summit to speak out against abortion.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Pension age for women may rise THE Department of Social Security is expected to decide this summer on an increase in the state pension age for women - possibly as high as 65 - after six months of consultation ends today. The department's views on equalising male and female state retirement ages will be made amid Treasury pressure to bring the female age, currently 60, level with the male retirement age of 65. However, 63 remains a strong possibility. A white paper would follow, probably before the end of the year, with legislation in the session of parliament starting late next year. The political consequences of the decision are likely to be large - even though the change is likely to be phased in over a period of at least as long as a decade. The Treasury is particularly conscious of the cost savings of at least Pounds 3bn a year that a common retirement age of 65 would bring - even if the benefits would not be realised until the next century. A reduction in the male retirement age to 60 has been more or less ruled out because of the extra cost involved. That has made an increase in the women's retirement age almost certain. Past indications have been that a common retirement age of 63 was most likely. Nevertheless, the social security department is believed to be contemplating seriously a rise to 65. Colleagues of Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, point out that many other European countries are moving towards equalisation at 65. In the US there is a move towards retiring at 67 and in Japan towards 65. A 'flexible decade' of retirement appears to have been ruled out, however.</p>

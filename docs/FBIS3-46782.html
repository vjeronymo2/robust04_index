(KOTRA) said Tuesday. As  hawkers bring in more and more goods, Moscow has decided to  lower the duty-free limit to 2,000 U.S. dollars per person from  5,000 dollars.    The decision is expected to deal a heavy blow to traders in  Pusan and other international marketplaces, who have prospered  from their dealings with Russian peddlers over the last three  years, officials at KOTRA's Pusan branch said.    Russian sailors and traders have been top customers in the  southern port since Seoul and Moscow normalized diplomatic ties  in 1991 and their purchases from the so-called Texas market of  such necessities as refrigerators and bread are worth 10 billion  won (12.3 million dollars) a month, the officials said. Texas  market in eastern Pusan hired Russian-speaking students and  ethnic Koreans from Sakhalin early last year and set up shops  exclusively for Russians to meet the growing demand.</p>

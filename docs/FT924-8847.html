			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Economics Notebook: Sober views of the legacy of communism Three years ago today, the Berlin Wall came down. But all the implications of that momentous event are only slowly becoming apparent. It is debatable, for example, whether the US electorate would have chosen Governor Bill Clinton as the next president if communism and the Cold War were still alive. Even staunch pro-Europeans can question the wisdom of the European Community countries turning inwards and expending vast efforts first to ratify and then implement the Maastricht treaty. The particular vision of European union that grew out of the Hanover European summit in June 1988 is difficult to reconcile with the challenges facing Europe since the disappearance of the Iron Curtain. The economic development of eastern Europe has been a sobering experience. Governments and peoples have found the going harder than anticipated. Many free market missionaries who set off for Warsaw, Prague and points east with high hopes of profit and glory have returned chastened. It is not surprising, therefore, that the economic problems of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union feature strongly among this year's Amex Bank Review Awards for new writing on current economic and financial issues*. What is interesting is a new sobriety among the winners of this, the sixth annual Amex essay competition, where eastern Europe is concerned. The award-winning essays (the order of the prize winners will be announced later today) suggest a broad consensus that market forces alone are not enough to overcome the legacy of communism. Professor Richard Rose of the University of Strathclyde makes a powerful case that the achievement of sustained growth and western levels of consumption and social benefit in eastern Europe requires a 'civil economy' in the region. Prof Michael Dooley and Mr Peter Isard, respectively of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the International Monetary Fund, argue that special care must be given to institutions, incentives and planning if the former communist states are to be turned into market-based economies. Professor Rose says that in some aspects of policy-making - such as taxation  -the former communist countries can learn more from the newly industrialising countries of Asia than the mature western economies. But more important is his question: Are east European economies in transition moving toward a civil or uncivil economy. By a civil economy, he means one based on the rule of law. It is not enough to have free elections and introduce a private sector by dismantling the controls of the command economy so that individuals can freely buy and sell goods. 'A market also requires the enforcement of laws.' Reformers must ensure that the state legislates property rights, sees contracts are enforced, creates an effective tax system and maintains public order so enterprises can invest with security. Western-trained experts may not provide the best advice in these circumstances. 'So accustomed are economists to operating within a framework of a lawful society where corporate and national income accounts both have integrity that they mistakenly assume that the collapse of a command economy automatically creates a civil economy,' Prof Rose says. He warns that east European societies have a mixed economy, but with a different mix to the industrial member states of the OECD. 'It is a mixture of civil and uncivil elements.' Some uncivil activities might appear benign: who hasn't made use of a moonlighting craftsman? But the uncivil economy can extend to trafficking in illegal goods and services, extortion and bribery, and is an obstacle to investment in long-term growth. For these reasons, it must be attacked. However, it is typical of Prof Rose's approach that he pleads for a slow transition. In particular, eastern Europe should avoid the high tax, high government spending policies of OECD countries because these would be difficult to implement and could undermine the nascent democracies. Messrs Dooley and Isard are similarly cautious about leaving transition to market forces. 'Although we have great respect for the power of markets to help countries in transition join the rest of the world in the benefits of market-oriented institutions, we see great danger in overlooking the nonmarket institutional structure upon which markets depend,' they write. A successful transformation of eastern Europe will require reforms of what they call the economic 'woodwork' - employment contracts, banking regulations, bankruptcy laws, payments systems and such like - 'that typically receive little attention in discussion of macroeconomic policy design'. Otherwise, the east European economies could face economic hardship, including high unemployment and inflation, and political instability. The two US economists also argue that the east European states will have to subsidise the consumption of employees of the large industrial companies that can no longer survive in the post-communist environment and provide much of the credit needed to restructure these companies. As another Amex prize winner, Prof Sweder van Wijnbergen of the University of Amsterdam and the London School of Economics, says: 'Eastern Europe is not well served with straight textbook advice.' The conclusion to be drawn from the essays is that pragmatism and flexibility in policy-making are required before Adam Smith's invisible hand can be left to get on with its work. That is a big change in attitudes. If the Amex essays are a guide, experiences in eastern Europe in the years ahead could hasten the swing from dogmatic support for free market ideals in Britain and the US. * Finance and the International Economy: 6.

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Travel: The pharaonic splendours of old Thailand - A gaudy oriental opulence THAILAND'S principal historic sites - some of them ruins, some of them living temples - deserve to be seen. One of the most rewarding one-day excursions out of Bangkok is a trip to Ayuddhya, the capital of ancient Siam. Although there are numerous tour companies that will coach you there and back, the superior way is to do the return leg by boat along the Chao Phraya river, by preference on the Oriental Queen I or the Oriental Queen II, owned by the Oriental Hotel and equipped with guides from the World Travel Service, the oldest, largest and most efficient of Bangkok's many tour operators. A genuinely lavish on-board buffet luncheon is served, and the cruise includes an additional stop at Bang Pa-In: a 19th century summer palace built by Rama V and Rama VI. Although its mixture of Thai, classical, Italian, Chinese and even English buildings, reflecting the Chakri dynasty's desire to propel Siam on to the world stage, is not entirely successful, it has some pretty lakes that confer upon it the air of a tropical Marienbad. Ayuddhya, by contrast, is where the Thai nation really took off. Seventy kilometres to the north of Bangkok, it was built on an island chosen by its founder, King Ramathibodi, for the leverage it gave him over the whole of the Menam basin. That was in 1350, during the final eclipse of the Khmer kingdom of Angkhor. Unlike previous Thai princes, the rulers of Ayuddhya made no bones about their pretentions to power. Carrying with them the full weight of Buddhist ritual, they set themselves up as gods. Their subjects were expected always to present their backs to them whenever they chose to leave the palace, and audiences were conducted in an elaborate throne-hall in which the throne, panoplied in gold, was raised many feet, so that the king appeared mystically, as though floating on a cloud. To enhance their divine status, the Ayuddhya kings developed a city to match, in which palaces mingled promiscuously with temples, proclaiming the true nature of the medieval polity. And it worked. Always cosmopolitan, Ayuddhya in time became a genuinely international inland port, a 'strong great city, seated upon an island round which flowed a river three times the size of the Seine', as the Abbe de Choisy wrote in the 17th century. 'There rode ships from France, England, Holland, China and Japan, while innumerable boats and gilded barges rowed by 60 men plied to and fro.' Yet Ayuddhya was eventually strangled by its own pomp. As the Abbe also observed, watching a royal procession, 'I feel that Pharaoh on the banks of the Nile used to parade in the same splendour.' The kings became progressively more remote from their subjects, and the kingdom was enfeebled by scheming courtiers until, in 1767, the city was sacked by a Burmese army. Ayuddhya was destroyed. The predominantly wooden buildings were burned to the ground, while much of the stone of the palaces and temples was later removed. Not very much remains. In the centre of the city three great bell-shaped stupas, or chedi, still stand, joined in line like the superstructure of some unfathomable alien battleship. These, along with other stupas, are what visitors are taken to see. Around the ruins of Ayuddhya a new, sprawling 20th century town is growing, the effect of which does not entice. In marked contrast is the site of the older city of Sukhothai, 450 kms north-west of Bangkok, the whole of which has been preserved from encroachment. Again, not many of the buildings have survived, but what has been created is an enormous and bewilderingly peaceful park, with bicycles for hire at the main entrance. Sukhothai's name means 'Dawn of Happiness.' In its time it was an important city, and other cities near it were held in vassalage. But it was never more than the centre of one kingdom among several in the Menam basin. Surviving inscriptions also indicate a less stratified society than the one that evolved at Ayuddhya. The kings, far from being demi-gods, were humans who took an active role in the daily running of affairs, and at least one of them held court in a sugar-plum grove, where, on the sabbath, Buddhist monks intoned the Law. An official and slightly lavish pictorial brochure tells the visitor that a joint Thai-UNESCO restoration programme 'will protect a fine example of the cultural heritage of all mankind.' That is propaganda, yet Sukhothai is innately, if demurely, spectacular. A model reconstruction shows that the medieval city, unlike too many of its counterparts, was meticulously planned. Founded during the 13th century on both sides of the Yom river, its triple rampart walls defined a rectangular area measuring 2 kms by 1 1/2 , traversed in both directions by a grid of roads and canals. Inside, as well as scores of temples and public buildings, were foundries, kilns, lakes and granaries, as well as orchards and fields. Under siege, Sukhothai was self-sufficient beyond the patience of most hostile armies. The model demonstrates the Thais' ability to plan to scale. On the site itself, as at Ayuddhya, it is mainly the stupas that have survived, Hindu as well as Buddhist, along with the bases and pillars of the prayer-halls and ordination rooms, and, most dramatically, some arresting Buddha images. These latter, either seated or standing, and relatively unscathed by the ravages of time, stare impassively across and through the ruins, creating an awesome visual poetry. Even so, the ruins themselves provide an equal insight into Thai culture and the Thai mind. Although stonework abounds, much of what survives is laterite, bricks made of small stones mixed with clay which hardened in the sun. These structures were then covered with a stucco made from sand, sugar-cane juice, water and even insects, producing the receptive smooth surfaces onto which gold and other brilliant colours could be applied. It is precisely this, the penchant for brilliant surfaces, combined with forms that are more feminine than those generally found in western architecture and decoration, that defines the almost gaudy oriental opulence that is synonymous with Thailand, and the continuity of its culture. For while the stucco has largely vanished from Ayuddhya and Sukhothai, in Bangkok itself it is wonderfully preserved, in the great buildings of the old quarter: the Grand Palace, the Golden Mount and a dozen glittering temples, among them Wat Po, Wat Phra Kaeo and Wat Benchamabophit. Transport: Most major airlines fly to Bangkok. The national carrier, Thai International, is recommended: as well as in-flight orchids, it offers a range of packages and incentive schemes and a good network of domestic flights. Bangkok Airways services Samui, Hua Hin and Phuket. In general, roads are good and air-conditioned coaches preferable to the Thai railway system.

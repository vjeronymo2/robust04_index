			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Property: Cottages in all sizes, always near a station - Gerald Cadogan finds many a 'des. res.' in the green fields of Sussex SUSSEX is a surprise. It is easy to imagine it as suburban sprawl grown up round the railway, but as I took the train to the county where I grew up (and have hardly visited since) the large tracts of well farmed country astonished me. So much green space - and so many old houses, medieval period to 17th century, still in use. Queen Anne and Georgian houses are few, except in Lewes, the old county town, and Chichester, the cathedral town. The 'beamy farmhouses,' described by Mary Still, of Stacks relocation agents (0428-751509), are everywhere: rich in character; a hazard to the tall. Mind your head when you live in the county of Goodwood and Glyndebourne. The South Downs, a low range of chalk hills, seem majestic. They rule Sussex and bar it from the sea. And - just as when I was a boy - it takes ages to get from Sussex to London by road (hard to believe if your normal route into town speeds along the M4 from the west, or the M11 from East Anglia). Before the railways shaped modern Sussex, it was nothing but sticky clay, small ironworking settlements, and forests, which the iron men chopped to fuel their forges. Journeying to the coast from London was an ordeal, however much the wicked delights of Brighton and other Regency watering holes beckoned the 'beaux.' The railways' success has meant that trunk roads have lagged. Only now is the bypass round Brighton for the A27 coast road near completion, and east of Lewes it still awaits massive improvement. Sussex houses were cottages (large ones for the ironmasters) built of wood, filled in with wattle and daub (as in Normandy, which is Sussex's cross-Channel counterpart in everything except cider, calvados and cream - in England these belong to the west country). More prosperous cottage-dwellers would put a brick or flint facade on the timber frame and hang tiles on the upper walls like a shingle cladding, to protect the wattle and daub against the weather. This is the typical Sussex house. If you see brick or flint, look for timber underneath. Although the railways brought newcomers, affluence and gentrification into the county, people still built in the same old Sussex style, endorsed in the 20th century houses of Lutyens and Norman Shaw. Besides the mediaeval survivors, many well-built 'Sussex' houses date between 1880 and 1920, in any size, attractive places to live. They are always coming on the market, and they are always near a station. Bridgers, in West Chiltington near Pulborough, is a pretty 1920s cottage on offer at about Pounds 295,000 from John D Wood (071-493-4106) and Fowlers in Pulborough. When you return, jaded, from the city, Sussex greenery can still put you right, thanks to a hundred years of affluence which has encouraged firm views on planning and conservation. Strategic gaps separate the towns and villages. Any moves to fill the gaps face fierce opposition. Long-term high prices for houses and land are the result, though they are now about 35 per cent down on 1989. 'If you have cash, this is the time to buy - you can be sure to negotiate a good price' is the agents' message. Interest picked up in the autumn of 1991, but then declined sharply before the election. The few successful sales were grouped in the Pounds 100,000-Pounds 200,000 range, where purchasers were not overworried about the outcome of the election and possible higher taxes. Now the market should rebound across the board. At the top, Humberts (0273-478828) is offering a superb Elizabethan E-shaped large house and 15 acres for about Pounds 1m. Streat Place overlooks a tiny village set back from the Downs between Hassocks and Lewes. It is that rarity in Sussex: a building of substance, grand enough to have stone corners, not at all in the timber cottage-style, although the hung tiles and the flint in the walls say loudly and clearly that it is in Sussex. More typical of the county is the timber and brick Mercers Cottage at Twineham (near Brighton and Haywards Heath). Well placed for the horse trials at Hickstead, it is actually two separate buildings which make an attractive ensemble: a two-bedroom cottage - ideal as a place for grandparents, teenagers or an American-style guesthouse - and a three-bedroom converted barn moved from elsewhere. The guide price is Pounds 365,000. At the west end of the county, polo players at Cowdray will want to inspect the Old Rectory at Bepton near Midhurst, complete with stables and 19 acres. Strutt &amp; Parker (0273-475411) is bringing it on to the market at over Pounds 600,000. The same agents have Antioch House, an outstanding 17th-18th century town house on the corner of the High Street and Rotten Row in Lewes. Offered at over Pounds 400,000, this is a smart merchant's house in one of England's finest towns; a place for curling up to read Jane Austen, thankful that the third of an acre of walled garden is not too demanding. Dale Hamme at Piltdown, built in 1452, offers one of Sussex's real medieval experiences. Its ancient beams and inglenook fireplaces are genuine (unlike the bogus Piltdown Man 'found' in a nearby gravel pit), and there are paddocks and stabling for childrens' ponies. GA Town &amp; Country (0825-761844) offers it at about Pounds 450,000. An alternative with less ground, at about Pounds 225,000, is Batsford Farmhouse at Iwood Place, near Heathfield in East Sussex. This is a late 15th century E-shaped hall house (like Streat Place, but of earlier date) built by ironmasters. Unfortunately a fire in the 16th century lost the house its wings, leaving an unusual long house. John D Wood is the agent. Further east, GA Town &amp; Country is the agent for Great Beech near Battle (of 1066 and all that), a Kentish style farmhouse with a converted oast house and barn with planning permission. There are 28 acres, and the guide price is Pounds 525,000 - or the property may be split into three lots. If you enjoy gardening, you may be interested in Stone Court at Staplefield, in the heart of the rhododendron belt. Nymans, Leonardslee and Wakehurst Place gardens are all nearby, and so is Gatwick. The old part of the house is 17th century. John D Wood and Barton &amp; Wyatt (081-977-3374) offers this sumptuous house with swimming pool, tennis courts, many bedrooms and 22 acres, for about Pounds 850,000.</p>

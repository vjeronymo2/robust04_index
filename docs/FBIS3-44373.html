They  would also like to express their thanks for your enthusiastic  support for the work carried out by the news agency over the  past year.    During the past year, we have endeavored to improve our  services toward newspapers, and radio and television stations.  Our editorial staff has improved the transmission of news items  to newspapers in Beijing; to party organs in various provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the  central government; and to newspapers in small and medium  cities. We have further increased the number of special-line  transmissions to radio and television stations, and enriched the  contents of such transmissions. In the new year, we will  continue to improve our services toward newspapers, and radio  and television stations. We earnestly hope for your continued  support and assistance.    The year 1994 is one of reform in which news reporting tasks  will be extremely heavy. All comrades at XINHUA NEWS AGENCY  wish all newspaper offices, and radio and television stations  even greater success in propagating the party's basic line and  in promoting the establishment of a socialist market economic  system under the guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    May the close cooperation between XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and  other newspaper offices, and radio and television stations  further develop and strengthen.    May our comrades succeed in their work and enjoy good  health.    [Signed] XINHUA NEWS AGENCY    [Dated] 31 December 1993</p>

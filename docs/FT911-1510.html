			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Allowable losses on the expiry of options I UNDERSTAND that the abandonment of a traded option is treated for CGT as a disposal at nil value, so that the indexed cost becomes an allowable loss. Can you tell me whether this treatment also applies to bond warrants dealt in on the London Stock Exchange. My inquiry relates more specifically to Phibro Salomon No 1 Warrants, which expired worthless on 13 November 1990. No allowable loss accrues on the expiry of any option to acquire or dispose of qualifying corporate bonds or designated gilt-edged securities because of section 29(2) and 67(1) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, as amended. The definition of 'qualifying corporate bonds' is to be found in section 64 of the Finance Act 1984, as amended. Subject to that exclusion, indexed allowable losses accrue on the expiry of options of the following types, by virtue of section 137(4) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, as amended: (a) an option (including an option warrant) which at the time of expiry is quoted on a recognised stock exchange or on a recognised futures exchange; (b) an option relating to shares or securities granted by a member of a recognised stock exchange, provided that - if the member is acting as agent for a non-member - the underlying shares or securities are dealt in on a recognised stock exchange (not necessarily the exchange of which the agent grantor is a member); c) an option relating to shares or securities granted (as principal) by an authorised person or a listed institution, as defined in the Financial Services Act 1986. That list is not exhaustive, but probably covers the types of option which interest you. The list was shorter before April 29, 1988 (the day specified in the Finance (No 2) Act 1987 (Commencement) Order 1988). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

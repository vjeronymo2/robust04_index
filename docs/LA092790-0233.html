			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE;  </P> <P> POMONA-PITZER TRIES TO CONTINUE ITS FAST START AGAINST WHITTIER  </P> <P> The Pomona-Pitzer football team, off to its best start since 1970, will try to  remain undefeated when it plays host to Whittier in a Southern California  Intercollegiate Athletic Conference game on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. at Strehle  Field in Claremont.  </P> <P> The Sagehens (2-0) defeated Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, 31-20, last week. It was  Pomona-Pitzer's first victory over the Stags since 1985 and its first  conference victory since 1987.  </P> <P> Whittier (0-2) and has been outscored this season, 80-29. The Poets lost to  Redlands, 42-16, last week.  </P> <P> Pomona-Pitzer has already won as many games as it won the previous two seasons.  The change in fortunes has been partly the result of an outstanding offense.  The Sagehens lead the SCIAC in total offense with an average of 372 yards a  game and passing offense at 237.5 yards.  </P> <P> The Sagehens, who have outscored their first two opponents, 73-55, have been  led by junior quarterback Scott Hamburg and sophomore running back Chris Smith.  Hamburg is the leading passer in the SCIAC, having completed 29 of 58 passes  for 475 yards and five touchdowns. Smith is leading the conference with an  average of 102 yards rushing and 160 all-purpose yards a game.  </P> <P> Whittier is ranked first in the conference in passing defense, having allowed  an average of only 93 yards a game. Whittier's top offensive player has been  quarterback Len Burton, who has completed 28 of 51 passes for 331 yards and a  touchdown.  </P> <P> In other games matching four-year colleges at 1:30 p.m. Saturday, Azusa Pacific  (2-1) will play host to Humboldt State, La Verne (0-2) plays host to Occidental  (1-2) and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (0-2) will entertain Menlo.  </P> <P> After receiving its highest ranking of the season, the Cal Poly Pomona women's  volleyball team will visit U.S. International University -- an NCAA Division I  squad -- in a nonconference match on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in San Diego.  </P> <P> The Broncos, who have moved up to No. 11 in the American Volleyball Coaches  Assn. Division II rankings with a 19-5 record, finished third in the Cal State  Dominguez Hills tournament behind Division II powers UC Riverside and  Sacramento State.  </P> <P> Pomona, under the direction of first-year Coach Gene Krieger, has been sparked  by sophomore right-side hitter Alicia Burns (5-8) and freshman left-side hitter  Heather Matthews (5-11).  </P> <P> The Broncos have already won more games than they did last season, when they  finished 16-18.  </P> <P> The Broncos open their California Collegiate Athletic Assn. schedule on Tuesday  at 7:30 p.m. when they visit Chapman. Pomona placed fifth in the conference  last season and Chapman finished in a tie for second with Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> The Cal Poly Pomona men's soccer team, which gained a victory and a tie in a  two-game road trip to Northern California last week, opens its California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. season with a match against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo  on Friday at 7:30 p.m. in San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> The Broncos tied San Francisco State, 1-1, and edged Cal State Hayward, 1-0,  last week to improve their record to 2-4-2.  </P> <P> Pomona has been led on offense by senior midfielder Kip Shipley, who is among  the conference scoring leaders with three goals and an assist for seven points.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nouakchott, 26 Jun (AFP) -- The Mauritanian  Government yesterday sent a medical team to Rwanda to support  French intervention in that country, the MAURITANIAN NEWS AGENCY  (AMI) reported today.    This decision was made by the Nouakchott government "to  alleviate the sufferings of the people who are victims of the  Rwandan civil war," AMI said. The news agency did not, however,  say how many people are on that medical team.    This is the first time Mauritania is intervening in an  outside conflict.</p>

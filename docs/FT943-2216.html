			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Kwik Save ends 'standstill agreement' with Dairy Farm Kwik Save, the discount retailer, and its main shareholder Dairy Farm International, are ending the 'standstill agreement' that prevents Dairy Farm from selling its stake or making a full bid for the company without prior notice. The two sides said the agreement had 'outlived its purpose' and would lapse after Kwik Save's full-year results in November. Dairy Farm, which holds 29.4 per cent of Kwik Save, added it had 'no present intention' of making an offer for the company. Kwik Save's shares closed down 3p at 604p. The shares have rallied recently on rumours that Dairy Farm was preparing a bid. Mr Derek Pretty, Kwik Save's finance director, said the agreement had been reached after Dairy Farm, a Hong Kong-based company owned by Jardine Matheson, first acquired a 25 per cent stake in Kwik Save in 1987 - later increased by open market purchases to the present level. It gave Dairy Farm board representation, and required it to give 30 days' notice of an intention to sell its stake or make a bid. Since then, the two companies had developed a 'co-operative, supportive and positive relationship', with the two managements 'very much intertangled'. Dairy Farm provided Kwik Save's last two chief executives, and its latest chairman, Mr Simon Keswick. Institutional investors indicated they did not favour the agreement, and Mr Pretty said the 30-day 'window' would have had a disruptive effect on the market for Kwik Save shares if Dairy Farm had indicated an intention to bid. He said shareholders were adequately protected by the Takeover Code rules on bids.</p>

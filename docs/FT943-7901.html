			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / BR may draft staff to break strike British Rail staff with signalling qualifications may be seconded to Railtrack to help break the nine-week series of strikes by signal workers, it emerged yesterday. The dispute has become so damaging to the railway network, particularly to the freight business, that BR is considering all available options to reduce its impact, an official said. The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association said some of its members had been interviewed but it advised them against taking such a step because it would involve working for a different company. Details of BR's plans became known on a day when the dispute with the RMT transport union showed renewed signs of spreading to other rail unions. Aslef, the train drivers' union, repeated an earlier warning that its members might take action over safety. BR said it was contacting its staff to see if they would volunteer to be seconded to signalling duties after refresher training. This is likely to involve few of BR's 110,000 staff because most people with signalling expertise are already with Railtrack 'but it may get into three figures', BR said. This move follows a warning from BR chairman Sir Bob Reid earlier this month that staff might be used to help Railtrack. 'The business is being very badly damaged,' the BR official said yesterday. 'Hitherto there has been the prospect of a settlement but we can no longer stand by and watch the industry bleed to death.' People who would be likely to have signalling qualifications included train planners and operations staff. Railtrack said that even a small number of extra staff in its signal boxes could make a big difference to the scale of the train service operated. The train operating companies promised to provide the most comprehensive strike service yet during the 24-hour stoppage planned from midday Monday to midday Tuesday. Overnight sleeper and Motorail services between Scotland and London could face closure because of damage caused by the rail strike. The service from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Fort William and Aberdeen to London Euston has lost 21 nights of business since the strike began. 'It is under review but no decisions have been taken,' InterCity West Coast said. The service runs 10 trains a night.</p>

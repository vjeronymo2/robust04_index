Without naming the  serious incidents at the beginning of the week in Cite Soleil,  the military institution asks all sons of the country for more  peace and tolerance and expresses hope that the coming year will  be the beginning of a new era for all, auguring the  establishment of a real democracy and a state of law  guaranteeing more justice to all Haitians and better prospects  for their children.    It should be noted that more than (5,000 million) gourdes  have been collected within the framework of humanitarian  assistance for the victims of Cite Soleil. Furthermore, the U.S.  Government is studying the possibility of a long-term  reaccommodation for those people. A protocol of assistance was  signed on 29 December between the United States, the Haitian  Government, and the health centers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kathmandu, June 8 (AFP) -- Nepal has announced new  visa regulations with lower fees and longer periods of validity  aimed at boosting the tourism industry with effect from July 16,  an official source said Wednesday.    Under the new visa regulations, foreigners investing in  Nepalese business and industry will be given five-year multiple  entry visas.    The cost of ordinary tourist visas will drop to 15 dollars  from the current rate of 20 dollars for a 15-day stay, which can  be extended to 35 days for another 25 dollars, the official said.    Tourist group leaders and foreigners staying in Nepal for up  to six months to conduct feasibility studies in industrial and  trade activities will be given non-tourist visas, the official  added.    Tourists arrivals to Nepal dropped to 293,567 in 1993 from  334,353 the previous year. Tourist receipts fell to 61.09  million dollars in 1993 from 72.10 million dollars.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Books: Appalling, but never boring JUST THE ONE by Graham Lord Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 16.00, 340 pages JEFFREY Bernard has made a living out of failure: not a good living but an interesting one. He failed at school, failed with his mother, failed with four wives and a reputed 500 mistresses, failed as a novelist, failed to give up drinking, frequently failed as a journalist. He even failed to commit suicide successfully on numerous occasions. Finally his failure made him a modest fortune when old pal Keith Waterhouse transmogrified the 'Low Life' column in The Spectator, Bernard's weekly diatribe on his purgatory, into a stage play. With Peter O'Toole playing the anti-hero, Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell was a surprise hit, providing enough money for Bernard to pay off his income tax. Now comes his biography, stoically written by Graham Lord. (Bernard failed to deliver an autobiography despite accepting advances from three publishers and running an ad. asking for information as to what he was doing between 1960 and 1974). Rarely can a biographer have painted such an honestly unbecoming portrait of his subject. For years Bernard got away with stealing from friends, seducing their wives, selling his body, throwing up over the Queen Mother and much more because he was handsome and witty, with upper middle class charm. But, as Francis Bacon put it, 'What are you going to do now, Jeffrey, now that your looks are gone?' The answer was obvious. Bernard, now 60, has spent the past 20 years re-telling the horror stories of the first 40 years of his life. Lord has padded these out by talking to his ex-wives (generally hostile) and girlfriends, and his old boozing partners. Bernard has heroically co-operated, although his memory is blurred for the many years when he was almost totally drunk. Lord's own horror stories are breathtaking: Bernard ignoring his mentally disturbed sister when she became a Soho bag lady; Bernard coming to terms with the fact that his third wife had a daughter even though he was sterile; Bernard going drinking on his honeymoon night (probably a recurring phenomenon). In his 'End Piece' Lord tries to make the best of Bernard, on the lines that 'he brightened our lives'. But this hardly excuses the overwhelming selfishness which has enabled him to trample on so many people. As the book says, Jeffrey Bernard rarely laughs; but he might smile at his contribution to a biography which is appalling but never boring.</p>

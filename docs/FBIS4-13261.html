			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alia Izetbegovic today  sent a message to the president of our country from Sarajevo.  The text of this message is as follows:    Your Excellency Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the  Islamic Republic of Iran.    Dear Mr. President: I am sure that Your Excellency is aware  of the tragedy that has befallen the inhabitants of Gorazde.  The Serbian Army, which for the past two years, before the eyes  of the world, has committed barbaric crimes in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, is at the moment laying siege to a city that  has 70,000 inhabitants, most of whom are women and children.  The people of that city are desperately awaiting the assistance  of international organizations.    Dear brother, at the most difficult and hard times, the  Iranian people and Government have been with us and have helped  us. Therefore, we will never feel alone. We are confident that  you and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will make  every effort to defend the inhabitants of Gorazde and to prevent  their destruction [soqut-e hasti], in view of the spiritual  values which we adhere to.    Our faith and certainty in the brotherly assistance of Iran  gives us the confidence to remain steadfast during these very  critical moments.    May the merciful and compassionate God protect you with his  blessings. With the most sincere greetings,    [Signed] Alia Izetbegovic    [Dated] 17 [as heard] April 1994, Sarajevo</p>

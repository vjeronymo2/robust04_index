			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Keidanren urges more deregulation The Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business federation, yesterday stepped up its campaign for more economic deregulation, amid the latest signs of a corporate recovery. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, who became Keidanren's chairman at the start of this month, called on Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to halve the number of business regulations in the next five years. He urged the government to 'break the wall of vested interests'. There were 11,402 regulatory permits and approvals in force in March 1993, 460 more than the previous year, and the seventh year running of growth in the red tape mountain, according to the government's Management and Co-ordination Agency. They cover industries representing 40 per cent of gross national product, estimates the Tokyo office of Baring Securities. Highly publicised deregulation drives by successive administrations have failed because of ministries' reluctance to lose power, and fear of competition, mainly among small companies in highly regulated sectors such as distribution. By contrast, big manufacturing business, represented by the Keidanren, supports deregulation to cut costs and in the hope that a more open market might bring a fall in the value of the yen, strength of which is hampering exports. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the previous prime minister, staged a fresh deregulation drive on taking office last August, but only held power for eight months, not enough to make significant progress on his hit list of 94 regulations. Mr Hata, whose government may be even shorter lived, yesterday called on cabinet ministers to display 'leadership' in pulling together by the end of this month a package of proposals to cut red tape. Fresh evidence that the worst of the recession is over for large companies came yesterday with a 33 per cent year-on-year decline by value in bankruptcies last month, reported by Teikoku Databank. However, the number of corporate collapses rose by 7.3 per cent over the same period, suggesting that small companies continue to suffer. Many businesses are still faced with surplus capacity, shown by a 2.5 per cent decline in private sector machinery orders in April, from the same month last year, the government's Economic Planning Agency reported yesterday. Cost cutting rather than sales growth will be the main feature of corporate Japan's expected profits recovery this year, according to a survey of the recent annual results of 1,198 quoted companies by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They told the TSE they expected quoted pre-tax profits to rise by a combined 6.44 per cent this year on nearly stagnant sales, up by just 0.25 per cent.</p>

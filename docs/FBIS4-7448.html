			<p>BFN     [Text] [Studio announcer] Radovan Karadzic and Nikola  Koljevic, president and vice president of the Srpska republic,  and Chairman of the Srpska republic assembly Momcilo Krajisnik,  today held talks in Pale with members of the British Foreign  Office delegation headed by Roger (?Bown). The leadership of  the Serbian republic told the British diplomats that peace  should first be established and territory demarcated in the area  of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, then political talks could be  initiated on the Croatian-Muslim Federation and the Serbian  republic's position regarding this newly established state.  Here is what Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the Srpska  republic, told our correspondent Dragan Colovic on his  expectations of the talks with U.S. President Clinton's special  envoy Charles Redman, scheduled for tomorrow [31 March]:    [Begin recording] [Koljevic] Well, we expect a further  concretization of the talks initiated by the British, therefore,  we expect the beginning of discussions on the demarcation and  the beginning of discussions about those urgent measures that  need to be taken in order to establish and strengthen peace. I  believe that it was Mr. Akashi who said that peace was on glass  legs; that is accurately stated; peace should move on from those  glass legs to a more stable basis, a more stable material than  glass. We shall discuss this with Mr. Redman and, of course, we  shall also discuss the possibilities of the preliminary  framework for the demarcation with the newly established  federation.    [Colovic] Will issues pertaining to relations between the  Serbian republic and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also be  included in the talks?    [Koljevic] Well, most probably. It depends on what kind of  concept is proposed for a link between the Srpska republic and  this newly established federation, that is, there are various  ways in which the Srpska republic can achieve its independence  and sovereignty, and, of course, realize its natural links with  Yugoslavia. I say natural, because it is quite normal and the  international community is aware that the links between the  Srpska republic and Yugoslavia are far more natural than the  links currently burdened by antagonism. [sentence as heard] Of  course, time will show that this antagonism can be overcome, but  links with our brothers in Yugoslavia can only grow stronger.  Therefore, we are primarily going to see what would be the  internationally desirable sequence of measures that would not be  in contradiction with out strategic interests. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Fears of rate rise STERLING'S steep slide on the foreign exchanges obliterated any bullishness that might have lingered in the cash and futures markets yesterday, with some dealers beginning to wonder whether Britain might be on the verge of an interest rate rise. Even in the relatively inexpensive conditions that prevailed in the cash market yesterday, rates could not but fail to go up. A Pounds 1.05bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England at the start of the day was swiftly removed by dealers. An easier flow of money from the authorities, however, could not stop rates firming in the afternoon, as the pound sank to a DM2.8525 London close, later plumbing a low of DM2.8489. Futures traders also had one of their busiest days of the year. The September contract fell 24 basis points to 89.85, a level which certainly dismisses all possibility of a cut in base rates before the autumn, and probably takes into account a rise. Trading in the contract was extremely heavy, reaching a volume of 37,323 lots. This price assumes that three-month sterling cash rates will be at 10.15 per cent in mid-September. The market remains overwhelmed by fears that the Bundesbank will tighten monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday. In the cash market, dealers decided to take out the shortage quickly. One discount house dealer said: 'They simply did not want period rates to get any worse.' Another dealer said there was no incentive in the interbank market to offer cash at a discount. 'We are now so resigned to rates not moving down before September that there will be no prizes for being clever, even if the Bundesbank does not tighten on Thursday.' By the close of trading, the yield curve reflected rates of 10 1/8 per cent all the way out to one-year. Three-month money was up from a previous 10 1/32 per cent. The Bank's operations were at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2 and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreement (repo). In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 50m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 25m in Band 2 and Pounds 812m in a repo for resale on August 3. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1bn and in the afternoon the Bank purchased Pounds 113m of Band 1 bank bills.</p>

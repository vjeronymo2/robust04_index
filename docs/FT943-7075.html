			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Time to go, m' lords: Roland Rudd suggests the upper chamber of the UK Parliament is ripe for the bin Viscount Cranborne's appointment last month as leader of the House of Lords may represent a sense of continuity in the government's eyes - Robert Cranborne is a member of the Cecil family, which has held high office, off and on, since the reign of Elizabeth I. But it also underlined what is wrong with the second chamber of the UK Parliament: those given influence are determined largely by birth. No disrespect to Lord Cranborne, who may turn out to be a good leader of the upper house, but the right of British prime ministers to bring hereditary peers into cabinet is blatantly undemocratic and should be abolished. Imagine the outcry in the western world if the descendants of Lenin inherited the right to sit in a second chamber and were then appointed to government by President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. The only difference in the UK is the so-called pedigree of those who owe their power to their birth. Defenders of the status quo might argue that, by bestowing this right on aristocrats, Britain is able to pick ministers from families who have produced leaders for generations. But irrespective of whether the upper classes make better leaders - an assumption which is deeply spurious - there is the awkward fact that all aristocratic families started off as commoners and some as rogues. There are dukes who owe their right to sit in the Lords to their descent from mistresses of Charles II, and lords to the fact that their antecedents financed the British garrison in Ulster in the 17th century. There is a leitmotiv in all this: money buys class, and money is no guarantee of good leadership. This does not mean that the reverse is always true - that the Lords always makes the wrong decisions because more than half of its members are hereditary peers. Indeed, it has recently provided a valuable service in watering down government plans to weaken defendants' right to silence and blocking changes to the compensation system for criminal injuries. But the fact that it occasionally, and by accident, does the right thing, does not in itself justify the House of Lords' existence. The question then becomes how best to get rid of it? Tony Benn, the veteran leftwing MP, had an interesting wheeze in the early 1980s. A Labour government would appoint 1,000 new peers, with excellent proletarian credentials, who would vote themselves out of existence at the earliest opportunity. There was only one problem. How would the new Labour peers differ from the old ones who, once installed in the splendour of the upper house, have sought to defend it? The son of the first Viscount Stansgate was unable to produce a satisfactory answer. Mr Bruce Grocott, the Labour MP for the Wrekin who has influenced new Labour leader Mr Tony Blair's thinking on the upper chamber, believes he may have found a solution. The right of those who have inherited peerages to sit in the Lords would be abolished. But the institution would remain intact, at least during the first term of a Labour government. The attraction of Mr Grocott's idea is that more than 400 of the 1,203 members of the second chamber, who were appointed by politicians, would survive. So they would have no reason to try to block change and, together with some hereditary members, could vote through the reform. Furthermore, the first holders of a hereditary peerage would also still participate in the Lords' proceedings. This is a nice refinement to Labour's policy during the early 1980s of straightforward abolition. It would allow hereditary peers such as Viscount Whitelaw (former deputy prime minister) and Viscount Tonypandy (a former House of Commons speaker) to remain in place. It is not that the Labour party has a particular affinity with the first holders of hereditary peerages, but it fears anything more ambitious would be too controversial and would dominate the first year of a Labour administration. Such proposals, however, would leave a rump organisation that many Labour MPs acknowledge would still be undemocratic. Reform of the Lords has long been discussed but nobody has yet come up with workable proposals. It is not for nothing that it recently won the Graham Taylor Lifetime Achievement Award (named after the less-than-successful England football manager) from civil rights pressure group Charter 88 for the institution that has defied seemingly insuperable odds and survived. Surely the lesson is that there is no middle way. Outright abolition is the only option.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pulp and paper group logs a privatisation record - The Swedish public is to be offered a further 34% of AssiDoman over the next 12 days Sweden's right-centre government yesterday proclaimed a successful start to its biggest privatisation issue to date, announcing that an offer to Swedish and foreign institutions of a 15 per cent chunk of the forestry group AssiDoman had been three times subscribed. The government used the bids from institutions to set a price of SKr153 per share for AssiDoman, valuing the company at more than SKr16bn (Dollars 2bn). A further 34 per cent stake is to be sold to the Swedish public over the next 12 days at a discounted price of SKr138. In total the state should raise around SKr8bn from the sale of the 49 per cent of AssiDoman, by some margin the largest privatisation Prime Minister Carl Bildt's market-orientated coalition has pulled off since it came to power in late-1991. The previous biggest sale was the SKr2.2bn flotation last May of Celsius, the defence group. Before that, the state sold its stake in SSAB, the steel group. Next in line is the planned sell-off in June of the state's majority stake in Pharmacia, the pharmaceuticals group spun off last year from Procordia under a deal between the government and Volvo, which jointly controlled Procordia. That should raise about SKr16bn at today's market prices. The state's one-third stake in the petroleum retailer OK Petroleum is also to be sold by private placement. Mr Per Westerberg, the industry minister, says the government will have sold 35 companies by the time the general election comes around in September. 'If we succeed with AssiDoman and Pharmacia then we will have raised very close to SKr30bn over the three years. That is in line with our goal of an average of SKr10bn a year and we would be very satisfied with that.' Of the AssiDoman sale he said: 'We will have a strong new pulp and paper group in Sweden with the financial muscle to act in the market. A strictly commercial company that can look for partners - like Celsius and SSAB - without political interference.' The Swedish privatisation path has not all been smooth, however, and big question marks remain over potential issues still to come. The opposition Social Democratic party, which is leading in the opinion polls at present, is firmly opposed to diluting the state's share in companies such as the telecommunications company Telia and Vattenfall, the state power company, which are on the coalition's list for some degree of privatisation after the election. The Social Democrats, indeed, were opposed to the privatisation of AssiDoman. The company was formed at the turn of the year from the state-owned groups Assi and Doman and will soon also take over a third company, Ncb. This will make it Sweden's fourth largest forestry group, the country's biggest owner of forests and the biggest producer of sawn timber. Under the terms of the present sell-off, the state will remain a 51 per cent stake-holder in AssiDoman. But Mr Westerberg said this was likely eventually to slip below a majority holding. This has angered the Social Democrats who oppose the loss of state control over companies which they identify as being of vital interest in the control of infrastructure and natural resources. Mr Anders Sundstrom, the Social Democratic spokesman on industry, said yesterday his party would block any further dilution of the state's holding in AssiDoman if it gets back into power in September. Mr Westerberg also came under fire over the Celsius issue which was 17 times oversubscribed - leading to claims that the state 'lost' up to SKr2bn by under-pricing the shares. It was partly for that reason that he opted for the pre-bidding method to set a price for AssiDoman. He should not run into such problems with Pharmacia, which is already listed on the stock exchange and the privatisation of which is not opposed by the Social Democrats. Mr Sundstrom also supports the eventual re-sale to the private sector of Nordbanken, the biggest victim of the Swedish banking crisis which is not now expected to be ready for privatisation until 1995. But Mr Westerberg's intention in due course to put the two giants Vattenfall, Europe's sixth largest electricity producer, and Telia on the privatisation block will clearly depend on the outcome of the election. 'We don't want to privatise Telia, Vattenfall or the forests - not even a minority share,' said Mr Sundstrom.</p>

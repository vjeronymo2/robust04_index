			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 28, SPA -- The United Arab Emirates  (UAE) has reiterated its inalienable stand from the problem of  the three islands occupied by Iran.    In a statement published by London-based AL-WASAT magazine,  carried yesterday by the UAE's news agency, UAE's Minister of  state for foreign affairs Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan said his  country, along with the other GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council]  member states, would remain keen on establishing good relations  with Iran.    But it will never accept the policy of threats and  occupation, he said.    As the UAE will never give up even one span of its  territories, then the problem of the three islands will  constitute an obstacle before normalizing relations with Iran,  he said.    If the Iranians have the historical documents which prove  their ownership of the three islands, then they should present  them before the international justice court, he said and added  'we will accept the verdict issued by the international court'.    Al Nuhayyan pointed out that refusal of Iran to arbitration  would mean that it has no sovereignty on the three islands.    On the problem of Yemen, Al Nuhayyan said his country does  not support any of the conflicting parties in Yemen.    He noted that the UAE had mediated to settle the Yemeni  dispute before the break-out of the war between Sanaa and Aden.    We have shown our keenness on Yemeni unity, but we believe  that this unity should not come by means of force, he said  highlighting the assistance extended by the UAE to Yemen before  the announcement of the unity.    Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, the president of the  UAE, has made it clear to the Yemeni leaders that unity cannot  be imposed by force, he said.</p>

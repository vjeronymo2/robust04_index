			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mun Il-hyon from Beijing] </F>   [Text] China warned on 17 May that "North Korea would  likely take extreme action [kuktanjok haengdong] if Western  countries intend to isolate North Korea."    A Japanese Social Party delegate said that in a meeting with  a delegation led by Kubo Wataru, secretary general of Japanese  Social Party, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said on  17 May that "it is possible for North Korea to take a very  extreme method [kuktanjok pangbop]," and that "the Western  countries should fully consider such a situation."    Regarding the replacement of fuel rods at a five-megawatt  reactor, which has aroused strong protest from Western  countries, including the United States, Vice Foreign Minister  Tang said: "North Korea seems to show a hard-line attitude, but,  actually, there is room for the settlement of the nuclear  issue." Accordingly, he has strongly hinted that North Korea has  not yet carried out the work of replacing fuel rods at its  nuclear reactor.    The Japanese Social Party official said that Vice Foreign  Minister Tang said China is now actively making efforts for the  success of North Korean-U.S. talks.    This is the first time China has openly expressed that it  has  played a behind the scenes role in resolving the North Korean  nuclear issue.    Also, the Japanese Social Party official said Vice Foreign  Minister Tang expressed that while President Kim Il-song was in  China he said to Chinese leaders on many occasions that North  Korea has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, nor does  it have the funds or technology necessary, or the need to  produce them.    Regarding this, a Chinese high-level source said that  "considering the special relationship between China and North  Korea, breaking the promise made between the leaders of the two  countries would not be easy," and that "the Chinese leadership  believes that President Kim Il-song will keep his promise." He  has also clearly expressed that China adheres to a negative  position on North Korea's nuclear development.</p>

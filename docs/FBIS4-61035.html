			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Abdulakh Mikitayev, chairman of the Russian </F> President's Citizenship Commission, by Nikolay Musiyenko; date  and place not given: "Not a Great Migration but Dual  Citizenship. Every Soviet Person Could Receive a Russian  Passport"]    [Text] Let me introduce my interlocutor. Abdulakh  Mikitayev was born in 1942 in the village of Malka, in  Kabardino-Balkaria, 30 km from Pyatigorsk. After secondary  school he went to the Mendeleyev Chemical Technical Institute in  Moscow. As a postgraduate student he defended his candidate's  dissertation. Then, as a young "mature" academic, he went to  Nalchik to teach at the Kabardino-Balkaria University. He soon  became a senior lecturer and head of a department and took a  doctorate. He created a whole scientific school in the field of  polymer chemistry. On a voluntary basis he chaired the  Kabardino-Balkar Republic Committee for the Defense of Peace.  In the last Russian Supreme Soviet he was head of the science  subcommittee. In March 1992 he became chairman of the Russian  Federation President's Citizenship Commission.    [Musiyenko] Abdulakh Kasbulatovich, we are not going to look  now for those to blame for the disintegration of the USSR or  discuss whether that could have been prevented. Unfortunately,  the fact remains that the Soviet state no longer exists and tens  of millions of Russians and those who consider Russian their  native language suddenly found themselves in a foreign country,  albeit a "neighbor." Their fate in many former Union republics  is, to put it mildly, unenviable.    [Mikitayev] You are right, the disintegration of the Soviet  Union was a tragedy for many people, very many people. In  recognizing the newly independent states formed from the  republics of the former USSR, Russia proceeded from the premise  that their governments, in accordance with the norms of  international law, would fulfill their duty toward Soviet  citizens and not allow their ethnic, linguistic, religious, or  other rights to be infringed. Such principles are enshrined in a  number of international conventions as well as in treaties  between the Russian Federation and the states which have  achieved independence. But what happened was that real  sovereignty went to the heads of the ruling politicians there to  such an extent that they got carried away and embarked on a  course of driving the Russian language out of use in society and  offended the Russian-speaking population in every way possible.  That is true above all of the Baltic countries, but in some CIS  states, too, people hailing from Russia are now living in a  state of spiritual oppression.    You have noted, of course, that the Russian Federation as  the  successor in law to the USSR is trying to defend the rights of  former Soviet citizens and to that end is employing diplomatic  channels and the authority of various international  organizations. With some success. But unfortunately by no means  total success. Because even within the framework of the CIS  there is still no efficient mechanism for implementing treaties  and agreements signed by the heads of states. Nor are there any  mandatory sanctions which follow inevitably if accords are not  observed. I hope that these shortcomings will be eliminated in  due course.    [Musiyenko] Let us clarify whom precisely you are concerned  about. Those who have officially been given Russian citizenship  but are continuing to live in, for example, Uzbekistan? Or  those who are Russian by blood, irrespective of whether they  hold citizenship of the Russian Federation? Or citizens of the  former USSR of any nationality who have been refused citizenship  of the states on whose territory they are now living?    [Mikitayev] All three categories. The Russian Federation  Law "On Citizenship" allows Russian citizenship to be granted to  anyone who has retained a USSR citizen's passport regardless of  their place of residence. But of course, we pay greater  attention to emigrants from Russia and their offspring.    Russians have been living for centuries in many republics --  Kazakhstan, for instance -- and have long been part of the  indigenous population. In the past they occupied vacant lands  and did not force anyone out. Now, although N. Nazarbayev  denies that there are interethnic problems in Kazakhstan, what  we are seeing is an exodus of Russians from that republic to  Russia. I think the reason why is clear: Russian has lost the  status of an official language there and it is primarily Kazakhs  who are being appointed to leading posts even in oblasts where  Russian speakers predominate.    Admittedly, mutual understanding has emerged between Russia  and Kazakhstan on these problems recently, as is demonstrated by  the memorandum on the fundamental principles of resolving  questions connected with the citizenship and legal status of  Russian Federation citizens permanently resident on Republic of  Kazakhstan territory and of Republic of Kazakhstan citizens  permanently resident in Russia, signed by B. Yeltsin and N.  Nazarbayev.    [Musiyenko] There is a great deal of talk today about dual  citizenship, but many people clearly do not understand what it  is.    [Mikitayev] I also get the feeling that certain heads of  state have still not grasped the essence of this problem and do  not understand what moral advantages their states stand to gain  from the conclusion of dual-citizenship agreements with Russia.  Clearly they believe that such an agreement will infringe their  countries' sovereignty. Nothing of the kind. No one would  claim that France, for example, has ceased to be an independent  state because it has concluded a dual citizenship agreement with  Canada, a country with many French-speaking inhabitants.    I can also quote a positive example from the CIS. At the end  of December 1993 an agreement of this type was signed between  Russia and Turkmenistan. There have been no dire consequences.  We did not see hordes of Russians resident in Turkmenistan  hurrying off at the crack of dawn to get an earlier place in the  waiting line outside the Russian embassy. Why worry, if  everyone knows that if they need a second passport they can get  one at any time -- or in five years, or 10....    I would put it this way: The institution of dual citizenship  is a symbol of trust between two states, evidence that they want  to live with one another in peace and good-neighborliness,  without harboring grudges.    Incidentally, dual citizenship has long been a reality  regardless of whether Russia has signed a corresponding  agreement with another state. Russian legislation does not  require that you relinquish citizenship of your country of  residence on receipt of citizenship of the Russian Federation.  We did that deliberately in the interests of our fellow  countrymen. Furthermore, the laws of some CIS states grant  their fellow countrymen the same opportunity (Turkmenistan,  Kazakhstan).    [Musiyenko] Is it difficult for someone living in, say,  Ukraine, to take out Russian citizenship?    [Mikitayev] Legally and technically there are no problems  here. The problem is that Ukraine does not yet have a network  of Russian Federation consular establishments. This means that  in order to take out a Russian passport you have to go all the  way to Kiev. And that takes time and money. However, in the  next few months Russia plans to open several consulates on  Ukrainian territory, including one in Simferopol.    [Musiyenko] What advice would you give to those who have  nevertheless made the difficult decision to leave their old  haunts and start a new life back in the motherland -- in Russia?    [Mikitayev] If you have no family, housing, or work there,  the best thing to do first is to apply to the Russian Federation  embassy or consulate, where there are bound to be  representatives of the federal migration service. They will  help you choose your future place of residence, obtain a loan,  and process all the documents. But what often happens is that  people gather up their possessions, buy tickets, and head for  Moscow, where they have no accommodation to go to and instead  camp out in front of various official institutions....    [Musiyenko] I am aware that a concept of Russian Federation  state policy with regard to fellow countrymen living abroad was  formulated recently.    [Mikitayev] Yes, our commission participated directly in  its preparation. It covers the most diverse aspects -- from  efforts aimed at restoring citizen status to the  "non-indigenous" inhabitants of Latvia and Estonia and the  enshrinement of the institution of dual citizenship in law to  the preservation of a single information area on the territory  of the former USSR and of the Russian language as the means of  communication among the different nationalities. Based on  international law and the wealth of world practice we are also  going to help Russian communities and other associations of  ethnic Russians in the neighboring foreign countries and give  those who have decided to migrate to Russia help in settling  down here.    [Musiyenko] Will this concept not remain on paper alone?    [Mikitayev] I do not think so. In any event, our  commission, with the president's support (it was he who,  concerned for the fate of our fellow countrymen, instructed the  commission in the fall of 1993 to submit proposals on the  protection of their rights and interests), will constantly  monitor the work of the government, the federal migration  service, and other state organs charged with putting this  concept into practice. The program for the protection of the  ethnic Russians in the neighboring foreign countries is already  near to completion at government level, and a financial basis is  being prepared for it.    [Musiyenko] Is this not going to be another pretext for  people to accuse Russia of harboring imperial designs?    [Mikitayev] Let those who express that opinion have it on  their conscience. We are acting in the interests of our country  and of the newly independent states equally. Russia does not  need another "great migration of the peoples" -- it is simply in  no position to provide tens of millions of refugees and migrants  with everything that they need. But the republics of the former  Union do not need a mass exodus of top-class specialists and  manpower either: That will inevitably cause them tremendous  economic harm and will prove to be a time-bomb placed under  those states. But all this can be avoided; all it needs is for  discrimination against ethnic Russians [russkiye] and Russian  speakers to be ended and for their civil rights to be recognized  in full. Russia, in turn, recognizes the right of other states  to take care of their fellow countrymen living in the Russian  Federation.    In the long term however, I am confident that we will surely  arrive at a new union of the European type -- with single  citizenship and complete freedom of movement, both for the  workforce and for goods. This will happen not in 50 years time  but much sooner, because we have not yet forgotten the  experience of mutual relations among the peoples in the economy,  culture, and everyday life. The first signs of the approaching  integration are already in evidence....</p>

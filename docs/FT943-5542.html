			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Wall Street's whizkids seek solace in poetry: Bronwen Maddox on why the high rollers of the 1980s are going back to college for 'creative' studies From Wall Street to Walt Whitman: the high rollers of the 1980s financial boom are now beating a path back to college to sign up for courses in poetry and literature. Columbia University in New York City, opening its doors for the start of the autumn term, has found that many of its new intake of postgraduates are fleeing the worlds of commerce, law and finance. According to Mr Grafton Nunes, associate dean of Columbia's School of Arts, which runs courses on creative writing, visual arts and film, many of those stepping aside from lucrative careers have concluded that 'my soul is dying  -I'm good at this but I am not fulfilled'. Then, he says, 'they ask themselves: 'dare I dream to do something different?'' Columbia, like many of the most prestigious US universities, has seen interest in postgraduate courses such as arts, politics and history rise steadily since the second half of the 1980s. Applications to its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, which encompasses art history, history, literature and political science, were only 3,400 in 1986, the year before the Wall Street crash, but reached 4,300 in 1990, and 6,200 in 1994. This year, Columbia has received 10 applications for every postgraduate place in painting and sculpture, even though it had not formally advertised the course. For the first time in years it has filled the 15 places for poetry writing. Some of the demand comes from undergraduates, many of whom are prolonging academic life through postgraduate study rather than enter the fierce competition for jobs outside. But recession has also given those in established careers ranging from stockbroking to psychiatry a new reason to go back to school, faculty members say. Ms Suzanne Fox, administrator of the creative writing course, and a former Wall Street high flyer, says that 'the glory days of the mid-1980s have gone. People now feel that there is no practical use to climbing the corporate ladder'. Faculty members talk of a 'glut of lawyers' on the job market. Lowered expectations of salaries and promotion mean that people are more prepared to make the financial sacrifice of returning to academia, Ms Fox says, although the decision is hardly made lightly, as completing a postgraduate course can cost some Dollars 35,000 (Pounds 22,650). Part of the rise in applications, admissions officers suggest, is that the current generation of parents, who themselves were at college in the 1960s, are willing to help pay for arts courses, where parents a decade ago would have steered their offspring towards law or medicine. 'Being a doctor does not have the same aura it used to have,' says Mr Nunes. But what happens when these graduates leave? According to Ms Fox, many should consider returning to their previous professions. 'Wise people are not looking for vocational change,' she says. 'They understand there are no day jobs for painters or literary writers.' A few may succeed in staying in academia: Mr David Damrosch, Columbia's director of graduate studies of English literature, suggests that graduates have their eyes on an improvement in the academic job market in the late 1990s, when a wave of retirements is expected. For writers and theatre producers, however, the booming studios of Hollywood offer the chance to cash in their new learning for considerable material rewards. According to Mr Nunes, himself a former film producer: 'Television has become such an important part of our communication that there has been an explosion of those jobs.' Technology is now capable of delivering hundreds of television channels to each house, and the US media industry, currently convulsed in multi-billion dollar takeover bids, is scrambling for more programmes to show. Would-be poets may find that lessons learned on Wall Street have not, then, been entirely wasted.</p>

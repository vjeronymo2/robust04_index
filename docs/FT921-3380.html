			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Headline news - Directors' Transactions THIS WEEK'S table contains information on deals done in the previous fortnight, after space constraints squeezed out the table last Saturday. Headline Book Publishing came to the market just under a year ago and the shares have comfortably outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index since. The maiden final results, announced in mid-February, were better than market expectations, but the sales by the chairman and finance director follow a large sale by the managing director. Between September 1990 and February 1991, a large number of purchases were made by directors of Fairway (London), a specialist stationer, at prices between 45p and 49p. Recent final results revealed another increase in profits and earnings and board member Richard Seamer has sold a total of 200,000 shares at between 62p and 65p. He still retains more than 1.5m. Gold Greenlees Trott, the advertising agency, has become one of the classic examples of how well directors time their dealing. Gold and Greenlees, the joint chairmen, sold about 700,000 shares back in February 1989 when the price stood at around 285p. From there, the advertising industry slid into recession and the shares fell steeply. They returned to the market in December 1990 and January 1991, buying 233,000 shares between then at prices between 63p and 70p. A little over a year later, Michael Gold is taking some profit, selling 100,000 shares at 223p. A non-executive colleague, Robert Bayley, also took the opportunity to sell, reducing his holding by 30,000 at the same price.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                No of Company                Sector       Shares       Value       directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Applied Hologr'cs        Misc        8,000          10           1 Argyll Group             FdRe       46,215         145           1* Bass                     Brew       76,367         425           2* Boots                    Stor      148,500         703           5* Courtalds                Chem       40,000         215           1* Courts (Furnishers)      Stor        5,000          16           1 Dalgety                  FdMa        3,500          14           1 Fairway (London)         Misc      200,000         127           2 Fleming Ent IT           InTr       10,892          15           1 Fleming Fledg IT         InTr        6,976          17           1 Gold Greenlees Trt        Med      130,000         290           2 Greenalls                Brew       18,241          69           2 Headline Book Publ        Med      248,540         430           2 Heath (Samuel)           Misc      105,000          87           1 Low &amp; Bonar              Pack        5,000          13           1 Lowe (Robert H)          Text      250,000          25           1 Macro 4                  Elns       70,000         305           1 Marks &amp; Spencer          Stor      165,811         528           2* Mercury Asset Mgmt       OthF      205,000         712           3* Sainsbury (J)            FdRe        3,000          12           1 Securicor 'A' Ord        Tele       57,500         346           2 Securicor 'A'Non Vt      Tele       50,000         303           1 Shiloh                   Text       12,000          14           1 Syltone                   Eng       40,000          99           1 Vodafone                 Tele       40,500         147           1* Watmoughs nil paid        Med      192,853          96           5 Whitbread                Brew      220,400         996           1* Wolv &amp; Dud Brew          Brew        5,000          28           2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aberforth Split          InTr       52,000         118           1 API Group                Pack       20,000          29           1 Burton Group             Stor      150,000          57           3 Electric &amp; Gen IT        InTr       50,000          62           1 Life Sciences Int        Hlth       25,000          43           1 Merchant Retail Grp      FdRe       50,000          10           1 Park Food                FdRe       50,000          57           1 United Energy             O&amp;G       30,000          10           1 Wheway                    Eng      200,000          39           2 Wickes                   BdMa       30,000          21           1 Williams Holdings        OthI      110,000         343           3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

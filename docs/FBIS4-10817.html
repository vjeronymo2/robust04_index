			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Under the Shade of Suspicion"] </F>   [Text] When he was informed about what was happening in  Rome regarding his wife, Cesar ignored the rumors and did what  the law allowed him to: He publicly repudiated her under the  allegation that "Cesar's wife" could not even appear as a  suspect in conjugal infidelity. No evidence was required: Mere  suspicion called for a public justification.    The episode about Cesar repudiating his wife, which remains  an example, is always recalled whenever the border between the  law and ethics seems undefined. In the case of Governor Nilo  Batista, however, the fact that his name appeared on the numbers  game list does not embarrass him. He insists on not feeling  morally prevented from commanding the investigation that seeks  to dismantle the illegal game network in Rio de Janeiro. And,  crowning his attitude, he confirms that he will not leave his  position.    Society expected the governor to consider himself a suspect  after Castor de Andrade's list was released. The law does  contemplate this sort of situation, but one's morals should not  compromise matters of principles. Government authorities must  set the example recommended by ethics even if the law does not  call for it.    All subterfuges converge in the same direction: those  involved feel uncomfortable in the company of celebrated numbers  game kingpins and deny the fact, just for the sake of denying  it, because they count on the law's formalities that make it  difficult to identify and punish organized crime, particularly  crime hidden behind the facade of simple infractions. Drug  trafficking; arms smuggling; holdups of banks, armored vehicles,  and homes; kidnappings; and moving large amounts of money are  behind the numbers game facade.    Society has been surprised only at how few names are  included  on the numbers lottery kingpins' list. It was common knowledge  that most of the other names on the list had links with the  illegal game. Society was aware of everything, including that  several members of the Military Police and the civil police had  associations with organized crime. All that was missing was the  link between the different criminal activities.    The mafia organization's unity was destroyed as a result of  charges pressed by the accountant for the numbers game's highest  capo. The situation was inverted: The district attorney acted in  an explosive manner and, in a surprise operation, seized  material that involves many of those who made common cause with  organized crime. The investigation has started and foretells a  lot more ammunition.    The crime universe that controls Rio de Janeiro's life,  under  the protection of some policemen and the involvement of some  politicians, has begun to crumble. It makes no difference  whether the numbers game donations were made to candidates:  Those who have been elected also have been contaminated. Money  allegedly from numbers game bets is also the money from  kidnappings, drug trafficking, and bank holdups. It is morally  unacceptable, although the evidence found so far still does not  comply with the formal inflexibility of the laws from the legal  point of view.    The Federal Police's own involvement shows the ramifications  of organized crime in Brazilian life. Wherever the numbers game  operates -- it functions countrywide -- politicians accept  bribes because the electoral law does not force them to report  where these donations come from. Despite all that, those who  accept dirty money cannot claim they did it in goodwill. The  first step into illegality is to accept money for which no  receipt can be issued. It is not a donation, it is tax evasion,  and it is therefore a crime. Public people cannot commit tax  evasion crimes. The amount of money, the extent of crime that  is destroying Rio de Janeiro inside, the widespread sense of  insecurity, and corruption -- which involves even the civil  police, the Military Police, the Legislative Assembly, and  national Congress representatives -- cannot be fought with  rhetorical antidotes. To say that what has been revealed is  staging a political coup is to disrespect public opinion and the  people's right to information and to judge those involved in  these crimes.    Society wants action and not subterfuges. Society wants real  guarantees and not fictitious ones. Something will have to be  done in addition to investigating names and the amounts  received. The citizens want an initiative to dismantle organized  crime in Rio de Janeiro and are waiting for a sign from above.  If the order is not given by the local administration, let  Brasilia order action against crime and against all of its  central commands, not only against the sources that supply the  money. Crime is being morally condemned but no firm measure has  been adopted to end crime, disarm the criminal groups, and  dismantle the organizations in charge of holdups and kidnappings.    It is not important to know the name of the legal operation  for which Rio de Janeiro has been waiting. It is not important  to know where the order to fight crime comes from. The people  expect that the authorities detect the signs of general  insecurity and translate them into direct action against crime.  The people will see in a good light any initiative President  Itamar Franco might adopt to eliminate organized crime in a  state that does not deserve to suffer what it has been suffering.</p>

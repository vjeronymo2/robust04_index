			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak in Dollars 68m deficit EASTMAN Kodak, which yesterday named Mr George Fisher, chief executive of Motorola, as its new chairman, also reported a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 68m and warned that it was no longer expecting record earnings in 1994. The third-quarter loss, which worked through at 21 cents a share, came after Dollars 387m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, of after-tax restructuring charges to cover its previously announced plan to cut employment worldwide by 10,000 and the costs of closing a West German plant making components for its ink jet printer business. Net earnings in the third quarter of 1992 were Dollars 189m, or 58 cents a share, after a restructuring charge of Dollars 141m, or 43 cents a share. Sales from continuing operations were Dollars 4.08bn, down 4 per cent. The company's Eastman Chemicals business, which is being spun off, is treated as a discontinued business and reported net earnings of Dollars 60m, down from Dollars 68m. In a separate announcement, later in the day, the company also named Mr Fisher as the replacement for Mr Kay Whitmore, the chairman since 1990, who was forced to step down in August because of Kodak's inability to produce strong earnings growth, despite endless restructurings and special charges over the past decade. Mr Whitmore, who has stayed on as caretaker chairman, said yesterday that the company looked for 'essentially level earnings from operations' for 1993 as a whole, and he blamed this on economic weakness in each of our major world markets and the continuing negative impact of currency fluctuations. He also announced that the company was no longer predicting record earnings for 1994 and would offer no earnings guide for the period. For the third quarter, Mr Whitmore said productivity gains in parts of Kodak's imaging division and cost controls had helped produce earnings gains at the operating level, despite lower revenues in both the imaging and information segments. There had been a significant improvement in cash flow, due to improved management of receivables and inventories and reduced capital spending. The company was well on its way to its target of generating Dollars 700m in cash flow for the year. The imaging business reported earnings of Dollars 202m, down 35 per cent, on sales which dipped 5 per cent to Dollars 1.88. Excluding restructuring charges, earnings from operations were up 2 per cent at Dollars 404m. The information business posted a loss of Dollars 250m, up from Dollars 113m, while sales dipped 8 per cent to Dollars 904m. Excluding restructuring charges, earnings were Dollars 28m, up from Dollars 10m. For the nine months, Kodak made Dollars 839m, or Dollars 2.56 a share, compared to Dollars 836m, or Dollars 2.57 a share, in 1992, excluding restructuring charges.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Brussels demand on Baltic shipyard aid THE EUROPEAN Commission has asked the German government to come up with an urgent restructuring plan for the ailing east German shipbuilding industry, as a condition for lifting the EC's ceiling on state aid to the shipyards. Government grants to Community shipbuilders are covered by special legislation that outlaws production aid worth more than 9 per cent of contract value. An independent consultants' report for the Commission has warned that even if they are granted aid at last year's EC maximum of 13 per cent, the yards of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on the Baltic coast will not survive. Officials would not reveal what proportion of aid the consultants had recommended, except to say that 13 per cent was 'far from sufficient'. The east German yards have been beset by strikes for the last week, even though the Treuhand privatisation agency has come up with a plan which would keep the core of the industry intact, as demanded by the workers. As the crisis in the Baltic shipyards grows, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, has written to Bonn warning the German authorities that any attempt to grant aid to the east German shipbuilding industry will require EC permission. But the Commission is prepared to recommend a temporary raising of the ceiling for the shipyards, probably until the end of 1993, provided Bonn produces a 'realistic restructuring plan designed to ensure that these yards achieve the same level of competitiveness as the rest of the Community within an agreed period of time'. The final decision on raising the ceiling will lie with EC governments.</p>

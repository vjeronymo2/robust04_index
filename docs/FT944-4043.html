			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Ulster talks face arms hurdle: Debate on IRA guns dominates historic Sinn Fein meeting with government The decommissioning of the IRA's huge stockpile of weapons emerged yesterday as the crucial issue that has to be resolved to keep the Northern Ireland peace process on track. Although historic exploratory talks between the UK government and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, were seen as constructive, sharp differences emerged over the timing of the disposal of IRA arms and explosives. After the first public talks between UK officials and Sinn Fein in 25 years of troubles, the two sides appeared on a collision course. The government insisted that the decommissioning of the IRA's arsenal would be a condition to Sinn Fein being allowed to enter all-party talks on the future of Ulster. Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland political affairs minister, said after a briefing by Mr Quentin Thomas, head of the UK's five-man delegation, that 'their continued retention will constitute a barrier to other political parties, as well as to the government itself, in joining with Sinn Fein in substantive political negotiations'. The minister warned that if the talks are 'to be taken to a successful conclusion, then the question of the decommissioning of arms must be resolved to satisfaction'. Nevertheless, he called the meeting 'constructive and business-like' while Mr Martin McGuinness, leading the five-strong Sinn Fein delegation, said it was 'a good beginning'. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, however, warned the government that it should not place conditions on the talks process. 'History will judge the British badly if they make excuses for not moving the peace process forward,' he said. The exploratory meeting at the former Northern Ireland parliament building at Stormont Castle in Belfast came exactly 100 days after the announcement of the IRA ceasefire. Condemned by hardline unionists, the meeting is viewed as an important part of wider negotiations started by the British and Irish governments, which aim to bring all the political parties in Ulster into discussions to craft a constitutional framework for the province. Mr John Major, who received a report on the meeting at the European Union summit in Essen, told other EU leaders that contacts with the republicans were designed to turn a 'ceasefire into a lasting peace'. He underlined that London and Dublin were close to a framework agreement to provide the basis for round-table talks on a new political settlement. Mr Ancram said yesterday's discussion had raised a 'very large areas of subjects'. Both sides had 'a good trot around the course', he said. Mr McGuinness, said the talks 'should have happened a long time ago'. The two sides agreed to meet again on December 19. Meanwhile, the Ulster Democratic party, one of the loyalist groups invited to talks next week with UK officials, warned it was reconsidering the invitation because of the presence at the Stormont meeting of a councillor from the Irish Republic. Sinn Fein delegates, who included the Old Bailey bomber Mr Gerry Kelly, called for an end to British military operations and a speedy release of all political prisoners. Sinn Fein said these issues should be addressed as a matter of urgency. Sinn Fein comes in from the cold, Page 6 New tune for Irish reel, Page 9</p>

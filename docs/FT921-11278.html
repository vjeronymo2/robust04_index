			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A SQUEEZE in stock index futures continued for most of yesterday, sending the March contract advancing to a strong premium, writes Joel Kibazo. Buyers for March were seen from the outset from both independent traders and large securities houses, sending the contract to a premium of 42 by lunchtime and pulling up the underlying cash market. That advance proved unsustainable and sellers were seen as dealers took profits and awaited Wall Street's opening. News that TWA had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected sentiment further, though dealers reported healthy after-hours buying. March closed at 2,604, a 33-point premium and some 17 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 16. Volume, at over 7,000 contracts, was better than the last few sessions. In traded options, where dealers dealt on the options floor for the last time, turnover reached 31,942. The FT-SE 100 index option, which expired yesterday, traded 11,610 contracts. The Euro FT-SE option was also busy, with 6,009 lots dealt. Rolls-Royce, which was hit by sentiment regarding TWA, was the busiest stock option with 1,722 lots traded and the March 140 calls busy.</p>

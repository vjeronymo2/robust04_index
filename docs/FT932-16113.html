			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Provisions of Pounds 7.9m leave Wilkes with Pounds 6.4m loss EXCEPTIONAL and extraordinary provisions at James Wilkes finally totalled Pounds 7.9m for 1992 and pushed the group into a net attributable loss of Pounds 6.41m, compared to a profit of Pounds 950,000 in 1991. Mr Arthur Watt, chairman, said the year was turbulent and marked by the successful defence against the bid from Petrocon, significant alterations to group structure, and board changes. He believed that group was now well focused and in good shape to take full advantage of an upturn in trading conditions. 'We have an impressive portfolio of specialist engineering businesses and a group which is structured for growth', he added. With 50 per cent of current turnover exported, the recent depreciation of sterling should result in increased turnover and improved margins, particularly at Floform and at Stubs. Central overheads were running at some Pounds 2m per year lower than a year ago. To illustrate the new structure, pro forma figures for the ongoing businesses showed turnover of Pounds 41.3m producing a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.17m, with earnings per share at 7.8p. Mr Watt also announced that Mr Doug Rogers, chairman of Newman Tonks and of Savage, had agreed to become chairman of Wilkes from April 16. That fulfils the undertaking given that the roles of chairman and chief executive would be separated. Mr Philip Gothard, company secretary, will join the board as finance director. As a reflection of the assessment of prospects for continuing operations and the wish to reduce borrowings further, the dividend is cut from 10p to 3.5p. The proposed final is reduced from 5.25p to 0.25p. Losses per share were 7.2p (earnings of 4.6p). Turnover came to Pounds 49m (Pounds 54.3m) and operating profit to Pounds 4.28m (Pounds 7.97m). There was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.58m (profit Pounds 1.89m) after exceptionals of Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 2.76m). Main constituents of the exceptionals were compensation for loss of office Pounds 1.08m, reorganisation, set-up and aborted acquisition costs Pounds 751,000, and bad debts and related stock write off Pounds 464,000. The extraordinaries, taken below the line, were Pounds 5.23m and comprised surplus on sale of promotional products division Pounds 4.75m, write back of goodwill Pounds 7.6m, loss on disposal of aviation division Pounds 728,000, write back of goodwill Pounds 163,000, and bid defence costs Pounds 1.47m.</p>

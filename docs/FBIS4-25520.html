			<p>BFN     [Text] From January to May this year, the province  exported goods worth $770 million or so in its trade with  foreign countries, an increase of 41 percent over the same  period last year.    The export sector witnessed a relatively big increase in  efficiency. Since the beginning of this year, the sector has  been confronted with serious difficulties, such as funding  shortages, high domestic prices, and a drop in overseas prices,  which hampered foreign exchange earnings from exports and  improved efficiency. To implement the plan for the entire year  to earn foreign exchange through exports and achieve better  efficiency, leaders of the provincial party committee and  government have repeatedly handled business on the spot in  foreign trade companies to solve practical problems. The  provincial economic relations and trade commission has also  repeatedly held special meeting to analyze economic activities  and to strive for unity in thinking and solutions to improving  economic efficiency, gave specific guidance to companies  according to their own concrete conditions, encouraged  enterprises with relatively good efficiency in exporting goods  to expand their scale and strive for better efficiency, guided  companies which had problems with exports and efficiency to make  more effort to improve efficiency, and helped solve practical  problems to boost enthusiasm for earning more foreign exchange  by exporting more goods and striving for better efficiency.  Nevertheless, the development of the province's foreign trade  is not balanced. Provincial-level companies have strengthened  management and have persisted in not engaging in loss-making  deals, thus gaining better economic efficiency, however,  prefecture and city-level companies, with the exception of those  in Changsha City, all suffered losses in operations. In  particular, the 29 industrial export enterprises, which have  been approved by the state over the last two years, and four  prefecture and county-level companies had yet to export goods to  earn foreign exchange by the end of May.</p>

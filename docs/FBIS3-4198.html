The  Yunnan NPC deputies mainly discussed issues like grasping  opportunities; deepening reform; and promoting faster economic  growth in the border and ethnic minority areas.    Pu Chaozhu, secretary of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee  and a Yunnan NPC deputy, was interviewed by this reporter in the  Yunnan Delegation's Beijing residence yesterday. Pu Chaozhu  said: I feel deeply that Premier Li Peng's work report has  comprehensively embodied the spirit of the 14th CPC National  Congress, as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee. At present we are undergoing a  strategic transformation, from a planned economy structure into  a socialist market economy structure. In this process, we  should implement unswervingly and to the letter a series of  reform measures promulgated by the central authorities and  should actively carry out all sorts of work in light of Yunnan's  actual conditions.    Pu Chaozhu noted: Yunnan still implements a unitary  ownership system, as well as a unitary industrial structure,  which inevitably have impaired the development of the productive  forces. In Yunnan's gross national product, the publicly owned  economy accounts for 89 percent, and the private and individual  economy, 11 percent. The facts have borne out that the more  economically and culturally backward a region is, the more  unitary is the region's system of ownership. Therefore, Yunnan  should take the road of keeping the public ownership system in  the dominant position, while at the same time vigorously  developing divergent economic factors. In this process, we  should make unreserved efforts to emancipate our minds and  disentangle ourselves from ideological debates aimed at  distinguishing socialism from capitalism. As long as we proceed  in this orientation, we certainly will be able to develop the  productive forces more expeditiously in a remote and  ethnic-minority province like Yunnan.    Speaking of industrial readjustment, Pu Chaozhu stressed:  Since 1984, Yunnan has made unceasing efforts to push ahead  with industrial structural readjustment. After eight to nine  years of hard work, we finally have succeeded in building a  batch of superior local industries -- including tobacco, sugar,  tea, and other industries -- the development of which has helped  to raise the province's financial revenue from 1.1 billion yuan  in 1983 to 20 billion yuan in 1993. At present, we are  undergoing another round of drastic industrial structural  shakeup. In view of this situation -- in addition to  successfully building infrastructure facilities and developing  educational, scientific, and technological undertakings -- we  should focus on building in some selected areas a batch of  backbone industries capable of generating 10 billion yuan or 5  billion yuan in output each, thereby turning Yunnan's unitary  industrial structure into a strong collective industrial  structure. In view of the province's conditions and resources,  as well as its domestic and overseas market demands, we should  continue to develop Yunnan's superior tobacco industry, and to  devote greater energy to the machinery and electronics, sugar,  nonferrous and precious metal smelting and processing, chemical,  iron and steel, building and building materials, forestry, and  food and soft drinks industries, as well as tourism, in addition  to the development of other industries.    In conclusion, Pu Chaozhu stressed: In order to accelerate  Yunnan's economic growth, we should press ahead energetically  with the reform of large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises; gradually implement and develop a joint-stock  system; vigorously develop town and township enterprises; bring  about a fundamental revolution in modes of production and  operation; and strive to push Yunnan's economic growth onto a  new stage over the next seven to 10 years.</p>

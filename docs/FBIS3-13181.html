Iraqi Kurdish sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that  Sa'di Ahmad Birah, the agriculture minister in the Kurdish  Government, replaced Humanitarian Affairs "Minister" Muhammad  Tawfiq Rahim, who left the government; that the agriculture  "ministry" portfolio was given to PUK Executive Committee Member  Hazim Yusufi; and that Jamal 'Abdul, former governor of  al-Sulaymaniyah, replaced Shirku Biks, the former "minister" and  well-known poet who resigned in December last year, as culture  "minister." [passage omitted]    PUK sources have confirmed the cabinet reshuffle but denied  that it had any political significance.

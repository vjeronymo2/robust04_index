The two sides are  discussing the present political and security situation in the  wake of last night's NATO ultimatum to Serbs in the republic of  Srpska and the agreement which Slobodan Milosevic, president of  the Republic of Serbia, and Radovan Karadzic, president of the  republic of Srpska, reached with Yasushi Akashi, the UN  secretary general's special envoy, in Belgrade last night. The  Russian parliamentarians arrived in Pale with specific proposals  involving various aspects of economic and cultural cooperation  between the Russian Federation and the republic of Srpska.</p>

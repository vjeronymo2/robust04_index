			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Foreign  Affairs released a statement on 4 April regarding the UN  Security Council's [UNSC] announcement of the president's  statement making irrational demands on us.    Noting that the UNSC published its presidential statement on  March 31 making irrational demands and urging us to allow  additional unjust inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA], the statement pointed out:    The nature of our nuclear issue is not one to be referred to  the UNSC for discussions. We have already allowed enough  inspections of our nuclear facilities to guarantee the  continuity of safeguards, as we agreed with the United States  and the IAEA. There is no room for any doubt here.    Even if there had been some differences in opinion in the  course of the inspection, they should be settled between the  agency and the inspected country -- the actual parties concerned  with the inspection.    Nevertheless, the UNSC discussed our issue based on the IAEA  Board of Governors unjust and biased conclusion that the scope  of the noncompliance with the safeguards accord has been  broadened. It is clearly contrary to the purpose and principle  of the UN Charter.    If the UNSC truly wants to fulfill its mission, it should  raise an issue with the United States, which is posing grave  threats to peace and security on the Korean peninsula with a  huge amount of nuclear weapons while creating obstacles to the  solution of the nuclear problem, and the South Korean  authorities, the perpetrator of the United States.    The UNSC intentionally ignored the nature of our nuclear  issue and raised an issue regarding the implementation of the  safeguards accord in the president's statement and sided with  the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK.    Before demanding additional inspections of us, the UNSC must  first take steps to correct the unjust action by the IAEA  Secretariat, which has expanded its unjust treatment while  currying favor with the big country.    The IAEA Secretariat must apologize for further widening the  area of unfair treatment while openly joining the U.S.  anti-republic maneuver. Far from apologizing, the IAEA  Secretariat has gradually expanded the unfair treatment. We  will repay this without fail.    Under the present situation in which the United States is  onesidedly clinging to pressure after overturning all promises  made to us, we have no choice but to normalize peaceful nuclear  activities, which we had unilaterally frozen for the DPRK-U.S.  talks.    The United States and the South Korean authorities are  attempting to escalate their commotion of pressure on us with  the presidential statement of the UN Security Council. However,  this cannot fool us.    The more the United States and its follower forces scheme to  crush the socialist system of our own style, the firmer the  single- hearted united might of our party, the people, and the  People's Army will be.    Responding to force with force and to dialogue with dialogue  is our firm and invariable will and policy. The U.S. hostile  policy of crushing Korea will not escape ruin.    Our position to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully is  consistent.</p>

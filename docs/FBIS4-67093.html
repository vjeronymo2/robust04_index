			<p>BFN     [Text] The House committee which oversees MPs' conduct  yesterday pledged a full inquiry into Chat Thai MP Thanong  Siriprichaphong, accused by a US court of smuggling huge amounts  of marijuana into the United States over a period of years.    Meanwhile, the opposition yesterday conspicuously deferred a  decision on a plan to censure the government. It was not  immediately clear if the opposition bloc was-buying time to  ponder the possible backlash from the Thanong case.    Charoen Khanthawong (Dem-Bangkok), chairman of the House  committee, said the committee would formally open an  investigation into the matter next Tuesday.    "This will seriously affect the (credibility of) Parliament.  We must uphold the honor of Parliament by getting to the bottom  of the matter and explain it to the public," Charoen said.    "In my opinion, Thanong should resign and the party to which  he belongs must also take responsibility."    The committee chairman said the most severe measure which  could be taken against Thanong would be for MPs to sign a motion  seeking his ouster from the House of Representatives.    "But I don't think we will have to resort to such a harsh  measure," he said.    Chat Thai secretary-general Banhan Sinlapa-acha yesterday  said that no Thai law enforcement officials had confirmed, or  denied, the allegation that Thanong had been involved in  trafficking drugs to the US.    "The man himself denied he had anything to do with it,"  Banhan said.    "The party has yet to see if there is any hard evidence to  substantiate the charge against Thanong. The way I see it, this  is a personal affair. The party could not have known about it."    However, Banhan said, he had asked Thanong to explain at a  press conference, probably sometime today.    He did not think the timing of the disclosure was aimed at  hurting Chat Thai's reputation.    "This case could not hurt the party's credibility. We have  yet to see the facts," he said.    Banhan would not say when the opposition intended to submit  a  no- confidence motion against the Chuan administration or which  Cabinet members would be targeted in the censure. The  opposition had been expected to make a decision yesterday.    Piyanat Watcharaphon, a former Social Action MP, said the  Chuan government had apparently neglected to take legal action  against Thanong though it had been aware of the US charges  against him for more than a year.    "The question is why it was revealed just now, when the  alleged wrongdoing happened a long time ago," said Piyanat, who  lost his seat when he was sacked from the party.    He believed Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and other coalition  leaders must have been aware of the matter but had failed to act  on it.    Sources said a group of Democrat MPs plan to submit a motion  seeking an official inquiry into the cases of Thanong and other  MPs who have been accused of involvement in international drug  trafficking.    Opposition leaders did not mention their much-heralded plan  to censure the government when they emerged from a meeting at  the Princess Hotel yesterday. On Tuesday they had promised a  decision would be made at the meeting.    At a press conference after the meeting, opposition leaders  instead criticized the government on such issues as terrorism in  the South and the controversial Pak Mun Dam. They also denied  allegations that some opposition leaders masterminded the  southern violence in an attempt to destabilize the government.</p>

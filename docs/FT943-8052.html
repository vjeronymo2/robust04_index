			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Inefficiency for all to see Sir, I note that the Post Office is planning to show full programmes to queueing customers ('Post Office queues to get piped TV shows', August 16). A queue is the classical method used by an inefficient monopoly to ration supply. Any other business would see a liability rather than a marketing asset. This is evidence to support depriving the Post Office of its monopolies, with or without privatisation. Richard Simmons, lower ground floor, 7 Palace Court, London W2 4LP</p>

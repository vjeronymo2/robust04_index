			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (10): Healthy advance by equities - Economic uncertainty is worrying European investors THE TOKYO stock market has put in an impressive performance this year. The Nikkei index has risen from 16,994 at the start of the year to around the 20,000 level now, although this is still far short of its record 38,915.87 seen on the last trading day of 1989. Tokyo has also risen by almost 25 per cent in local currency terms in the FT-Actuaries index since the beginning of the year, compared with little more than a 14 per cent rise in the World Index. For the foreign investor, however, the advance has been even more spectacular at more than 47 per cent in sterling terms and almost 50 per cent in dollar terms as a result of the strength of the yen, a performance bettered only by Finland and Spain. However, the consensus is that the yen's strength will not continue unchecked. David Roche, global strategist at Morgan Stanley, believes it has probably peaked and will decline from current levels of around Y105 to the dollar to Y115-120 by the end of next year. But Tokyo's positive tone does not appear to have brought any great rush into Japanese equities by European investors. Figures produced by the Tokyo stock exchange show net inflows by foreigners of Y744bn by mid-September, compared with Y841bn in the whole of last year. By contrast, a net Y5,621bn was invested in 1991 after a net outflow of Y2,548bn in 1990. However, analysts caution that these figures include all foreign investment and a substantial part of this year's total is believed to have been contributed by US pension funds which had previously been short in Japanese equities. The figures also include the operations of Japanese institutions abroad, further reducing the European contribution. Political uncertainties caused by the arrival of a seven-party coalition government after July's election, ending the 38-year rule of the Liberal Democratic party, a bumpy economic outlook with no clear end in sight to the recession and the depressing knock-on effect on the corporate sector have all put a brake on fund managers' enthusiasm for Japan. There have been false dawns on economic recovery before, says Nicholas Kenworthy of Nomura International in London. A Y10,000bn stimulatory package at the end of August,1992, and a Y13,000bn package last March both provided strong spurs to the equity market, while some encouraging corporate news during the first quarter of this year brought hopes that recovery was on the way. But with hindsight, analysts now believe that the improvement may have had more to do with book squaring at the end of the fiscal year than indicating the likelihood of any pick-up. Since then, the economy has been treading water, and many economists doubt whether this month's Y6,150bn package will prove sufficient to get the economy moving quickly. Analysts believe many European investors have been increasing their weightings in Japan over the past year. With bulls looking for the Nikkei to reach the 30,000 level in two year's time, few have been willing to reduce their holdings substantially. In any event, few investors believe that the government will allow the market to slip below the 18,000-level, since that would trigger difficulties for Japanese banks in meeting the capital adequacy ratios of the Bank for International Settlements. Stocks likely to benefit from deregulation, in the retail and transport sectors, have proved popular with foreign investors, as have shares in the housing sector. The housing market went into cyclical downturn 18 months before the real economy and is now beginning to show signs of growth. Patrick Thompson, of Fleming Investment Management in London, sees no sign that the economy had yet bottomed out. 'Ultimately, we believe that the actions being taken by the new government will succeed but there will be no real recovery before the first or second quarters of next year,' he says. Fleming Investment Management was committed to Japan in the long term, he adds. 'But the currency acts as a break on people making further investment in the Japanese market.' In the next economic cycle, there was potential for share price rises but Mr Thompson did not believe that this year's gains, in sterling terms, would be repeated. Nathan Gibbs, senior fund manager of ESN Investment Management which runs the pension fund assets of the British electricity industry says it has clearly been a very good year for UK investors in Japan, after the dismal showing of the previous three years. ESN has 18 clients and they have all been at maximum weighting since the end of the first quarter. He believes that in recent years, institutions had reduced their holdings, but now he would expect any London based pension fund to have around 5 per cent of its investments in Tokyo. He added that the types of stocks sought by foreign investors had changed considerably in recent years. Until the early 1980s, foreigners tended to buy the blue chip exporters like Honda, Fuji Photo and Sony. They had provided better disclosure of financial information than many Japanese corporations and were internationally known. But during the last decade, foreigners had begun to take a lead from their Japanese counterparts, who saw the best opportunities in stocks that were very highly priced by UK standards - large steel companies like Nippon Steel or the private Tobu Rail. Alison Edmunds of Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, believes that last week's 75 basis point cut in the official discount rate to a record low 1.75 per cent might help the economy, but she believed there remained scope for further interest rate and tax cuts later in the year. Postel had been overweight in Japan earlier in the year but had taken advantage of the market's rise to take profits. It was neutral now. Michael Thomas, director of Martin Currie, the Edinburgh-based fund management group, notes that the short-term earnings outlook for Japanese companies was poor, as a result of the depressed state of the economy and a very strong yen. On the other hand, he believes that current low level of interests rates and a lack of incentive to enter the property market would bring cash rich Japanese financial institutions back to the equity market, when the economy showed signs of picking up. On a global, non-US basis, Martin Currie had reweighted its Japanese holdings in March and April. It was now below the index average of 48 per cent, but was higher than an industry average which he saw as around 30 per cent. Peter Robertson, Far East director for M&amp;G Investment Management, which has reduced its weightings from overweight to neutral in Japan, notes that an unproven government and the possibility that there could be another election were uncertainties. He welcomed the latest supplementary budget but said that more action to spur the economy was needed. 'Although it is an area where you must have money, it is not as big a part of a south-east Asian portfolio as it used to be,' he said.</p>

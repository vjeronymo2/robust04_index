			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  resumed telecommunications trade talks Friday [3 June] by taking  stock of their positions since talks collapsed in February, a  Japanese official said.    Negotiators had a "wide-ranging discussion" on government  procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, the  last of three priority sector talks to resume in bilateral trade  "framework" talks, said the Foreign Ministry official.    He described the meeting after a hiatus of three and a half  months as a get-reaquainted session, saying "a decision would be  impossible" in a day.    Talks between the U.S. Trade Representative's Office and  Japan's Finance, Trade and Telecommunications Ministries will  continue with a full-day session Saturday, he said. But no  deadline has been set, said the official, who briefed reporters  on condition his name not be used.    He would not comment on whether the negotiators discussed  "objective criteria" or the treatment of Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp. (NTT) -- two key issues in the sectoral talks.    U.S. Officials were not available for comment.    How to assess market-opening progress is the biggest  remaining issue in the field, on which the two sides are  "nine-tenths of the way toward agreement," a ministry official  said earlier.    Also at issue is whether to include NTT in the talks, with  Japan insisting it is a private company but the U.S. stressing  the Japanese Government's two-thirds ownership.    Talks on insurance began Wednesday in Tokyo and on autos and  auto parts Thursday in Washington.</p>

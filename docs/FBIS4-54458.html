			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with resigned Deputy Defense Minister Boyko Noev </F> by Petya Vladimorova in Sofia on 25 April: "I Have Confidence  in the Defense Minister's Efforts"]    [Text] [Vladimirova] Mr. Noev, when the army budget was  being planned, Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov hinted that  he may submit his resignation if the budget is cut beyond what  is acceptable. General Petrov, chief of the General Staff, said  the same thing, but in much stronger terms, and the General  Staff even sent a letter to all units that frankly described the  disastrous situation of the Army. Today, however, it is you who  resigned.    [Noev] I have not followed closely who has made what  statements. When the budget estimates were being made and we  asked for one-third of the available funds to be allocated to  military needs, it was clear to everyone that we would not get  one-third, because 37 billion leva is beyond the state's  capabilities. As for whether I heard about the letter with  information on the state of the army that was sent to the  troops, the answer is yes. As far as I know, it expresses what  the top army officer told parliament. My personal view is that  the sending of this document to the troops has seriously damaged  officers' self-esteem. The document in question contains  assessments that, if they proved to be true, would mean that we  simply would have no army. However, the situation is not so  clear. We must see whether such a document was really sent out  and how it affected the morale of the officers.    [Vladimirova] The press organs of the political force that  wants your resignation -- it is no secret that this is the BSP  [Bulgarian Socialist Party] -- are raising a furor over  discontent being rife in the Army. At the same time, a letter  of the kind that the General Staff reportedly sent out to the  troops cannot in itself be a source of tension. Unprejudiced  people are inclined to link this document with the newspaper  campaign that ended with demands for resignations. What is your  view on this?    [Noev] Please allow me to decline to comment on your  analysis. I would only like to say that it is indeed true that  serious feelings of disappointment and loss of faith have  arisen. I cannot say whether this letter represents the result,  or whether it led to this discontent.    [Vladimirova] What do you expect to happen after your  resignation?    [Noev] I hope that it will contribute to finding the best  personnel decisions as far as the cabinet is concerned. I have  confidence in the efforts of Professor Berov and Minister  Aleksandrov.    [Vladimirova] It is no secret that the minister held you in  high regard, yet now you are leaving to enable Minister  Aleksandrov and Prof. Berov to find the best possible personnel  decisions. Is this not a logical contradiction?    [Noev] No. because Minister Aleksandrov would not have  accepted my resignation, that is why I submitted it direct to  Prime Minister Berov.    [Vladimirova] How do you assess the army reform so far?    [Noev] The reform is going slowly, but Minister Aleksandrov  is doing everything possible to press forward with the changes,  and I am sure that his efforts are in the interest of all the  democratic forces in Bulgaria.    [Vladimirova] Thank you for the interview, Mr. Noev.</p>

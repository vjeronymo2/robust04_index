The Trading Practices Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Protecting investors from manipulated stock prices was one of the principal goals that prompted the enactment in 1934 of the Exchange Act. Since shortly after the adoption of the Exchange Act, the Commission and its staff have dealt with issues involving manipulation in the context of securities offerings and provided formal and informal advice regarding the scope of permissible activities during securities offerings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As the Commission has noted, regulation of the market activities of parties with an interest in the outcome of an offering presents ``intensely practical problem[s].'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Among other things, the staff has provided advice regarding the types of activities engaged in by participants in a securities distribution that would be viewed as being undertaken for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of the securities by others, in violation of section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, in response to formal and informal staff interpretations, managing underwriters followed the practice of stopping or tapering off their trading activities when preparations for the distribution were begun; and participating underwriters curtailed their trading when the registration statement was first filed or when they were later invited to participate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Foshay, supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 5, at 912.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Release 34&hyph;2446, at 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 3056 (October 27, 1941).

They also serve a deterrence function by expressly prohibiting manipulative behavior during offerings, and promote investor confidence in the securities markets by lessening the ability of distribution participants to manipulate the price of an offering upward to facilitate the offering. Moreover, as with other antimanipulation provisions, the Trading Practices Rules provide the Commission with important enforcement tools in bringing actions against persons that have engaged in manipulative practices during securities offerings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Appendix A for a discussion of the historical development of the Trading Practices Rules and an index of Commission releases relating to these rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 5040 (May 18, 1954), 19 FR 2986 (``1954 Release'').

The Need for Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission remains committed to the fundamental legal and policy bases for regulating the activities of participants in a distribution. Since the adoption of the Trading Practices Rules in 1955 and their most recent comprehensive review in 1983, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  however, tremendous changes have occurred in the securities markets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19565 (March 4, 1983), 48 FR 10628 (``1983 Release'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's Division of Market Regulation recently completed a comprehensive review to assess the state of the United States (``U.S.'') equity markets and to provide guidance for the development of a national market system.

Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) &para;85,311.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> A. Transformation of the Securities Markets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the 1950s, trading in the United States securities market was dominated by activity on the national securities exchanges; little information was publicly available about trading in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market. Today, however, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.'s (``NASD'') Nasdaq system is one of the world's largest stock markets, with an average daily trading volume of 263.0 million shares, at an aggregate value in 1993 of $1.35 trillion. This compares with an average daily trading volume of 264.5 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''), at an aggregate value in 1993 of $2.3 trillion. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Such high levels of trading volume have produced deeper, more liquid markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Source: Securities Industry Association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, there has been an enormous growth in communications and information technology, which has provided industry participants with enhanced real-time price data and news about securities and their issuers. These developments have fostered the high level of transparency (i.e., the dissemination of trade reports and quotation information is available to all market participants) that generally characterizes the U.S. equity markets. The availability of quotation information helps investors to determine when and where to trade, while transaction reporting provides an indication of the reliability of the quotations and the quality of transaction execution. A higher degree of transparency helps investors, analysts, and other market participants to better observe and evaluate security price movements. During a distribution, this market transparency provides greater visibility to transactions in the offered security, enhancing the ability of investors, regulators, and others to observe unusual price movements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

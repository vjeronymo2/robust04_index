			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Boost for US growth prospects: Trade and consumer price data add weight to Clinton forecasts Reports of a zero increase in consumer prices last month and a sharp fall in the trade deficit in December to Dollars 7.4bn yesterday added credibility to the Clinton administration's forecast of sustained non-inflationary growth. Analysts said the unexpected fall in the trade deficit would lead to upward revisions to economic growth in the fourth quarter to an annual rate of more than 6 per cent. Apparent absence of upward pressure on prices, meanwhile, reduced the immediate risk of another increase in short-term interest rates. But good inflation figures are unlikely to prevent further tightening of monetary policy in coming months if the Federal Reserve concludes the economy is growing faster than its long-run potential, and thus eliminating excess capacity. The consumer price index was flat last month and up by only 2.5 per cent in the year to January. Most analysts had predicted an increase of about 0.3 per cent. Inflation was held down by the decline in world oil prices, which caused a 0.8 per cent fall in US energy prices, and by changes in seasonal adjustments. In recent years, blips in consumer prices in the first four months were wrongly interpreted as a sign of increasing inflationary pressure. The 'core' consumer price index - which excludes the volatile components of food and energy - rose 0.1 per cent last month and by 2.9 per cent on an annual comparison. The merchandise trade deficit fell from Dollars 9.7bn in November to Dollars 7.4bn in December, the lowest shortfall in a year. Analysts had expected a gap of about Dollars 10bn. The improvement mainly reflected a Dollars 2bn rise in exports to Dollars 42.2bn; imports fell Dollars 0.3bn to Dollars 49.6bn despite the economy's strength at the end of the year. The smaller trade gap will probably result in an upward revision in economic growth in the fourth quarter to an annualised 6.0-6.5 per cent, against the 5.9 per cent initially reported. The trade improvement, however, may not be sustained. Exports were boosted in December by an erratic increase in aircraft sales, by a strong rebound in car exports, and by the decline in oil prices, which held down imports. Mr David Rolley, senior economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill, the forecasting group, said import volumes were likely to grow twice as fast as exports this year, reflecting faster growth in the US than elsewhere. The trade deficit would probably rebound to Dollars 12bn-Dollars 13bn by mid-year and hit Dollars 15bn by the end of the year.</p>

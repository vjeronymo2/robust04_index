			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija  Izetbegovic sent a letter yesterday [25 February] to the UN  Security Council. The letter says:    A ferocious offensive on Maglaj has been going on for days  now. The situation is deteriorating by the hour due to the  employment of the heavy artillery the Serb aggressor withdrew  from around Sarajevo. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has done and  is doing everything it possibly can to rescue the town and its  residents. Our defenses are flagging due to the enemy's  technical superiority. Thousands of civilians -- mostly women  and children -- are facing a fresh massacre. We are demanding  urgent action on the part of the United Nations to forestall  genocide, President Izetbegovic's letter says.</p>

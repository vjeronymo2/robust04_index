Based on the improved contracted responsibility system for  agricultural production, contracted rights and utilization  rights of land can be divided and transferred to promote  production.    Establishment of collective farms and small household farms  are encouraged to promote the sizeable management of the land.    Further reform measures will be introduced to the markets  for  major agricultural products. The prices of grain, cotton and  cocoon silk will be shifted to the control of the market from  the traditional uniform state pricing system.    The provincial government also aims to increase agricultural  input by readjusting the allocation of funds. It is stipulated  that the annual growth rate of expenditure on agriculture must  be higher than that of the total in the financial budgets of  governments at all levels.    More capital will be earmarked for building and renovating  irrigation works and water-conservancy facilities.    Moreover, funds for agricultural technology research will be  increased and more credits and loans will be provided to farmers.    Export-oriented agricultural development zones will be set  up  to expand the opening-up of rural economy and accelerate  agricultural restructuring.    Disaster-relief reserve funds will be established to  guarantee supplies of materials for farming production.    Poverty-relief efforts will continue to be emphasized. The  provincial government has earmarked 100 million yuan as special  loans to boost township enterprises in poor areas.</p>

We ordinary mortals do not know that lawyers entertain in  all  earnestness a concept which acknowledges that enterprise and  crime are indissolubly linked and that it is time to introduce a  moratorium on the struggle against economic crime. What are the  arguments for this? OK. It is impossible to accumulate  original capital honestly -- that is self-evident. So, a  moratorium must be introduced. When criminal businessmen steal,  pardon me, accumulate quite a lot of money, they start investing  it in legal business, thus helping out society by producing  goods, creating jobs, and so on.    Nonsense? Nothing of the sort. This concept has not emerged  from nothing and it has quite a few supporters. Admittedly,  there are also other professors who think that you can avoid  bloodshed, racketeering, and thievery when accumulating capital,  but this group is clearly in the minority.    Life regrettably confirms that the first group of scientists  are correct. M. Yegorov, Russian first deputy minister of  internal affairs, said that over 40,000 state and commercial  enterprises belong to criminal groupings. These groupings,  using counterfeit advice slips and other methods, have effected  financial operations worth over 1 trillion rubles.    Typically these bigwigs have little scope for crime and they  are making vigorous inroads into politics, but this kind of  fusion of criminals and corrupt politicians is very dangerous.  The strangest thing is that Russia still does not have clear  laws to help distinguish between honest and criminal business.    Criminal groupings are dividing up spheres of influence at  full speed -- from below -- but at the very top a completely new  trend has emerged: the creation of powerful organizations with  leadership at oblast, kray, or even regional level.    In this situation the largest commercial structures must set  up their own security services, but they still cannot do without  the militia. And many people realize that. At any rate  businessmen's mistrust of internal affairs organs is gradually  subsiding. Today the Ministry of Internal Affairs is willing to  guard banks and offices and transport money and securities, as  well as ensure personal security. I am of course only talking  about honest business. It may nonetheless exist....</p>

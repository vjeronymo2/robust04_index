The transformation of the Presidential  Guard, which is directly attached to President Geydar Aliyev,  into a "regular army" has brought the victory nearer. The  guardsmen are being trained at a location some 50-km from Baku  to adapt to any natural environment. The Azerbaijani commanders  in their turn have been trained by the officers of the Turkish  Armed Forces.  <H5>  The Discipline of the Turkish Army </H5>   The [Azerbaijani] commanders are saying: "We were trained by  Turkish officers. Had we received this training beforehand, the  Armenians would not have been able to occupy our lands."  Indicating that their military discipline is fashioned after  the discipline in the Turkish Army, the commanders are saying:  "The Armenians will now see how we fight. The previous defeats  were not our fault. The volunteer units were the cause for our  reverses. Any person wanting to fight must fight under the  command of the national army."</p>

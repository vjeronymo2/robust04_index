			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Rainer Nahrendorf: "Lower the Employment </F> Threshold"]    [Text] The Clinton Administration criticizes the failure of  West Europeans to create new employment through new growth. This  criticism, however, is only partly justified. Although the GNP  of the United States grew by almost 3 percent in 1993, and  although some 2 million jobs were created in 1993 and the  unemployment rate, computed according to a new method, dropped  to 6.7 percent in January, the much-praised U.S. "job machine"  runs below capacity.    In the United States, as in Europe, for some time there has  been discussion on economic growth without additional  employment. The leverage of growth on employment is not as great  by far as in former phases of upswing. The Institute of German  Economy recently calculated that in the U.S. economy overall, 7  percent growth of the GDP between 1991 and 1993 had brought  about 3 percent more employment, while in the economic boom of  1983-1985, a 14.6-percent growth rate had still yielded a  9.6-percent employment increase.    The reason for growth without employment increase--which  occurs primarily in industry--lies in the slimming down of U.S.  enterprises, forced by tough international competition. This  applies above all to the automobile industry, machine and  systems building, and the electrical engineering industry. New  jobs are being created primarily in the service sector, in  software and engineering offices, in social services, and in  low-paying jobs such as parking lot and movie attendants. U.S.  Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich would like to counter the  "slimming down strategy" of enterprises with a qualification  strategy and a reintegration program for the growing number of  long-term unemployed.  <H5>  Millions of Exchange Proceedings </H5>   Professor Dr. Horst Siebert, president of the Kiel Institute  for World Economy, has furnished proof of the phenomenon of  solidifying unemployment in the FRG. According to his  calculations, the unemployment base (see HANDELSBLATT of 14 Dec  1993) has grown by 700,000 and 830,000 persons, respectively,  during the last two recessions. Siebert predicts that an  economic upswing will hardly improve the situation on the labor  market. For the period 1970 to 1989, Siebert has found that  employment rose only if the growth rate of the GDP went above  the 1.7 percent mark.    Even if economic growth were to approach 3 percent, it would  not solve the problem of a solidifying unemployment. However, it  is misleading to speak of an "unemployment base" rising with  every cycle. Behind the unemployment figures, year after year  there are movements into and out of unemployment by the  millions. According to computations by the Federal Labor Office,  in the course of 1993 there was a total of 6,574,300 unemployed.  This number consists of those unemployed at the beginning of the  year and those who became unemployede during the year. At the  end of 1993, there was still a core of 2,513,700 unemployed. On  the supply side, there is a similarly strong movement, albeit on  a clearly lower level.    In 1992, the average unemployment period in western Germany  came to 24.7 weeks. When employment problems grow overall, they  hit older people considerably harder than younger ones. In 1993,  the unemployment rate for younger people (up to 25 years of  age), was 14.1 percent, while for older persons (50 to 65 years  of age) it was 30.5 percent.    Although the number of long-term unemployed (one year or  longer) in 1993 in western Germany reached its highest point  since 1988 with 594,099, the ratio of the long-term unemployed  at 26.2 percent remained constant compared to 1992 figures.  <H5>  Costs Must Come Down </H5>   Measures of an active labor market policy, such as promotion  of extended occupational training, occupational rehabilitation,  general job creation measures (ABM), and employment assistance  for the long-term unemployed contribute considerably to  countering structural discrepancies and improving the balance  between supply and demand on the labor market. They ease the  labor market, and build a bridge for many out of unemployment  into jobs. This also applies to the employment promotion law  which has facilitated the conclusion of time-limited employment  contracts (see HANDELSBLATT of 16 Feb 1994).    But labor market policy measures and increased part-time  work  try to cure the symptoms of stagnating and decreasing employment  rather than improving the preconditions for employment-intensive  growth. The key to closing the workplace gap lies in improving  the supply conditions in industry, in lowering costs, in tax and  levy reductions, and a restrained wage policy better  differentiated according to sectors, regions, and occupations.  The Council of Experts, the research institutes and the German  Bundesbank time and again have pointed out this correlation.    To the lack of differentiated wage structures are added  inflexibilities and incrustations due to institutional  regulations which also raise the entry threshold into the labor  market. But above all it is important that wage agreements only  regulate minimum standards and leave room for operational wage  and salary differentiations, and working hour differentiations  and flexibilities. The chemical industry wage agreement partners  have provided a good example in their 1994 agreement, which  provides for a 2 percent wage and salary increase with a  three-month delay, expansion of the working-hours corridor, and  entry level wages for the previously unemployed and first-time  workers.</p>

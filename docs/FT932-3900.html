			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Dares Estates cuts losses to Pounds 22.3m Dares Estates, the property investment and development group, is continuing talks with its UK lenders and the board hopes that it is near agreement. The proposals involve the conversion of Pounds 9.7m into preference shares, some of which will be convertible into ordinary shares, subordination of Pounds 9m debt and the extension of the maturity of residual debt until December 31 1997. Other provisions cover permission to pay interest by the issue of preference shares and the conversion of existing preference shares into ordinary shares. For the 1992 year, which saw pre-tax losses cut from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 22.3m, the accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis, subject to the capital reorganisation being agreed. The fall was helped by lower interest costs and exceptional charges. Exceptionals came to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 17.8m) of which Pounds 11.4m related to provisions for the fall in value of assets. Interest costs were Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 12.2m). Turnover was Pounds 5.53m (Pounds 17.4m) made up of rental income of Pounds 5.44m (Pounds 7.6m) and other income down from Pounds 9.78m to Pounds 90,000. Losses per share were 13.53p (15.76p).</p>

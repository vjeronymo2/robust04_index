The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appeals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural Resources Defense Council, 11/1/93  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> LFA&hyph;0150 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Natural Resources Defense Council filed an Appeal from a denial by the Office of Military Application of a request for information that it filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In considering the information that was withheld as classified material under Exemption 3 of the FOIA, after a review by the DOE's Office of Classification, the DOE determined that a small portion of previously withheld material could now be released as the result of more precise deletions. The remaining withheld material continues to be properly classified, and therefore, may not be released. Accordingly, the Appeal was granted in part and denied in part. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Valley Times, 11/1/93,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> LFA&hyph;0325 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Valley Times filed an Appeal from a partial denial by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of a request for information which the company had submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that the names of certain former Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory employees who were under investigation by the OIG for possible conflict of interest violations were improperly withheld under Exemptions 6 and 7(C) and that the names should be released to the public. On remand, the OIG must release the names of the subject of its conflict of interest investigation or explain why it is inappropriate to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

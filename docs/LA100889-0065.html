			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT  </P> <P> American Youth Hostels has opened a budget accommodation facility in Austin,  Tex.  </P> <P> The youth hostel is near the heart of the city, on the south shore of Town  Lake. The renovated building was originally the Old Rowing Club Boathouse.  </P> <P> Now it offers accommodations for up to 40 visitors in single-sex dormitory  rooms. In addition, there is a special family/couple room with a king-size  waterbed. You'll also find a fully equipped self-service kitchen and a large  common room that overlooks the lake.  </P> <P> AYH advises that the location is convenient to parkland hiking and biking  trails that skirt the lake.  </P> <P> If you are a member of American Youth Hostels the rate is $8 a night.  Non-members will have to pay an extra $3 a night for an introductory  membership.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Age Restrictions  </P> <P> The AYH network has more than 250 outlets across the United States, and is  affiliated with the International Youth Hostel Federation, which has more than  5,000 outlets around the world.  </P> <P> Although the word "youth" is prominent in the name, few areas of the world  (including North America) impose any age restrictions on using hostel  facilities. In return for inexpensive accommodations, be prepared for  single-sex dormitory rooms, having to provide your own sheet sleeping bag and  being asked to help with a small chore.  </P> <P> For more information or reservations, contact Austin International Hostel, 2200  S. Lakeshore Blvd., Austin, Tex. 78741, (512) 444-2294.  </P> <P> The British Youth Hostel Assn. has announced the opening of another hostel  along the 180-mile Pembrokeshire Coast Footpath in southwest Wales. That means  there are now eight youth hostels along this popular walking route.  </P> <P> Most of the route is in Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, one of 11 national  parks in England and Wales. The area is known for its wildlife, coastal  scenery, sandy beaches and cozy harbors.  </P> <P> One of the reasons you might find yourself in that area is because of a ferry  service from Rosslare, Ireland, to Fishguard, Wales, that takes less than four  hours. Student and youth discount fares are available through the Irish student  travel service, USIT, which has offices throughout Ireland and in London.  </P> <P> The new hostel is at Manorbier a few miles from the popular resort of Tenby,  which is about 239 miles from London. It's in a renovated building suitable for  young travelers, the disabled and even families.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Footpaths and Walks  </P> <P> The walking season is almost over for this year, but you can get some help in  planning for next spring through a free publication, "Walking In Britain,"  offered by the British Tourist Authority and the Countryside Commission.  </P> <P> Along with descriptions, the booklet includes maps of 60 established footpaths  and walks throughout Britain.  </P> <P> England and Wales have more than 135,000 miles of public rights of way, which  help you avoid the traffic while enjoying the countryside.  </P> <P> You could find yourself being led across a field or through a forest. Many of  these routes were originally paths used as communication systems before cars or  bicycles; now they've been joined to form long-distance walking trails.  </P> <P> "Walking In Britain" also identifies youth hostels, and includes information  about alternative budget accommodations, guided walks, public transportation,  guidebooks, detailed maps and such practical advice as what to wear.  </P> <P> Free copies are available from tourist information centers in Britain or from  the British Tourist Authority, 350 S. Figueroa St., Suite 450, Los Angeles  90071, (213) 628-3525.  </P> <P> Another good source of information for planning travel in Britain is "Let's Go:  Britain and Ireland," by the Harvard Student Agencies ($11.95). It's  re-researched annually, and new editions are usually available in bookstores  during the Christmas holiday season each year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Russia's participation in  NATO's Partnership for Peace programme "could be useful for  Russia only under certain conditions", a senior Russian lawmaker  said.    Addressing a news conference on Thursday, Vladimir Lukin,  head of the State Duma (the parliament's lower house) Committee  for Foreign Relations, dwelt upon some key issues concerning  Russia's proposed joining the NATO initiative.    Russia agreed last month to enter the Partenership for  Peace,  a programme of joint exercises and military cooperation between  the Atlantic Alliance and the post-communist countries.    Lukin deems it necessary to draw up a so-called "document of  presentation" and send it to NATO before joining the initiative.  The document is to specify mutual obligations of the  Partnership's participants. It should also stipulate that  Russia is ready to take part in the decision-making process only  as NATO's equal partner.    Furthermore, the Partnership should have some relationship  with the 52-member Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE), Russia's favoured forum for European security.    "The CSCE has a mandate for maintaining cooperation and  keeping peace but no mechanism. NATO has a mechanism to impose  its decisions but has not international mandate", Lukin said.    According to him, the above "document of presentation" could  be best drafted by joint efforts of all the parties concerned:  the executive branch, the foreign and defence ministries, the  Security Council and the State Duma, in order to "avoid any  questions in future". This document should be also brought in  line with the already existing programmes of CIS collective  security and take into account Russia's commitments under these  programmes.    The lawmaker assumed that the decision to join the  Partnership for Peace programme would not require ratification  by the lower house, but "this is still to be verified", he noted.</p>

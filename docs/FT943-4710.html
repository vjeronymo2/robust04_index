			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: JCI posts strong rise ahead of planned demerger Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, the South African mining house, boosted attributable earnings by 73 per cent to R748m (Dollars 165m) in the year to June, from R433.2m a year ago. It was the last annual result before the conglomerate's planned unbundling into three separate companies early next year. Group turnover rose to R2.92bn, up from R2.63bn a year ago, and the dividend was raised to 200 cents, up from only 132 cents last year. Although the results were helped by R84.5m from the sale of Argus Newspapers to Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers, equity-accounted earnings before extraordinary items advanced 57 per cent to R912.9m from R582.4m. The company has also decided to reverse its decision to write off R130m of its investment in the HJ Joel Gold Mine after a sharp improvement in the mine's prospects during the past year and its successful raising of R284m in fresh capital. Following last year's tax credit of R20.8m, tax paid rose to R62.3m on the year. Earnings from platinum holdings, which include the world's largest platinum mine, Rustenburg Platinum, rose to R114.5m from R85.4m, while gold benefited from an improved price to more than double earnings to R93.8m from R34.6m. The group, which last week lost out in the bid to buy Randcoal, reported that coal earnings rose substantially to R23m from R1.8m. Diamonds also had a good year, with earnings rising to R104.2m from R79.2m. Mr Pat Retief, chairman, said he expected all sectors of the company to continue to perform well after unbundling. Under the plan announced by JCI's leading shareholder, Anglo-American, the platinum interests would be retained by Anglo-American while its diamond interests would be bought by De Beers. The rest of JCI would be divided into a mining company, comprising primarily JCI's gold interests, and an industrial holding company, both of which are due to be offered to black investors. Although the transaction requires changes to legislation before it can be approved by shareholders, Mr Retief said he hoped final unbundling would take place early next year and be completed by April 1995.</p>

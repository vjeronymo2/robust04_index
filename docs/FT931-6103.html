			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten move on school ballots MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, will announce today that the government will take new powers to overturn ballots on whether schools opt for grant-maintained status if local auth-orities interfere in the process. Under the proposals, ballots could be declared void where one of four types of interference by third parties had taken place. It was not spelled out last night who these third parties were but it was taken to be a reference to local authorities that oppose grant-maintained schools. Examples of interference would include the intimidation of voters and the dissemination of seriously misleading information during the conduct of a ballot. Mr Patten is expected to portray the proposals as an attempt to ensure fair play in an important aspect of local democracy. News of the move emerged last night as Mr Patten was accused of acting like a dictator during the first of two consecutive days' Commons debate on the education bill. Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, charged Mr Patten with wanting 'a national system of education under your personal political control'. With the parliamentary guillotine in operation to ensure that MPs are asked to give the bill a third reading by 10pm today, the government secured a majority of 46 (284-238) to carry a new provision strengthening the minister's powers over schools in England and Wales. MPs may not get the chance to debate Mr Patten's proposed new measures in full. It is understood the measures are to be inserted in the bill as an amendment to a clause on which debate has already been curtailed.</p>

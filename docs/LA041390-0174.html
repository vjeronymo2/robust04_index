			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 'MEALS FOR PEOPLE' IS REALIZING A DREAM  </P> <P> A year ago, Richard Cholewa was lying in a hospital bed recuperating from  quadruple-bypass open-heart surgery. As he recovered, he began to re-evaluate  his life and wondered if, at 56, he had made any lasting contributions to  society.  </P> <P> It was during this time that the Orange resident decided to launch Meals for  People, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supplying funds to soup kitchens  throughout Southern California.  </P> <P> "I felt that there was a reason why I was still here," said Cholewa, who  suffered a heart attack just before the operation and a second one during  surgery. "I feel just fantastic now and realize that the reason I'm still here  is to help my fellow man."  </P> <P> During its first three months, Meals for People has raised about $15,000 by  collecting money in red, white and blue containers placed in about 1,500 stores  throughout Orange County, including 19 Vons supermarkets.  </P> <P> "We've had tremendous cooperation from retailers, particularly the mom-and-pop  type businesses," Cholewa said.  </P> <P> The timing is right for organizations like Meals for People, which he said cuts  through a lot of governmental red tape and gives money directly to soup  kitchens.  </P> <P> "Government funding for soup kitchens has not increased in five years and, in  some cases, has decreased," Cholewa said. "As a result, the number of people  who need assistance has doubled. That's why it's important for private  organizations, like ours, to raise money and offset the decrease. Without  groups like ours, soup kitchens would be in a lot of trouble."  </P> <P> John Lands, executive director of the Orange County Rescue Mission in Santa  Ana, agreed.  </P> <P> "The one commodity we're always short on is money, which we need to buy food,"  said Lands, whose soup kitchen serves about 300 people each day. "We don't get  any government funding at all so we really appreciate Meals for People. We wish  there were more groups like them."  </P> <P> For Cholewa, getting Meals for People off the ground was the realization of a  dream that originated in 1986. Back then, he attempted to start the  organization, but legal problems prevented it from progressing. Until his  illness, the plans remained in limbo.  </P> <P> "I had always planned on trying to start it up again, but I'm not so sure I  ever really would have if I hadn't gotten sick," Cholewa said.  </P> <P> Grants given so far have ranged from $500 to $1,100. The Orange County kitchens  that have received funds so far include: Someone Cares Soup Kitchen in Costa  Mesa, Orange County Rescue Mission in Santa Ana and El Modena Soup Kitchen in  Orange. Kitchens in Riverside and San Bernardino counties have also received  funding.  </P> <P> Cholewa said distributing funds to Southern California soup kitchens is only  the beginning. He would like to expand the organization's efforts across the  state and, eventually, across the country.  </P> <P> "If the lord is willing and keeps me healthy, I believe it will happen."

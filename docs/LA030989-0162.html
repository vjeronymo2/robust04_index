			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IOC DOCTOR CALLS FRANCIS' SABOTAGE THEORY NONSENSE  </P> <P> An International Olympic Committee doctor who was in charge of the doping  control facility at the Seoul Games dismissed the sabotage theory presented in  testimony by Ben Johnson's coach Charlie Francis, this week at the Canadian  federal inquiry into drug use in sports.  </P> <P> Dr. Manfred Donike of West Germany said Wednesday in an interview with the  Toronto Star: "I can tell you this is absolute nonsense . . . When I  interpreted the analytical result of Johnson's urine and took into  consideration the steroid profile, I saw this was not possible."  </P> <P> Arnold Beckett, an IOC doctor from England, was quoted as saying: "It's a load  of rubbish, let's face it. First of all, they were talking about someone  tampering with his bag on the field. Then they started changing it into another  story about a black man in the waiting room. Then they thought it was a white  man. Then they mixed the two and got a yellow man. Did he have an antenna,  too?"  </P></p>

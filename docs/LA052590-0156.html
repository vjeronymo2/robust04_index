			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEDTRONIC UNIT GETS $6-MILLION SOVIET CONTRACT;  </P> <P> COMMERCE: ANAHEIM-BASED DIVISION TO SUPPLY 20,000 BLOOD OXYGENATORS TO THE  MINISTRY OF HEALTH, WHICH WILL DISTRIBUTE THEM TO ITS NATION'S HOSPITALS.  </P> <P> An Anaheim division of a Minneapolis biomedical manufacturer will supply 20,000  blood oxygenators to hospitals in the Soviet Union under a contract that  company officials valued at $6 million.  </P> <P> Medtronic Cardiopulmonary, a 380-employee division of Medtronic Inc.,  manufactures the Maxima blood oxygenator, a disposable device used to perform  the functions of the lungs during open-heart surgery.  </P> <P> Winston R. Wallin, Medtronic's chairman and chief executive, said Thursday that  the sale is the largest the Minneapolis firm has ever made in Eastern Europe.  It is also believed to be the largest single Soviet purchase of oxygenators  from a U.S. company. Two other Orange County firms -- Shiley Inc. and Baxter  Healthcare Corp.'s Bentley Laboratories division, both in Irvine -- have made  smaller sales of oxygenators to the Soviets.  </P> <P> Medtronic will begin shipping the oxygenators to the Soviet Union in June, said  Willard Lewis, general manager of the Anaheim division. The Soviet Union's  Ministry of Health will distribute the devices to various hospitals that  perform open-heart surgery in the Soviet Union, he said.  </P> <P> The Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd. of Japan has issued a letter of credit  guaranteeing that Medtronic will receive payment for the equipment in U.S.  dollars, Lewis said.  </P> <P> "We estimate that this order would comprise the majority of the oxygenator  requirements of the Soviet health ministry for a year," said Jim Pacek, the  division's marketing director.  </P> <P> Negotiations with Soviet ministry officials and Medtronic representatives in  Paris and Anaheim began last July after Soviet officials visited Medtronic's  Anaheim facility, Medtronic officials said. Under the contract, Medtronic will  also provide technical and educational support to the Soviets, said Dick Reid,  a Medtronic spokesman in Minneapolis. Medtronic will send technicians to Soviet  hospitals to train their medical staffs, and some Soviet doctors, medical  technicians and health ministry officials will receive training at Medtronic's  European headquarters in Paris.  </P></p>

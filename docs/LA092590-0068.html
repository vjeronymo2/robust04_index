			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TIPS ON AVOIDING UNWANTED VALET SERVICE  </P> <P> Concerning Joseph N. Bell's Aug. 24 article objecting to the growing practice  of restaurants forcing unwanted valet parking on the public, Mr. Bell should  have had the fortitude to fight back.  </P> <P> I wholly agree with Joe and The Times in deploring the practice, but both  overlooked the obvious method of cure.  </P> <P> It's very simple. Mention the offending restaurants by name. That would have  ensured a fast cure and would also have been a very nice tit for tat.  </P> <P> Joe would have been scratching that itch and The Times would have performed a  public service for the majority of patrons at a possible very small cost in  advertising.  </P> <P> Other restaurants would think twice before instituting a similar disservice to  their customers.  </P> <P> HARRY PRINCE  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

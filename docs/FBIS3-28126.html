			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Japan's electric power  industry revealed plans Wednesday [2 February] to upgrade the  country's boiling water reactors (BWRs) to minimize damage in  case of a serious accident. The power industry had previously  maintained that technical modifications for the sake of safety  were unnecessary because there was very little chance of such an  accident with Japanese reactors.    The containers of all BWRs, the reactor type used in the  majority of the country's nuclear power plants, will be  furnished with pressure valves, which, in case of an accident,  would allow surplus radioactive gas to escape to prevent the  container from bursting, power industry sources said. Before  release into the atmosphere, the gas would go through filters  designed to retain its radioactive components, they said.    To prevent damage from a buildup of pressure in pressurized  water reactors (PWRs), this reactor type will be equipped with a  device that will burn surplus hydrogen gas originating from the  reactions in the reactor core.    The safety measures, which will cost several hundred million  yen, will be carried out after being approved by the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the nuclear safety  commission, but not earlier than next year, the sources said.  The power companies will officially submit their upgrading  proposals to MITI in March.    France, Germany and other industrialized countries have  taken  similar measures following major nuclear disasters such as the  near meltdown of a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in the  United States in March 1979, and the Chernobyl disaster in the  Ukraine, at that time in the Soviet Union, in April 1986.    In a 1992 report, the Nuclear Safety Commission, under  pressure to reassure the public after an accident at Kansai  Electric Power Co.'s nuclear power plant at Mihama, Fukui  Prefecture, in February 1991 triggered the reactor's emergency  core cooling system, urged the Japanese power industry to  improve reactor safety. After thorough examination of the  commission report the nuclear power suppliers decided to take  preventive measures such as improving the coolant capacity of  reactors to minimize the risk of a serious accident, the sources  said.</p>

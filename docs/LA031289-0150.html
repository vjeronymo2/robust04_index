			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHENEY, NUNN AT ODDS OVER MILITARY'S DRUG ROLE  </P> <P> President Bush's new nominee for defense secretary, Rep. Dick Cheney (R-Wyo.),  has in the past supported a plan strongly opposed by the Pentagon that would  require the U.S. military to halt drug smuggling over the nation's southern  border.  </P> <P> Cheney's vote for the proposal, which was approved by the House last May 5 over  the opposition of then-Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and was later  weakened in the Senate, is one of many defense-related issues on which he  surely will be quizzed during confirmation hearings by the Senate Armed  Services Committee, beginning this week.  </P> <P> A review by The Times of Cheney's House votes and statements on defense issues  found that while he consistently backed the Ronald Reagan Administration's  military buildup over the last eight years, few of the positions he took as a  House member would clash with the majority opinion on the Democratic-controlled  Armed Services Committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Vote Most at Odds  </P> <P> Perhaps the one Pentagon-related vote by Cheney over the last year that  conflicts most sharply with the views of Armed Services Committee members is  the one he cast for a GOP-inspired amendment ordering the secretary of defense  to "substantially halt the unlawful penetration of United States borders by  aircraft and vessels carrying narcotics within 45 days of enactment."  </P> <P> The House-passed drug interdiction proposal was strongly opposed not only by  Carlucci but also by Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who a  year earlier had entertained spectators in the Senate gallery by ridiculing the  idea in the starkest terms possible -- detailing the enormous quantities of  military personnel and equipment that would have to be diverted from normal  duties to halt drug trafficking across U.S. borders.  </P> <P> Nunn, in negotiations last May with Carlucci and Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.),  the committee's ranking Republican, eventually came up with a compromise  acceptable to the House leadership that increased the Defense Department's role  in drug interdiction, but only marginally.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Glenn Criticizes Posturing  </P> <P> On the Senate floor, Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), a member of the Armed Services  Committee, criticized both the House-passed amendment and the Senate compromise  as nothing more than political posturing in a year that many members of  Congress were facing reelection.  </P> <P> Pete Williams, House press secretary for Cheney, said Saturday he does not know  if the nominee still supports the anti-drug plan that he voted for last year or  whether he would press for an increased military role in drug interdiction as  defense secretary.  </P> <P> In response to such questions, Williams quoted Cheney as saying on Saturday:  "With respect to my votes and positions during my years in Congress, I have  said I would not discuss policy prior to my appearance before the Congress."  </P> <P> Cheney, who was nominated Friday only one day after the Senate rejected Bush's  first nominee, John Tower, spent the weekend poring through briefing papers  provided by the Administration on defense issues likely to be raised in  confirmation hearings by the Armed Services Committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Date Set for Hearing  </P> <P> No date has yet been announced for the start of Cheney's confirmation hearings,  but Williams said the nominee expects them to begin as early as Tuesday.  </P> <P> In the hearings, Cheney is likely to be questioned about his prolific public  statements and writings defending the prerogatives of the executive branch as  well has his many votes on defense-related issues in the House.  </P> <P> Just last year, Cheney voted in favor of spending nearly $5 billion on Reagan's  "Star Wars" nuclear defense system, $650 million to deploy the MX missile on  railroad cars and $350 million for the small intercontinental ballistic missile  known as Midgetman. He also was a staunch advocate of aid to the Nicaraguan  resistance and an outspoken foe of a proposal that would require the President  to inform Congress of all covert actions within 48 hours.  </P> <P> Many Democratic members of the Armed Services Committee, as well as at least  one Republican, Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.), are on record favoring the  48-hour provision, which passed the Senate last year but was never brought up  for a vote in the House. Cheney's opposition to it is consistent with his  often-expressed view that Congress imposes too many constraints on the  President.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Favors Discretion  </P> <P> Cheney has argued that the 48-hour rule is part of a "never-again" philosophy  adopted by many members of Congress in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair. He  has described it as "fatally flawed" because it would "deprive future  presidents of all possible discretion under conditions Congress cannot possibly  foresee."  </P> <P> As a member of the Iran-Contra investigating committee, Cheney generally  defended the Reagan Administration while acknowledging that mistakes were made  by Reagan. A former White House chief of staff during the Gerald R. Ford  Administration, he said he was not troubled by Lt. Col. Oliver L. North's  shredding of documents because all top officials destroyed sensitive documents.  </P> <P> Although the issue of Cheney's support for Contra aid will probably be explored  by the Armed Services Committee, it may not be dwelt upon in the hearings since  the President has indicated that he has no plans to revive military assistance  in the near future.  </P> <P> On "Star Wars,"the Strategic Defense Initiative, Cheney voted last year for an  unsuccessful amendment to increase spending for development of the system to  $4.9 billion in the current fiscal year -- only $400 million more than was  authorized by the Senate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposes Funds Limit  </P> <P> But he opposed a successful amendment by Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. (D-S.C.)  specifying that no more than 40% of the funds authorized for SDI could be used  to develop a so-called "phase one," using existing technology, for deployment  as early as the 1990s.  </P> <P> Cheney also supported a defeated proposal authored by then-Rep. Jack Kemp  (R-N.Y.) to require the Pentagon to map out a plan for developing an accidental  launch protection system that would include two ground-based anti-missile sites  as well as space-based components. While no similar plan was offered in the  Senate, Nunn has recently advocated redirecting SDI research to produce a  system to guard against accidental launch.  </P> <P> One major issue facing Cheney as defense secretary is to allocate current  funding between the MX rail garrison system supported strongly by conservative  Republicans and the Midgetman favored by liberal Democrats. On this issue, his  voting record provides no clear indication how he would settle the issue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Supports MX Funding  </P> <P> While Cheney voted last year against a proposal by Rep. John G. Rowland  (R-Conn.) to eliminate funding for the Midgetman, he nonetheless did support an  amendment by Rep. William L. Dickinson (R-Ala.) intended to increase MX funding  at the expense of the Midgetman program.  </P> <P> At the time, Cheney was quoted as accusing liberals of favoring Midgetman only  as a part of a strategy to block deployment of any new strategic weapons. "Some  of our colleagues never support the deployment of any additional capability on  the grounds that there will always be something better in the future," he said.  </P> <P> After voting for many of these amendments, Cheney last year voted against the  overall House legislation authorizing $299.5 billion for the Pentagon during  the current fiscal year. He offered no explanation for his vote.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Cesar Gaviria bid the Armed Forces  farewell yesterday during a ceremony marking the 87th  anniversary of the Jose Maria Cordoba Military School for  Cadets. During the ceremony, the Army promoted 140 new officers.    Gaviria said in his speech "this ceremony holds a special  meaning for me, as it is the last chance I will have to address  you and share a moment such as this. Through the School for  Cadets we honor the Armed Forces as the guardians of democracy  and human rights."    The president briefly summarized the government's strategy  for strengthening the public forces and justice system. He said  new recourses, such as the new constitutional guarantee  procedure [tutela] and others recently put into effect by the  Prosecutor General's Office and the People's Prosecutor  [Defensoria del Pueblo] demonstrate the government's pro-human  rights efforts.    "Application of international humanitarian law, as expressed  specifically in the Constitution, and the country's resulting  obligation to abide by such laws are other encouraging signs in  the quest for respect for human rights."    Gaviria said the two stages of the government's national  strategy against violence have sought to strengthen justice,  fight impunity, and pave the way for democratic participation.    "Of course, the high crime rate," Gaviria said, "the degree  of impunity, and the current level of poverty are factors that  worry the community in general, especially the government."    The president concluded by praising the Armed Forces and  their individual commanders for their work during the elections  on 29 May.</p>

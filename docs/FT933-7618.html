			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / People: 'One-company man' for Courtaulds Textiles On August 19 1963 Noel Jervis walked through the door of Courtaulds to start his first day's work with the company as an apprentice accountant. Diligence clearly pays off. Yesterday, 30 years to the day, Jervis, who will be 49 on December 25, was formally hailed as chief executive in waiting of Courtaulds Textiles. He takes over on January 1 next year, when Martin Taylor heads off for Barclays Bank. Jervis says Taylor 'will be a desperately hard act to follow, since not only is he a thoroughly decent chap, but he is also a man capable of searching conversations and unafraid of taking tough decisions'. Having been with Courtaulds throughout his career, Jervis - 'I regard myself as the archetypal one-company man' - believes that his experience of the company from the bottom up means that he has a feel for the organisation. In 1980 he was appointed finance director of Courtaulds Fabric Group and from 1982 was chairman of the group's overseas fabrics business. In 1988 he gave up the post of finance director of Courtaulds Textiles Group to concentrate on the international business. Courtaulds Textiles has more than 20,000 employees, but Jervis says he has neither a lump in the throat nor butterflies in the stomach at the prospect of the move. His background he regards as 'solidly working class'; his father was a miner in the South Wales coalfields at the age of 14. As for what changes he may make, Jervis feels the need to tread carefully and soundly. 'The City view seems to be to expect us to do something big, but we are in a long race, not a 100 yard sprint,' he says.</p>

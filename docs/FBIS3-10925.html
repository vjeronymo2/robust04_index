On 24 February the National Police presented to the press 23  Shining Path "terrorists" who operated in several provinces of  Ancash Department. They had perpetrated nearly 50 attacks and  selective crimes against civilian authorities over the past few  months. They were arrested after a thorough investigation  conducted over six months by authorities in the many shantytowns  of Callejon de Huaylas and Conchucos, and in the Lima provinces  of Huaura and Barranca. The forces seized a large amount of  explosives, weapons, subversive propaganda, and maps of various  public buildings used in attacking civilian authorities in  Chavin Region.

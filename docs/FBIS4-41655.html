			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 24 June TASS -- Russian and  Moldovan secret services should pool their efforts against  criminal activities that threaten the safety of Russian and  Moldovan citizens, Moldovan National Security Minister Vasile  Calmoi said here today before signing the treaty on cooperation  with the Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence Service.    Service head Sergey Stepashin arrived in Kishinev today on  an  official visit.    The treaty provides for information exchange and interaction  of the Russian and Moldovan secret services against terrorism,  contraband, illicit arms sales, drug trafficking. The two  services will also prevent attempts of citizens of third states  to use Russian and Moldovan territories for illegal transit.    The sides take an obligation not to carry out force or  subversive actions against each other. In the words of Calmoi,  Moldova and Russia have signed similar agreements with the  Ukrainian Secret Service.    The treaty is another proof that Russian secret services  plan  no subversive actions against Kishinev, a representative of the  Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence Service's delegation told  ITAR-TASS. Russia keeps to unconditional recognition of  independence and territorial integrity of Moldova.    Speaking of the Trans-Dniester problem, the official said it  "should be settled only peacefully and the Federal  Counter-Intelligence Service will help it with all legal means."    Stepashin and Calmoi will leave for the Trans-Dniester  region  on Saturday to visit Russian troops stationed in the area.</p>

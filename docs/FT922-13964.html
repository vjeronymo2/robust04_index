			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Stubborn polls deny a breakthrough FROM SHADOW Budgets to soapboxes, spectacular rallies to lavish political broadcasts, the leading parties have tried everything they know. But opinion polls, for the most part, have been stubbornly unmoved through four weeks of intensive campaigning. Labour has consolidated and arguably widened the narrow lead it held when Mr John Major named the day from the steps of Downing Street on March 11. But neither of the leading parties has sustained anything resembling a decisive breakthrough. If there has been a pronounced trend, it has favoured the Liberal Democrats, whose support has climbed to a 19-20 per cent plateau from 15-16 per cent a month ago. This improvement seemed to stem from the 'war of Jennifer's ear', when their two rivals became embroiled in an unseemly slanging match in the wake of a controversial Labour broadcast on health on March 24. As his opponents argued, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, made a dignified bid for the moral high ground. There was one day when Labour thought it had made a breakthrough: Tuesday, March 31, when three polls put the party ahead of the Tories by between four and seven points. More recent polls have, however, resumed the less decisive pattern evident early in the campaign, averaging out at a Labour lead of between two and three points. Though the Tories have not regained the 39 per cent support level around which they oscillated for the first two weeks of the campaign, Labour support has appeared to seep away to the Liberal Democrats in almost equal measure, leaving the gap between the two leading parties little changed.</p>

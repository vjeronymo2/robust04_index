			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / International Company News: Porsche falls to DM2m at halfway PORSCHE, the German maker of expensive sports cars which has been beset by controversy over management appointments and the role of its controlling family shareholders, made almost no profit in the first half of this financial year. Pre-tax profits had slumped from DM65m to DM2m (Dollars 1.2m), Mr Arno Bohn, chief executive, told the annual meeting yesterday. He said Porsche expected to make a profit for the full year ending July 1992, but warned of the risks that could stem from high claims in the coming wage round. Nor did he have any hope to offer about the near future. 'There are no signs of economic turnround in the US or other important export markets,' Mr Bohn said. He expected group turnover this year to drop to around DM2.5bn, 20 per cent less than in 1990-91. Despite the problems surrounding the company, its management and the supervisory board (representing the Porsche and Piech families and employees), the annual meeting was a fairly low-key affair. Shareholder criticism was occasionally sharp but without rancour. The family members on the non-executive supervisory board kept silent. Mr Bohn himself made no comment on the recent tussle with the supervisory board, which first failed to confirm him in office and then, after he threatened to resign, gave him a three-year contract renewal. However, representatives of preference stockholders - the two families hold all the voting shares - criticised the 12-man non-executive board, especially the five family members, for allegedly having dented the company's image by their indecision and willingness to leak details of boardroom policy. Mr Werner Futter, representing a small shareholder association, said the resultant publicity had harmed the Porsche marque and was bad for employee motivation. 'We never want to experience this again,' he declared. Shareholders clapped, and Mr Walther Zugel, a local banker who spoke on behalf of the supervisory board, of which he is a member, remarked: 'I assume from the clapping that you have scored a bull's-eye.' Mr Bohn admitted this month that the company's image had not been helped by a series of management departures. The latest has just occurred in the US, where the president of Porsche Cars North America resigned over unspecified policy differences. It is in the US that Porsche has suffered most demand weakness. Sales there in the first six months fell 54 per cent to 1,800 cars. Other export sales were down by 38 per cent to 3,700 cars, while those in Germany rose by 20 per cent to 5,050. Total half-year turnover was 23 per cent lower at DM1.1bn. Mr Bohn pointed out, however, that Porsche's new 968 four-cylinder model (priced from DM92,000) had only been fully available since December and the eight-cylinder 928GTS (DM159,000) from January. Porsche was continuing its cost and staff reductions which would allow it to break even on sales of 21,000 cars a year against 28,000 in 1989-90.</p>

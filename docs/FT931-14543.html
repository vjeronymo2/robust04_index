			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Management: Delivering the goods - Andrew Baxter says centralised distribution may not always make sense in the single market LONG BEFORE the European single market came into being, companies adapted manufacturing strategies to anticipate the new conditions. But it was soon clear that making such strategies work depended on the ability to deliver the goods. Logistics - the fine art of warehousing and distribution management - has a special significance in the single market. Over the past five years, the more forward-looking companies have asked themselves what kind of distribution chain they need to serve customers across continental Europe in the most cost-efficient way and have acted accordingly. The conventional view was that companies would reduce the number of warehouses in Europe, moving from a national structure to a regional approach or even a central warehouse. That view still holds good. But there is evidence that some companies are becoming aware of the dangers of over-centralising and are rethinking their European logistics strategies. Getting logistics right is probably harder than sorting out a manufacturing strategy. For every company there are one or more different solutions - it all depends on what you are producing, where your customers are and how you want to serve them, says David Ecklund, European commercial manager for Caterpillar Logistics Services. A report due next month from the Illinois-based Council of Logistics Management says that some companies have recognised that their initial attempts at logistics restructuring in Europe may have been too aggressive. The report, co-ordinated by Kevin O'Loughlin, a partner in Andersen Consulting's logistics strategy practice, and James Cooper, director of the Cranfield Centre for Logistics and Transportation, says the conventional wisdom that centralised warehousing is the optimal form of integration in Europe must be challenged. Moreover, it says, the diverse market characteristics in Europe, as well as the varying degrees of market penetration, are not well served by a uniform, homogeneous logistics strategy. 'Centralisation does rely on product standardisation in both the formulation and packaging,' says Cooper. This view is confirmed by other European logistics experts. Joachim Miebach, founder of Frankfurt-based logistics consultancy Miebach &amp; Partner, says some of the initial enthusiasm about central warehousing has waned, as it was found not to be feasible. 'The big hindrance is national peculiarities,' he says. 'They have not disappeared.' For example, many companies thought they would be able to introduce product labels with as many as five languages on each, but they are still having to produce different versions for each national market, The report also says that growing road congestion is confounding manufacturers' abilities to provide speedy deliveries to some parts of Europe from a single site. Even so, O'Loughlin points out that some companies are still happy to have one central warehouse for Europe. He cites the example of Becton Dickinson, the US medical and diagnostic products group, which is moving to a single distribution site outside Brussels from 22 sites around Europe. On the other hand, a large consumer packaged goods company included in the council report said it had decided to move to a single distribution site but would have to modify the plan. Having closed warehouses in Italy, it now believed it needed a warehouse in southern Europe to ensure it could serve customers there properly. Fortunately, few companies built one central warehouse for their entire European business because they realised it would not work. Instead, they are using centralised distribution as one element of a diverse logistics package and are adopting centralised logistics management for a handful of regional warehouses. This is the approach at Whirlpool, the world's largest white goods group, which is expanding fast in Europe following its takeover of the Philips large domestic appliance business. The company has reduced its warehouses from 45 in 1985 to 16 and aims to end up with six or seven, says Ugo Simonelli, Whirlpool Europe's logistics chief. With relatively high transport costs for white goods, Whirlpool aims to keep its products travelling in one direction and it would not have made sense to have had a single warehouse for goods coming from several manufacturing sites in Europe. On the other hand, spare parts distribution is being concentrated on one or two warehouses. A mixed approach is also being adopted at SKF, the Swedish roller bearings group. The company, which Miebach has been advising for the past 15 years, is preparing the ground for a new centralised warehouse in Belgium which was to have supplied all customers. Instead, SKF will now supply automotive customers directly from its factories and use the warehouse for deliveries to dealers. One of the most important messages from logistics experts to companies considering changing their logistics structure for the single market is not to lose flexibility by blindly pursuing the economies of scale which integration provides. Consequently, in industries where the eventual level of product harmonisation is hard to predict, companies are being advised to use third-party distributors rather than invest heavily in capital-intensive warehousing which they may later regret. This is providing unexpectedly good opportunities for sophisticated third-party companies such as CLS. O'Loughlin cites one client, a leading US supplier of medical products, which has traditionally used its own warehouse facilities and storage retrieval systems. 'One of our key suggestions was to rethink that, to use more third-party distributors so that it could remain flexible and adaptive - then begin investing in its own infrastructure once the market environment stabilises.' Whatever happens to the central warehouse ideal, it is clear that the logistical restructuring of Europe has only just begun. Many companies have shrunk from reorganising their distribution, either because they were not sure how 'single' the single market would be, or because they have been wary of restructuring a function that historically has been closely allied with national sales and marketing outlets. But, as the council study says, most managers express little doubt that logistics restructuring will occur, sooner or later.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Lenders forecast housing recovery A housing-market recovery next year, in spite of factors such as reduced real incomes because of tax increases, is forecast today by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, Alison Smith writes. The council, which represents building societies and centralised lenders such as banks, says the stabilising of house prices and the likelihood of a small rise next year, with the reduction in negative equity and better employment prospects, will boost confidence. It believes these will outweigh elements such as the fall in mortgage interest tax relief and the greater expense of becoming an owner-occupier.</p>

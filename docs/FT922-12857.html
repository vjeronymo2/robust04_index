			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (2): Safety and security - Banking EVERY morning a fleet of shiny Mercedes pour over the Italian frontier into Monaco to deposit their fur-clad passengers into the Louis XV restaurant of the Hotel de Paris for lunch. These rich Italians are the bread and butter of Monaco's banks. For, after lunching at the Louis XV and shopping at Louis Vuitton, they then pop into their banks to check on their tax-free deposits. 'High net worth individuals are what banking in Monaco is all about,' said one local financier. 'The tax advantages are important, of course, but there is also the ambience. These people are too frightened to walk around Torino or Milano. They can't wear their furs. They can't park their cars. Here they feel safe. They could walk around in their jewels all day if they wanted to.' So far the banks have thrived on Monaco's appeal to this wealthy clientele. Business had always been buoyant for the Monegasque banks, but for the past five years, ever since the French government removed exchange controls and their customers could move money in and out more freely, they have flourished. The value of deposits lodged in Monaco is believed to have risen by between 20 and 25 per cent a year throughout the late 1980s and mustered growth of just under 20 per cent to about Dollars 10bn last year. Ten years ago there were 20 banks in the principality, now there are nearly 40. The only recent casualties have been Chase Manhattan, which closed its Monaco office as part of its internal restructuring and the local branch of BCCI. 'In difficult times people look for safety and security from their investments,' said Mr Yves Max, director-general of Credit Foncier de Monaco, a subsidiary of Suez, the French financial group, and the principality's biggest single bank. 'Even 1991, a dreadful year for banks in other countries, wasn't too bad for Monaco.' Most of the Monegasque banks are subsidiaries or affiliates of international groups, mainly of the big French banks such as Suez, Paribas, Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale - although Italian, British and, to a lesser extent, American banks are also present. The bigger banks operate as retail banks for residents and are also involved in advising and financing local businesses, mainly in the property industry. There are some local investment institutions, notably the Monaco Treasury, Societe des Bains de Mer, the state-controlled hotel and casino group, and a handful of small pension funds. But the bulk of their business is in dealing with wealthy private clients. These clients are undoubtedly attracted by Monaco's tax system where everyone, except the French, is exempt from tax. The French have been taxed on any money deposited in Monaco since 1962 when General de Gaulle, infuriated by the number of rich Frenchmen using Monte Carlo as a tax haven, sent his troops to seal off the border until Prince Rainier agreed to compromise. Monaco is, however, at a disadvantage compared to other 'tax havens' such as Luxembourg and Switzerland in that the rules on disclosure are far stricter. The Monegasque government is empowered to demand access to all information on bank accounts. Until recently, the local banks tended to concentrate on customers in neighbouring Italy and North Africa (with which they have long links thanks to France's colonial ties). Now they are looking further afield. Paribas and Credit Foncier both send sales executives to other countries. 'We see northern Europe and the southern Mediterranean as important growth markets,' said Mr Michel de Robillard, director of Credit Foncier. 'We, like the other big Monaco banks, are now much more active at international marketing.' The critical question for the Monegasque financial community is how it will develop in the future. To some extent this will be determined by the direction of Europe's financial legislation in the post-1992 unified market. The worst possible scenario would be for other European countries to align with France and wipe out the principality's tax exemption. Such a scenario would have dire consequences for the local economy. But luckily for the Monegasques it seems improbable, at least for the foreseeable future. Instead, the banks are more likely to see some moderate reforms in the level of regulation. For operational purposes, the Monaco banks come under the joint jurisdiction of the French and Monegasque authorities. They follow French banking regulations and all securities dealings come under the scrutiny of the Parisian stock market authorities. This system is designed to enable the Monegasque government to strike the delicate balance between making Monaco flexible enough to attract investors without scaring them away - and attracting the wrath of the French authorities - with scandals. Most of the time the system works. 'People play by the rules,' said Mr Joseph Sauzier, director of Societe Generale's Monaco operations. 'After all, it is in our interest to do so. The bigger banks here all belong to large financial groups with tight management and financial controls.' But from time to time things go wrong as illustrated by the collapse two years ago of Banque Industrielle de Monaco, the principality's sole surviving fully independent bank. The murky details of BIM's demise - from the suicide of one senior executive, to the arrest of another and the discovery that it made a great deal of money from bearer deposit notes held by Monegasques as 'cats' paws' for tax-dodging French citizens - fulfilled the financial sector's worst fears of a local scandal. Bigger banks admit, privately at least, to being terrified of another BIM-style collapse. The authorities are already tightening up some areas of banking regulation although Mr Jean Pastorelli, counsellor to the government for finance, insists this has nothing to do with BIM's demise. Legislation is under way to make Monaco's laws on money-laundering the same as those of France. Other reforms are in the pipeline. In the meantime, Monaco's financial community is looking forward to a prosperous future. 'There are now nearly 40 banks here employing around 1,200 people,' said Mr Gilles Trousseau, director of Paribas. 'But there is lots more potential. There is no reason why we shouldn't have 50 or 60 banks with 2,000 employees.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Qiao Shi at the Fifth Meeting of the Eighth </F> National People's Congress, NPC, Standing Committee on 29  December 1993]    [Text] Beijing, 29 Dec (XINHUA) -- Dear deputy chairmen  and committee members:    After 10 days' hard work, we have completed all scheduled  tasks. The meeting has heard expositions and opinions on a total  of 11 draft laws and draft legal decisions. After making  earnest deliberations, we have adopted resolutions on four laws  and relevant legal issues. While holding the meeting, we have  also attended the commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth  centenary. The adopted Company Law is a very important law in a  socialist market economy. Its formulation and implementation  will be a major event in the development of China's legal  system. The law has an important significance in specifying the  legal status of companies which are the main bodies of a market,  in regulating a company's organizations and behavior, in  establishing a modern enterprise system, and in enhancing the  healthy development of a socialist market economy. The meeting's  adoption of the Draft Amendment to the Accountants Law and the  decision on the applicability of relevant interim taxation  regulations to foreign-funded and foreign-owned enterprises will  play an important role in improving the legal system governing  accountants and the taxation system, in protecting the market's  economic order, and in improving China's investment environment.  The meeting has adopted a decision to submit the Draft Budget  Law to the Second Session of the Eighth NPC for deliberation.  It has preliminarily deliberated the Draft Foreign Trade Law,  the Draft Law on Protecting Taiwan Compatriots' Investments, the  Draft Law on Eugenic and Health Care, and the Draft Provisions  on Severely Punishing Criminals Who Organize and Smuggle People  Across China's Borders. It has also heard a report on opinions  concerning the Draft Securities Law. Furthermore, the meeting  has heard and deliberated the State Council's reports on the  work regarding economic relations and trade with foreign  countries; on improving the safety and work of civil aviation;  and on inspecting the implementation of the Decision on  Punishing Crimes of Production and Sales of Fake and Shoddy  Commodities.    The meeting has adopted a decision to hold the Second  Session  of the Eighth NPC. We have over two months before the Second  Session of the Eighth NPC is held on 10 March 1994, and we  should do earnest and down-to-earth preparatory work. We must  be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line; strive to make the forthcoming session a meeting of  democracy and unity, as well as a meeting to seek truth, and  discuss practical problems, opening up, and forging ahead; and  further mobilize people of various nationalities across China to  make concerted efforts and seize opportunities to accelerate the  pace of reform and opening up and bring about sustained, rapid,  and healthy development of the national economy.    The year 1993 is approaching its end. Through our joint  efforts since the First Session of the Eighth NPC was held in  March 1993, the NPC Standing Committee has made considerable  progress in economic legislation. We have made 16 decisions on  formulating and amending laws, and on adopting relevant legal  issues; 12 of them concerning socialist market economy issues.  We are intensifying the inspection and supervision of law  enforcement. The NPC Standing Committee and various special  committees have successively sent out 33 law-enforcement  inspection teams to check the implementation of 18 laws and  decisions, and the inspections had a certain effect. Our work in  other aspects has also produced good results.    The year 1994, which is approaching soon, will be one in  which we shall face more concentrated tasks of reform and must  implement in an all-round way the "Decision on Certain Issues  Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy" made  by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee.  All reform measures that we take will be of vital importance,  and therefore they require that we be meticulous and act with  caution. We must succeed in their implementation; we cannot  afford to fail. Our fundamental method is to base our work on  the interests of the masses and to win their understanding and  support. We must make the masses really understand that  successful implementation of these reform measures are, in the  final analysis, beneficial to them and conducive to accelerating  economic development and to improving the people's living  standards. In this connection, it is necessary for the NPC and  the people's congresses at all levels to look upon expediting  the implementation of various reform measures as their own  tasks, to conduct surveys and study by immersing themselves  among the masses and by going deep into the realities of life,  to listen attentively to the views of the masses, to show  concern for the masses who encounter temporary difficulties, to  take notice of and understand various factors that may possibly  affect social stability and the smooth progress of reform at all  times, and to actively help the putting forward of constructive  views on solving various problems under the leadership of the  party. Meanwhile, they must supervise the implementation of all  reform measures which have been adopted according to the law,  take the initiative in a timely manner to make suggestions on  improving our work, and unite and lead the masses of the people  to successfully fulfill our reform tasks during the whole year.    In 1994, the people's congress standing committees must  continue to place legislation and, in particular, economic  legislation at the top of their agenda. They must make efforts  to closely coordinate legislative work with the steps of reform  and use laws to guide, promote, and protect reform in accordance  with the requirements set by the "decision" of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. They must in a  timely manner sum up the experiences gained from implementing  adopted reform measures, and they must finalize and standardize  them by using as many legal forms as possible. They must make a  clear distinction between the order of importance and urgency of  the laws to be made next year, make proper arrangements, and  create the laws that are badly needed ahead of other laws. For  example, laws on finance, banking, bank bills, and securities  are more urgent than others, and close attention should be paid  to their legislation.    To carry out major legislative work in a planned way and to  enable a framework of the legal system for a socialist market  economy to evolve during the current tenure of the people's  congresses, the [NPC] Standing Committee is mapping out a five-  year legislation plan and is taking vigorous steps to this end.  The five years are an important period for China to accelerate  the establishment of a socialist market economy; all fields of  endeavor call for the formulation of a number of laws. A  legislation plan must be based on the Constitution; it must take  into consideration both the possibilities of the realities and  the objective needs of reform, opening up, and modernization;  and it must make the focal points stand out while giving  consideration to other points. The current [people's congress]  standing committees must treat as their primary task the effort  to formulate the laws on standardizing the main part of the  market, maintaining market order, strengthening macroeconomic  regulation and control, and improving the social security  system. Meanwhile, they must also make arrangements for the  legislation of the laws on strengthening the building of  socialist democracy, improving the system for the organization  of state organs, punishing criminals for various criminal  activities, maintaining social order; promoting the development  of education, science, and culture; protecting our environment,  and strengthening the national defense buildup. In addition,  they must amend or abolish at the right moment laws incompatible  with the establishment of a socialist market economy. It is  necessary for all departments to make concerted efforts and to  coordinate closely with each other to map out a legislative  plan. The people's congress standing committees must strengthen  guidance for legislative work and work successfully in  coordinating and supervising the drafting of laws under the  unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee. We definitely  must acquire a new concept compatible with the socialist market  economy, conduct intensive study of the new situations and new  problems existing in the realities of life, boldly explore and  practice, and solve the difficulties and problems encountered in  legislation with the spirit of reform so that legislation can  catch up with the pace of reform and opening up.    After a law is enacted, it must be resolutely implemented.  The failure to implement an enacted law is tantamount to the  nonexistence of the law. The basic principle of our socialist  legal system is to have laws, abide by the law, strictly enforce  the law, and see to it that violators of the law are punished.  To ensure a sound legal system, none of these four links are  dispensable. Because China has a history of several thousand  years of feudal society, people have a relatively weak sense of  law. Some comrades are accustomed to relying on administrative  means to manage economic and social affairs, and they do not  attach sufficient importance to the role of the law. Some of  them even abuse power and openly violate the law merely to  benefit their own localities, departments, or organizations.  Such a practice is incompatible with the establishment of a  socialist market economy. So, we must not only pay attention to  legislation. We must also attach great importance to  implementing laws and ensure that everything is done strictly  according to the law. Great efforts should be made to improve  the situation of some departments, cadres and, people who "know  nothing about the law, know about it but fail to implement it at  all, or fail to implement it strictly." Comrade Xiaoping has  pointed out that an important thing in strengthening the legal  system is to carry out education, and it is necessary to enhance  the sense of law among the people. We should strive to  publicize the law and make it known to as many people as  possible. Television and radio stations, newspapers, journals,  and other media should make it their day-to-day important work  to publicize the law. All departments and localities should  persistently publicize the legal system to educate the cadres  and the people, and to increase their sense of law and their  ability to act according to the law. It is necessary to  establish the authority of the PRC Constitution and other laws  in society, and to ensure that the Constitution and other laws  are implemented to the letter. Leading organs and leading  cadres in particular should take the lead in studying,  understanding, and abiding by the law, and know how to manage  economic and social affairs according to the law. It is also  necessary to keep improving the judicial system and the  administration's law-enforcement mechanisms, and to raise the  standards of both. The people's congress standing committees at  all levels should attach importance to inspecting and  supervising the implementation of laws. The stress of the  inspection for a period to come should be placed on major issues  concerning reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, as  well as the issues about which the people have strong  complaints. More attention should be paid to inspecting and  supervising the implementation of the laws concerning the  socialist market economy and striving to improve the results of  inspection. If any problem is discovered, the departments  concerned should be urged to resolve it seriously so as to win  the people's trust. In short, we should conscientiously carry  out the duties bestowed on us by the PRC Constitution and other  laws. We should work in a down-to-earth way to make greater  progress in promoting the socialist democracy and legal system.  I hope that our comrades will make their due contributions  during the struggle waged by the whole party and the people  across the country to win new victories in reform and  construction next year.    Last, because New Year's Day is just around the corner, I  would like to take this opportunity to say Happy New Year to  you. Thank you.</p>

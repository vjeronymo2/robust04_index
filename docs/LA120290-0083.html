			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC PARAMETERS: CHINA  </P> <P> "In the gulf crisis, the U.S.A. has the initiative to choose between war and  peace. This is not only because the U.S.A. has the strongest military strength  in the world, and has placed the largest number of troops in the gulf, but also  because the U.S.A. claims that it has to shoulder the duty as a 'policeman of  the world.'  </P> <P> However, since numerous uncertain factors exist, it is, in fact, not completely  up to the U.S.A. to choose between war and peace. First, the main objective of  the U.S. troops in the gulf is to pose a strategic threat, exert a military  pressure, try to force Iraq out of Kuwait and overcome Saddam's regime.  </P> <P>  -- Li Qinggong, writing in Liaowang magazine.  </P></p>

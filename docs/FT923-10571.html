			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin America Debt Crisis: Chronolgy of events - 1982-1985 / Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt? 1982 MEXICO, facing foreign borrowing requirement of more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.4bn) for the year, raises Dollars 5bn in first quarter, although at higher interest rates than previously. Outflow of dollars prompts several sharp devaluations of peso during year. Inflation accelerates rapidly and oil revenues decline. April - Argentina's invasion of Falkland Islands provokes conflict with Britain and slows new lending to Latin America. Mexico draws on swap line with US Federal Reserve and meets difficulties in arranging loans from banks. August - Mexico introduces exchange controls, seeks emergency finance from US and international financial institutions. On August 20 finance minister meets creditor banks in New York and announces three-month moratorium on Dollars 10bn of debt principal repayments. Central banks agree Dollars 1.85bn emergency loan to Mexico 'to ensure continued smooth functioning of the international financing system'. US provides Dollars 2bn credit. Mexico to seek International Monetary Fund and bank loans. Creditor banks form advisory committee chaired by Citibank. September - Mexico nationalises banks and imposes total exchange control. Central bank heads consider Latin American payment problems. One says: 'To say that we are concerned could be an understatement.' International Monetary Fund and World Bank hold annual meetings in Toronto in atmosphere of panic. October - Brazil arranges emergency short-term bank loan, sells gold. November - IMF managing director Jacques de Larosiere tells bank chairmen he expects them to make new Dollars 5bn loan to Mexico and Dollars 1.5bn loan to Argentina, to support economic policies under International Monetary Fund programmes. December - Banks commit to Mexico loan. Brazil arranges Dollars 1.5bn in emergency loans from US and says it will seek new 'jumbo' bank loan. But, as year ends, Brazil also halts repayment of debt principal. 1983 January - Pattern emerges for handling LDC debt problems. Key elements are: IMF-agreed economic programme and IMF loan, rescheduling of some debt principal repayments to banks and governments, and large new loans. This involves close co-operation among debtors, international institutions and creditors. Packages under way for Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Yugoslavia and, soon, Chile and Peru contain all these elements. Bridging loans tide borrowers over until the full agreements are signed. February - Brazil signs Dollars 4bn new bank loan and Dollars 4.8bn rescheduling, but suffers severe difficulties in maintaining short-term interbank lines of credit to foreign branches of its banks, a crucial element of financing programme. It misses first-quarter International Monetary Fund economic targets. Interest payment arrears build up to Dollars 2bn by August. Economic programme and rescue package have to be re-drawn. March - Mexico's banks sign Dollars 5bn new loan (agreed in 1982) and, in August, agreements rescheduling Dollars 20bn of debt principal falling due to banks in 1983 and 1984. September - At International Monetary Fund annual meeting, Brazil agrees in principle with creditors on Dollars 11bn rescue package involving Dollars 6.5bn new bank loan, rescheduling of debts falling due up to the end of 1984. Leading creditor banks and central bankers embark on successful worldwide 'roadshow' to persuade other creditor banks to join the deal. Brazil begins to reduce interest arrears. 1984 Argentina builds up interest arrears of Dollars 2.7bn by end-March. Impasse in Argentina's negotiations with IMF and banks means US banks must count loans as 'non-performing' for first time in debt crisis. June - Banks agree in principle to provide 'multi-year rescheduling agreement' (Myra) for Mexico, lowering interest rates on rescheduled debt and stretching out six years' maturities, totalling Dollars 48bn. Poland signs Myra in July. In September Venezuela agrees in principle on Dollars 21bn Myra. In December Argentina agrees in principle on Dollars 14bn Myra and agrees to cut interest arrears, and International Monetary Fund endorses economic programme. 1985 International Monetary Fund suspends loans to Brazil and Argentina as economic targets missed. In negotiation of new targets, Brazil seeks greater flexibility from International Monetary Fund - but in August finance minister and central bank governor resign in frustration over lack of economic austerity policies, and government embarks on expansionist approach. Peru announces unilateral limit on debt service payments: 10 per cent of export receipts. Argentina agrees new economic stabilisation package with International Monetary Fund as inflation reaces 1,000 per cent. In July, Mexico introduces new austerity package as oil revenues drop and misses International Monetary Fund targets. In September, earthquakes devastate Mexico City. Brazil seeks International Monetary Fund 'monitoring of economy' rather than full agreement. September - At International Monetary Fund annual meeting in Seoul, US treasury secretary James Baker unveils new approach to debt, known as Programme for Sustained Growth or Baker Plan. Key elements are: Economic reform by debtor countries to promote growth and balance of payments adjustment, and to reduce inflation. Increased structural adjustment lending by multilateral development banks as well as continued central role for IMF. Increased lending by commercial banks: net new lending of Dollars 20bn over next three years to heavily indebted middle-income countries. Maintenance of case-by-case approach to debtors. Larger debtors and creditors give qualified support to Baker Plan. Chronology of events: 1986-1992 1986 June - Mexican finance minister Jesus Silva Herzog resigns as oil revenues drop and economy worsens. In July his successor Gustavo Petricioli agrees growth-oriented economic programme with International Monetary Fund, clearing the way for negotiations with banks. At International Monetary Fund annual meeting, a year after Baker Plan announced, banks and Mexico agree in principle on Dollars 7.7bn new loan and Dollars 54bn loan rescheduling, first under the plan, with 20-year maturity and 13/16 percentage point interest margin - seen as too concessional by some banks. By December banks' commitments to loan are sufficient to put the International Monetary Fund's rescue package into effect. 1987 February - Brazil halts interest payments on Dollars 68bn of debt to banks. April - Argentina agrees with banks in principle on Baker Plan deal for new loan and Dollars 24bn rescheduling on terms similar to Mexico's. Package features first 'menu of options,' including chance for banks to convert loans into 'exit' bonds. May - Citicorp, biggest lender to third world, adds Dollars 3bn to loan loss reserves and says it will seek to 'liquefy' third world loan portfolio by selling loans and using instruments such as debt/equity swaps. Its share price rises. Other US banks follow with similar loss provisions. August - Bank of England issues guidelines to UK banks on loss provisions. September - Brazil proposes to convert Dollars 34bn of bank debt into securities, taking advantage of discount at which loans trade in secondary market. It is rebuffed by Mr Baker. He proposes new International Monetary Fund funding facility to compensate debtors for unforeseen shocks which could undermine Fund programmes. November - Brazil and banks reach interim agreement to end halt in interest payments. Brazil agrees to seek accord with Fund on economic programme. December - Mexico and J P Morgan, the US bank, announce innovative plan to retire Dollars 20bn of debt in exchange for securities with principal backed by US zero coupon Treasury bonds held by Mexico. Banks invited to tender loans competitively - those putting the highest discount on their loans to win bonds. 1988 March - Mexican exchange auction results in issue of only Dollars 2.5bn of bonds in exchange for Dollars 3.6bn of bank debt, an average discount of 33 per cent. Brazil holds first debt-for-equity auction. June - Brazil's creditor banks agree in principle on Dollars 5.2bn loan and Dollars 61bn rescheduling. October - US makes Dollars 3.5bn emergency loan to Mexico, again suffering liquidity problems following drop in oil price. 1989 March - US Treasury secretary Nicholas Brady announces controversial 'suggestions' on debt problems, dubbed the Brady Plan. Key new element embraces concept of allowing debtors, provided they pursue approved economic policies, to reduce outstanding debt. However, this should be on a voluntary basis for creditors - along lines of Mexico/Morgan offer. International Monetary Fund, industrialised countries and leading bankers give debt relief qualified backing. July - Mexico and banks agree first Brady Plan deal covering Dollars 52bn of debt, including options for banks to exchange loans for collateralised floating rate bonds at a 35 per cent discount, exchange loans for bonds of same par value but lower fixed interest rate, or advance new money to finance Mexico's interest payments. September - J P Morgan adds Dollars 2bn to loan loss reserves, bringing them to a level equalling its medium- and long-term lending to countries which have restructured debts. It says increase reflects rising expectations about the size of debt reductions possible under Brady initiative. Its share price rises. US President George Bush appeals to banks to support Brady Plan. November - UK banks increase provisions against third world debt losses. Lloyds Bank says 15 of 29 problem countries are not paying interest and that it has made 100 per cent provisions for more than half of the 29. Peru, which had cut itself off from the International Monetary Fund and built up Dollars 800m of arrears to the Fund, agrees to resume payments to International Monetary Fund and accept economic programme. 1990 Of Mexico's creditor banks, 49 per cent choose to exchange Dollars 22bn of debt for lower interest, fixed-rate bonds of same face value, and 41 per cent choose to exchange Dollars 20bn of debt for floating-rate bonds at 35 per cent discount to face value, saving Mexico a total of Dollars 1.3bn per year. Costa Rica, the Philippines, Uruguay and Venezuela agree Brady debt reduction deals. 1991 April - Brazil reaches preliminary agreement on settling Dollars 8bn of interest arrears to banks. September - International Monetary Fund approves Peru economic programme. October - Mexico's Nafinsa issues 10-year Eurobond, longest maturity for Latin American capital market issue since debt crisis began. 1992 April - Argentina reaches outline agreement on Brady deal covering Dollars 23bn of debt and Dollars 8bn of interest arrears. July - Brazil reaches outline deal on Brady deal covering Dollars 44bn of debt. Brady says after Brazil agreement that more than 90 per cent of the commercial bank debt of big debtor countries would be dealt with. He says: 'It represents a milestone in finally putting the Latin American debt crisis behind us.'</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Problems in the pipeline: The challenges facing British Gas as it wrestles with regulation and increased competition For Mr Robert Evans, the deal signed last week in Kazakhstan jointly to exploit one of the world's biggest oil and gas fields marks a Dollars 3bn step towards his vision of building British Gas into a world-class energy business. Closer to home, however, he has less cause for contentment. Mr Evans, the company's chairman and chief executive - although he is expected to relinquish the second part of his title soon - braved Kazakhstan in January to help the deal along. He may think that extracting 20 trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas and 2bn barrels of oil from the vast Karachaganak field is easier than running his business back home. The scouse mechanical engineer, who joined British Gas 40 years ago, believes that Britain's sixth-largest company is being pushed around. Instead of laying pipelines, too much time is devoted to playing politics. His critics say he is not playing the game well. The company's latest advertising campaign, in which the thumbs of actors spontaneously combust as they proclaim the benefits of 'being in control', draws wry smiles from those who believe British Gas has lost its way. Mr Evans, who as a young trainee thought gas works were 'dirty, smelly and exciting', passionately defends his business and his own record. He talks animatedly of 'intelligent pigs', the latest in pipeline monitoring hardware, and about the revolution in gas supplies made possible by plastic piping. His task is to run a highly capital-intensive, technically sophisticated business, while at the same time delivering gas safely to satisfied customers. He delights in reporting that his company's 18m customers now rate British Gas second only to Marks and Spencer for good service. Every complaint is matched by 20 happy customers - a performance Mr Evans says 'really turns me on'. Not everyone, however, is quite so 'turned on' by British Gas. Or by Mr Evans, who some regard more as a gifted engineer than an inspirational boss. He has attracted unwelcome publicity over his Pounds 435,222 annual pay packet and a home crammed with appliances for his family to test. More seriously, Mr Evans is still entangled in an increasingly personalised wrangle over gas prices - 'a 15 per cent cut since privatisation, excluding the latest reduction, is a damn good record for anyone' - with Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas. Sir James is the industry watchdog who bites as well as barks. Mr Evans, who has been heard bellowing 'Good, bloody morning]' on his way out of Sir James's office, says the relationship is 'totally and utterly unproductive'. Sir James's views on his adversary are equally crisp. The atmosphere of sterile hostility, created in the absence of any established, national philosophy on utility regulation, now borders on the absurd. To many British Gas watchers, the future of the company which led former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher's crusade for popular capitalism appears less clear-cut than at any time since it was sold to 4m eager shareholders in 1986. The concern may initially be hard to fathom. Profits after tax in 1991 breached Pounds 1bn and the company now supplies nearly half of all Britain's non-transport energy needs. Last year, the cash-rich business gave the exchequer more than Pounds 556m in corporation tax. This year, British Gas will make at least another Pounds 1bn and will invest nearly Pounds 3bn. With UK gas prices among Europe's lowest, Mr Evans suggests: 'We are very close to the pinnacle in offering an effective, efficient, value-for-money supply of gas to nearly everyone who wants it.' Boosted by the Kazakhstan deal, British Gas shares have outperformed the FT-A All Share Index by 25 per cent since privatisation. But many believe that a less 'wonderfuel' future may await British Gas. If the top team at Rivermill House, the company's Vauxhall Bridge headquarters, saw privatisation as a passport to commercial freedom, they now know they were misguided. British Gas faces a greater degree of intervention in its activities than ever. Mr Evans complains: 'What we never, ever expected was that the goal posts were going to be moved all the time.' A senior colleague told a recent City gathering: 'We can't even locate the playing field.' Once seen as impervious to external influence, the company now struggles with the burden of regulation - in June it had to cut domestic gas prices by 3 per cent under threat of legal action from Sir James. With its industrial and commercial gas businesses being prised open to admit competitors, British Gas is also reluctantly breaking up an integrated structure - jealously guarded and preserved intact at privatisation by hiving off its national pipeline and storage operation for others to use on an equal footing. Given that the domestic gas supply monopoly may also end, profits may no longer pour so easily from pipelines. Mr Evans has said that the will mean higher prices, lower standards of service and less reliable supplies. But he has succumbed to the changes, under threat of a second post-privatisation investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The Office of Fair Trading has been unhappy with attempts by British Gas to fight back by promoting to journalists its own strategic view of its business. Asked to sign an undertaking that it would stop such initiatives, British Gas refused. All of which has left the management, faced with a maturing energy market in the UK, a threat to earnings from regulation and rising competition, seeking a new game plan. To Mr Evans, part of the answer lies increasingly outside the UK, where British Gas profits are quickly rising. But there has been mixed success - winning control of Canada's largest gas distribution business but seeing its ambitions dashed in Spain and New Zealand. One of Britain's most senior exploration men is highly critical: 'Everywhere you go they are bidding ridiculous amounts of money on exploration and production. It smacks of diversification at any cost.' British Gas says this is 'sour grapes' from less fortunate competitors. In spite of the attempt to broaden its horizons, the company is still regarded as being caught permanently on the back foot, unable to pre-empt inevitable changes in its marketplace and not yet convincingly articulating a vision for the future. 'It's like the retreat from Dunkirk, with the high command agonising over what has to be left on the beach and what to try and get on the boats,' says an energy consultant who has had close dealings with British Gas. Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers' Council, claims British Gas failed to comprehend that the greatest challenge to its future was not other energy sources but regulation: 'They have failed to think strategically and are left to knit their brows and wonder why things are happening to them.' According to a former British Gas middle-manager: 'The management is politically naive.' An independent gas company executive suggests: 'British Gas needs someone deeply unpleasant and detached to turn it over. Bob Evans is far too nice a man.' Supporters say he has manfully tackled a series of commercial onslaughts which would have tested the stamina and skills of any chief executive. A colleague claims: 'He has a quick grasp of the issues and a broad vision. What else are we doing in Kazakhstan?' Some of his closest lieutenants, many of them single-function, lifetime gas men unused to thinking beyond their core business, have also been criticised for uninspired leadership. Two recent executive board appointments, however, involving people whose careers were not forged in British Gas, have not dispelled the disenchantment. As it is, Mr Evans is in the hot seat for another two years - although handing over the role of chief executive to Mr Cedric Brown, a senior British Gas board member, is thought to be imminent. All the criticisms encapsulate a general theme: that British Gas has been slow to dump its old state monopoly culture and slow to wake up to the changing world in which it must conduct its business. Mr Evans is defiant: 'We have not needed to change our culture. We were not an extension of the civil service before privatisation. We never went cap in hand for money and have always tried to improve and expand our business. 'We have faced constant intervention ever since the ink dried on the privatisation documents, with 10 major regulatory changes in five years.' Such uncertainty, he says, is destructive. He refuses to apologise if his company ponders on external pronouncements - 'usually heard first on Radio 4' - which may have profound effects on its business. According to Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman: 'The government is trying to create competition artificially instead of regulating the gas industry effectively. The result is a never-ending series of critical interferences which have discouraged it from thinking long term.' Now the company is said to be considering a wholesale break-up of the business, intended to deflect the regulatory onslaught upon it and to enhance the value of an investment which shareholders, so far generally acquiescent, are beginning to question. British Gas plays down the break-up suggestion, but stresses that any financial re-engineering would have to be accompanied by a significant easing of regulatory pressures. Mr Evans explains, with a note of exasperation: 'Our European counterparts regard what is happening to us as one big experiment.' No one, he feels, should mess around with gas unless they know precisely what they are doing.</p>

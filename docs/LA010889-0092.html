			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Detroit Catholics apparently received mixed blessings as the city's archdiocese  began announcing which inner-city parishes would stay open and which would  close. At least a dozen parishes will close by summer, 18 have been designated  as "questionably viable" and were given six months to a year for more study,  three targeted for closing will be kept open, two will be merged with other  churches and two will remain open until their pastors retire. Nearly two dozen  other parishes that did not have Saturday Masses were to learn their fates  today. Cardinal Edmund Szoka disclosed his final decisions to pastors in  private meetings last week, giving them permission to release the information  during weekend services. The church closing plan, announced in September,  called for closing or merging 48 parishes. Officials cited declining  membership, a shortage of priests and increasing costs.  </P></p>

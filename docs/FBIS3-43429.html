			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Very early in the morning, street barricades  were set up by elements who have not yet been officially  identified. These barricades had the effect of paralyzing  activity in the city. In some suburbs the barricades were  removed by gendarmes, but in others the situation remains tense.    UPRONA [Union for National Progress] president, Nicholas  Mayugi, in a declaration he has just issued, expressed his lack  of solidarity with the organizers of these operations. Here he  is:    [Begin Mayugi recording] The executive bureau of the UPRONA  Party and its parliamentary team have just learned from the  radio and that barricades were set up on some roads in Bujumbura  on the morning of 6 January for the purpose of stopping workers  from going to the various service districts. We have also  learned that writings have been distributed on behalf of a  coalition of opposition parties.    The UPRONA executive bureau and the UPRONA parliamentary  team  inform national and international opinion that the sabotage  actions and the organization of this Operation Ghost Town, which  seems to be the objective [as heard], have been decided and  implemented without the knowledge of the leadership of UPRONA.  That is why UPRONA's executive bureau and the parliamentary  team express their total lack of solidarity with all the  perpetrators of these deplorable acts which today are stopping  people from going to work, going to see their doctors and  honoring their commitments. [passage omitted]    We make a strong call to all our militants and the entire  Burundi people to refuse any call for disorder, indiscipline,  violation of the law, violence or subversion. We call for  peace, dialogue, and discussionss, in order that the task of  re-establishing peace and carrying out reconstruction will  become easier. We call upon those of our militants who could be  lost to heed our call for peace and discipline, and to cease  sowing divisions, as hatred and chaos lead only to grief,  disintegration and self destruction. All party members who hear  our call should mobilize themselves for unity, peace, and work  and keep away those who want to mislead them, acting in unison,  for the restoration of peace in unity and nonviolence. Thank  you. [end recording]</p>

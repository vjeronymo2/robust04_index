			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE ASSAULTED, ROBBED IN HIS HOME  </P> <P> Fred Beteta, an unsuccessful candidate for state Assembly in the recent  election, was bound, gagged, assaulted and robbed of cash and his car Tuesday,  allegedly by two knife-wielding men he had previously employed in his Santa  Monica home, police said.  </P> <P> Beteta, 61, a longtime Santa Monica College trustee and retired engineer,  suffered minor knife "nick" wounds in the attack, which occurred about 1:15  p.m. in his home on the city's south side, said Santa Monica Police Lt. Robert  Thomas.  </P> <P> "I thought I was going to die," said Beteta, who said he was slashed in the ear  and had his face repeatedly pushed into the floor. "They kept roughing me up,  asking me where the money was in my house."  </P> <P> After tying Beteta's hands and feet behind him with nylon cords, the two  assailants escaped with about $60 from his wallet and stole his maroon 1978  Toyota Cressida, Thomas said.  </P> <P> Beteta said a jewelry box belonging to his wife, Lucy, also was stolen, but  that he did not notice it until after he filed the police report.  </P> <P> Beteta, a Republican who challenged Assemblyman Tom Hayden in the race for his  44th District seat, said two young men had approached him about three weeks  ago, saying they were hungry and looking for food.  </P> <P> Beteta said the men told him they were illegal aliens from Mexico. He said he  did not know if they came to his house randomly or if they noticed his home  address printed on a campaign mailer.  </P> <P> A staunch conservative who was born in Nicaragua, Beteta said he took pity on  the men and gave them some yard work in exchange for food and about $20 apiece.  </P> <P> Beteta said the men returned Tuesday asking for more food, and that he again  gave them some yard work. Beteta told police that after letting the men into  his house so they could wash their hands when they were done, they brandished  butcher knives and tied him down.  </P> <P> Beteta said that despite being bound, he managed to maneuver his hands to dial  operator assistance to ask for help. Telephone company officials notified  police, who arrived at Beteta's home at 1:40 p.m. to find that he had just  freed himself, Thomas said.  </P> <P> The men, whom Beteta described as being of medium height and build and in their  early 20s, are still at large, according to Thomas.  </P> <P> Beteta said he thought the attack illustrated a growing danger in Santa Monica  posed by transients attracted to the city by its feeding and social service  programs.  </P> <P> "We are creating a haven for these people here, not realizing we're creating  trouble at the same time," said Beteta. "People are getting victimized by  attempting to be compassionate."  </P> <P> Thomas, the police daytime watch commander, said people "should be very careful  of the people they hire to work in their yards."  </P></p>

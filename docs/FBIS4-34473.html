			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A State of Risk"] </F>   [Text] As the second-largest contributor to the Brazilian  GDP, the priority of Rio de Janeiro State is to guarantee the  production of electrical power through a reliable and consistent  network as an essential condition for maintaining and expanding  its industrial and agricultural sectors. The economic future of  the state depends on a political decision, one that can lead to  the creation of thousands of direct and indirect jobs, increase  tax revenues, and attract new investments.    It is unfair that this state, which accounts for more than  60  percent of all the oil produced by Brazil, is forbidden by the  Constitution from collecting a single cent of the ICMS [Goods  and Services Distribution Tax] on operations to supply other  states (this means Sao Paulo) with petroleum and  petroleum-derived lubricants, liquid fuel, and gas. On the  other hand, Sao Paulo is authorized to collect the ICMS on its  industrial and agricultural products that are sold to other  states. Sao Paulo State also collects ICMS on gas from the  Campos Basin supplied through Comgas [Municipal Gas Company].    This represents a risk for Rio de Janeiro, which in 1990  consumed 25,138 kwh, only which just 8,267 kwh came from its own  sources. The fact that 50 percent of the electric power consumed  by the state is produced outside its territory explains why we  have been begging in vain for large industries to settle in Rio  de Janeiro.    The lag between electric power production and consumption  has  made Rio de Janeiro extremely sensitive to decisions on  investments in the electric power sector outside its own  territory. The state is also vulnerable to operational  contingencies in the electricity power grid. A break in the  transmission lines from Itaipu [hydroelectric complex] can black  out Rio de Janeiro, paralyzing its industries. This is how we  arrived in a state of risk.    This situation arose following systematic operational  difficulties in one of Itaipu's transmission networks. The  problem has not caused further damage only because of the  remarkable drop in electrical power consumption following the  economic crisis that began 12 years ago. It should be noted  that the Angra-1 nuclear power station has also contributed [to  place Rio de Janeiro on a state of risk], given that it accounts  for 36 percent of the electric power generated in Rio de Janeiro.    This merely emphasizes the decisive importance of expanding  the use of nuclear energy as a power generation source in order  to reduce the current dependence. Nuclear energy is essential  for Rio de Janeiro: The vast majority of the Brazilian  institutions that are linked to nuclear energy, not just in the  industrial area but also those linked with training courses and  professional associations, are located in this state.    The concentration of these activities in Rio de Janeiro  State  makes it a real nuclear center that comprises the following  institutions:    1. The National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), which  controls and grants licenses to nuclear units and which  coordinates nuclear technological research; 2. The Nuclear  Energy and Radio Protection and Dosimetry Institutes [Institutos  de Energia Nuclear e de Radioprotecao e Dosimetria]; 3. Nuclear  Industries of Brazil, which is a holding [preceding word in  English] of industries connected with the nuclear fuel cycle; 4.  Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc., which owns the Angra-1, 2,  and 3 power plants (3 is still under construction); 5. The Fuel  Elements Factory, the Separation Elements Plant, and the  Isotopic Enrichment Plant in Resende.    We must not overlook Nuclen [Nuclebras Engineering, Inc.], a  nuclear plant engineering company; Nuclep [Nuclebras Heavy  Equipment, Inc.], which produces equipment for the primary  circuit of these nuclear plants; Monazite Sands Primary  Beneficiation Plant [Usina de Beneficiamento primario de areias  monaziticas] in Campos; or the Brazilian Nuclear Quality  Institute. These are research and training institutions which  provide valuable technological assistance.    We must insist: Once the Angra plants are totally  operational  they will considerably increase the power base of the  Southeastern power grid. The Angra plants, which are located  near the main consumer markets of the country (130 km from Rio,  220 km from Sao Paulo, and 350 km from Belo Horizonte) will  reinforce the whole power system and guarantee a suitable power  supply for the states of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo.    The assembly of Angra-2 is currently a top priority. It is  at an advanced stage (67 percent built) and is being financed by  Germany and by Furnas. Energy demand projections show an  average 5 percent increase of consumption per year for the  South/Southeast/Center-West grid. So there is no time to waste.    The commissioning of Angra-2 will reduce Rio de Janeiro's  dependency on energy from other states from the current 50  percent to 35 percent. Angra-2 will provide 350 civil  construction jobs and 550 engineering jobs for 4 years; 350  administrative jobs for 5 years; and will create 1,400 new  electro-mechanical assembly jobs for 5 years.    Over the next 5 years, the related taxes collected will  represent $100 million for the state and for the municipalities.  This is apart from the improved social benefits for the region  in the field of education, health, and infrastructure.    The consolidation of a nuclear center will allow Brazil  access to the international nuclear market, which handles  billions of dollars per year in the supply of fuel elements, the  manufacture of equipment, the training of operators, and the  supply of engineering and quality control services.    Then why this reluctance to assemble Angra-2? To compare it  with Angra-1 is like comparing a Jumbo jet and an Electra. It  follows the security concept of the German nuclear plants, the  safest and with best performance in the world. In terms of  transfer of technology the Angra-2 has been very successful: 108  of the 113 systems of the plant were designed by Nuclen.    The reasons for postponing its construction based on the  long  economic recession have already been overcome. Environmental  excuses do not hold water. The arguments used by organizations  like Greenpeace can be summarized in three categories: 1.  Nuclear energy is expensive and dangerous and it is declining in  the rest of the world; 2. Nuclear plants are the fastest way to  obtain a nuclear bomb; 3. Nuclear power involves technology that  externally serves the interests of German industrial  penetration, and internally consolidates a military class that  longs to make Brazil a world power.    The first lie is based on a superstition similar to that  felt  by those who fear flying. There is no point in proving to them  that statistically more people die in traffic accidents (or of  heart attacks) than in airplane accidents. There is no point in  proving that the environmental damage caused by conventional  power plants is greater than that caused by nuclear plants. The  problem is not caused by modern nuclear plants but by backyard  accidents like the one that took place in Goiania when medical  equipment was scrapped [and a radioactive cesium capsule was  stolen].    Hysterical tropical NGO's [Non Government Organizations]  merely cover their ears to these arguments. They are totally  controlled by reactionaries who swallowed the extreme concept of  [18th century philosopher Jean Jacques] Rousseau of comparing  the good savage with the [Brazilian] lion-monkey [mico-leao].  They do not take into consideration the fact that Chernobyl was  a fifth-rate nuclear plant that did not meet minimum Western  standards or that the accident in Three Mile Island was confined  to the interior of the plant and did not harm the environment.  They do not want to hear about sea platforms like Pampo, for  example, which produces hydrogen sulfide gas and which is a  volcano with a statistically greater chance of erupting than  Angra-1. They selectively choose to ignore Petrobras [Brazilian  Petroleum Corporation] and the tropical forest devastation  because the NGO headquarters abroad know the Brazilian people  are proud of their oil and are concerned about the Amazon  region. They know that a phobia of nuclear plants gives them  more notoriety.    It is a lie that nuclear energy is declining in the rest of  the world: Despite the 1970 world recession, when nuclear energy  represented 1.6 percent of the world energy capacity, by 1990 it  had risen to 17 percent, which is very close to hydroelectric  energy, which represents 19 percent of the total world energy  capacity. In France, 78 percent of the domestic power  production comes from nuclear energy. There even are nuclear  power plants located around Paris. Nuclear power plants in  Belgium produce 59.9 percent of all requirements.    The United States, France, Japan, the former USSR, Canada,  and the old GDR produce 60 percent of all the nuclear power  energy in the world. It is not surprising that these  environmentalist groups, which favor the "zero growth" preached  by the old Rome Club, come from the very countries that do not  want to transfer modern energy and technology to other countries.    It is known that the Carter administration did everything it  could to stop Germany from transferring technology that should  have remained in the First World. Former [Science and  Technology] Minister Renato Archer has revealed that British  Professor John Demos, who directs a nuclear power plant, told  him the Americans do not want the largest energy industry in the  world (theirs) becoming obsolete just because Brazil has  radioactive minerals. This is why Archer defended, through  Admiral Alvaro Alberto, the idea of only supplying radioactive  minerals to the Americans in exchange for nuclear technology.    But the world powers have always rejected the "industrial  lever effect" associated with nuclear energy. That is, in  nuclear plants like Angra, high-technology equipment account for  70 percent of the whole construction while civilian construction  works account for 30 percent. These proportions are inverted in  hydroelectric plants.    A nuclear bomb? Why has Brazil just signed the Tlatelolco  Treaty to denuclearize Latin America? Why should they imagine  that Brazil will start just as the Cold War is over, the USSR  has disappeared from the map, and California is in crisis as  consequence of the dismantling of its war industry? If we give  up launching rockets just because they could carry bombs, we  should also give up carrying knives because they can be used to  kill. Why should we give up the fantastic autonomous program of  Aramar [Navy nuclear project]? A country with more than 7,000  km of coastal line cannot do without an atomic submarine.    Let us speak like adults: The future is too serious to let  ourselves be influenced by environmentalists who even torture  animals in publicity films to prove that progress is taking us  backwards.</p>

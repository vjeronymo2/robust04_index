			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVABLE FEASTS: SAVORING THE STUFF AT SAVORIES  </P> <P> Savories. That's the name of a new take-out shop/cafe on Beverly Drive. At  first, I imagined a store filled with fussy tinned things, finnan haddie  (that's smoked haddock from Scotland) and olives as varied and briny as they  come. Was I ever wrong. The goods here are freshly made and scrupulously  undersalted, with an allegiance, in fact, to things not savory but sweet. "Eat  dessert first, life is uncertain." That's what the sign on the counter says.  </P> <P> People in the Savories neighborhood already pile in for jumbo-sized hot, fresh  muffins, with flavors (blueberry, corn and Cheddar, something  chocolater-than-thou) that change daily.  </P> <P> Feeling that life's uncertain? Savories' wet, nutty fudge-like brownies would  be a steadfast way to blast through space. (Yes, dessert's coming first today.)  </P> <P> The buttery, thick bread pudding ($5.99 per pound) with vats of hard sauce is  completely satisfying (the gentleman serving us kept spooning the topping on .  . . ).  </P> <P> A good measure of the Nourishing Food is equally pleasing. I know that the  exquisite curried chicken salad ($9.50 per pound), with its fat raisins, mango  chutney, toasted almonds and lushly coated chicken, is halfway to dessert, but,  really, it's one of the best in its class. The lean honey-mustard boneless  grilled chicken breast ($8.99 per pound) tastes of wood cooking, and is totally  luscious.  </P> <P> Uncertain life that this is, of course, not everything turned out to be equally  mesmerizing. The black bean salad was refined and distinct with a swell little  kick of cumin, ($6.50 per pound). The Mexican chicken salad, all mashed up, was  muddy and confused. The Greek salad with lots of fresh oregano and a pleasing,  creamy feta ($6.50 per pound) was very light while the wild rice, pine nut and  pepper salad was absolutely indistinct. Sesame noodles were underflavored,  raddiatore with a frothy pesto ($7.99 per pound) were more assertive and fun to  eat. Green bean salad was lethargic, penne with "tomato pesto" was boring, but  the spinach lasagna was lusty, fluffy and reassuring.  </P> <P> If you're in the mood for exotica, Savories sells Tuscan biscuits, honey dashed  with whiskey, and shelves full of other upscale delicacies.  </P> <P>  Savories, 240 South Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills. (213) 276-9481. Open  Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-8 p.m. Saturday, 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Closed Sundays. MasterCard  and Visa. Street parking.  </P> <P> </P></p>

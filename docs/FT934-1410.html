			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Sport: Put through the ringer - Rugby Union / Tom Fort once smuggled an All Black star into his Sunday team One of the sights of the recent All Blacks' tour of Britain was the mighty winger, Vai'aiga Tuigamala, a terrifying man, who felicitously combines the destructive potential of a medieval battering ram with intelligence and finesse of the highest order. Even in the All Blacks' sole defeat, by England at Twickenham, there was one moment to savour. The victim was the younger Underwood. As he took a high kick outside the England 22, he was picked up by Tuigamala, in the manner of a splintered tree trunk being shifted by a JCB. He finally hit the turf 15 yards back, and tottered away, ruefully massaging his flanks. Had the International Rugby Board's regulations on national qualification been other than a standing joke, Underwood would not have had to suffer so. For Tuigamala is hardly more of a New Zealander than I am a Frenchman. He is a Samoan. He is not alone. The ranks of the two great southern hemisphere sides are bursting with South Sea islanders. Apart from Tuigamala, the All Blacks have Frank Bunce, Steve Bachop and Eroni Clarke from Samoa. Australia have the indestructible Tongan, Willie Ofahengaue, and the Fijian flanker, Ilie Tabua. The Europeans are not above such shenanigans. Remember the hoots when former Aussie Brian Smith pulled on the green shirt of Ireland - which turned to howls when he left his adopted country in the lurch just before the World Cup. By name, Damien Cronin may sound like a resident of Tannochbrae. But by any meaningful criteria, he is English, as are his fellow Scots, Andy Reed and Neil Edwards. Nigel Redman, Jonathon Callard, Stuart Barnes and Simon Halliday of England are all Welsh born. Tony Copsey of Wales is an Essex man with a 'Made in England' tattoo. Whatever the contortions over birthplace, citizenship and grandparental domicile, these men are - to employ a colloquialism - ringers. And as the longtime organiser of a rugby team which was ever oppressed by the need to find 15 players, I am all for them. Gather thy bodies wherever thou mayest is my motto - with one proviso, which I shall come to later. Of course, there is a limit to the influence a ringer can wield. If the team is useless, he will not be able to transform it into something else. One Sunday, many years ago, the Welsh and British Lions winger, Clive Rees, was strolling around the pitch on which we were about to play formidable opposition. As usual, we were deficient in numbers, and the obliging Rees was talked into helping out. I suspect he regretted it. We lost 54-0, and not once were we broken-winded, clapped-out forwards able to secure the ball for him to use of his greyhound pace. I prefer to recall another occasion. We had progressed from the Rees era, and were a reasonable side. But our opponents were better, and knew it. We longed to puncture their air of superiority. We had a Kiwi playing for us that season. He was called Rex Smith, and he had played for Otago and was well-connected. We told him how keen we were to beat this outfit for the first time, and he said he would speak to some mates. On the evening in question he produced his two recruits. One introduced himself as Earle - Earle Kirton, the former All Blacks number eight (and currently the assistant coach). The other was called Sapsford. He was a prop, 18st plus, and could run faster than anyone in our back division. It was he who did the damage. He took the ball, and thundered at them like a buffalo with a mission. Their defence was demolished like brushwood, leaving casualties stretched out on the ground. We scored. They kicked off, Sapsford caught the ball and off we went again. It was murder, and the greatest fun. The atmosphere in the bar afterwards was charged. They were subdued, we were riotous. There were recriminations, which became increasingly bitter when Kirton was identified. Our sportmanship was questioned, the future of the fixture put in doubt. But the crosser they became, the more we smirked. They had never thought much of us, but the worm had turned, and we had - to put it crudely - stitched them up. And that brings me to the condition I mentioned earlier. Yes, I believe the game is richer for ringers, and it has been a privilege to see Tuigamala in his pomp. But life is undoubtedly more comfortable if you make sure that they are on your side.</p>

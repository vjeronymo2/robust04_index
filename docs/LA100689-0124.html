			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKINNER PLAN WOULD EASE WAY FOR FOREIGN AIRLINES  </P> <P> Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner proposed Thursday to open up some  U.S. cities with little or no international air service to flights by foreign  airlines without the usual negotiations.  </P> <P> If the plan is adopted, Skinner said, "many more U.S. cities will have the  opportunity to enjoy the economic benefits" of direct international flights.  </P> <P> In a speech at a forum on international aviation, the secretary said the  Transportation Department would formally propose the new rules within the next  few days. A period for public comment, usually about two months, would follow  before the rules would take effect.  </P> <P> Skinner did not detail what cities or routes might be affected.  </P> <P> Analysts said that such cities as Charlotte, N.C., and Tampa, Fla., could be  early applicants seeking foreign service.  </P> <P> He said the department has been flooded with letters from governors, members of  Congress, mayors and business leaders urging a policy that would open up more  international routes from cities where passengers have to make connecting  flights to go abroad.  </P> <P> Permission for foreign airlines to fly the routes would be dependent upon  having an agreement that would allow U.S. carriers "all the rights our airlines  require" within the country where the foreign carrier is based, Skinner said.  </P> <P> Currently, international routes generally are awarded through bilateral  negotiations between the United States and other countries on a basis of  reciprocity -- an airline from each country flies the route.  </P> <P> Under Skinner's plan, the United States would approve foreign air carrier  service between a U.S. city and the carrier's home country if no other airline  served the route, if the United States has no aviation dispute pending with the  country and if no U.S. airline or other party raises any "overriding public  interest objection" to the flight, the secretary said.  </P> <P> "We stand ready to share our free market competitive concept with any country  willing to listen," Skinner said.  </P> <P> He said the proposal would not replace traditional aviation negotiations. But  he said the negotiations process has not worked in cases where U.S. carriers  have no immediate plans to serve a route that a foreign carrier is willing to  fly.  </P></p>

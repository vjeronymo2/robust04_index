			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Letter: Underlying factors creating foundation for future growth in Poland Sir, Your news item ('Polish economy declines despite private growth', February 3) deserves elaboration. It focused without comment on 1991 figures from the Main Statistical Office. As in other post-socialist countries, this is notoriously incapable of capturing much private activity in services, industry and agriculture alike, both because of its reach and because of 'grey' and 'black' evasion. In an economy like Poland's, which some time this year will be more than 50 per cent private, the official numbers are simply not to be trusted. There is much evidence that unrecorded output in Poland is not just absolutely but also proportionately larger than among its neighbours. The Austrian bank, Creditanstalt, recently estimated that in Poland official 1991 output figures understated the true position by as much as 38 per cent and that consequently GDP was on a rising trend. Whatever the 'truth', it is certain that the official negative number of 8-10 per cent overstates the contraction. The Polish economy now appears to be bottoming out. Your conclusions about rising unemployment and the greater number of pensioners are simplistic. It is not necessarily the case that these reflect a 'sharp overall contraction in job opportunities'. Of course there is, inevitably, rising unemployment in an economy shifting orientation on a massive scale, and there are numerous unemployment black spots. However, the new non-farm private sector is creating jobs rapidly. Officially, it employs 2.5m and unofficially perhaps a million more, some of whom are surely claiming benefits. Furthermore, in relative terms pensions are extremely generous. In 1991 pensioners' average incomes were higher than those in working households, and their expenditure rose by a huge 8 per cent in real terms (that of working households was unchanged). The continued and remarkable boom in exports to the west, up by an (understated?) 18 per cent to Dollars 14.2bn, shows extraordinary flexibility in an economy which has had market conditions for only two years. This will be the foundation for future growth. Exports are well-diversified and so far have come predominantly (80 per cent) from the state sector, which has a vast potential for improved efficiency. The private sector accounted for 46 per cent of imports. Those included consumer items, such as the (one-off?) flow of western cars, some 300,000 of the 523,000 sold last year. But the private sector, as we are seeing in the Polish Development Bank, is now also gearing up for import substitution and export-orientated production, using imported machinery on a large scale.

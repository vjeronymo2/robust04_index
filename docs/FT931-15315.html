			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Ecuador woos foreign investment ECUADOR'S President Sixto Duran Ballen has signed a law lifting almost all restrictions on foreign investment, and allowing repatriation of profits, Reuter reports from Quito. It will go into effect once it is published in the government's Official Register, replacing the law in effect since June 1991. The law will activate plans previously announced by the government, as part of its economic reform programme. A panel of Ecuador's creditor banks in New York is discussing restructuring the country's commercial bank debt.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has acted to  defuse a growing land-grab scandal involving his government by  announcing that all leases of state land to individuals would be  canceled. His move follows widespread allegations of corruption  in land reforms meant to redress injustices of the colonial past  by redistributing white-owned land to landless blacks. Entire  farms had been leased to individual government ministers, senior  civil servants, and top members of the military, instead of  being used to resettle peasants.    Mr. Mugabe told his ruling ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African  National  Union-Patriotic Front] party newspaper, THE PEOPLE'S VOICE, that  the land should not have been leased out in the first place  because it had been acquired for the purpose of resettling  peasant farmers. He said in future land should be leased after  proper procedures had been followed, and the Land Acquisition  Act would continue to be used for the resettlement of landless  peasants.</p>

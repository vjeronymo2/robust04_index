			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Flynn rejects job creation at any cost A SOLUTION to the European Community's jobs crisis can not be obtained at the price of dismantling EC social provisions or driving down wages, Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs and employment commissioner, said yesterday. As opinion among his Commission colleagues and the 12 member states is leaning in favour of labour market deregulation and reducing labour costs, Mr Flynn insisted that focusing too exclusively on wage costs was a blind alley. 'The social dimension has to be kept on board,' the commissioner told journalists. 'We're not talking about dismantling workers' rights.' Mr Flynn said the Commission's White Paper on EC competitiveness, growth and employment - ordered by June's Copenhagen summit for the December summit of EC leaders in Brussels - may recommend that specific countries alter labour market and taxation policies. These are areas in which the EC has very limited jurisdiction, and the step would be all the more controversial given the new Community orthodoxy of subsidiarity, limiting EC action to those areas where national or regional government cannot act as effectively. Mr Flynn underlined that there was as yet no consensus on the content or form of the White Paper inside the Commission. But he said that 'with the crisis deepening, and the credibility of the Community on the line, I think we have to go that step further.' 'If you can establish that the taxation system (in a given member state) keeps people out of jobs, then you should do something about it,' he said. 'I think it's going to have to be said.' On wage and non-wage costs, the Irish commissioner insisted that the real issue was productivity and unit labour costs, singling out the UK, which he described as the most deregulated labour market in the EC. 'Half the population &lt;in the UK&gt; now lives on one quarter of national income,' he said. 'Ten years ago the same number lived on a third of national income; and they've still got 3m unemployed.' Mr Flynn made the comparison with Belgium, pointing out that British wages were 30 per cent below Belgian wages, but that the UK 'has exactly 70 per cent of Belgium's productivity.' The thrust of Mr Flynn's department's analysis remains that solutions must be found through making working time more flexible by upgrading skills through education and training. Part of the burden of non-wage costs, like social security, could be shifted from employment to other areas, for example through eco-taxes on scarce resources. Unemployment in the EC dipped to 10.6 per cent in July from a revised 10.7 per cent in June, but the fall is not a sign of economic recovery, the EC's statistical office said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'The slight fall does not reflect an upturn. It is largely due to an 0.5 percentage point decrease between June and July in the unemployment rate in Spain where many students who graduated in June found a job in July,' Eurostat said.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR VETOES FUNDS FOR PARKLANDS  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed from the state's 1989-90 budget a $3-million  appropriation for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to acquire land near  Malibu Creek State Park and in the Santa Susana Mountains. In his veto message  last week, Deukmejian said there were insufficient funds from a 1984 parkland  bond act to make the purchases.  </P> <P> Joseph Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director, said the organization  would seek funds from other state sources for the land purchases. "I think we  have a shot at that," he said.  </P></p>

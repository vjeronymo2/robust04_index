			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federation Council ought to ratify the treaty on  the CIS Economic Union of 24 September 1993 as this is in  Russia's interests, the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament  was advised at hearings Friday.    The Russian Government was advised to step up efforts to  create a free trade area and customs and payments unions in the  CIS.    Federation Council members said that industrial decline  throughout the CIS was due largely to the break up of economic  links.    The CIS Statistics Committee said that overall economic  decline in the Commonwealth was characterized by a reduction of  the gross domestic product on the whole in the CIS by 26%  over  the past two years, including by 30% in industry and  11% in  agriculture.    The Statistics Committee said that industrial output had  gone  down by 10-18% in Ukraine, Belarus and Turkmenistan since  1991,  24-31% in Russia, Moldova, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and  39-60% in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Georgia.    Sergey Glazyev, who is chairman of the State Duma (lower  chamber of parliament) Committee for Economic Policy, told the  Federation Council that the Free Trade Agreement signed on 15  April this year must be put into effect, all the more so because  of its benefit for Russia. The CIS market accounted for one  fifth of Russia's foreign market and it was in the former USSR  states that Russian goods were most competitive, he said.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Wales 'long way short of targets' All eight counties in Wales have shown an improvement this year in the average performance of pupils at state schools in obtaining GCSE passes. But Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said the results left Wales still behind England and Scotland and 'a long way short of our targets'. He said he was pleased that 136 maintained schools had recorded an improvement in the number of pupils achieving five or more A-C grades and that the Welsh average had improved from 37 per cent to 39 per cent. He added, however: 'The spread of results, with the best LEA school obtaining 73 per cent and the worst only 4 per cent, is far too wide. More action is needed to lift standards in the worst performing schools.' Average performance ranged from 30 per cent of pupils gaining five or more A-C grades in Mid Glamorgan to 45 per cent in Dyfed and Powys. The biggest improvements were in South Glamorgan, which went from 35 per cent last year to 40 per cent, and in Powys, which was up from 40 per cent. The highest-scoring state school - with 73 per cent of pupils gaining five or more A-C grades - was Bishop of Llandaff High School in Cardiff. The worst performing, with 4 per cent, was Glan Ely High School in Cardiff. Among independent schools Westbourne College gained a 100 per cent figure, and Howell's School 99 per cent. Both are in South Glamorgan. More than 19 out of 20 state pupils aged 15 were entered for at least one GCSE or Certificate of Education this year, and nine out of 10 pupils gained one or more graded GCSE result. At A/AS-level all counties but one showed an improvement in the average passes of candidates entered for two or more subjects. The exception was Gwynedd, which on a points basis stayed at 14, the same level as last year. The average for Welsh schools rose from 14 to 15. The range was from 13 points in Mid Glamorgan to 16 in Powys and South Glamorgan. The highest rating by a state school was by Penglais Comprehensive, Aberystwyth, with an average per pupil of 23 points for those taking two or more subjects. In the independent sector Ffynone House School in West Glamorgan scored best with 28 points. This year the Welsh Office publishes the absenteeism level at schools. Mr Redwood said: 'I recognise that irregular attendance in many cases might be out of the immediate control of the school. But I hope by publishing these figures it will encourage schools to investigate unauthorised absences. 'I find it very worrying that in Mid Glamorgan pupils on average miss more than one day a fortnight, and in South Glamorgan more than one fifth of all the absences are unauthorised.'</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Books: The lure of lonely places FALLING OFF THE MAP: SOME LONELY PLACES OF THE WORLD by Pico Iyer Cape Pounds 14.99, 190 pages NATURAL OPIUM: TRAVELLING TALES by Diane Johnson Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 10.99, 234 pages TRANQUEBAR: A SEASON IN SOUTH INDIA by Georgina Harding Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 15.99, 205 pages YOU can do almost anything under the broad banner of 'travel writing', which is why travel books continue to churn from the presses, despite the alleged shrinking of the world into smaller and duller bits. But it helps to have a theme, and it is the theme of Falling Off The Map - lonely places: the parts of the world that most people try to avoid - that serves Pico Iyer so well in his extremely enjoyable book. For Iyer, lonely places are the ones that do not fit in; that have no seat at the international dinner table; that fall between the cracks of our tidy acronyms (EC, Opec, Nato). They are, says Iyer, 'the places that are not on international wavelengths, do not know how to carry themselves, are lost when it comes to visitors. They are shy, defensive, curious places; places that do not know how they are supposed to behave.' No doubt Australia will object to being categorised in this manner. Iyer found it 'quiet and unpeopled', the definitive terra incognita, not really part of the planet. Australia is not quite as eccentric as he makes out, but perhaps he is right; perhaps it is a lonely place: a seemingly new-born world still peopled by elemental presences. The remainder of his choices are far less controversial: North Korea, Argentina, Cuba, Iceland, Bhutan, Vietnam and Paraguay. North Korea must be the strangest place in the solar system. Both South and North Korea are zany, says Iyer, the difference being that North Korea is so cut off from the world that it does not know how strange it is and cannot imagine anything except North Korea. The second strangest place in the solar system is probably Bhutan. At one of Bhutan's dzongs - huge whitewashed 17th century fortresses cum monasteries cum administrative centres - Iyer spoke to one of the students about a Royal Government of Bhutan truck drawn up outside the gates. The men in the truck were dog-catchers. 'You see', said the student, 'these dogs do many dirties here.' 'How many live in the dzong?' '100.' '100?]' 'Just now they will be taken to the Indian border and let out there.' 'The Indian border] That's seven hours away]' 'Oh, yes, very far.' Iyer has a perfect ear and eye for oddness, and an intense, original style - he went to Eton, Oxford and Harvard and is now an essayist for Time, which must be rather jolly. For his next trick he ought to turn his attention to John Major's Britain, which for deepening eccentricity is starting to rival Bhutan. Diane Johnson's Natural Opium is similar in theme to Iyer's book, though quite different in tone. She is a novelist and a biographer (of Dashiell Hammett and Mary Ellen Peacock) who has frequently accompanied her doctor-husband to unchosen destinations and has attempted to describe the curious condition of being a traveller. She writes of China, Cairo, London, St Petersburg, Utah, Agra and the Great Barrier Reef, always with charm and a quirky eye. It is all in the eye, of course. Plenty of people write travel books, or even travel journalism, without ever seeing a thing. Georgina Harding's first travel book, about a journey to Romania, was generously well-received. Her second describes a winter's stay, with her 14-month-old son, in Tranquebar, a village on southern India's Coromandel Coast. Unfortunately, it's a plod.</p>

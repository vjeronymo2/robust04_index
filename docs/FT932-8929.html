			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Man in the News: Return of the Invisible Man - Jacques Delors Barring the odd volcanic outburst, Mr Jacques Delors has been a model of self-restraint this year. The president of the European Commission has assumed such a low profile that Brussels officials joke that the man known as Mr Europe has turned into Mr Invisible. But if the polls are correct and Danish voters approve the Maastricht treaty in next Tuesday's referendum, Mr Delors intends to mount a comeback. This may come as a surprise to those in Britain and elsewhere who dismiss the 67-year-old Frenchman and his vision of a federalist Europe as a busted flush. But Mr Delors, with one eye on the French presidency in the 1995 elections, still sees himself as a present and future leader in Europe. One of Mr Delors' residual strengths is that he is not afraid of entering areas where others fear tread. Hence his decision to order an in-depth European Commission study of whether Europe is losing the battle to remain competitive with the US and Asia. This is more than an academic study about why there are 17m people out of work in EC. According to aides, the Commission president is prepared to tackle the sensitive question of whether Europe's welfare state is indirectly contributing to low growth, rising unemployment and the failure to create new jobs. Now, there is nothing to suggest that Mr Delors, a Christian and a socialist from peasant stock, has undergone a midnight conversion and decided to create a US-style society in Europe; nor is there any sign that Mr Delors intends to encourage the Commission to put forward legislation. On that count, at least, his ambitions for Brussels have been blunted beyond repair. Mr Delors simply wants a public debate. For just as he anticipated the political tide was moving in favour of economic and political integration in the 1980s, so he now suspects that another shift is underway in the 1990s, one which could undermine the social policies which he has championed. What is worrying Mr Delors is that Europe seems to be losing its capacity to generate new jobs. Between 1983 and 1990, the EC generated 9.4m net new jobs, partly in anticipation of the single European market; since 1990 it has lost a net 1.4m jobs. Low growth in the EC in 1993 and 1994 means no immediate dent in the dole queues. The second area of concern is the Maastricht treaty's squeeze on budget deficits. This is a natural consequence of the 'convergence' programmes  - the path of economic virtue which member states must tread to meet the requirements for European monetary union. But hard-pressed governments looking for savings are naturally tempted to look at cuts in social spending to meet the targets, all the more so in a deeper-than-expected recession. Mr Delors says it is time to 'pull the alarm chain'. The pace of technological change means that the competitiveness question will not go away. In Switzerland, workers are paid Dollars 20 an hour, 85 times more than in China. Growth rates in east Asia dwarf the EC's. 'How in Europe can we ensure minimum employment and preserve the social dimension,' he asked recently. Events in Germany suggest that Mr Delors is on to something. The deal between engineering employers and trade unions, reached yesterday, to delay raising eastern wages to western levels until 1996, is one straw in the wind. Just as telling was last week's decision by the leading private German industrial lobbies to reject government plans for a new social insurance surcharge for workers and employers. The idea was to finance residential care for the chronically sick and elderly with a DM13bn (Pounds 5.2bn) spending package. But the employers described the package as a direct threat to jobs and investment. Mr Delors frets, too, about the UK. He is irritated by the ruling British Conservative party flaunting its opposition to the Maastricht treaty's social chapter. While he bears no grudges against the UK government's success in boosting growth, he remains worried that other EC countries may be tempted to follow the British model, either engaging in competitive devaluations or floating their currencies outside the European exchange rate mechanism. This week's forced devaluations of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo seemed to confirm Mr Delors's fears. Mr Delors recently declared that Europe faces a choice between survival and decline. What he is really saying is that his own legacy - eight years during which he has been by far the most impressive Commission president in history - is at risk. This means the single market; the Emu programme; the Delors II spending package to bridge the gap between the richer north and the poorer south; and lastly the social policies which Mr Delors fought for in the Maastricht negotiations. These policies, he insists, are the price which EC member states must pay if their citizens are to be persuaded of the economic sacrifices necessary to create a single European currency. Ever since the first Danish referendum last June, Mr Delors has been forced to come to terms with a painful political fact - the national debates on Maastricht, notably in his native France, have opened up a huge gap between what the 12 EC governments were able to agree and what European public opinion is able to accept. Narrowing that gap is the great challenge of his remaining 18 months as president. The Delors study on Europe's unemployment crisis is partly an attempt to bridge the gap, to make the Community more relevant to its citizens. The main focus will be on job creation, partly through better training, a more efficient use of the Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.74bn) social funds in Brussels, and new fiscal incentives for keeping people in work. On the question of French presidential ambitions, Mr Delors is keeping his options open. But those who know him suggest that he is unwilling to have a straight fight with Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist party's standard-bearer. 'Only if Rocard clearly fails, will Delors enter,' says one EC official. This may reflect a lack of killer instinct, a curious failing in a politician as successful as Mr Delors. It could be the greatest obstacle to a comeback.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Technology: Finding the best performers - A new database designed to ease product comparison in the financial services industry This week saw the launch of the UK's first comprehensive product database for the financial services industry. The development comes at a time when insurance companies, investment houses and financial advisers are under intense pressure to improve product design and value for money for customers. The Aequos database is the brainchild of The Research Department, a team of seven consultants with experience in life assurance, pensions and investment. While other databases tend to specialise in a narrow range of products sold through independent advisers, Aequos includes all products irrespective of distribution channel or whether or not commission is payable to advisers and salesmen. The technology applied to the database makes this a practical business tool, which is simple to use. It costs Pounds 5,000 a year per module - or individual product group - of information. The full package costs Pounds 20,000 a year. The programme, which is updated monthly by disc, runs on any IBM compatible PC using the Windows operating system. Even technophobes will find the operating instructions easy. After signing on to their computer and clicking on to the Aequos icon, users are in the database and can go on to select an area of interest, pointing the cursor, and clicking the mouse. Aequos covers the entire range of regulated and many general insurance products. The system includes more than 100 insurance companies, 200 personal equity plan (Pep) providers, 300 investment trusts and 1,400 unit trusts. The latter three groups account for more than 200 investment managers. Mark Hayes-Newington, director of The Research Department, said: 'The system is designed to give skilled staff more time to spend using information instead of losing time collecting it. Moreover, Aequos tells you not only who does what but how well they do it.' The products fall into four categories, each with its own subsections. Pensions, including personal pensions, self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs), phased retirement plans, expatriate pensions, executive plans, small self-administered schemes, funded unapproved retirement benefits (Furbs) and transfer plans. Investment, including annuities, back-to-backs (hybrids that combine two or more products to meet a specific need), savings plans, maximum investment plans (Mips), endowments, peps, bonds, investment trusts and unit trusts. Protection, including term assurance, whole of life, permanent health insurance (PHI), private medical insurance (PMl), long-term care and critical illness. Group (company schemes), including pensions, life, PMl and PHI. A fifth module, of company profiles supplied by consulting actuaries AKG, offers analysis of a company's structure, management, sales data, financial strength, investment policy, administration and service efficiency, and distribution channels. Changes in the regulation of investment products, which come into force in January next year, have encouraged many providers to redesign investment and savings products to compete in what is expected to be a much more demanding, consumer-led market. At the core of Aequos is a series of product tables with details on more than 60 product features ranging from charging structures, flexibility and performance to the small print on loyalty bonuses and segmentation of insurance company pension policies. Users keen to analyse products in depth can 'interrogate' the key tables for detailed technical specifications. Providers who want to assess their brand's competitive position in the market will find all the primary research at their fingertips. A brand can be checked against competitors or against a select number on the basis of particular features. The Research Department, which is independent of the financial services industry, ranks and benchmarks product features in a process known as Data Numerical Analysis, which gives a standard measure for comparison purposes. Users highlight the relevant products and instruct the system to make the comparison on the basis of a self-selected list of criteria. For example, a life office wanting to launch a new personal pension aimed at younger people would be keen to check that its plan compared well on flexibility of premiums so that the client could stop and restart contributions to suit his or her changing work patterns. Aequos users can compare and rank products by any combination of providers and by any number of features. Product comparisons are presented in a graph. The system allows users to switch quickly from tables to technical pages to examine detailed policy information and to clarify any confusion. Direct comparison of technical information of several providers simultaneously is possible through the Windows system. Sales data from the company profiles module can also be ranked and sorted. Swift and accurate comparative analysis allows providers to pinpoint where their own products excel and fall short, and to target improvements and new launches. This will prove a welcome change to the more costly, complex and inefficient scatter-gun approach now used, whereby providers design 'me-too' products that include every feature imaginable. General Accident is one of several large insurance companies in the UK that have signed up for the full service. David Heslop, marketing manager, said: 'Quality and timely information is what marketing is all about and there is no doubt that the Aequos system will provide this. Using the database will make us more efficient and cost-effective. This will translate into better product design and distribution, which ultimately will mean better value for money for our customers.' John Green, information services manager at Norwich Union, said: 'At present our product analysis relies on a paper-based system and direct contacts. My next project was to try to design exactly the system Aequos offers so its arrival on the scene was very timely.' A third heavyweight insurer, Commercia1 Union, has also signed up. Ian Frater, information manager, says the system will 'improve the efficiency and accuracy of our marketing department'. Aequos also offers a range of services for financial advisers according to need and pocket. Large firms covering all markets are likely to prefer the full service to identify the most competitive products for clients. The comparative analysis facility will help advisers to demonstrate the respective merits of shortlisted products, while the link to Micropal statistics on investment performance allows the adviser to cross-check relative performance - a vital ingredient in the product selection process. Specialist firms of advisers can buy individual modules while small firms will he interested in the 'best advice panel' service. By law, independent advisers are expected to broke the entire market to select the right products for clients, a time-consuming and expensive exercise. Using Aequos, advisers identify the key criteria for product selection for their client base. This is fed into the system which produces on disc a shortlist including the most attractive products and providers based on the adviser's own criteria. Early next year, a real charge analysis system will be added. Under the new regulatory regime providers must tell customers exactly what their charges are and how they impact on the investment returns throughout the term of the contract. Until July this year, providers were allowed to disguise real charges by using an industry standard formula in their investment projections. Best advice under the new regime will require advisers to demonstrate a detailed knowledge of product charges. Once this information is on the Aequos system, real charges can be taken into consideration along with other product features. Product details: Aequos is available from The Research Department Ltd, Brands House, Kingshill Road, High Wycombe, Bucks HP13 5BD. Tel; 0494 714040. Fax; 0494 718080. The programme runs on IBM compatible PCs using the current Windows operating system. The Research Department installs the database, provides training and a helpline service.</p>

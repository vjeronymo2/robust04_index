According to the Korea Maritime and Port Administration and  the related industry on 9 January, Choyang Shipping,  representative company of the ROK consortium participating in  the Inchon-Dalian ferry project, and (Dalian Deep Ocean  Transportation Corporation), the PRC side's representative  company, recently held a second-round working-level meeting in  Seoul and agreed to open the route after deciding to establish  the joint venture's head office, which was the biggest issue  blocking the opening of the route, in the ROK while giving the  PRC side the responsibility of financial manager. They also  agreed to hold the third-round meeting within this month to make  the final decisions on how to secure ships and when to begin the  service.    The opening of scheduled ferry services between the ROK and  the PRC had been agreed in the ROK-PRC maritime meeting held  last year but it was delayed because the two countries insisted  that the head office of the 50-50 joint venture should be  located in their respective countries.</p>

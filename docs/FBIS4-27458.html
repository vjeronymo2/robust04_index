			<p>BFN     [Text] The Vietnamese troops who came and planted rice on  Cambodian land in Boreicholasa Disitrict, Takeo Province, late  last year (19 December 1993) recently pulled back to Vietnam  after harvesting all their crops.    Mr. Hah Saret, governor of Boreicholasa District, said  without the strong efforts of all of us Cambodians, especially  the provincial leadership, these Vietnamese troops would never  have withdrawn. He expressed concern that similar incidents  would again happen in the future if our border is not clearly  demarcated.    The problem of Vietnamese intruding into our land and  planting rice there or just plain illegal immigration takes  place every year and has to be settled every year with no end in  sight.    The district governor went on to reveal that along Takeo  Province's border with Vietnam there was an artificial canal dug  up during the time of Mr. Pol Saroeun, who was then the  province's governor (of the former State of Cambodia), to  prevent Vietnamese infiltration into Cambodian territory. This  canal was quite effective. However, whenever it got damaged or  dried up, problems normally arose. It has been frequently  observed that the Cambodian side rarely intrudes into Vietnam,  whereas the Vietnamese usually cross over this side of the  border.    It was noted that the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops  who  intruded into our land to grow rice was prompted by the pledge  made following talks between the leadership of Takeo Province  and that of Vietnam's An Giang Province earlier this year. The  Takeo provincial leadership made three attempts to solve this  problem with the leadership of Chau Doc District and An Giang  Province before it was successful.    Mr. Su Phirin, governor of Takeo Province, once told  REAKSMEI  KAMPUCHEA that the latest round of talks with the Vietnamese  side was most difficult because the Vietnamese claimed that the  contested area belonged to them. They said they had heard  repeated pleas from Takeo Province for years and they were  determined not to give up the land as in the past. The governor  said that before we could reach any agreement, we had to make a  lot of inquiries, confrontations, and persuasions and we spent  so much time doing just that. Mr. Phirin wished to see the  border clearly and quickly demarcated to avoid similar border  disputes in the future.    It should be recalled that the site where the Vietnamese  troops came to grow rice is located in Cheychouk Commune,  Boreicholasa Disitrict. The area is 50 to 70 meters deep and  1,500 meters wide inside Cambodian territory. These Vietnamese  intruders are troops from Chau Doc District. They came to grow  rice in groups of 40 to 50 persons, each armed with automatic  guns and sometimes heavy weapons. This made the situation much  more explosive than before when only unarmed civilians came in  to grab land to plant rice or simply to set up domicile. The  latter would pull out whenever our district armed forces  intervened. But recently, it was the Vietnamese troops  themselves who had intruded.    Some of the views admitted that it was great the Vietnamese  troops had agreed to withdraw. But one thing they were most  concerned about was that these troops might return in the future  as there is already a precedent.    According to the provincial governor, every year when the  rice planting dry-season comes, the problem of Vietnamese coming  in to plant rice on Cambodian land always arises because the  soil in Vietnam is not as productive as in Cambodia.    Another problem that frequently occurs is the renting of  land  to the Vietnamese by some of our own Cambodian citizens. This  is a dangerous practice. Moreover, the governor of Boreicholasa  Disitrict has complained that he cannot control every part of  the sparsely populated, and vast land area (240 square  kilometers) with few roads, as most of it is inundated.  Moreover, during the dry season access is easier from the  Vietnamese than from the Cambodian side. Nevertheless, he  showed his strong determination to fully preserve the  territorial integrity of Boreicholasa District.    It is to be noted that Boreicholasa is a new district of  Takeo Province created in December 1987. It is currently has  18,362 inhabitants, mostly farmers and fishermen. The creation  of this district was Takeo Province's strategy against the  influx of illegal Vietnamese immigrants.</p>

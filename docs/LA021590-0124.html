			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY, PLAY STALLED REPLACES PLAY BALL;  </P> <P> LABOR: MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYERS ASSN. DOESN'T HAVE MUCH IN COMMON WITH OTHER  UNIONS, AND SALARIES ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE.  </P> <P> Last year, the average American labor union negotiated a contract that gave its  members a 4% annual raise.  </P> <P> This winter, nine baseball players signed multiyear contracts paying annual  salaries of $3 million or better. One of them, Will Clark, now makes roughly  170 times the median salary of a full-time American worker.  </P> <P> That's merely the most obvious difference between the Major League Baseball  Players Assn. and the rest of organized labor.  </P> <P> Baseball's often-amended labor framework -- which the owners are now trying to  change again with their threat of a spring training lockout -- is a world apart  from traditionalAmerican industrial relations.  </P> <P> Money is not the only reason that an $8-an-hour member of the United Food and  Commercial Workers or the Service Employes International Union may feel less  than complete solidarity with a fellow unionist such as pitcher Pascual Perez,  who recently signed a $5.7-million, three-year contract with the New York  Yankees after a 9-13 season with the Montreal Expos.  </P> <P> The very issues that consume most unions are different. Health benefits, not  wages, is the most volatile subject in American labor. The number of strikes  over management cutbacks in health benefits has tripled in the last three  years, while unions have grudgingly grown used to pay increases that fall a bit  below the pace of inflation.  </P> <P> "As a good union man, I should say we feel a lot of kinship, but personally I  don't," says George Blunt, a teamster from Whittier who hasn't worked in five  months after going on strike at a Los Angeles food warehouse. "For a guy making  $2 million a year, a little medical bill isn't the problem it is to the average  working man."  </P> <P> Traditionally, the prime responsibility of a union is to negotiate a master pay  scale. In baseball, as well as the entire sports-entertainment segment of  labor, the union negotiates only the minimum wage -- $68,000 a year in major  league baseball. Above that floor, the player is worth whatever he and his  agent can get from the club's owner.  </P> <P> The logic behind this difference is that, unlike the typical worker, the  athlete is not just an employee.  </P> <P> "He's the product that's being sold," said Dick Moss, a baseball players' agent  who was formerly general counsel to the players' union as well as associate  general counsel to the United Steelworkers of America in the 1960s.  </P> <P> The determination of these salaries is another example of the difference.  </P> <P> Salaries for most unionized workers are "uniform by job categories because, for  the most part, the job skills the workers in these jobs have are on par with  one another," said Lionel Sobel, a Loyola Law School professor who wrote a book  about sports law. "The variations are hard for an employer to determine."  </P> <P> As anyone who's ever participated in a rotisserie league can testify, employee  variables in baseball are rampant, if not mind-boggling. They make job  categories impossible, but they also make performance analysis much easier than  trying to rate the work of, say, two dozen nurses.  </P> <P> The increased use of computers in the workplace now allows employers to more  easily quantify worker performance, from the number of calls an operator  handles each hour to the number of minutes a warehouseman needs to fill a  certain stock stock order. But unions, fearing that this data will be used  punitively, have generally resisted basing wages on such individual  measurements.  </P> <P> And what of the notion of seniority, so prized in the union shop, where  gradations in pay are based on the belief that the longer you've been around,  the more valuable you are? At Boeing, for example, machinists move up through  121 labor grades and steps, ranging from $8.88 an hour to $18.42.  </P> <P> Baseball stands such an idea on its head. Ask any 37-year-old utility infielder  who took a pay cut after hitting .193. Or ask Steve Garvey, who at 38 wasn't  offered a contract by the San Diego Padres after he had hit .211 in 1987.  </P> <P> The workaday world certainly has its share of that kind of coldness. Unions  complain increasingly that employers are pressuring workers in their 40s and  50s into retirement to save medical and other fringe-benefit costs, and turning  increasingly to younger or part-time workers. But sports -- particularly  baseball, with its wealth of statistics -- makes such judgments even less  forgivingly.  </P> <P> Daniel Mitchell, director of UCLA's Institute of Industrial Relations, said  that even the fundamental question of market value changes when ballplayers and  workers are compared.  </P> <P> "In routine collective bargaining, individuals are trying to get more than they  would be worth (individually) in a free market," using the union's traditional  implicit threat of a strike as leverage, Mitchell said. "In sports, players are  trying to get what they're worth in the free market."  </P> <P> Historically, baseball players have been regarded as a breed apart from other  workers because their bosses -- the team owners -- were exempt from antitrust  laws. This occurred because of what sports-law expert Sobel calls an accident  of history.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court ruled in the 1920s that baseball was exempt because it did  not meet the definition of interstate commerce -- a definition that in  subsequent decades has been substantially widened to include not merely  manufactured goods but services as well. businesses.  </P> <P> But the control owners enjoyed over players -- restricting them to a certain  team, robbing them of all bargaining rights -- began to evaporate in the 1970s  with court rulings that created salary arbitration and free agency.  </P> <P> Those changes have made the antitrust exemption largely irrelevant, according  to Sobel and Jack Getman, another sports-law authority who teaches at the  University of Texas law school. The current battle between the players and the  owners, as well as the future ones, will be played out under the same federal  labor laws that govern the rest of America's unions.  </P></p>

Asked  whether he had any preferences for the government to be  appointed after 1 March, the president of Romania said that he,  personally, had no preference, and that he would like "a  government enjoying some stability and enough parliamentary  support." He underlined the distinction that should be made  between "a political agreement between the political parties  forming the parliament" and the "possible structure of a  government." In this latter case a government, the president  opined, "could be formed solely of technocrats or of  representatives of a single political party, but only based on a  political formula of a wider parliamentary support."    About the much vented version of holding early elections,  Romania's number one said that such an alternative would not be  the best for Romania, because an election campaign at the moment  would only "disturb public life." However, theoretically  speaking, early elections "could be a solution unless others are  found." President Iliescu's opinion is that in 1994 the  Romanian society should concentrate its efforts on surmounting  the crisis and on economic reconstruction. "No matter what  governments will succeed one another, Romania's problems will be  the same," the president of Romania said.    As already widely reflected by the press, President Ion  Iliescu had consultations with all the parliamentary parties  with the aim of reaching a political pact aimed at reinstating a  climate for dialogue between the political forces and at  building a minimal common platform for taking the economic  reform further. The first round of consultations ended in  mid-January. Their resumption depends on the joint agreement of  all parties involved.</p>

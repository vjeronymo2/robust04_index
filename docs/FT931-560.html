			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Government wins backing on pits THE government comfortably headed off a threatened backbench rebellion over its coal white paper last night, leaving it free to implement proposals to reprieve 12 of the 31 threatened pits. The 319 votes to 297 victory - a government majority of 22 - removed any question mark over the political career of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. A Labour amendment calling for domestic coal production to be maintained at present volumes was earlier defeated by 320 votes to 295. In both cases, the government's majority was bolstered by the support or abstentions of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs who last week won at least Pounds 10m extra help from the Northern Ireland Office for industrial electricity users in the province. Four Conservatives - Mr Bill Cash (Stafford), Mr Richard Alexander (Newark), Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (Batley and Spen) and Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) - voted against the government motion. Another 16 did not vote, of whom three - Mr Steven Day (Cheadle), Mr Patrick Cormack (Staffordshire South), and Mr Winston Churchill (Davyhulme) - were believed deliberately to have abstained. These figures compared with six votes against and five abstentions when MPs debated the government's original pit closure programme last October. In a sometimes stormy debate, Mr Heseltine used the promise of 'hundreds of millions of pounds' in subsidies to the coal industry to keep the backbench revolt below danger levels. There was 'a significant new market to go for', he told a sceptical Commons. 'We have made it clear that the best hope for British Coal is to take advantage of the opportunity we have provided.' But a series of interventions by possible rebels indicated that he had not completely calmed fears that the 12 reprieved pits might not survive for more than a year. These fears were played on by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, in a spirited plea to Tory MPs to join Labour in voting down the white paper. Today was the day for Tories who had voiced displeasure at the original pit closure announcement last October to make good the promises they had made five months ago to Britain's mining communities, Mr Cook argued. The debate came as the coal and electricity industries completed signing contracts for the sale of 160m tonnes of coal over five years, leaving the way clear for talks on extra sales aimed at saving the 12 reprieved pits. British Coal yesterday joined Mr Heseltine in admitting it could not forecast how big the extra market would be above the core contract. 'The generators and rest of electricity industry will effectively decide the future for our pits,' the company said. Page 24 National Grid plans Pounds 300m link with Ireland Parliament, Page 15</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: United Airlines revises offer of compensation to shareholders United Airlines, the US carrier days away from putting the world's biggest employee buy-out to the vote, yesterday announced a last-minute change to the compensation deal for existing shareholders. It said it was dipping into company resources and producing another Dollars 300m in cash to replace the proceeds it had hoped to receive from selling a tranche of preference shares. Under the deal, to be put to a shareholder vote on July 12, employees will eventually gain control of United by trading Dollars 4.9bn worth of labour concessions over the next 12 years for a minimum of 55 per cent of the company's stock. Existing shareholders are to be offered a mix of cash and new United shares for the stock they now hold. Part of the cash is to be raised through the sale of preferred stock and loan notes. Yesterday, however, United acknowledged that it had been unable to sell as much preferred stock as it had hoped. Merrill Lynch, lead manager, said the issue had been aimed primarily at retail investors, and there had been insufficient time to market the whole of it at the target price with the July 12 deadline looming. As a result, the contribution coming from United's internal resources will rise by Dollars 12.20 a share to Dollars 38. Merrill Lynch said using the company's cash balances was a less expensive alternative to lowering the price of the preferred stock. On a positive note, United said it had reached 'a tentative understanding' to settle shareholder litigation pending in the Delaware Chancery Court relating to its recapitalisation plan. It also said that Institutional Shareholder Services, an independent adviser to institutional investors on proxy voting, corporate governance and other shareholder issues, had recommended its clients to vote in favour of the plan.</p>

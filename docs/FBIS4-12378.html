			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amjad Mu'alla] </F>   [Text] Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has  called on Jordan to continue its good offices to help Yemen  overcome its crisis, and emphasized that the Yemeni leadership  is eager to implement the accord document that was signed in  Amman.    In a telephone interview with AL-DUSTUR in Aden yesterday,  he  emphasized that Jordan has played, and is still playing, a very  important role in calming the situation in Yemen, whether  through its active participation in the joint military committee  or through its relentless efforts to bring the views of the  conflicting parties closer together.    On the recent meeting between Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah  Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Salalah, al-'Attas  said the meeting achieved good results and the president and his  deputy managed, in their closed meeting, to discuss a host of  issues concerning the situation in Yemen and reached practical  solutions for these issues.    He added: We hope that this meeting will open the way for  convening other meetings at the level of Yemeni leadership. The  Yemeni prime minister emphasized that the meeting between the  president and his deputy is in itself a national achievement.    Answering a question on the possibility of a military  explosion in Yemen in light of the charges exchanged by the  parties regarding shipments of weapons to Yemen, al-'Attas  emphasized that all parties in Yemen do not want the situation  to reach the point of explosion, and all are prepared to do  whatever they can to avoid bloodshed.    The Yemeni prime minister said the situation is improving in  Yemen, and stressed that the government meeting, planned to be  held in Ta'zz today will take place and will discuss  implementation of decisions made by the previous government  meeting held in Aden. These decisions focussed on implementation  of the accord document.    He added that the government will adopt a number of other  decisions to complete the mechanism through which the document  will be implemented.    Meanwhile, AL-DUSTUR made a telephone contact with Ahmad  Jabir 'Afif, chairman of the Yemeni national dialogue committee,  in which he emphasized that solving the Yemeni crisis is in the  hands of the Yemenis, and this can be done through implementing  the accord document.    'Afif said the committee, which was formed from outside the  ruling coalition parties, unanimously agrees that the accord  document should be implemented, and that it is useless to go  anywhere outside Yemen.    'Afif criticized the ruling coalition for ignoring the  national dialogue committee at this stage and for not informing  the committee of developments.    He said that during its today's meeting, the committee will  discuss the practices of the coalition partners, and will convey  its view to the coalition leaders. He emphasized that these  practices have absented the role of the dialogue committee, and  the committee became unaware of what is going on. He said the  committee does not know in whose interest it is being absented.</p>

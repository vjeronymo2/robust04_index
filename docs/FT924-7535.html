			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / GM in mutual aidplan with suppliers GENERAL Motors, the US carmaker undergoing a radical restructuring, is trying to entice some of its parts manufacturers into an unusual form of co-operation, which would involve the suppliers setting up operations inside GM plants and using GM labour. The scheme, which GM calls 'strategic insourcing', would help the company to slash costs in its loss-making North American operations. It is being put forward by Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who was appointed earlier this year as GM's head of worldwide purchasing. Mr Lopez has demanded that many GM suppliers cut their prices, but he offers long-term supply contracts to those that meet the quality specifications. The insourcing scheme covers certain high quality suppliers which GM is prepared to offer additional business. Mr Lopez has proposed that these companies be given factory space free of charge in under-used GM plants, rather than expanding their own facilities. In return, the supplier would agree to employ GM workers currently in the company's jobs bank. The bank, which is part of GM's three-year labour agreement with the United Auto Workers union, guarantees UAW members who are laid off full pay indefinitely. The workers would remain GM employees but would be paid by the suppliers at the prevailing GM union wage rates - which in general are higher than those of non-unionised supplier companies.</p>

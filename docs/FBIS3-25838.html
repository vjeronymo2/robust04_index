Li Zemin, Wan Xueyuan, Liu Feng, Chai  Songyue, Lu Zhangong, Xu Yongqing, Liu Xirong, Liang Pingbo, Si  Daxiao, Xu Xingguan, Long Anding, Zhang Qimei, Xu Zhichun, Sun  Jiaxian, and other provincial leaders attended yesterday's  meeting. Li Zemin spoke and Chai Songyue gave a summing-up of  the conference, expressing his opinions on the reform of the  fiscal and taxation system as well as enterprise and  agricultural problems, which were matters of great interest.    In the reform of five major systems, reform of the fiscal  and  taxation system is the one with great difficulties and  encompassing a wide range of issues. Practicing the financial  system of separated taxes and gradually bringing the "contract  system" to an end is not only a significant reform in fiscal and  taxation work, but will also lead to crucial changes in the  behavior of the government and enterprises. The current reform  of the taxation system, which has introduced the value-added tax  and unified income tax rates, is extremely indispensable to  bringing about a system of fair taxation and thus creating a  market environment for fair competition among enterprises.  Although the reform of the fiscal and taxation system has  caused some problems that cannot be ignored in the economic work  in the near term, what is more important is that it has offered  a rare opportunity to step up Zhejiang's economic growth and  improve its economic quality. We should all the more be aware  of its beneficial effect on long-term development, and stand on  a higher point and take a longer view. We should often approach  the issue of reforming the fiscal and taxation system with a  positive view and thus grasp its significance, use our brains  frequently, and think of a way to practice it; whoever grasps  this issue and takes the earlier initiative will benefit sooner.    The fundamental way out for running enterprises well under  the new situation still lies in deepening reform. From a  long-term point of view, we should strive to attain the goal and  fulfill the requirement of establishing a modern enterprise  system. At the moment, we should run existing enterprises well  as the preparatory and fundamental work for the establishment of  a modern enterprise system in the future. In light of the fact  that Zhejiang's enterprises increased their losses last year and  some of them have failed to reverse their loss-making situation  for a long time, in proceeding with reform this year we should  firmly follow the principle of the circulation of equities in a  market economy to promote reform bravely and strive for a new  breakthrough this year. Enterprise reform is the microeconomic  basis of economic reform as well as the key to the success or  failure of this year's reform. In approaching the issue of  enterprise reform, we should further emancipate our minds and  feel freer in taking action.    To put agriculture on the course of a market economy, we  still have to keep exploring in the course of practice.  Developing high-yield, high-efficiency, and fine-quality  agriculture as well as developing "large-scale agriculture"  which incorporates the distribution system is the direction we  should adhere to. Since Zhejiang deregulated prices of farm  produce, the problem of ignoring the government's guidance and  administration has existed in the past few years. This year, we  must redress abnormal phenomenon in agriculture, such as large  area of uncultivated land and unattended fertile farmland. We  should reverse some cadres' view that the government is of no  help to agricultural production, particularly grain production,  and thus let it drift. We should also study and improve ways to  guide peasants' work and must not further increase their burden.  We should strengthen management over the supplies of the means  of agricultural production to cut the cost and increase the  returns of growing grain.    The tasks in this year's economic work and reform are  arduous. We should look to the following: The organization and  establishment of local financial institutions is of important  significance to local economic development in the future, all  localities and departments in charge of financing should do more  preparatory work for the organization and establishment of  cooperative banks in urban and rural areas -- making plans first  and strive to take a significant step towards this goal this  year. We should make good arrangements to ensure supplies on  the market, strive to control commodity prices, and forestall  manmade abrupt price hikes. Meanwhile, we should ensure  industrial production, transport services, traffic safety,  public security, and others around the spring festival in a  down-to-earth manner.    The special meetings on financing, taxation, economic  restructuring, planning, and foreign trade, which were held  simultaneously with the provincial economic work conference,  have also successfully completed their respective major agendas.  Some 1,500 comrades in charge of prefectural, city, and county  governments and departments around the province attended this  conference.</p>

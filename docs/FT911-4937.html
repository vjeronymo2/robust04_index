			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: B&amp;C to float Exco unless buyer can be found 'in a few weeks' BRITISH AND Commonwealth will opt for a public flotation of Exco, its money broking arm, unless a buyer emerges 'in a few weeks', according to the administrators of the failed financial services group. It would be the first flotation of a company out of administration since Rolls Royce was floated from insolvency in 1971. 'Exco is an unusual animal that does not sit easily with one parent but would sit well in the Stock Exchange,' said Mr Stephen Adamson, an Ernst and Young partner and B&amp;C's senior administrator. Exco is making pre-tax profits of Pounds 28m on an annual basis and is considered one of B&amp;C's most valuable assets. A sale or flotation could add about Pounds 200m to the Pounds 415m raised so far from the sale of assets since B&amp;C was put into administration last June in one of Britain's largest corporate failures. Mr Adamson also said the administrators hoped to make their first repayments to creditors late this year after agreeing a 'scheme of arrangement' that would govern how B&amp;C's assets were to be distributed. There were substantial advantages to proceeding with such a scheme as opposed to a liquidation of assets, he said. B&amp;C owed about Pounds 1bn to unsecured creditors in June and a further Pounds 320m of convertible unsecured loan stock which is subordinated to other creditors in a wind up. The repayment scheme would establish a formula to repay creditors when B&amp;C assets were sold and would operate over several years. Mr Adamson said the administrators could not say how much the initial repayments would amount to at this stage. Holders of preference and ordinary shares were unlikely to see any return, the administrators said in a letter to shareholders and creditors. Included in the Pounds 415m raised is Pounds 100m on deposit at the Bank of England which was part of the proceeds of the sale of Gartmore Investment to Banque Indosuez. The administrators were seeking legal advice as to whether creditors of B&amp;C Holdings or B&amp;C Finance had first call in this deposit. Mr Peter Phillips, a joint administrator, said he was expecting a ruling on liability next week in B&amp;C's litigation against Quadrex Holdings and Samuel Montagu. The Pounds 200m claim follows Quadrex's failure to complete an agreed Pounds 280m purchase of the wholesale broking division of Mercantile House by February 1988. He denied B&amp;C had held talks about an out-of-court settlement with Midland Bank, which is Samuel Montagu's parent, or the merchant bank which advised Quadrex. Following the collapse in March of efforts to sell British and Commonwealth Merchant Bank to Bank of Cukurova, part of the Turkish industrial group, the administrators are still seeking a buyer. However Mr Adamson said he realised the climate for selling banks was difficult and that the administrators were considering a 'voluntary arrangement' with creditors under the insolvency act. Creditors, who are owed a total of Pounds 300m, would be able to receive some payment on account immediately they agreed an arrangement and would receive the balance over a period of time.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARAMOUNT AGREES TO SELL FINANCE UNIT TO FORD;  </P> <P> $3.35-BILLION DEAL MAY HELP FIRM BUY MORE COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES  </P> <P> Paramount Communications, taking the last step to becoming a pure media and  entertainment concern, said Thursday that it has agreed to sell its big finance  arm to Ford Motor Co. for $3.35 billion.  </P> <P> The sale of Associates Corp., the nation's third-largest independent finance  company, will bring Paramount net proceeds of $2.7 billion and an after-tax  profit of $1.3 billion, Paramount said. Much of the money may soon be used to  carry out Paramount's plans to expand by acquiring other communications  companies, analysts said.  </P> <P> The sale is "the last step in our strategic development into a pure  communications company," Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis said in a  statement. "It is our intention to aggressively build these core businesses and  accelerate our growth worldwide."  </P> <P> The deal will greatly expand Ford's financial services operations, a goal that  the auto company has had for some time. With plenty of money to spend and  growing confidence about its abilities to manage a financial service firm, Ford  has lately considered a number of big acquisitions in the financial services  area.  </P> <P> While Associates is largely a consumer finance business, analysts noted that  its commercial finance operations are heavily involved in providing loans for  large trucks and trailers. In this, it will fit well within Ford's Financial  Services Group, which also has emphasized truck financing.  </P> <P> In a statement, Ford Chairman Donald E. Peterson said Associates has an  "excellent strategic fit with our existing financial services business and  provides the basis for meaningful growth through an expanded product line."  </P> <P> The Associates' current chairman, Reece A. Overcash, will continue in the post,  reporting to Kenneth Whipple, president of Ford Financial Services Group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Price in Middle  </P> <P> The Associates' consumer business includes real estate secured loans, bank  credit cards, direct installment and revolving credit loans, mortgage banking  and home relocation services.  </P> <P> Analysts said the price was in the middle of the expected range. At a meeting  in June, Paramount's Davis told analysts that an estimate of $2.5 billion was  too low and that $5 billion was too high.  </P> <P> "It's an OK price," said an investment banker who was familiar with the  transaction but did not represent either party.  </P> <P> The announcement came just three days after Paramount gave up a bitter,  seven-week quest to take over Time Inc.  </P> <P> In Paramount's court battle with its target, Time released a confidential  document in which a Paramount investment bank, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,  speculated that the sale of Associates could bring proceeds of $2.66 billion.  </P> <P> Wall Street sources said four to six companies made firm bids for Associates.  Among those that looked the finance firm over were domestic and Japanese  insurance companies, the credit arms of more than one auto maker and General  Electric Co., the sources said.  </P> <P> GE Capital is the largest U.S. finance company, followed by Household Finance.  </P> <P> Paramount has recently been rumored as a possible takeover candidate, and the  extra cash from the deal may make it more attractive to a would-be acquirer.  </P> <P> J. Kendrick Noble Jr., analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said he had  expected that Paramount might wait until it was prepared to make its next  acquisition before it sold Associates.  </P> <P> Paramount's stock rose again in composite trading on the New York Stock  Exchange, closing Thursday at $59.25 a share, up $1.125.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Operating Income Tripled  </P> <P> Last year, Associates reported gross revenue of more than $2 billion and  operating income of $373 million, or 46% of Paramount's total. The company  posted record income for 12 years in a row.  </P> <P> Based in Dallas, the firm was founded in 1918 and acquired by Paramount in  1968. It has provided Paramount -- formerly called Gulf &amp; Western --  insurance against downturns in Paramount's more volatile entertainment  businesses.  </P> <P> Between 1982 and 1988, operating income more than tripled -- to $372.4 million  from $99.4 million.  </P> <P> Yet Davis had also expressed frustration that Wall Street had not valued  Paramount's stock as high as he believed it deserved because the company was an  amalgam of financial services and communications properties.  </P></p>

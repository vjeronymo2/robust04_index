			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Growth in sales of new cars slows The growth in new-car sales has slowed during April from the strong pace set in the first three months of the year. The car industry is still unclear, however, whether the market is simply drawing breath after the unexpectedly firm start to the year. 'We could not forecast what the tax increases would do to consumer demand, and it is still too hard to read,' Mr Paddy Byrne, sales director for Ford of Britain, said yesterday. 'My personal hunch is that there has perhaps been a short-term reaction, but it may be a 45 to 60-day wonder as people reassess their income.' Ford estimates new-car registrations have grown by about 5 per cent year-on-year in April, which would be the slowest rate for several months. In the first three months of the year new-car sales - at 529,436 - were 16.8 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year, a rate of growth well ahead of the industry's most optimistic forecasts for the year. On the evidence of reports from key Ford dealers throughout Britain, Mr Byrne said the pattern of demand remained patchy. 'It is like talking to people in different countries. Some were saying that they had had an interesting increase in retail demand, others said they were having a good month for sales to fleets.' Ford was persuaded by the strength of overall demand in the first quarter to raise its forecast for new-car registrations in the full year to 1.95m, an increase of nearly 10 per cent on 1993. Any hesitancy in April is not forcing it to revise this figure downwards.</p>

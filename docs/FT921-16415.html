			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Observer: Trouble-shooter Glad to see that Peter Grant, the ex-Lazards banker parachuted in to the chairman's seat at the deeply-indebted Lep Group, is not letting its troubles spoil his new year fun. Yesterday's formal announcement that he had replaced John Read, architect of Lep's over-ambitious growth, included a contact number. But when Observer tried to button-hole Lep's would-be saviour, Grant had gone shooting and was not expected back for another day or two. This laid-back behaviour may be acceptable in some City merchant bank parlours, but it is hardly calculated to reassure nervous shareholders. Lep's shares have fallen by another third since the first news of Grant's appointment six weeks ago. The group is without a chief executive and the job of selling its National Guardian subsidiary - the key to its survival - is in the hands of a little-known US subsidiary of France's Credit Agricole. Quite a challenge for most chairmen.</p>

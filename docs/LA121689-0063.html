			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE'RE WATCHING THE DEATH OF HOPE;  </P> <P> REFUGEES: THE VIETNAMESE SHIPPED BACK TO HANOI BY HONG KONG ONLY WANTED THE  FREEDOM THEY COULD SEE DAILY OUTSIDE THEIR BARBED WIRE.  </P> <P> Each broken-hearted Vietnamese refugee being rushed Tuesday onto a plane  heading from Hong Kong to Hanoi was given $30 -- a consolation prize,  compliments of the authorities in the British colony.  </P> <P> But the refugees, who went unwillingly back to Vietnam, had already tasted  freedom. They saw it through the barbed-wire fences as Chinese children laughed  on their way to school. They watched it gleam on the tall, glassy skyscrapers  that towered over their own tin-roofed huts. They heard it spoken on their  radios; freedom danced on the Chinese-language television screen. Freedom  taunted them, but proved forever elusive.  </P> <P> Pinned on my wall are photos of refugee children staring out from behind the  bars of their camps with wide, hungry eyes. They remind me of myself, 15 years  ago a Vietnamese refugee in the Philippines and later in Guam. I remember days  spent staring out through those fences toward real homes in the distance,  wishing that my family and I could be there instead of inside muggy army tents.  The children in the pictures are waiting for the same things that I did. They  want to live where I do now.  </P> <P> If the British resume forced repatriation early next year, as planned, they can  expect riots, fire, bloodshed, suicides in the camps. For when the grand prize  of freedom is taken away, no consolation prize can compensate. The crowded bunk  beds, the piled-up feces, the stench and murderous heat, the cholera outbreaks,  the years of waiting, all these horrid conditions and indignities, once  endurable, suddenly become maddening. Endurance may be a characteristically  Vietnamese trait, but my countrymen endure only when hopes and dreams are  nurtured in their hearts. Take away those dreams and chances are they will  commit desperate, violent acts.  </P> <P> Displayed in the refugee camps are signs that read: "We would rather die than  go back," and "Better dead than Red." They are written with blood.  </P> <P> Waiting has become fruitless. Hope for freedom is but a one-way ticket "home"  -- home to face the assured cruelty and revenge from Vietnamese authorities.  </P> <P> Condemned is he who is branded an "economic refugee," for he has no chance of  resettlement in a third country. Only "political refugees" are considered  legitimate refugees, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has declared in faraway  London. Only a minuscule number of the boat people have successfully defined  themselves for Hong Kong authorities as political refugees. The rest are to be  sent home. But were you to look at those who stare out from the fences with an  unbanishable hunger for freedom, you could never know the difference between a  Vietnamese political refugee and an economic one. And how could anyone make  such a distinction among thousands of children living in those camps?  </P> <P> The labels don't fit. The differences are apparent only to those who make up  rules and regulations that brush the majority off as "illegal immigrants." But  all of the refugees fleeing communist Vietnam will be punished when they  return, no matter if they are from the north or the south, ethnic Chinese or  not, political or economic refugees.  </P> <P> Some of the refugees would argue that the fact that they took flight itself is  the most political act imaginable. By leaving, they defied an oppressive  communist system known for its human rights violations. The refugees would tell  you that they did not escape for better bread or rice. They had heard that tens  of thousands of Vietnamese perished on the South China Sea; they understood the  odds. They wanted more than bread; they wanted a life without persecution, a  life where no authority has the power to move them and their families about.  </P> <P> "We want freedom," writes a young Vietnamese man asking for help. "They jailed  my father and forced my siblings and me to work in the isolated mountainous  areas." He is the son of a sergeant who once served as a medic in the South  Vietnamese army in Danang. "If you could save me," he writes, "I will devote my  entire life to the cause of freedom."  </P> <P> But like the 46,000 people due to be sent back to Hanoi next year, this young  man will likely spend his future in those mountainous areas from which he so  desperately tried to escape. He will spend his life longing for freedom, not  serving it.  </P> <P> I remember my bus ride to the Guam airport en route to the United States years  ago. I was elated; I couldn't sit still. The cool, sweet wind rushed through  the windows and I thought I felt freedom whispering on my skin then. I wish I  could share that experience with this young man and those like him. Instead I  mourn for my countrymen's fate. I can't begin to imagine the bitterness they  feel as they take their dark journey toward an ominous Vietnam.  </P></p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Keating puts off poll on republic AUSTRALIA'S re-elected Labor prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, yesterday ruled out a referendum on the abolition of the monarchy until after the next election, due in mid-1996. Mr Keating said Labor remained convinced that Australians would not be 'masters of our own destiny' until the 205-year-old link with the British crown had been broken. However, constitutional change would require a long period of public debate and negotiations with state governments, which would inevitably take several years. Mr Keating hoped the process could be completed by 2001, the centenary of the federation of the continent's six British colonies, which many Australians regard as the foundation of modern Australia. The prime minister's comments are in line with Labor's 12-year-old commitment to gradual progress towards the abolition of the monarchy, which was confirmed by the party's policymaking conference in 1991. Mr Keating announced last month that Labor would appoint a committee to draw up plans for the transition to a republic, but the party did not seek to make the future of the monarchy an election issue. Confirmation of the timetable for constitutional change will disappoint the republican movement, which gained strength last year after British criticism of Mr Keating's handling of a visit by the Queen. Republicans will also criticise Mr Keating for backing down on a promise to remove the British union flag from the Australian flag. The prime minister said a change of flag would have to await the establishment of the republic. In his first post-election press conference, Mr Keating moved to patch up relations with Britain. He said Mr John Major, the British prime minister, had congratulated him on Labor's election victory.</p>

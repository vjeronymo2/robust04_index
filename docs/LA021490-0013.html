			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STRONG WINDS TO CHILL HEARTS  </P> <P> Sweethearts, children and other tender living things should bundle up today  against a cold blast of Siberian air.  </P> <P> Blustery winds up to 35 m.p.h. have been working their way from the Bering Sea  down California and will pass through San Diego today, said Wilbur Shigehara,  forecaster for the National Weather Service.  </P> <P> "It's a reminder that it is still winter, and spring is over a month away,"  Shigehara said. "The good news is it's going to be sunny, but the bad news is  it's going to be windy and cold."  </P> <P> "These winds can be ferocious. Flying small airplanes and sailing can be  dangerous today," he said. A small-craft advisory for gale-force winds has been  posted. In the desert, residents may get sand- as well as wind-blasted.  </P> <P> The strong winds will be accompanied by low temperatures, Shigehara said,  adding that the thermometer is not expected to rise above 60 degrees anywhere  in San Diego County.  </P> <P> The winds will die down tonight, but "it's going to get so cold tonight and  Thursday night, we have posted a frost advisory that will extend almost to the  water's edge," he said.  </P> <P> Point Loma, Del Mar, Carmel Valley and La Jolla growers and residents should  protect frost-sensitive plants from temperatures that are expected to dip as  low as 31 degrees.  </P> <P> In inland areas, including Escondido, Bonsall and the San Pasqual Valley,  citrus, avocado and blooming strawberry crops will be subject to frost and  temperatures ranging from 23 to 35. Farmers should keep a close watch on  temperatures through Thursday night, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> The cold may also prompt city and county shelters to expand their services to  the homeless. The city's Office of Emergency Services opens a makeshift shelter  in Balboa Park's Municipal Gymnasium and gives permission to private shelters  to expand their services during unusually cold weather.  </P> <P> The county Office of Disaster Preparedness opens the California National Guard  armories at Vista and El Cajon if temperatures of 35 or lower are expected.  </P> <P> Despite the cold, skies will be fair and sunny through Friday, with a chance of  showers on the weekend, Shigehara said.  </P></p>

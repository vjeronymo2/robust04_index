			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial report] Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese  31 January morning edition received via Nikkei Telecom Database,  carries a 200-character report noting THE SUNDAY TIMES article  on Japan's possession of nuclear weapons cited in second ref.  The text of the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN report, filed by London  correspondent Yuzo Waki, is as follows:    "The 30 January edition of THE SUNDAY TIMES, an influential  British Sunday paper, frontpages a report saying `Japan is going  nuclear under the arms expansion race in Asia.' The report  says: 1) The British Defense Ministry conveyed to the British  Prime Minister's Office its concern over `Japan being forced to  abandon its non-nuclear stance'; 2) a document submitted in  January to the joint Intelligence Committee, the British  Government's main security body, notes Japan has all the  equipment and technology necessary for an early deployment of  nuclear weapons; and 3) an expert who read the document said  `Japan could have already acquired its own nuclear bombs, and  all they would need to do is to select adequate amounts of  plutonium.'"</p>

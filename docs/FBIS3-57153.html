These documents include an appeal from Kronid Lyubarskiy,  the  well known defender of human rights and first deputy chief  editor of NOVOYE VREMYA, to General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik,  which we publish today.    I notify you that citizen Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy,  born 1946, has committed a crime under Article 71 of the Russian  Federation Criminal Code: "Propaganda of War." As is well  known, the text of the article states: "Propaganda of war, in  whatever form it may be conducted, is punishable by imprisonment  for a term of between three and eight years."    The circumstances of the case are as follows. The "Pisatel"  limited-liability company and the "Bukvitsa" publishing  cooperative produced a book by citizen V.V. Zhirinovskiy  entitled "The Last Dash to the South" in a print run of 75,000  copies. The book was signed to press 28 September 1993 and  printed at Moscow Printing Plant No 13 (30 Denisovskiy Street,  107005 Moscow) as order No 456.    In the book the author propagandizes the unleashing of  aggressive war against Russia's neighbors Turkey, Iran, and  Afghanistan. It is this, it transpires from the text, that is  reflected in the very title of the book.    In particular, the book says:    "I have already begun to develop my own geopolitical  concept.  I don't want to give it my name, the Zhirinovskiy formula, say,  but the last 'dash' to the south and an outlet for Russia to the  shores of the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea are really  the task of saving the Russian nation" (page 63).    "The idea emerged of the last `dash' -- last because it will  probably be the last repartition of the world and it must be  carried out in a state of shock therapy, suddenly, swiftly, and  effectively" (page 64).    "The last `dash' to the south. I dream of Russian soldiers  washing their boots in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and  switching to summer uniform forever. Lightweight boots,  lightweight trousers, short-sleeved open-necked shirts with no  tie, lightweight caps. And a small modern Russian assault rifle  produced by the Izhevsk plant. These assault rifles are much  better than UZI's. So any platoon of Russian soldiers can  impose order anywhere" (page 66).    "...we will make this last `dash' to the south. We badly  need it, it is medicine that we must take. Medicine is not  always sweet. Some people in Kabul, Tehran, and Ankara may not  like this. But millions of people will feel better as a result"  (page 67).    "Our Army will perform this task. This will be a method of  ensuring the survival of the nation as a whole, it will be the  basis for the renaissance of the Russian Army. New armed forces  can be reborn only as a result of a combat operation. The Army  cannot grow stronger in military commissariats and barracks. It  needs a goal, a task" (page 70).    "The pros of carrying out this operation considerably  outweigh the cons which may naturally be perceived. And the  Russian Army also needs this so that our guys can flex their  muscle, tired as they are of `hazing,' instead of sitting around  in barracks, in the depths of Russia, waiting for the end of  their term of service, not knowing where the enemy is, who the  adversary is, or what they need to prepare themselves morally  and physically for. This would be a cleansing for us all" (page  75).    "May Russia successfully accomplish its last 'dash' to  the south. I see Russian soldiers preparing for this last  southern campaign. I see Russian commanders at the headquarters  of Russian divisions and armies tracing the itineraries for the  movement of troop formations and the destinations of the  itineraries. I see aircraft at airbases in southern districts  of Russia. I see submarines surfacing off the shores of the  Indian Ocean and landing ships approaching shores along which  Russian Army soldiers are already marching, infantry fighting  vehicles are driving, and huge masses of tanks are moving.  (The italics are V. Zhirinovskiy's.) At long last Russia  completes its last military campaign" (pages 142-143).    It is perfectly obvious that the above remarks constitute  every indication of a full-blown crime under Article 71 of the  Russian Federation Criminal Code.    There are grounds for believing that this is not the only  criminal episode on the part of V. Zhirinovskiy. Practically  all the mass media reported V. Zhirinovskiy's statements  regarding the possibility of delivering nuclear strikes against  Japan and Germany and his threats to "give them a new Hiroshima"  and a "new Chernobyl." V. Zhirinovskiy made these statements  orally, so they are not documented. However, it should not be  difficult to find journalists who witnessed these episodes and  to check whether these criminal episodes did indeed take place  and, if so, in what circumstances.    On the basis of the above I ask you to open a criminal case  against citizen Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy under Article 71  of the Russian Federation Criminal Code. The crime envisaged by  this article ranks among particularly dangerous state crimes.  Consequently V. Zhirinovskiy's actions affect the vital  interests of all citizens, myself included, since they  jeopardize everyone's personal safety.    The election of V. Zhirinovskiy as a State Duma deputy,  which, incidentally, took place after he committed the crime,  cannot serve as grounds for refusing to open a criminal case.  As is well known, this question has already been the subject of  judicial consideration at the trial on the SCSE [State Committee  for the State of Emergency] case in relation to defendants A.I.  Lukyanov and V.A. Starodubtsev.    At the court sitting 5 January 1994 the presiding judge,  A.T.  Ukolov, deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Supreme Court  Military Collegium, explaining his refusal to terminate the  criminal case regarding Lukyanov, cited Article 98 of the  Russian Federation Constitution. According to this article, the  immunity of Federal Assembly deputies is not universal but  limited and consists merely in the fact that deputies "cannot be  detained, arrested, or searched unless detained at the scene of  a crime, nor can they be subjected to a body search except as  provided by federal law in order to guarantee other people's  safety." The fact that deputies enjoy immunity does not  preclude the opening of a criminal case and the carrying out of  preliminary and judicial investigations regarding a deputy.    The General Prosecutor's Office did not protest this  decision  by the Russian Federation Supreme Court Military Collegium and  therefore showed solidarity with it. Since the criminal  prosecution of State Duma Deputy A.I. Lukyanov and Federation  Council Member V.A. Starodubtsev has not been stopped, then, in  accordance with the principle of citizens' equality before the  law (Article 19 of the Russian Federation Constitution), nothing  can be a barrier to the criminal prosecution of State Duma  Deputy V. Zhirinovskiy.    If the question of arresting V. Zhirinovskiy arises in the  future, the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office can  ask the State Duma to strip Deputy V. Zhirinovskiy of his  immunity under Article 98 of the Russian Federation Constitution.    I do not know V.V. Zhirinovskiy's place of residence, but it  can easily be established via the staff of the Russian  Federation State Duma.    I await your reply within the legally prescribed deadline.    Respectfully    [Signed] K. Lyubarskiy</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: BLACKMAR'S LONG DRIVE WINS TITLE  </P> <P> Phil Blackmar outdistanced two former San Diego State players to win the Long  Drive title at the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open Tuesday. Blackmar, who won  $3,500, drove 270 yards to defeat Lon Hinkle's 266 yards and Greg Twiggs' drive  of 262.  </P> <P> Hinkle won $2,000 and Twiggs received $1,000 in the contest held on the first  tee of the South Course at Torrey Pines.  </P> <P> Nick Price won the Shootout with an eagle-three on the 18th hole of the South  Course and won $3,000. Bob Tway was second and Craig Stadler, who played at La  Jolla High School, was third.  </P> <P> Lynn Mikulus, who played at Grossmont High School, is the second-round leader  of the University of Arizona Dominos Pizza Classic after shooting a three-under  69. Mikulus, who is competing as an individual and who's score does not count  for her Arizona State team, has a one-shot lead over teammate Missy Parr.  </P> <P> Even without Mikulus, Arizona State is the team leader with a 596, five shots  ahead of UCLA. San Diego State's Joann Walker is tied for seventh at 148 and  the Aztecs are eighth with a 614. U.S. International is 12th in the 18-team  tournament.  </P> <P> PADRES  </P> <P> The Padres completed their spring-training roster by signing free-agent pitcher  Bruce Tanner to a minor-league contract, and will invite him to spring  training. Tanner, the son of former major league manager Chuck Tanner, was 1-6  with a 2.77 ERA last season with Phoenix and Tacoma of the Pacific Coast  League. Tanner joins Roger Smithberg, who was 7-7, 4.47 ERA at Las Vegas last  season, as the only non-roster pitchers invited to camp.  </P> <P> MEN'S BASKETBALL  </P> <P> San Diego State center Marty Dow underwent successful surgery Tuesday to repair  a partially torn tendon in his right foot and ankle, SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg  said.  </P> <P> "It wasn't nearly as torn as they thought," Brandenburg said. "They didn't have  to do as extreme of a surgery as they thought, and the rehabilitation time will  be the same."  </P> <P> Dow, who is out for the season, was averaging 12 points and six rebounds a  game.  </P> <P> SDSU guard Arthur Massey missed practice with a pinched nerve in his neck.  </P> <P> Massey is expected back in time for Thursday's game with Air Force at the San  Diego Sports Arena, as is guard Kevin Honaker, who missed practice Monday with  a sore calf.

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts expect smaller Florida orange crop THE 1993-94 Florida orange crop could be as low as 160m boxes or as high as 190m, but most analysts' estimates are concentrated in the 165m- to 175m-box range, Reuter reports from New York. That is well below last year's figure of 186.5m 90-lb boxes issued by US Department of Agriculture, which was the state's third largest orange harvest. Analysts said brisk activity on New York Cotton Exchange's frozen concentrated orange juice futures market was linked to recent buying ahead of USDA's report, due for release on October 12. Ms Celeste Georgakis, first vice president futures specialist with Dean Witter, said uncertainty would continue until the release of the estimate. 'But most of the consensus is still pointing toward 165m to 185m,' she said. 'I feel the estimate could come in the mid-170m box area.' Factors that could hurt this season's production included a late cold snap last winter in Florida, which was reported to have killed some bloom, and some outbreaks of blossom blight disease, according to analysts.</p>

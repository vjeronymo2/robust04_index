			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria April 9 SAPA -- The rightwing "burgerraad"  [citizens' council] of Pretoria says that because of the history  of the Union Buildings it would be unwise to inaugurate the new  state president at this venue. In a statement sent to the main  South African political players, the South African Police,  foreign embassies and the media, the burgerraad called for an  alternative site to be used. A copy of the statement sent to  SAPA said no-one could guarantee security at an event which was  expected to draw the biggest crowd ever in the history of the  country.    It called for an alternative site to be used, saying no-one  could guarantee security at an event which was expected to draw  the biggest crowd ever in the history of the country. [as  received]    The burgerraad argued that most of the people living in the  vicinity of the Union Buildings were Afrikaners and the  inauguration could lead to "bitterness" among these citizens.  Unlike a sports stadium, the Union Buildings could not  accommodate a massive crowd of people. Up to 300,000 could  attend the inauguration on May 9 or 10, it said. Also, the  union building was an ideal place for a sniper attack and crowd  control would be next to impossible.</p>

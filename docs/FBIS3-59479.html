			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov by Dragan </F> Jovanovic; place and date not given: "We Are All Captives"]    [Text] For Macedonians, Kiro Gligorov has already become  more than the head of the Macedonian state. He has made his  place in Macedonian history as the statesman who finally  accomplished what Goce Delcev [Macedonian politician in 19th  century, founder of the terrorist Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization that fought against Ottoman  authority, and for Macedonian autonomy within a Balkan  confederation] had dreamt of. Everybody will tell you so, the  Macedonian intellectuals, classic and alternative, as well as  the opposition leaders, and the so-called ordinary citizens.  "May our state live as long as possible," is what everybody  says, a peasant women from a village in Galicani, as well as a  clerk from Skopje. President Gligorov is not only in the pink  of health, but he is also the statesman of the country in which  one shoots only on the New Year's eve and when hunting ducks om  Lake Ohrid. Gligorov acknowledges that NIN is an old friend of  his.    Having heard that I am going to interview Gligorov,  economist  Dr. Ljubomir Madzar tells me in NIN's editorial office: "If  there is any wise politician in the Balkans, then it is Kiro  Gligorov."    [Jovanovic] I listened to your New Year expose in  parliament, when you made a concise assessment of everything  that happened in the last three years, particularly in 1993.  Did you forget to say something in that general address to the  Macedonian Parliament and public?    [Gligorov] I certainly missed many things, keeping in mind  that the expose must not be too long, but rather sufficient to  comprise some of the most important things that had happened.  Still, I certainly did omit some things: First of all, I spoke  little about the events taking place north of Macedonia, about  the war that is still going on, and the peace prospects. I  deliberately skipped that topic in my expose, because, right  now, it is really difficult to say anything in that respect. In  certain moments it seems to me that so much blood has already  been shed, that the economic position is so bad, so that the  logical conclusion should be the imminent end of the war.    However, one has to take into consideration the fact that,  unfortunately, a readiness for further conflicts and the  prolongation of the war also exists. I am not sure that, after  everything that has happened in Sarajevo recently, the war might  not perhaps accelerate. That is what I am afraid of. Any war  has its end, but it is sad when one sees what is happening day  after day, how many victims the war has already claimed, all the  devastation, and so forth. As though everybody is certain that  the war will end only when virtually everything that was built  over decades is in ruins. That is something that cannot but be  our concern as well. Not only because the war, as long as it  lasts, can always spread to the surrounding regions and states.  We in Macedonia cannot be at ease, because some of our  perspects for a stronger, more rapid development cannot be  expected while the war is still raging in former Yugoslavia. We  are all captives of that situation. We are all hampered in a  way, in the situation of closed borders, barriers, hate, and so  forth.    I did not state it in my expose, but I think it is important  that, among the Macedonian people, no hate toward the neighbors,  or toward all other peoples with whom we lived, or are still  living -- in the Balkans -- has been created. I think that is  very important. Perhaps, we shall further suffer the  consequences of the sanctions, closed borders, and so forth,  yet, one day when everything comes to an end, we shall be able  to communicate with all the peoples around us without a twinge  of conscience that we hated them, or caused some conflicts. I  think that nobody will be able to say that our behavior was a  contribution to the war becoming even more severe. I think that  is very important. And if there is anything I am satisfied  about, it is exactly that: The Macedonian people has been  looking at the conflict around us with a feeling of sorrow that  something like that is happening, and that we are incapable of  doing anything to make the war stop, or at least to prevent its  continuation. On our part there has been no malice, nor has  there been any sort of warmongering, but there has rather been  the dominant desire not to spoil the relations we developed over  decades while we were living together. Also, we have never  shown a trace of malice toward the neighbor-countries with which  we have never lived in a union, but with which, right now, in  these circumstances, we are communicating much better in terms  of economy, culture, and such things, because we are facing a  time that demands open borders.    Tomorrow, when all this comes to an end, we shall be able  to offer a hand to each party with all our hearts, and to take  part in the collective efforts to stop the Balkans being a blind  alley of Europe, to make Europe stop treating it as a  destructive virus, like something that constantly causes new  problems. I think I probably did not say enough in my expose,  that the further destiny of the Balkans will depend, above all,  on whether democracy will definitely win in each of the Balkan  countries, whether the conditions will be created for a  development that would rest upon democratic institutions. I do  not have any illusions about it, I do not think that it will  happen tomorrow, or that such a process may be accomplished  overnight.    [Jovanovic] What is your estimate of when such a process  will be finished -- in two, three, five years?    [Gligorov] Well, I think that two election periods are  inevitable, yet it is difficult to say how long it will take for  each of the Balkan countries to accomplish that. Because, the  conditions are different from country to country, but  unfortunately, the longer the war is, the worse effects it will  have on those democratic processes. Still, I believe that if  democracy wins in each of the Balkan countries after the war, it  will also mean the victory of the orientation toward the market  economy, which is supposed to have its own social  characteristics, and, on the other hand, also the ecological  characteristics, which are very important for the future.    [Jovanovic] I am quite pleased with your being the first to  mention the importance of ecology....    [Gligorov] If they were to find a place for those elements  in the economy, I think that would be a more painless way for  the Balkans to prepare itself to enter Europe. In that respect,  one needs time, one needs certain phases in the development of  the political and economic systems. All other elements are  quite favorable for the Balkans, which has many things to offer  in terms of culture and the level of civilization, and to  contribute to the enrichment of the European cultural scene. In  addition, one must create a political atmosphere in which all  conflicts and disputes will be settled by political means, in  democratic ways, because conflicts are still an inevitable  thing. One cannot suddenly come into a conflict-free state from  such a conflict-ridden situation, where a war is in full swing.  Conflicts will continue, but what makes the difference is the  means that will be implemented for the settlement of those  conflicts.    [Jovanovic] Since you again mention the war and conflicts,  and your fear of the deterioration of the war in Bosnia, how do  you comment on the famous CIA report, that was denied in the  meantime? According to the report, Slobodan Milosevic is the  only leader in Serbia who is worth talking to. The report  states the possibility of the war spreading to Kosovo. True,  Macedonia is not mentioned, but it says "even further to south."    [Gligorov] I do not believe in the authenticity of that  report. It has already been denied two or three times in  different ways. By itself that report is of no interest to me,  but what I am suspicious about is the rationale of that report.  If we view the United States as the only global strategic  force, then America can only have an interest in the prevention  of the further spread of conflicts in the Balkans. The spread  of the war that is now going on to the north of Macedonia,  sooner or later, means the involvement of two NATO member  countries, that is Greece and Turkey. If the war were to spread  to Kosovo and Macedonia, then it would be a scenario remembered  from the not-so-distant history: The Balkan Wars. I do not see  any interest of the United States in such a war, because it  would shake NATO quite badly, and cause much deeper  repercussions in Europe, in contrast with the current war, which  shakes not only Europe but the whole world, but which, however,  has its own limitations. It is still a war in one enclave, it  cannot generate European consequences in the sense of its  spreading out of the Balkans. However, a war in which Greece,  Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania, and later Turkey were to take part,  would have much more far-reaching consequences, and that is the  sense in which the presence of the U.S. troops here, in  Macedonia, is interpreted, as well as support for the prevention  of the spreading of the war.    [Jovanovic] The following question must be boring for you,  still, when we talk about the Americans, on one hand we have  their military presence in Macedonia, which is at this moment  quite productive, regardless of which angle we view things from,  that is, from which neighboring country's point of view. On the  other hand, the United States has not yet recognized the  Republic of Macedonia. What do you think the United States is  waiting for? Is it only the pressure exerted by the powerful  Greek lobby, or is something else the matter?    [Gligorov] In that respect, the position of the United  States is quite complex, or better to say delicate. Because  Greece is a NATO member-country, and a U.S. ally. On the other  hand, it is obvious from its behavior, that the United States is  aware of the fact that Macedonia is the factor of stability in  the south of the Balkans, which is evidenced by Macedonia's  behavior in general, the way in which it became independent, how  it arranges interethnic relations, what its attitude toward the  neighbors is like, what its attitude toward the European policy  is like, and so forth. For that reason, the United States  helped us in certain situations, they sponsored our admittance  to the United Nations. So, one can say that the United States is  in a very delicate position, and it is probably relying on time  to solve certain things. I do not think there is any other  reason, any other combination that is behind the United States'  reluctance to recognize Macedonia.    [Jovanovic] Nevertheless, that is something that not only  the Serbian regime, but also the Serbian opposition, are  manipulating with. It is claimed the United States wants to  rule from Macedonia.    [Gligorov] Why would the United States rule from Macedonia,  and what for? If that was the case, a much greater number of  U.S. troops would be stationed here, rather than a symbolic  number of troops. And their number is symbolic only to add  political weight to their presence.    [Jovanovic] Is the initiative for Macedonia's admittance  into NATO, which has already been endorsed in parliament,  precisely on the same path -- that the Republic of Macedonia  should provide itself with political integrity on one hand,  while on the other hand with sovereignty?    [Gligorov] Security is built, above all, through membership  in the United Nations.... Each UN member-country is provided  with some general security, because its membership gives it the  possibility to count on the protection of the United Nations.  Second, security is also built through membership in the CSCE.  We have not yet managed to become a member of the CSCE, because  Greece opposes that, but Macedonia has been admitted as an  observer. Third, in terms of security, the two opposing  alliances, that is the Warsaw Pact, and NATO, no longer exist.  So today, after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, the only  collective factor of security is NATO. And seen politically,  our orientation is the European option, that we, in 12, or 15  years, gradually, by phases, enter the European Union. I believe  it will be the orientation of all Balkan countries. On the  other hand, the European Union and NATO are quite compatible  institutions, although they are separate, and have distinct  tasks. Now, our parliament's decision does not mean that  Macedonia will become a NATO member-country tomorrow. It is  more an expression of our determination, a declaration. We know  that, regardless of our aspirations, we cannot be instantly  admitted into NATO.    [Jovanovic] At this moment, the reasons for Greece opposing  the recognition of Macedonia are generally known. However, much  more interesting and unclear are the reasons why Serbia, that is  the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], has not recognized  Macedonia yet. Would you, please, comment on the latest  provocative statements by Mihajlo Markovic from the Socialist  Party of Serbia, saying that "Serbia knows how to make Macedonia  join Serbia, that is Yugoslavia?"    [Gligorov] I would not comment on any of those statements.  I would rather express a feeling: Objectively seen, Serbia and  the FRY have absolutely no reasons not to recognize Macedonia,  and vice versa, Macedonia has no reasons not to recognize the  FRY, and there are no reasons for those acts not to be done  simultaneously. The FRY did that in the case of Slovenia, but  the other side showed no readiness to do the same. It is not my  job to assess what the FRY's interests are.... Considering the  situation not only as a statesman, but also as a man, I think  that the recognition of Macedonia by the FRY at this moment, and  the recognition of the FRY by Macedonia, would be quite helpful,  first of all to the FRY. That would definitely show that the  charges accusing Serbia of preparing to spread the war to the  south, or to ignite a war in Kosovo, are not correct. The  credibility of the peace option that is supported by Milosevic  now, who is stating everywhere that Serbia wants peace, and that  it will do anything for peace, would increase considerably. The  recognition of the Republic of Macedonia would be a right move  that would strongly boost the credibility of Yugoslavia.    [Jovanovic] And, why do you think Milosevic is not making  such a move?    [Gligorov] Probably because of the relations with Greece.  Second, the current period of political life in Serbia makes it  clear to us that there are forces in Serbia that are against the  recognition of Macedonia.    [Jovanovic] Who do you think has a firmer attitude toward  Macedonia: the opposition or Milosevic?    [Gligorov] It is hard to say now, in the time following the  elections. Many things were said in extreme excitement.... We  have slid back into history too much, we are giving too much  significance to what happened in the Balkan wars, going as far  back as to the battle of Kosovo [14th century]. Naturally, in  such an atmosphere, ghosts that we thought had vanished are  reviving. For all time, in 45 years of shared life, I had the  impression that the great majority of Serbs, holding almost  inconsiderably different views, accepted and experienced that  we, the Macedonians, are a different people, and that they  accepted Macedonia as a republic, as a state according to the  Constitution of former Yugoslavia. Now, some ghosts of the past  are reviving....    [Jovanovic] Not only that, but also some ideas about the  Balkan Orthodox confederation, and the Pan-Slav empire....    [Gligorov] I am expressing in advance my doubts in all the  alliances that are founded on religious or ethnic bases. Such  alliances existed in the last two or three centuries, and we  know how they ended up! The foundation of an alliance on an  ethnic or religious basis will bring about a new division of  Europe, and a new division of the Balkans, and, in such  circumstances, the Balkans will suffer most. And therefore I  think that, basically, one should support the general course of  Yeltsin toward the Europeanization of Russia, aiming at Russia's  becoming a part of the European family. Europe will continue to  live as a Europe comprising many nations, and many different  religions.    [Jovanovic] You mean the Europe according to the formula of  Goce Delcev?    [Gligorov] Yes. He said, such a long time ago, that he saw  and understood the world as a community of different peoples  that were competing with one another on the cultural plane.    [Jovanovic] That is actually the project of the European  Union....    [Gligorov] That is right. The project is about the creation  of a common civilization in which no country will lose its  individuality, its identity, and every each of them will  contribute to the common cultural treasure. The Balkans has  many things to say in that respect.    [Jovanovic] Let us go back to the relations with Serbia:  Are there indications that something is changing in those  relations? Was there any half-secret, or secret meeting between  you and Milosevic?    [Gligorov] No, after the meeting in Ohrid we have not met.    [Jovanovic] Are there indications, or initiatives for a new  meeting?    [Gligorov] No. Neither secret, nor public initiatives.    [Jovanovic] It is claimed that one of the reasons for a firm  Serbian attitude toward Macedonia is an unfavorable status of  Serbs in Macedonia. I see that the Macedonian Parliament has  adopted a document, the so-called "Memorandum of Understanding."  What is the essence of that document?    [Gligorov] That is a good document. In fact, it conveys and  accepts everything that, in European documents, refers to the  rights of different nationalities, national minorities, and so  forth. As for the real situation, look, you are staying here,  and you see that, in our society, no nationality, including the  Serbian, has been treated badly. On the contrary. Look at the  TV news, theater, film, you can see everywhere people with  Serbian family names. In Macedonia that is a normal thing.  Even when the Yugoslav People's Army [YNA] left Macedonia, we  held on to that principle. And that principle says that  everybody who wants to stay here, can stay. I would be  satisfied if such a document, regarding the rights of  Macedonians in Serbia, was adopted in Serbia.    [Jovanovic] Let us move to the Macedonian program of  economic stabilization....    [Gligorov] Our program of stabilization is something neither  new, nor unknown, nor original. First of all, if one accepts  the market economy, then several things are to be observed.  Firstly, property. Secondly, the market. Thirdly, opening up  to foreign countries. The market must not be introverted.  Money must not be issued without any control, and not to  mention the use of that money to cover the budget, or  investments.    [Jovanovic] Which is in some countries the strategic  policy....    [Gligorov] Some things are known, and they just need to be  implemented. In such circumstances, the restrictive program  like ours carries a great risk in itself. That must be said.  However, any postponement in the name of our more easily  accomplishing the goal later is a delusion. We know that from  the experience of former Yugoslavia -- the reform would have  been most easily accomplished in 1965. So, one ought to start  radical changes as soon as possible, given the support of the  international financial institutions: the IMF, the World Bank,  the London Bank for Cooperation with Eastern Countries, the  European Community. Without it, the task would be extremely  difficult, and it would go beyond the limit of social endurance,  and one has to take into account that limit as well.    [Jovanovic] You have mentioned the danger of the transfer of  the so-called filthy technologies.    [Gligorov] The transfer of filthy technologies reflects the  attempts of many countries, which is happening right now, to  more easily surmount the problems of development, and that is  the line of least resistance.    For the time being, we can hardly expect that foreign  capital  will suddenly start flowing into Macedonia, and that, regardless  of the aid for development, it will be flowing in through the  pipes of the international financial institutions, the World  Bank, the World Financial Corporation, the Agency for  Development, and other banks. No project will be accepted  without our consent. For that reason, the country should be  organized in such a way that the people must not forget the  ecological factor. Given that awareness, nobody would be able  to sell us some filthy technologies. All institutions that are  engaged in ecology, above all the movement for ecology, should  organize themselves, and get involved in choosing and approving  the projects, so that the destiny of some underdeveloped  countries that lacked experience and caution does not  necessarily have to fall upon Macedonia.    [Jovanovic] At the end. What was the hardest time for you  in these three years, and what were the happiest moments, when  you felt most satisfied?    [Gligorov] There were two hardest moments. First of all,  the moment when the YNA was supposed to leave Macedonia -- the  uncertainty whether we would accomplish an honest agreement,  which would be a good capital for the future, or whether it  would come to a conflict. At the time, the danger existed that,  in such an atmosphere, a wrong move could be made, either on the  part of the YNA, or on somebody else's part, for instance,  somebody could have tried to surround a garrison, or to provoke  some army units. That was a very tense atmosphere, particularly  when the first metal coffins started arriving from the north,  being the aftermath of the initial skirmishes and clashes.  Somehow it happened that those first victims were Macedonians.  In a very short time, 43 soldiers were killed. We had to use  all means to prevent getting involved in the war.    The second moment was the Lisbon declaration, when it looked  as if our fate had been sealed by the decision of the group of  12 in Lisbon: The European Community would recognize Macedonia  as a state only if it were to eliminate the word "Macedonia"  from its name.... That could have also generated some unpleasant  and dangerous events, which could have spread as well,  eventually. That was also a dramatic moment that lasted about  six months. In that period, we were politically and  diplomatically isolated, we were not able to explain our  political position. However, everything was settled at the  meeting in Edinburgh six months later, in December 1992.    [Jovanovic] And when did you feel most satisfied?    [Gligorov] Well, that is certainly the long-awaited moment  of Macedonia's admittance into the United Nations. That was a  tough process, although everybody knew we met all the  conditions, which was also unambiguously confirmed by the  Badenter arbitrating commission, underlining certain qualities  that ranked us first, ahead of Slovenia. And despite  everything, we were supposed to wait until April 1993, while,  let me remind you, Badenter's report had been submitted on 15  January 1991. The admittance to the United Nations is an event  that not only pleased me most, but also relieved me in a way.</p>

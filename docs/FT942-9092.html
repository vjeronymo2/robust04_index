			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Air Products covers loss on derivatives Air Products and Chemicals, the US industrial gases group which last week took a Dollars 60m after-tax charge in its second quarter to cover losses on five derivatives contracts, said yesterday it would absorb an additional Dollars 9m charge in the next quarter to cover the cost of closing out the contracts. The Pennsylvania-based group said it terminated the interest rate swap contracts to reduce the company's earnings exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Air Products is the fourth US company to take a charge against its earnings this year because of problems with derivatives agreements sold by Bankers Trust, the New York bank. Procter &amp; Gamble, Gibson Greetings and Mead Corporation incurred losses with contracts bought from Bankers Trust. The bank last week said it sold derivatives to companies so that they could manage their debt and investment portfolios, and continued to believe the contracts were useful to clients. Air Products had decided to stick with the contracts, recalculating their value at the end of each quarter. But the contracts were leveraged, which magnified the potential for losses and left Air Products open to the possibility of losing more money if interest rates continued to rise.</p>

Zhu Senlin, the provincial governor, said yesterday that  construction will soon begin on a nuclear power plant in  Yangjiang and on the second phase of the newly-build Daya Bay  reactor.    He made the remarks at the ongoing Provincial People's  Congress.    The second phase of the Daya Bay plant is set to begin late  this year. It includes installation of two units each with a  capacity of 900,000 kilowatts.    Situated five kilometers away from the main plant, the  generators are expected to be in operation within five years.    The plant in the coastal city of Yangjiang is expected to  cost over 6 billion yuan ($689.6 million) and have four units  with a combined capacity of 4 million kilowatts. Construction on  the project is expected to begin in the next two years and it is  expected to begin operation before 2000.    When the three plants come on line, Guangdong will have a  nuclear power installation capacity of 10 million kilowatts.    The Guangdong provincial government has begun to raise funds  for the two nuclear projects, which will cost several billions  of dollars.    Advanced equipment and technology imported from abroad will  be used, Zhu said.    "We also intend to build a fourth and the fifth nuclear  power  plant to sustain the province's economic boom, but we have to  wait for the approval of the central government," the governor  added.    The electricity supply in Guangzhou is 30 percent short of  demand.    Guangdong's first nuclear power plant, the Daya Bay plant in  Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, opened on February 6, when its  first nuclear power generator started operation.    The $4 billion plant has two nuclear power generating units  with a capacity of 900,000 kilowatts each. Its second set of  units will come on stream in the next four months.    Developed by Guangdong and Hong Kong, the plant will  generate  10 billion kilowatt hours every year. However, only 30 percent  of the electricity will be supplied to the provincial power  grid. The rest will be sold to Hong Kong to repay overseas loans  totalling $3.6 billion.    The Daya plant was designed by the French and uses reactors  and other equipment imported from France and Britain.    China's first nuclear station, Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant  in  East China's Zhejiang Province, began operation in 1991.    The station, with a capacity of 300,000 kilowatts, was  designed by China.</p>

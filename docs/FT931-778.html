			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: Brave stab at Glinka FOR ITS latest venture the ever-enterprising University College Opera has staged Glinka's Ruslan and Lyudmila - the full five-act opera, uncut it seemed. 'The Tsar of operas', Tchaikovsky called it; Alexander Serov, Russian critic and composer, countered by deeming it 'not a drama, not a play, hence not an opera, but a randomly assembled gallery of musical scenes'. This work divided critical opinion from the start - and continues to do so - but its seminal importance in the history of Russian music is indisputable: it became a veritable source-book for Russian opera composers even into the 20th century. Ruslan (1842), Glinka's second opera, earned him the title 'father of Russian music', a label fitting for a composer who mixed Italian convention with bold new form, 'fantastic' harmonies, vivid oriental colours and magical subjects. It was also the first of countless operas derived from Pushkin - though the poet's untimely death scotched the possibility of his collaboration with Glinka, who then began writing music for the opera before he had a libretto. Hence the dramatic muddle that has ensured the work's neglect. This production at London's Bloomsbury Theatre was a brave, welcome gesture by University College Opera, but the odds were stacked against the students even before they began - Ruslan makes virtuoso demands, on the orchestra especially. Tuesday's performance got off to an inauspicious start, dogged by the non-arrival of programmes, a scrappy overture and wayward choral singing. Throughout the evening the chorus was consistently under-projected  -a problem compounded by the strange decision to give this unknown work in Russian, or rather (to borrow Andrew Porter's phrase), partly in Russian and partly in gibberish. At least one English translation exists: it was used by University of Reading Opera in 1976. The students deserved stronger guidance than they got. The music (under David Drummond) was played in a generalised mezzo forte, and the production matched it. Mike Ashman - often an admirable producer - staged the opera aimlessly on a featureless raked stage, in designs (by Bernard Culshaw) that lacked magic; an understandable shortcoming, given the shoestring budget. From the large cast three singers stood out. Elizabeth Hetherington was a touching Ludmila, and Michael Preston-Roberts was well cast as Bayan and Finn - his tenor has the right tone for these plaintive Russian character roles. Most impressive was the soprano Helen Kucharek as Gorislava. Her performance suggested Slavonic glint, and was sung in well-projected Russian. At least UCO hinted at the many merits of Ruslan and Lyudmila, making its neglect by major companies hard to understand. If The Golden Cockerel and Christmas Eve are worth doing, then why not this important Russian opera? Bloomsbury Theatre, London, WC1. Final performance tonight.</p>

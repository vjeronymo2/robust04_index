			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Raising a glass to prospects of growth - A look at the logic of Allied-Lyons' Pounds 739m purchase of Pedro Domecq On the face of it, Allied-Lyons' proposed Pounds 739m purchase of Pedro Domecq is a splendid proposition. Allied becomes, on its own reckoning, the world's second biggest spirits producer after Grand Metropolitan, overtaking Guinness. It gains some powerful brands with which to attack the fast-growing South American market. It also recruits some able managers, mostly members of the Domecq family, who thoroughly understand the Hispanic world of drinks. On closer inspection, the sceptic might ask just what Allied is getting for its money. The overwhelming bulk of Domecq's profits - 97 per cent - come from two countries, Mexico and Spain. Allied's products in those countries are already distributed by Domecq. Domecq's own brands mostly have limited appeal outside those two countries, so there is little scope for Allied to push them through its own distribution system. And Allied already has a blocking vote in the shape of a 32 per cent holding in Domecq. Outright control of the business, Allied argues, means a great deal. This is a little at odds, however, with the praise it lavished on Domecq's management yesterday, and the fact that the same management will remain in place. So what does Allied think it is getting? The answer, above all, is the prospect of growth. 'The logic of this is not about bringing together two big companies to take out a lot of cost,' Mr Tony Hales, Allied's chief executive said yesterday. 'It's getting faster growth in fast-growing parts of the world.' Mr Michael Jackaman, Allied chairman, develops the point. Take Mexico, for instance, which contributes half of Domecq's trading profits, and where Domecq has more than 40 per cent of the spirits market and an 80 per cent share in brandy. 'The fact is that the Mexican business has to develop and change', he said. 'It probably has to change its focus from the domestic brandy business to imported products. That's a 10 or 15 year job, and it will be much easier to do when you call the shots than when you have to persuade your partners.' Equally, he added, there were a number of markets, especially in Europe, where Domecq still has its own distributors. In most of them Allied will take over the distribution. In the really long run, Mr Jackaman was hopeful that Domecq's brandies could be sold in that fabulous goal of all consumer marketers, China. 'Long term, that's going to be a strong cognac market,' he said. 'Spanish and Mexican brandies are good-tasting products, and I don't see any reason why there shouldn't be some space for them ultimately and we have a sales and distribution operation in China already.' Mr Hale was more pragmatic. 'The biggest opportunity', he said, 'is for us to sell more Scotch through their network, and more tequila through ours.' As part of the deal, Allied will buy control of Tequila Sauza, the second biggest-selling tequila in the world, with 35 per cent of the Mexican market. For Mr Jackaman, the deal has a further attraction: cash. Domecq was a very strong cash producer, he said. In the past, as a minority shareholder, Allied had profits but not cash. 'Profit is all very well, but it's cash that pays the bills.' This was slightly at odds with a point made yesterday by Mr Ramon Mora-Figueroa, Domecq's chief executive. Explaining the Domecq family's motive in selling, he said: 'When you have 500 members of the family who have seen Domecq grow so rapidly, especially over the past six years, while (the Domecq-Allied partnership) has been more interested in growth than in paying big dividends, some of them wanted to realise the value of their shares.' In other words, it sounds as if Domecq has been absorbing cash to grow, rather than throwing cash off. Mr Jackaman disputed this, saying the family had been brought up to expect 'really sexy' dividends, far more than an institutional shareholder would require. Nor did he accept that the family's desire to sell obliged Allied to buy. 'This is something I've been hoping for for a long time. It was just a question of when the shareholders got restive.' Meanwhile, the deal carries Allied further in its stated policy of concentrating on drinks and retailing, which includes pubs, Baskin-Robbins ice cream and Dunkin' Donuts. By implication, this leaves two unwanted divisions: food manufacture, and the Carlsberg Tetley joint venture in brewing. Yesterday, Mr Jackaman said Allied was not engaged in any active talks about selling its food interests. On brewing, he was non-committal. Allied was happy with the current arrangement, despite the tough times facing UK brewers. Then again, he said: 'We are not natural developers of a worldwide beer business as Carlsberg is.' The deal also confirms Britain's remarkable dominance of the world drinks industry. Allied is now lodged at the top of the tree with two other British groups, Guinness and GrandMet. The only other company in the same league is Seagram of Canada. Perhaps, in the end, this is as persuasive an argument as any for the deal: that if the British have found something they are good at, they should make the most of it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ALLIED-LYONS: FROM REGIONAL BREWER TO GLOBAL DRINKS GROUP IN 33 YEARS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Chronology  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied-Lyons  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1961 Company created by merger of Ind Coope, Tetley Walker and Ansells 1963 Name changed to Allied Breweries 1968 Bought Showerings 1976 Bought Teacher's 1978 Bought J Lyons for Pounds 60m 1981 Name changed to Allied-Lyons 1985 Elders bids Pounds 1.68bn for Allied-Lyons, which is finally rescinded in 1986 1986 Bought 51% of Hiram Walker, of Canada, acquiring balance in 1987 for CDollars 1.3bn 1988 Equity link with Suntory , Japanese drinks group 1989 Bought 69% of Chateau Latour; bought Dunkin Donuts for Pounds 207m; bought James Burrough 1991 Bought 24% of Champagne Lanson 1992 Leased over 700 pubs to Brent Walker; Showerings sold to management for Pounds 140m; Lyons Maid sold; breweries merged with UK arm of Carlsberg  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pedro Domecq Group  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1730: Founded in Jerez, Spain 1816: Acquired by Domecq family 1941: Established Mexican operation.

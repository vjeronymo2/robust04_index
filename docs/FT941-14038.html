			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Upper House reform vote astonishes ruling parties: Coalition in disarray after unexpectedly widespread revolt by dissident Socialists The atmosphere in the normally sedate corridors of the diet building was one of astonishment and disarray. Representatives of Japan's coalition government were visibly shaken by yesterday's vote against political reform. 'We did not even dream that such a thing could happen,' said Mr Kozo Watanabe, of the Japan New party. Of the dissident Socialists who scuppered the legislation, he said: 'It may be that the awareness of their responsibility as the governing party was not strong enough.' Socialist leaders quickly gathered behind closed doors to assess the situation. In the opposition camp leaders relished the victory. Mr Kazuo Shii, head of the Japan Communist party's secretariat, pronounced the outcome as 'a reflection of the people's will'. In a combative mood though as solemn as ever, Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP leader, emphasised the seriousness of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's responsibility. 'He failed in his first promise to enact the reform bills by the end of the year and he is about to fail in his second promise to do so by the end of the emergency diet session.' Mr Hosokawa managed to maintain his aristocratic composure as he emphasised the government's continued commitment to reform. The confusion which followed the upper house vote had broken an uneasy tension which had hung heavily over the Assembly Hall during the hour leading up to the final result. Last-minute attempts by both sides to tip the balance had continued as representatives of the coalition and opposition parties had come to the podium to present their cases for and against the reforms. Senior members of the LDP and Socialist parties alike had left the Assembly Hall from time to time with prospective rebels on each side to make a final plea to those expected to hold the casting vote. It was not until the very last minute, when the votes had been counted and re-counted, that the uncertainty was cleared by the surpris - ingly large number of Socialist rebels who had voted against the reforms, a historic change the public had been waiting for. On the streets, many citizens expressed frustration with both the government and the opposition for their failure to enact the reform bills. 'What have they been doing for the past 60 days using taxpayers' money?' asked one middle-aged man who was angered by the news. 'There are so many important things that need to be done, particularly economic reform,' he said. 'The LDP should also co-operate and ensure that the reforms pass so that the government can move on to other things.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPAN'S POLITICAL REFORM Upper House Vote  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            No of seats     For     Against     Abstain  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pro-Reform government parties Social Democratic                   73      53          17           3 Clean Japan                         24      24 Japan New Japan Renewal Democratic Reform                   23      23 Democratic Socialist                 7       7 Total coalition                    127     107          17           3 Sports Peace                         4       3           1 Independents                         5       3           2 Total                              136     113          20           3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Anti-reform opposition parties Liberal Democratic                  99       5          94 Japan Communist                     11                  11 Niin Club                            5                   5 Total                              115       5         110  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Grand total                        251     118         130           3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

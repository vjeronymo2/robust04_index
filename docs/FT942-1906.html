			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Mortgage complaint cases up 15% Complaints about the treatment of mortgage customers taken up by the Building Societies Ombudsman Scheme rose 15 per cent in 1993-94 compared with the previous year. At the publication of the scheme's annual report yesterday, Mr Stephen Edell, the senior ombudsman, highlighted complaints in areas such as mortgage-protection policies and the explanation of fixed-rate mortgage terms. He said some societies needed to improve their practices significantly in relation to mortgage protection. As a minimum they should comply with the code of practice devised by the Association of British Insurers. The report describes some society documentation on fixed rate loans as 'unacceptably sloppy'. Societies should ensure that the papers reflect their real intentions, it says. It also criticises the reluctance of some societies to publicise the ombudsman scheme, suggesting that this is in breach of the code of banking practice. Overall, the report shows a drop of just more than a third in the total number of complaints taken up to 901 from 1,352 in 1992-93. There was also a slight drop in the number of complaints received, to 9,100 from 9,402. The figures reflect both a greater readiness among societies to settle complaints through their own procedures, and also improvements in the treatment of investors with information about obsolete accounts. In spite of a lower total number of complaints taken up the ombudsmen have found for the complainant more often than in 1992-93. In 338 cases the customer was at least partly successful, compared with 279 in 1992-93. Mr Edell welcomed the fact that from the beginning of next month, the ombudsmen's powers would extend to dealing with complaints arising from what happened before a mortgage or investment was completed, provided the transaction did then take place.

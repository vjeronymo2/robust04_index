			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Canada takes toughline on Nafta curbs NEGOTIATIONS on side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement ran into their first obstacle yesterday when Canadian and Mexican chief negotiators took a tough line against the use of formal trade sanctions to enforce labour and environmental standards. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, has taken on board demands from prominent US senators and congressmen for agreements 'with teeth', but he has yet to define how he sees the enforcement taking place. Yesterday Mr John Weekes, the top Canadian negotiator, said Mr Herminio Blanco Mendoz and Mr Rufus Yerxa, deputy US Trade Representative had 'exchanged concepts' on the agreements but had reached no firm conclusions . Negotiators are expected to have little difficulty agreeing to establish labour and environmental commissions, but trouble is expected in agreeing their precise powers. Mr Weekes said he would be consulting with the provinces, the non-governmental organisations and the business representatives before determining Canada's final positions. He also implied that Mexico and Canada had no interest in writing a third agreement over import surges because that was already embodied in the completed Nafta text. Negotiators will meet again on April 11. A deal is expected to take two to three months, Mr Weekes said. This could get Nafta to the US Congress in early summer.</p>

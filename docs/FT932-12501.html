			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Letter: Asian Development Bank's success rate Sir, The article by Victor Mallet about the success rate of Asian Development Bank aid projects ('Many ADB projects 'failed' ', April 20) reported that only 40 per cent of the bank's 28 projects evaluated in 1992 were considered generally successful. Those projects evaluated represented only a sample of completed projects and included several complex projects. In addition most had been approved and completed in the 1980s during a period of unusual turbulence characterised by the second oil shock, falling non-oil primary commodity prices, and high interest rates. Overall the bank's record is much better and shows the picture in reverse. Sixty per cent of a total of 400 projects evaluated so far have been rated as generally successful, with 30 per cent partly successful and 10 per cent unsuccessful. In each case, the bank seems to learn, where possible, how to improve the design, implementation and performance of its development projects, to enable it to better account for the effectiveness of the assistance it provides to its developing members. Importantly, partly successful projects are not to regarded as 'failed' projects, nor is the definition controversial. The bank's criteria for deciding into which category a project falls are comprehensive and clear-cut. More importantly, the bank places great emphasis on learning from the experience of past projects and has developed a widely applauded and effective feed-back system. Guided by these clear objectives, the banks recently put into place additional institutional processes to make its assistance and operations even more efficient. The bank believes that increased responsiveness to the needs of its developing members, improved relevance of its sector operations and enhanced quality of services - by incorporating the lessons of ongoing and completed operations - will, together, significantly raise the quality of projects assisted by the bank.

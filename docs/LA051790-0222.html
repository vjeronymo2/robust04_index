			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CBS PULLS PLUG ON 'FALCON CREST,' 2 OTHERS  </P> <P> One of the most successful soap operas in the history of TV, CBS' "Falcon  Crest," comes to an end tonight at 9 after a nine-season run.  </P> <P> In the early and mid-1980s, "Falcon Crest," which starred Jane Wyman in a tale  set in the Napa Valley wine country near San Francisco, ranked among the Top  10-rated shows for three consecutive seasons.  </P> <P> It was the period of prime-time soap opera's greatest success, with such series  as "Dallas" and "Dynasty" dominating the field and "Knots Landing" also a  strong finisher.  </P> <P> CBS also yanked two other series Wednesday -- "City," a Valerie Harper sitcom,  and "The Famous Teddy Z," a comedy about a young talent agent -- after both  shows registered disastrous ratings Saturday when paired for the first time  against NBC's powerful tandem of "The Golden Girls" and "Empty Nest."  </P> <P> "City" and "The Famous Teddy Z" will be replaced effective this Saturday by  reruns of the Vietnam War drama "Tour of Duty," which earned double the ratings  of the two comedies in the same time slot before winding up its season. "Tour  of Duty" is awaiting a decision on whether it will be renewed for next season.  </P> <P> CBS' decision to cancel "Falcon Crest," which was down to 19% of the audience  this season, came as the network -- on a surprising rebound this month --  focused in on its new lineup for fall, soon to be announced. "Dallas" has also  slipped sharply, although "Knots Landing" remains a relative success.  </P> <P> In another series change, Fox TV's "The Tracey Ullman Show," which tied for  89th place in last week's ratings with "The Famous Teddy Z," became the second  quality series to depart the fledgling network. Ullman's innovative variety  program, which gave Fox its first Emmy Awards but drew low ratings, followed  "It's Garry Shandling's Show" in bowing out after its fourth season.  </P> <P> "I thank Fox for letting someone no one ever heard of do a show on a network  that didn't exist," Ullman said. "Well, it certainly does exist now and I am  proud to have helped give it credibility."  </P> <P> In last week's ratings, "City" ranked last among 91 shows, drawing only 6% of  the audience, and "The Famous Teddy Z" was 89th, with 7%. "Tour of Duty," which  previously fared respectably against TV blockbusters such as "The Cosby Show"  and "Roseanne," attracted 13% of the national audience this season in  competition with "The Golden Girls" and "Empty Nest."  </P></p>

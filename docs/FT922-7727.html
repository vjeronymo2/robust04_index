			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Pensions hit by back-door raids THE REMOVAL of pension fund assets, as it was done by Robert Maxwell is, fortunately, rare. But depredations caused when companies use pension schemes to subsidise redundancy programmes have become commonplace. According to actuary Bryn Davies, of the specialised consultancy Union Pension Services: 'It does weaken the funding for the people who remain with the company scheme and treats them less than fairly, yet trustees tend to go along with it.' A few companies have special redundancy terms written into the pension scheme rules, giving those made redundant better treatment than employees leaving early of their own accord. Someone made redundant after the age of 50 might be allowed to retire at that time with a full pension instead of an actuarially-reduced amount. But companies without special redundancy rules assemble their own packages with an eye on cash flow as well as tax efficiency. Because of the Pounds 30,000 ceiling on the amount that can be paid as tax-free redundancy compensation, a favourite tactic is to offer departing employees the option of taking a lower lump sum, plus an improved deferred pension. Most schemes allow companies to increase some members' benefits if the trustees and actuary approve. Theoretically, this means that the company has to make an extra payment into the pension scheme to buy the additional benefits. But if the pension fund is in surplus, the company often can be excused actuarially from handing over any cash. Employees remaining with the company might see this as a form of pension fund raid, but have no effective comeback. Bryan Freake, of the white-collar Manufacturing Science and Finance union, says companies will continue dipping into pension fund surpluses with ease until the law is clarified. 'Under present law, scheme members have no right to the surplus, so there is no point saying people made redundant should not have anything extra if you can't deliver it to the others, anyway.' Freake says employers could also take advantage of the fact that employees generally are unaware of the heavy pension loss that could be involved in a seemingly generous redundancy package. Their deferred pension would be subject to annual increases only up to a 5 per cent annual limit - likely to be well below the wage increase they could have expected had they stayed in employment. However, a more significant influence on such deals could be be a protocol agreed at the Maastricht EC summit last December. It proposed an amendment to the Treaty of Rome aimed at wiping out the possible retrospective effect of the landmark Barber judgment - a European court decision that men and women in occupational pension schemes should be treated equally - handed down on May 17 1990. Redundancy terms were considered an essential part of equal treatment. Barber's original case was brought after he was made redundant and received lower total benefits than a woman of the same age would have been given. Thanks to uncertainties about the exact interpretation of the judgment, unequal treatment has continued and hundreds of claims have backed up in the legal system. If the Barber judgment is not taken as applying retrospectively, only pension rights earned after May 17 1990 would have to provide equal benefits. But matters may not be resolved quickly even if the Maastricht protocol is ratified, as the agreement could be challenged in the European Court.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vitaliy Korionov article: "An Ally? A Client? An Enemy?"] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Many will remember that soon  after he took the Kremlin throne, the incumbent president  described Russia's position as a country staying "in the  antechamber": Soon another "revelation" followed: Apparently  Russia needs to be "raised from its knees." And now other  countries have been asked to use "vy" [formal mode of address]  in talking with Russia. [passage omitted]    In its time Turkey was called "the sick man" of Europe. Now,  increasingly, foreign press describes Russia as a seriously  ailing state with a heart ready to break. Zbigniew Brzezinski  reflects: If Russia is not an enemy anymore, what is it then: an  ally, or a client, or simply an enemy that has suffered a defeat?    We shall not discuss today the main reason for Russia's  deplorable condition. Yet one cannot but admit that the present  policy makers indeed possess an exceptional talent for  destruction. It is not just anyone that is capable within a few  years of bringing one of the "superpowers" to its "knees,"  moreover with its own hands. [passage omitted]    The rapid destruction of Russian industry and agriculture  and  the downfall of science make Russia's position on the world  arena all the more shaky. It would be naive to suppose that the  Western business world would seriously reckon with a country on  the verge of an economic catastrophe. To be sure, red carpets  are being unrolled before the Russian president. But what is  happening in reality? [passage omitted]    At the end of August the last Russian soldiers will leave  Germany -- the soldiers who, at the command of the whole world,  made a decisive contribution to smashing the Nazi regime. Yet  representatives of western states -- participants in the  anti-Hitler coalition -- refused to take part in the sendoff  ceremony. What cunning political calculations lie behind this?    Yet Russia's humiliation does not stop here. From an  interview that the Russian president had with DER SPIEGEL we  have learned an amazing piece of news: Yeltsin has called on  the Bundeswehr "to take on peace-keeping missions not only in  Yugoslavia but also in the restive CIS states." An excellent  "present" to the peoples of the former USSR on the 50th  anniversary of our Victory in the Great Patriotic War!    Seeing such policy by the Kremlin, the Pentagon is stepping  up pressure on Moscow, demanding that joint U.S. and Russian  military exercises be held in Russia's heartland. "The working  people of Orenburg and Volga regions, as well as all people of  Russia," says a joint statement issued on this occasion by 14  public organizations of the region and titled "U.S. Troops Have  Nothing To Do On Our Soil", are pained to see how, in the course  of and anti-people's reform, the country's military and economic  might and its political authority are falling. The ever growing  unceremoniousness, with which Western powers are openly  interfering in Russia's internal affairs, arouses anger and  indignation."    Many of the world's press publications also see Russia's  national humiliation in the unscrupulousness shown toward Moscow  by the NATO countries delivering air strikes on Bosnia, not  deeming it necessary even to inform Russia about them in advance.    The picture will be more complete if it is recalled that  gentlemen reformers have driven the country into the trap of  powerful Western financial centers. The clutch of the IMF and  the World Bank is merciless. According to THE WALL STREET  JOURNAL, Russia already owes the West more than $80 billion, of  which $32 billion is to be paid this year. Experts on this  problems, for instance, French Professor Bernard Notain, warn:  "The ongoing enslavement is setting the stage for a subsequent  dismemberment of the country."    The logical question is: Who in fact has brought Russia down  to its knees and forced it out into the antechamber?    FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU states, "Russia is in no position to  demonstrate that cooperation with it can be fruitful, and  therefore it is merely imitating activity, conditioned by  helplessness."    Where will the leaders -- who rather than ensure effective  protection of the country's national interests, are only capable  of imitating policy -- steer Russia?</p>

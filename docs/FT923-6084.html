			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Chancellor fails to sway critics THE UNUSUAL sight of Mr Norman Lamont making a breakfast-time statement on the Treasury doorstep put the spotlight on the link between his political future and the government's rejection of devaluation, highlighting the division of opinion among Tory backbenchers. Critics of the government's exchange rate policy renewed their warnings, while other MPs queued up to express support for the chancellor. But on both sides of the division, MPs continued to talk of a rise in interest rates as a real possibility. Sir Teddy Taylor, chairman of the dissident Conservative European Reform Group, said that he believed the government would have to change its policy, and that this would jeopardise the chancellor's position. 'I feel that the chancellor, by his unusual statement, has put his head on the block because clearly if the government is forced to move away from the present policies his continuance in office will be virtually impossible,' he said. Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the all-party Treasury committee of MPs, said this could yet be the moment at which interest rates had to rise as the markets seemed to have become 'doubting Thomases'. While an increase in interest rates would be unwelcome, he said, it would be far more damaging if the chancellor had not emphasised his readiness to take appropriate action. He dismissed Sir Teddy's comments on the prospect that Mr Lamont might be forced from office. The calls of Tory Euro-sceptics such as Mr Toby Jessel, the MP for Twickenham, for the UK to leave the ERM were attacked yesterday by Mr Tim Smith, a party vice-chairman. He said their comments were 'extremely unhelpful' while sterling was under pressure. Most backbenchers, he added, supported Mr Lamont because they knew that 'if we were to follow the alternatives there is no guarantee whatever that we would be able to cut interest rates'. Treasury insiders were cheered by the chorus of helpful comments from Tory MPs, but Mr Lamont's words brought a sharp attack from the opposition. Labour accused the government of failing to put forward proposals to help revive the economy.</p>

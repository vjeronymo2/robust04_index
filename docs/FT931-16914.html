			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Bucking the trend: Eternal optimist plans expansion - A specialist that has thrived since it was bought by its management on the eve of the truck market collapse LAST YEAR was the third in a row that the UK's commercial vehicle industry would rather forget. For much of the year, UK truck sales continued a headlong plunge to market levels rarely experienced since the second world war. There are at last tentative signs of recovery, though: sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes have risen slightly, on a year-on-year basis, in each of the past five months, and the trend is expected to strengthen this year. It is, nevertheless, an extraordinarily gloomy background, but one against which one manufacturer expects to announce sharply increased profits and expanded sales and production for last year. No less remarkable is that the company concerned floated itself successfully on the London Stock Exchange little more than two months ago and has seen barely more than three years elapse since becoming the subject of a Pounds 27.3m management buy-out almost on the eve of the collapse of the truck market. That Trinity Holdings - the maker of Dennis fire engines, dustcarts and other specialised trucks and buses, as well as of Duple (Metsec) bus body kits - has defied recession so strongly is a source of considerable satisfaction to Mr Geoffrey Hollyhead, its chairman and chief executive, who led the 1989 buy-out. Market analysts expect that in a few weeks' time he will report that Trinity achieved an operating profit of more than Pounds 8m in the financial year to the end of this month. That compares with the previous year's figure of Pounds 5.6m, and Pounds 4.8m in the first year after the buy-out from its previous owner, Hestair. Turnover has also risen steadily from Pounds 66m in the first year after the buy-out to Pounds 82m the following year, with 1992's results expected to exceed Pounds 100m. Only last month, Trinity won a Pounds 38m order from Sri Lanka for its Duple (Metsec) subsidiary to supply 2,500 bus bodies. That has provided a further boost for the investors who took up Trinity's offer of 25m 10p shares at 120p a share in October. Given that the Stock Market at the time was in recession-battered disarray, both the flotation itself and the take-up - the issue was 2.3 times oversubscribed - looked like a brave decision, particularly as the engineering sector generally has been among the worst-hit by the recession. But with Trinity's shares trading at 166p at the close last week, and growing bullishness from the government and industry about this year's economic prospects, the company's concerns are now very much with the future and growth, particularly in exports. In spite of the depressed conditions in some of the many market niches in which Trinity specialises, the group's total vehicle production has continued to rise. Production at Trinity, which is based at Warwick and has plants at Worcester, Halifax, Tipton and Guildford. reached 914 in the first three quarters of last year, up from 690 in the comparable 1991 period, and output continued to accel-erate in the final quarter. With the order from Sri Lanka, Trinity expects to build further on export activities, which already account for a third of its turnover. In that regard, Trinity is building on the long-established presence of Dennis - one of the UK's oldest vehicle makers through a succession of ownerships - in Third World and other overseas markets outside Europe. Some of Trinity's growth has come from acquisition, notably Reliance Mercury, which specialises in dockyard and airport towing vehicles, and Carmichael, the producer of airfield crash tenders and rapid-intervention vehicles. But a significant amount is expected to come from heavy investments in new products. Among them are a new generation of chassis for the Dart, the UK's best-selling bus, and a new range of refuse disposal vehicles. Some Pounds 10m has gone into new manufacturing facilities at Guildford, Surrey. Not content with traditional export markets such as Hong Kong, Trinity has also begun a sales push into continental Europe, starting with the Benelux countries. At the same time, tighter inventory and other management controls are attributed by Trinity's management team to the sharply improved financial performance of the company. They are seen by Mr Hollyhead - a self-professed 'eternal optimist' - as putting the company in good shape for what is expected to be a strong recovery in two of its main UK market sectors: refuse vehicles, and buses and coaches. Both have been affected not so much by recession as by the the government's policies on privatisation and deregulation. Local-authority tendering and the deregulation of bus and coach services - initiated in the 1980s - have had knock-on effects in terms of the abolition of grants to bus buyers and a reluctance to invest in new local-authority equipment. Trinity believes that such disincentives - which have reduced demand for such vehicles by up to a half - are now disappearing rapidly, with all that that entails for growth this year.</p>

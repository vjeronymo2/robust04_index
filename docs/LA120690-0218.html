Ruggeri said he and Wagner did not attend the meeting.  </P> <P> Downing was named administrator in November, 1988, after serving three months  as assistant administrator. He could not be reached for comment. His  resignation letter is dated Nov. 16.  </P> <P> According to Wagner and Ruggeri, the three council members who reportedly  demanded the resignation were Sher, Kathleen Navejas and Esther Flores. Navejas  said that was not true and that she would not discuss the resignation because  it was a personnel matter.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Shao Ling (6730 7227): "Reasons Why </F> the Mainland Authorities Are Rectifying Futures Markets"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 8 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Futures  markets in mainland China took off in the late 1980's, and, with  their unique role, they rapidly became the third major  investment craze after the stock and real estate crazes.  However, as futures markets developed very rapidly, they were  beset by many problems. Not long ago, the mainland's State  Administration for Industry and Commerce and the China  Securities Supervision and Regulatory Commission [CSSRC] issued  a circular on rectification.    According to incomplete statistics, there are already 40  exchanges on the mainland bearing the nameplates of "commodity  exchange" and "futures exchange," of which 30 are officially  registered, and there are nearly 300 futures brokerage  companies, including more than 50 Sino-foreign joint-venture  brokerage companies. If unregistered underground brokerage  companies are added, the total number exceeds 500. There are  over 50 items listed and traded as futures in existing  exchanges, which fall into eight major categories, including  agricultural products, petroleum, steel products, coal,  nonferrous metals, ferrous metals, agricultural means of  production, construction materials, industrial chemicals, and  state treasury bonds.    The mainland's futures market have developed so rapidly with  such an enormous number of transactions that even government  officials are surprised. As of now, the United States, which  has the most developed futures markets in the world, has 24  exchanges, while Britain has just 11. It took several decades  for the United States and Britain to develop their futures  markets to what they are today. Nevertheless, mainland China has  surpassed them in terms of numbers in a matter of years.  Therefore, we can imagine how blindly its futures markets have  developed.    In fact, as laws and regulations, as well as supervision and  controls, failed to keep pace with the excessively rapid  development of the futures markets, numerous problems have  occurred. Hence, the authorities adopted some measures to  rectify the futures markets in April and May of this year. Zhu  Li, secretary general and concurrently spokesman of the CSSRC  said recently: The State Council has issued a circular urging  the firm checking of the blind development of futures markets,  strengthening macromanagement of the markets, and exercising  unified guidance, supervision, and control over the markets.  Then, the Beijing authorities dispatched five joint  investigation teams to North China, East China, South China,  northeast China, and central China to conduct thorough  investigations and make reports. According to the authority's  analysis, the results of the recent investigations will have a  great impact on the development of the mainland's futures  markets.    It has been reported that the main problems are that  exchanges are too numerous in number and are confused, the CSSRC  is unable to exercise supervision and control, a "futures law"  has not been enacted, and a lack of national standardization  makes it difficult to put all exchanges on the right course.  Moreover, exchanges in localities have simple and crude  facilities and limited functions. As they are mismanaged,  corrupt practices are prone to occur. It was precisely because  supervision and administration departments were unable to  exercise supervision and control that quite a few exchanges  operated in their own ways and formulated their own "trading  regulations." In particular, seizing this opportunity,  Sino-foreign joint-venture or disguised joint-venture brokerage  companies deceived their costumers using various means, thus  causing an enormous foreign exchange drain. A certain futures  company in Shenzhen is a case in point. After buying futures on  behalf of its customers, the company, which claimed to be an  agent of certain futures exchanges in Canada and Japan, did not  produce any original transaction certificates while the clients'  cash deposits given as collateral were sent abroad. When  government organs investigated the case, personnel from the  foreign side immediately pulled out of the company and returned  to Hong Kong together with the relevant accounts. Almost all  the clients lost money and the Chinese side of the joint-venture  company also suffered a loss of 220,000 yuan. Those who really  made fortunes were the foreign side of the company.    Moreover, capitalizing on imperfections in the regulations,  the existence of a double-track exchange rate system, and the  lack of a commodity price formation mechanism, some underground  futures brokerage companies carried out illegal activities, such  as money-for-power deals and contract breaches, thus making the  futures market more confused.    Judging from this, the rectification of the futures market  is  indeed necessary. Therefore, the mainland's State  Administration for Industry and Commerce promulgated the  "Provisional Regulations Concerning the Management of Futures  Brokerage Company Registration" in April. According to the  regulations, for a futures brokerage company to operate, it must  have capital of over 10 million yuan, suitable  telecommunications facilities, and at least 20 full-time futures  brokers; it must open a special account for customers' cash  deposits used as collateral with designated financial  institutions; and deposit at least 25 percent of its total  registered capital as guaranty money. If it violates the  regulations, it will be punished, ranging from a warning,  confiscation of earnings, or the revocation of its license  according to the seriousness of the case. Those violating the  criminal law will be handed over to judicial organs for  prosecution.    In early May, the CSSRC announced a decision to close some  problem exchanges (it is said they amounted to 50 percent of the  total number) as one of its emergency measures for further  rectifying futures markets. At the same time, Beijing stepped  up efforts to enact a "futures law" and other related laws in a  bid to bring the futures market into an orbit of legal, normal,  steady, and healthy development.</p>

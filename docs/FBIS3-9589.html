			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirjana Kusmuk] </F>   [Text] The assembly of the Srpska republic has continued  its session in Pale. SRNA journalist Mirjana Kusmuk reports:    [Kusmuk] The 39th session of the people's assembly of the  Srpska republic continued in Pale at about 1100 this morning.  After government ministers presented their reports, the deputies  started to debate them behind closed doors. During the 15-minute  break, the president of the Srpska republic [Radovan Karadzic]  expressed a doubt in the replacement of the government, assuming  that the assembly will decide to reshuffle it soon. The  government will be made more dynamic and new posts will be  created, those of deputies and assistants. The government will  also be requested to work faster. This will have to produce  results, Karadzic said.    The assembly of the Srpska republic should today send a  letter to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali regarding the UN  decision to send Turkish troops to the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to Karadzic, judging by the  prevailing mood in the assembly, the aforementioned letter will  also contain a statement that by adopting this decision the  Security Council has assumed responsibility for yet another  dangerous precedent in the case of the former Yugoslavia, and  that this represented the most direct responsibility for the  possible spread of the war.    Commenting on the platform for the continuation of the peace  negotiations adopted yesterday, Karadzic stressed that the  Serbian side would continue to negotiate with the Croats and the  Muslims on some kind of links under certain conditions, but that  it will not agree to the imposition of any solutions.    A doubt was expressed that the conditions existed for our  entry in the Muslim-Croat federation. However, we have not  received any official offer to join them, Karadzic said.    The assembly session is still in progress. The reports of  the republican ministries are being discussed behind closed  doors.</p>

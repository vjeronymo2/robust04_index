			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'CAR POOL LANES DRIVE THESE GUYS CRAZY'  </P> <P> Some people spend their leisure time collecting stamps. Others umpire Little  League baseball games, do charity work or keep tropical fish. But not the group  of five men who headlined the Orange County section of the L.A. Times Sunday  (Nov. 26).  </P> <P> I applaud the fivesome in their effort to change what they think is a Caltrans  version of the Blob. More people should get off the couch as they have.  Unfortunately, they have devoted their energy toward a misdirected cause.  </P> <P> The Caltrans diamond lane may be a social engineering project, but to those who  use it religiously, it inarguably works. I have a dream that someday my  children will have the pleasure of seeing the high-occupancy lane as congested  as the general-use lanes. Then maybe we will have to open yet a second car-pool  lane, and so on.  </P> <P> If Southern Californians don't release their strangling grip on their  ever-so-precious automobile, we'll all be choking on airborne pollutants or  even each other from gridlock frustration.  </P> <P> It doesn't take a rocket scientist to compute the effects of doubling up to  work. And I hardly think turning the diamond lanes into general-purpose lanes  could increase traffic flow to the point where less time spent on the freeway  would counter the doubling effect.  </P> <P> If our five friends pooled together in the diamond lane, they might have some  extra time to indulge in the pleasures of collecting stamps, umpiring Little  League, working for a charity or even watching their tropical fish!  </P> <P> RICH LEONE  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

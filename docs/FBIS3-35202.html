As my first question, I  would like to ask why various efforts to solve the problem of  Bosnia-Herzegovina have failed to achieve a satisfactory result  in the last 23 months, while all involved parties claim to want  to solve the problem in a fair way?    [Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. Greetings to dear viewers. I would like to mention  that this is not the case. Not all sides involved in the  resolution of the Bosnian issue are well-intentioned in the  search to find an honorable solution to that complicated and  painful problem. Therefore, we witness stagnation, deadlock,  slowness, seeking excuses and obstructionism in the process of  the work related to the establishment of peace and stability in  Bosnia. Specifically the influential members of the Security  Council, in various forms and degrees of strength, oppose the  establishment of an Islamic state in the heart of Europe. And  that is an issue which can be clearly said today.    In the past, it was assumed, on the basis of the available  analysis, that some influential members of the United Nations,  and specifically in the Security Council, would stop, in various  forms and degrees of strength, the formation of that Islamic  country in the heart of Europe in any way they can. That is the  reality of the case. What you can see, which can be described  in general as obstructionism toward the establishment of an  honorable and fair peace, is caused by that ideology which  dominates the Security Council and particularly its permanent  members.    [Correspondent] In the same connection we witness that the  Security Council -- to which you specifically referred --  prevents the efforts of the effective members of the ICO. What  is the reason for that?    [Velayati] As I said the reasoning for that is the same as  the reply to the first question. Islamic countries, according  to a state of sympathy that exists in the world of Islam toward  the fate of Muslims, adopted very clear and forthright stances  in support of Bosnia. Today if an Islamic government exists  which seeks to act differently to that it will face the pressure  of its public opinion. Therefore, you see a solidarity among all  the ICO members -- which number 52. That is 52 ICO member  states are unanimous in the belief that the Bosnian problem must  be resolved in an honorable and just manner; the aggressions and  brutalities of the Serbs and Croats against the Muslims must be  terminated; and human rights -- in its true sense -- must be  observed in Bosnia. But we know, and we have experienced for  many years, that some Western countries use the words human  rights as a political weapon to advance their objectives. If  they wish to put pressure on a country, they do it by using the  human rights lever. But they themselves determine the criteria  for human rights. Even if we seek to raise another issue within  the framework of human rights by using those very criteria that  they have determined themselves, they will oppose that method if  it does not suit their political interests. In other words,  they use differing standards when judging and making decisions  on a single issue in the world. That is, double standards in  international forums -- resulting from the influence exerted by  influential states -- is quite obvious. You know that, for  instance, the U.S. Government has been asked repeatedly to send  its troops to Bosnia under the UN flag to prevent the Serbs'  aggression -- and even the UN secretary general has made such a  request recently -- but the Americans have so far abstained from  such a thing. Whereas you see that in Kuwait and Somalia they  themselves were the axis for implementing UN decisions. But in  the case of Bosnia they have said bluntly that their national  interests do not warrant such a thing.    [Correspondent] Yes. Just today there were reports saying  that the commander of the UN forces in Bosnia has requested  3,000 reinforcements which in practice would be from America but  America has failed to agree.    [Velayati] Yes. Some American officials had already said  they would do no such a thing since their national interests do  not warrant it. Thus you see that they interpret human rights  according to their national interests, or to be more clear,  their personal interests. That is, if you see the Americans  intervene somewhere -- under the pretext of supporting human  rights, supporting humanitarian aspirations and peace -- it will  be nothing but a deception because they do not intervene in  similar scenarios where that detracts from their political  interests. And they even may prevent intervention by those  whose really intend to establish justice. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] You have pointed to the Nonaligned Movement,  the ICO, and the latter's liaison group. Now why is it that the  UN Security Council has called on NATO to act despite the fact  that countries such as Iran have repeatedly announced their  readiness to send troops? Is this a European and a Christian  decision in connection with the formation of an Islamic  government in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Velayati] In reality the Security Council which is under  the rule of the permanent members of the Council, and more  specifically under the rule of the western permanent members of  the Council, seriously prevents the international scene from  slipping away from the supervision and decisionmaking domain of  these limited and influential members of the Security Council.  It is in fact a form of coercion. On the surface the United  Nations and the Security Council were formed after World War II  to defend justice and keep security and peace. The UN Charter  is in fact to guard and strengthen peace in an honorable and  just fashion across the world and to propagate peaceful ideals.  However the foundations are such that the international scene  is under the yoke of several influential and powerful countries  of the Security Council. They think that if they respond  positively to requests by Islamic or third world countries and  allow them to defend justice under the UN flag and according to  UN charter, a part of the international situation may slip from  their hands and the Bosnian situation could develop in a way  that might not be in their interests. To conclude my answer to  your question I repeat and emphasize the answer given to the  earlier questions. The pretext of action by some western  countries within the UN context is to seek peace and justice.  However the content of their actions is in fact an effort toward  maintaining the interests of the countries on whose behalf they  are active in the United Nations.    As you pointed out, despite the declaration of Islamic  countries in the Pakistan summit and the repeated emphasis in  the recent Geneva summit as well as repeated emphasis in the  liaison group of the Islamic Conference in Jakarta -- which was  held during the nonaligned meeting -- stating the preparation of  the Islamic countries, at least the several countries that had  announced readiness, to send 20,000 fully equipped troops to  Bosnia under the full supervision of the UN, so as to leave no  doubt, we have not yet received a positive response form the UN  secretary general. This is despite the fact that the secretary  general and the Security Council repeatedly emphasize that there  is a need for more peacekeeping troops to guard peace and the  security of the besieged people of Bosnia. But they only ask  some particular countries. You have pointed this out. They  have asked the Americans to send 3,000 troops. Americans have  not sent them. France and Holland said they will be not sending  more. Well if they are short of troops and some UN members are  prepared to send troops to the region to serve under the control  of the UN commander, why are they not responding positively to  this proposal by Islamic countries? We can then conclude that  the UN Security Council is under the influence of several  particular countries. And since these countries only see and  wish to keep their own interests in the world, even to the cost  of other countries, they try to keep the international situation  under their own control. Thus they oppose other countries which  even might wish to send troops with all sincerity.    [Correspondent] The NATO deadline to the Serbs ends Sunday  night. NATO's intended deadline and action are not very  reliable and permanent because they are limited to areas  surrounding Sarajevo and the withdrawal of heavy weapons to a  particular distance, but is it possible to predict the NATO  action?    [Velayati] Their ultimatum is not very strong and no firm  decision has been made. They have asked the Serbs to withdraw  their heavy weapons 20 kilometers from where they are. We do  not really know what this would solve in Bosnia's complex  situation. That they have been told to withdraw their heavy  weapons means light weapons are alright. And the formation of  the Serb military forces around Sarajevo is such that they can  aim with light weapons at the innocent people of Sarajevo with  ease. Furthermore there are no plans for other Bosnian towns  besieged by Serbs and Croats. There are also differences  between NATO members over the implementation of the ultimatum.  Even if we imagine that they resolve their differences and take  action after the 10 days, it would be less an effective  practical action and more a propaganda measure for some western  countries which want to say that they are seeking peace and  justice in Bosnia. Even if they take action, for example by  bombing Serb positions, it would not be determining in the  Bosnian situation. It would only be a propaganda measure in  favor of countries making the decisions in NATO and a tool to  silence the protest of people who of are fed up with this  injustice.    [Correspondent] Dr. Velayati, this may seem a general  question, but what is the solution to the Bosnian problem?    [Velayati] It seems to be very simple, but they do not want  to see the implementation of a clear solution. Bosnia is an  accepted UN member. According to the UN Charter, if the  territorial integrity of a UN member country is threatened, it  is the responsibility of the United Nations to defend that  country's territorial integrity. That is to help the people of  that country to safeguard their territorial integrity. Second  if an act of aggression takes place against a country and  genocide takes place, it is the duty of the United Nations to  stop the genocide. Thirdly a number of resolutions were finally  issued in support of Bosnia due to the public pressure. It is  the duty of the United Nations to implement those resolutions.    Therefore the solution to the problem of Bosnia is that the  UN Security Council, which is responsible for safeguarding peace  and security in the world, should act, within the UN framework,  and seriously take the necessary measures to end the aggression  and bestial acts of the Serbs and Croats against Bosnia which is  an independent country and a UN member. It should also stop the  continuation of the genocide. It should also implement the UN  approvals.    I mentioned earlier that the United Nations is dominated by  double standards and you can see that in the way the Iraqi  people were treated. Look at the situation that Iraq finds  itself in today. A country with massive resources and a long  history. An important Islamic and Arab country. We have left  the Iraqi Government alone; but what sin have the Iraqi people  committed? Those people have really been devastated under the  the pretext of carrying out the decisions of the UN Security  Council. The same disaster was wreaked on the Somali people.  But regarding Bosnia they procrastinate somewhat.    Today, Bosnia's main problem is the indecision and  incompetence of the United Nations. That is, even if just one  of the influential members of the Security Council does not wish  one serious action to be undertaken in the international arena  it is able to carry out that wish. That is the United Nations's  shortcoming. That is, it is sufficient for an influential  Security Council member to veto a decision. It ties the UN  hands, even if under that veto the worst crimes occur in a spot  in the world. Just like it has in the Bosnian case! More than  200,000 of the Bosnians, most of whom, almost all of whom were  ordinary people and civilians -- women, children, young and old.  They became martyrs through the continuation of the Serbs'  crimes there. And hundreds of thousands became refugees. They  are living a harsh life, in the heart of Europe and under the  eyes of the UN observers. You see that the Serbs have deployed  their mortars, their artillery, and any time they wish they kill  the ordinary people who are passing through the street for  shopping. Human rights are being violated and trampled on so  blatantly over there and no serious objection is forthcoming  among the European communities.    We return to the first part of our discussion. If you wish  to know my understanding, it can be summarized in one word [as  heard]. Those people are Muslims and wish to have a country  where they can live in peace and tranquillity, just like the  rest of the world nations. This reactionary idea continues to  dominate in some Western communities that in practice they  oppose some of the European people -- who have another religion  -- having an independent state.    [Correspondent] Dr. Velayati, once again I thank you for  your  trouble in taking part in this program.    [Velayati] I thank you as well.</p>

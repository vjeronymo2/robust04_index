			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Move to cut night flying noise at London's airports NEW night flying restrictions designed to cut noise at London's Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports are to come into effect from Oct-ober. The government announced yesterday that a quota system based on the amount of noise made by different types of aircraft would be introduced, replacing the present regime based on the number of aircraft movements. Under the new system, which will operate for five years, the noisier the aircraft the more its use at night will use up an airport's quota. Separate regulations will ensure that noisier aircraft, such as the BAC 1-11, will be phased out within a decade. Announcing the move in a parliamentary written answer, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said he had tried to maintain a balance between the aviation industry and local people. He said the new system would help to ensure those living near the airports could enjoy 'a good night's sleep'. The new regime would be 'tough on industry' and was 'a challenge to them to maintain progress at introducing quieter aircraft'. BAA, which owns and runs the three London airports, said airlines would be encouraged by the quota system to schedule their quieter aircraft for use at Heathrow. The company said: 'Our aim is to ensure that our airports attract quiet, premium planes.' BAA said the new arrangements would also mean planes arriving at Heathrow from the Far East in the early morning, ahead of schedule, would not have to be stacked over south-east England before 6am. The airports define night-time as between 11pm and 6am. British Airways said the new scheme would clear up inconsistencies and inflexibilities, but BA's expansion plans would be affected. The company said: 'We were looking to land two extra flights from the Middle East.' There would be no scope for those flights under the new regulations, it added. Britannia Airways, the charter airline, puts 11,000 flights a year through Gatwick and 2,000 a year through Stansted. The company said it broadly welcomed the new restrictions as better than the previous ones, and said it would be given greater flexi-bility. The airline said there would have been greater incentive for airlines to invest in newer, quieter aircraft if the government had decided to give unlimited landing access to the so-called super-quiet aircraft, such as the Boeing 757 and Airbus A320.</p>

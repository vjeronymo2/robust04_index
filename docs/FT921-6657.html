			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow unsettled by decline in consumer confidence Wall Street A WEAKER than expected consumer confidence report unsettled the equity market yesterday, sending share prices lower across the board, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished above its low for the day but was still down 24.59 at 3,257.83. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.82 at 410.45, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks fell 3.53 to 621.40. Turnover on the New York SE came to 210m shares, and declines led rises by 1,052 to 654. Although the Dow indicator has crept up to new highs in recent days, the underlying tone of the market has been weak, and news of the decline in the Conference Board's February consumer confidence index to 46.3 - the lowest level since December 1974 - provided a good excuse for selling. The fall in the consumer confidence index was unexpected, as was an equally damaging decline in the Conference Board's measurement of consumer expectations, which pointed to more trouble for the economy. Even Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who has made positive noises recently about an economic recovery, was moved to call the confidence figures 'quite disturbing'. Leading stocks were lower across the board. IBM fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 88 1/8 , Merck Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 152 3/8 , Procter &amp; Gamble Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 100 5/8 and General Electric Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 79 3/8 . Motor shares were particularly hard hit, having been bought recently on hopes that rising consumer confidence would boost car sales. Ford slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 35 5/8 , General Motors Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 and Chrysler Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 16 3/8 . A rare gain was reported by SmithKline Beecham, which climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 73 3/4 on news of a 16.5 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits and plans for a two-for-one stock split. Wells Fargo dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 71 3/4 after credit rating agency Moody's downgraded Dollars 4bn of long-term senior debt and commercial paper because of concern about the outlook for the bank's asset quality. On the over-the-counter market, Intel weakened Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 63 3/4 as investors reacted to news that an arbitrator had granted Advanced Micro Devices, up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 19 1/4 , rights to the technology in its clone of Intel's 386 microprocessor. Canada THE Toronto market closed mixed after moderate trading, as dealers awaited the announcement of the Canadian government's Budget for the 1993 fiscal year. The composite index ended a slight 1.7 firmer at 3,544.9, but falls outnumbered rises by 297 to 262 after volume of 22.5m shares worth CDollars 238.3m.</p>

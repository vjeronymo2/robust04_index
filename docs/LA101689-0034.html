			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'COLD SASSY TREE' PROVES A PLEASANT ROMANCE  </P> <P> Faye Dunaway gets out and around. Witness her hot-pants Bonnie to Warren  Beatty's impotent Clyde ("Bonnie and Clyde"), her undercovers investigation of  Steve McQueen ("The Thomas Crown Affair"), her lover-daughter complications  with father-dearest John Huston ("Chinatown").  </P> <P> Her latest machination is staunch, independent Miss Love Simpson to Richard  Widmark's newly widowed-but-still-heated Rucker Blakeslee. It takes place in  turn-of-the-century Cold Sassy Tree, which is the name of the pinch-faced  Georgia town that is set atwitter.  </P> <P> The film, "Cold Sassy Tree," executive produced by Dunaway and Don Ohlmeyer,  and written and directed by Joan Tewkesbury, is a project of TNT cable, which  premieres it tonight at 5, 7 and 9 p.m.  </P> <P> It's taken from a first novel by Georgia journalist Olive Ann Burns, who was  setting down reminisences of her father. His is the voice of the story, as  played by Neil Patrick Harris, the new "Doogie Howser, M.D." He plays Widmark's  grandson.  </P> <P> Widmark is "a Democrat, Baptist and devout Confederate veteran" who is bent on  wrenching homilies -- "Livin' is like pourin' water into a Coca-Cola bottle --  if you're the least bit scared, you can't do it."  </P> <P> Dunaway is a shady lady from Baltimore, who, we learn, has a troubling history.  The guts of the story is that they marry for mutual convenience, then overcome  the town's fear of her indifference to the traditional woman's roles.  </P> <P> The town is stumblingly bucolic and the pictures are hazy, as if the movie was  shot in a dreamlike state.  </P> <P> But the leads are great old pros and it's a pleasant romance. The quibble with  the casting has more to do with a faulty script, which has characters grumbling  about their age difference. This is less a May-December romance and more like  mid-August-December.IRV LETOFSKY  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola, MPLA chairman, today granted an audience  to the African National Congress, ANC, team led by ANC Executive  Committee Member Tokyo Sexwale, who delivered an oral message  from ANC leader Nelson Mandela. The MPLA chairman took the  opportunity to express the MPLA's solidarity with the ANC as it  prepares for multiracial elections in South Africa. The  audience was also attended by MPLA Secretary General Lopo do  Nascimento.    Tokyo Sexwale believes that the name of Savimbi is becoming  synonymous with something evil. Addressing a news conference  this afternoon shortly before leaving the Angolan capital, that  ANC official noted that his party will not allow South Africa's  elections to result in a bloodbath.    [Begin recording] [Sexwale, in English with Portuguese  translation in subtitles] We support the talks that are taking  place right now in Lusaka between the various parties from  Angola but, in supporting those talks, we want to make it  absolutely clear that in our view, and in the view of  correctness, those talks that are taking place must not overlook  the fact that elections have taken place here and some people  did win those elections. The defeat of the Angolan elections,  which were the outcome of the popular opinion of the people here  is the defeat of the elections that will take place tomorrow in  South Africa.    You asked me a question about Mr. Savimbi. He is an old man.  He is an Angolan. He has been on the run for too many years  now. The appeal is to give his people a chance. Around the  world, the name Savimbi has come to be known as a name  representing some form of evil but, as an African, I think he  should work toward a situation where one day the name Savimbi  can be associated with reconciliation.    [Unidentified correspondent] Is there not the danger that  Buthelezi or Terreblanche might become another kind of Savimbi  in South Africa?    [Sexwale] I think until right now, we are also....[pauses]  We  have made an appeal to those people in the right wing in South  Africa, both black and white, the ultra rightwing, like Mr.  Buthelezi, like Terreblanche, even at this late hour, when we  have completed negotiations, we appeal to them to (?seriously  join) the process for elections on 27 April. But I must  indicate that, in support of those negotiations that are taking  place and in support of the defense of the elections, I think we  want to point out that we, in South Africa, have always held the  MPLA as our friend. In Zimbabwe, we once held the organization  of Mr. Nkomo as an ally, but they lost elections and we accepted  the will of the people of Zimbabwe (?behind) Mugabe. We accept,  therefore, the will of the people of Angola behind the MPLA.  [end recording]</p>

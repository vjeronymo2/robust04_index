			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Swissair and Austrian Air to operate joint offices SWISSAIR and Austrian Airlines are to operate jointly customer service offices in their two home countries from November 1 as part of a programme to intensify co-operation and reduce costs. The remaining offices, including agencies of the two airlines in border towns of neighbouring countries, will be operated by the home airline. Passenger and cargo handling at Swiss and Austrian airports will pass to the home carrier from September 1. Austrian Airlines and Swissair, together with Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), formed the European Quality Alliance in 1989 to share facilities and improve their competitiveness. The three recently set up jointly operated stations in some eastern European cities. Further links among the three were possible, said Mr Otto Loepfe, chief executive of Swissair, but he ruled out mergers. 'Generally we have said that, short of merger, all possibilities are open,' he said at a Zurich press conference.</p>

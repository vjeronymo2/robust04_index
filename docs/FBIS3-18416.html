			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [George Jones report: "Services in Conflict With Cabinet"] </F>   [Text] A serious clash is looming between the Cabinet and  defence chiefs over the Government's refusal to send more troops  to Bosnia. Service chiefs say the 2,300 troops there are so  thinly spread that they could be dangerously exposed if the war  worsens. The Chiefs of Staff have yet to make an unconditional  formal recommendation to the Government to send reinforcements,  but their concern is growing.    Senior soldiers have decided to give urgent support to a  request from Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose, the British UN Commander,  for another battalion of infantry.    Gen Rose is understood to have told the Chiefs of Staff that  the ceasefire he has brokered around Sarajevo -- and is  extending to other areas -- could crumble without more troops to  enforce it.    There is also a growing concern in the Army that the  Government, which argues that extra troops should come from  other countries, is failing to back a senior British officer who  is widely acknowledged to have transformed the situation around  Sarajevo with his tougher attitude to the warring factions.    Authoritative sources confirmed last night that there were  now serious differences between Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence  Secretary, and military chiefs, who want an additional battalion  to be sent to Bosnia for three months.    Ministers hit back, saying that the previous advice from the  military on reinforcing the British contingent has been  "ambivalent." A senior source in the Ministry of Defence also  stated that the Chiefs of Staff had so far made only one formal  recommendation to the Government: that the sending of additional  troops should be conditional on other nations agreeing to put in  extra men. The Cabinet's committee on Defence and Overseas  Policy (OPD) has firmly backed Mr Rifkind's opposition to  sending another battalion until other Nato countries,  particularly the United States, make a contribution.    After weeks of arguing the case behind doors in Whitehall,  senior officers now want the issue made public. The opening  shot in a remarkable trial of strength between the armed forces  and the Government was a letter to The Daily Telegraph on  Tuesday from Lord Bramall, former Chief of the General Staff,  who still has close links with the Army.    He said it seemed incredible that the Government had  "largely  spurned" a request by such a senior general.    "You could hardly imagine the French or even the American  Government taking such a negative view if one of their own  generals had achieved so much." The Government's opposition to  sending more troops was reaffirmed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the  Foreign Secretary. In an article in yesterday's London EVENING  STANDARD, headed "Why we won't be dragged into the quagmire," he  acknowledged that the UN might need extra men, but said that  Britain, with France, Spain, Holland, Canada and Malaysia, were  doing their bit.    "The extra should come from elsewhere," he said.    However, it was disclosed last night that the French, who  have the largest contingent in Bosnia, have decided to send out  a replacement battalion. It will overlap with the existing  forces there, and provide valuable additional support for the UN  peace keeping force under Gen Rose's command.    Senior ministers confirmed there was still strong opposition  in the OPD Cabinet committee to sending more troops. So far,  all that has been agreed is the despatch of 60 men with mortar  locating equipment and permission for Gen Rose to redeploy some  Coldstream Guards already stationed in Bosnia.    Although Mr Major, who chairs the committee, is sympathetic  to Gen Rose, some of the Cabinet's most heavyweight figures are  opposed to any deeper involvement. They are backed by most Tory  MPs, who fear that Britain could be sucked into a  "Vietnam-style" conflict.    On the one side are Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Harding,  Chief of the Defence Staff, Gen Sir Peter Inge, Air Chief  Marshal Sir Michael Graydon and Adml Sir Benjamin Bathurst.    Lined up against them are Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor,  Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, Mr  Rifkind and Mr Hurd. The Attorney General, Sir Nicholas Lyell,  also attends OPD meetings, largely to give advice on  international law.    Mr Clarke -- the second most powerful member of the  Government -- is the strongest opponent of sending more troops.  Mr Rifkind, who pointed out last week that there were only 15  US personnel on the ground in Bosnia, has also formed a close  alliance with Mr Hurd in arguing that other countries should  make a contribution before Britain does more.    The Prime Minister is said by colleagues to be acutely  aware of the danger that the Government could be accused of  failing to back a British general at a crucial moment in the  Balkan crisis.    Mr Major was in the forefront of pushing for British backing  for a more "muscular response" by NATO in the wake of the  Sarajevo market place massacre. In talks with President Clinton  in Washington on Monday [28 February] Mr Major urged him to  reflect urgently on the UN's need for more troops to enforce the  ceasefires now being established in Bosnia.    But the President again reaffirmed that America would not  contemplate sending ground troops until there was an overall  peace settlement. Mr Major suggested that a contingent of  Italian troops could be sent to Bosnia when he later met the  United Nations Secretary General, Mr Butrus Butrus Ghali, in New  York. This is now under active consideration .    At Westminster there is growing concern over the rift  between  the Cabinet and the military chiefs. It is the most serious  dispute on operational matters that has developed between this  Government and the Army.    There is now evident worry at the highest levels over the  dangers faced by the British contingent in Bosnia.    The soldiers are said to be tired and spread out in small  groups, without the ability to defend themselves against an  all-out attack.    Gen Rose will have an opportunity to state his case for more  troops when a deputation from the cross-party Commons defence  select committee visits the British peacekeeping forces in  former Yugoslavia early next week. The general will travel to  Split on the Croatian coast to meet them.    Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative MP for Upminster and  chairman of the select committee, said last night that he backed  the Cabinet's view that other countries should be expected to  play their part first.    "If more troops are sent we want to be sure we can extricate  ourselves. Otherwise we could find ourselves going down the  Vietnam road."    But Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman,  who will be part of the select committee deputation, said: "When  a British general performing a very difficult United Nations  command actually asks for more troops, his Government has a  pretty specific obligation towards him.    ``I don't think that ministers should let people take these  commands unless they are willing to give them the necessary  support.''</p>

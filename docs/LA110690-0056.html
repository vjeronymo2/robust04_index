			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPER SAYS ALL MARCOS WEALTH TO BE RETURNED  </P> <P> Imelda Marcos, who was reported to have reached a deal with the government to  repatriate part of her family's fortune, has offered to return all her late  husband's riches, a newspaper said.  </P> <P> The independent Manila Standard said the former first lady made the offer in  exchange for Manila's permission to allow her to return to the Philippines.  </P> <P> The newspaper said it interviewed Marcos by telephone from her Beverly Hills  hotel on Saturday.  </P> <P> But President Corazon Aquino said Monday the return of Marcos was not being  discussed in current negotiations for the repatriation of part of the Marcoses'  wealth from Hong Kong.  </P> <P> "This does not concern the return of Mrs. Marcos here," Aquino said.  </P> <P> Marcos and her late husband, Ferdinand, who was overthrown in a civilian-backed  military uprising in 1986 and forced into exile in Hawaii, are alleged to have  stolen more than $10 billion during the dictator's 20-year rule.  </P> <P> Aquino's government has barred the return of Imelda Marcos for security  reasons.  </P> <P> "All the wealth of President Marcos, and my life as well, I dedicate for the  betterment of all Filipinos," Marcos was quoted as saying by the Standard. "I  am coming home to dedicate my life and my husband's legacy to rebuild the  country and provide a better life for all Filipinos."  </P></p>

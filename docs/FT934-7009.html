			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Dream of freedom turns into a prison: Paul Betts explains why four European airlines abandoned the Alcazar project Alcazar yesterday turned into Alcatraz for four European medium sized airlines. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), Swissair and Austrian Airlines had attempted for the past seven months to merge their operations to create a 'fourth force' in the European aviation industry to compete against the big three European airlines: British Airways, Lufthansa of Germany and Air France. The four airlines picked on the name of Alcazar, the Spanish for a Moorish fortress, because their intent was to create a new fortress airline system in Europe to defend themselves against the increasing consolidation and globalisation of the European airline industry. Until a few weeks ago, it seemed the four carriers were close to agreement. They managed to compromise on several complex issues including the valuation of assets, headquarters location for the new joint airline company and the joint management structure. But at the end of the day it was the new partnership's American connection which transformed the ambitious venture into a prison which, like Alcatraz, was impossible to escape. Mr Jan Carlzon, the former SAS president, warned two weeks ago that the choice of a US airline partner was 'the only real large question that can still endanger Alcazar'. A partnership with a US carrier has become one of the critical aspects of any global alliance by a European carrier or group of airlines. But the problem for the Alcazar partners had been made all the more difficult because three of the carriers had already established ties with US airlines: KLM with Northwest, Swissair with Delta Air Lines and SAS with Continental. Until yesterday, financial advisers to the four airlines felt that the US partnership issue was in many respects less complex than the other problems the carriers had managed to resolve over the past few months of hectic negotiations. Indeed, bankers had calculated that co-operation in Europe would account for most of the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) benefits the alliance was expected to provide with the US partner playing a relatively minor role. In the last few days, the issue appears to have been narrowed down to a simple choice with KLM insisting on its US partner, Northwest, while the other three airlines favoured a link with Delta, in which Swissair has a 5 per cent cross-equity stake. 'It boiled down to KLM versus the rest on the US partner issue,' one source close to the negotiations said yesterday. KLM, which owns a 20 per cent stake in Northwest's parent, Wings Holdings, argued that Northwest offered strategic advantages to Alcazar largely because of the recent US 'open skies' deal with the Netherlands. But Swissair said Northwest was too weak financially and its US network, based around its hubs of Minneapolis and Detroit, was considerably less attractive than Delta's deeper reach in the domestic US market. KLM, however, was worried that Delta's main European hub at Frankfurt would rival the hubs of the Alcazar partners in Amsterdam, Zurich, Copenhagen and Vienna. But the other partners argued that Delta's strong presence in Frankfurt, rather than competing against their hubs, would enhance their position in Europe by strengthening their presence in the large German market. They also felt that if KLM got its way, the partnership would be heavily tilted in the Dutch airline's favour with Amsterdam ending up playing the dominant role in the alliance. The collapse of Alcazar will now force the four airlines to reconsider their longer term plans. KLM, which failed to form a partnership first with Sabena of Belgium and then with British Airways, has been cutting costs and believes it is now in a better position to face the competitive pressures of airline deregulation and globalisation than two years ago. The Dutch airline also believes it can buy some time to consider new partnerships because the pace of liberalisation in Europe appears to have slowed. SAS has also restructured its top management and intends to pursue its cost-cutting drive to return to profitability. But without a strong international partnership, its longer-term future remains clouded. Swissair has already made it clear that will need a strong European partner. It already has links with Delta and Singapore Airlines, but the airline needs a big European alliance. Mr Hannes Goetz, Swissair's chairman, recently said if Alcazar failed, Swissair would have to consider a partnership with one of the three big European carriers: BA, Lufthansa or Air France. As for Austrian, the smallest of the four, it has already held talks with Lufthansa and has not ruled out an alliance with Swissair. The collapse of Alcazar in no manner suggests a reversal in the current trend of consolidation in the European airline industry. If it had succeeded, the top six airline groups in Europe would have controlled almost 85 per cent of European airline traffic. But as Professor Rigas Doganis, of Cranfield Institute of Technology, recently put it: 'If it does not, another grouping will emerge. The consequences will be the same.'</p>

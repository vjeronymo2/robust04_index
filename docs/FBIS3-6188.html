The reaffirmation came at a meeting between South Korean  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and U.S. Deputy Secretary of  Defense Frank Wisner in Seoul on Tuesday.    The two officials also discussed security on the Korean  peninsula and strengthening bilateral security cooperation,  officials said.    Wisner told Yi that the Korean peninsula is vital to U.S.  strategy while the two officials agreed that the security  arrangement between the United States and South Korea remains  firm, the officials said.    The meeting was attended by other military officials from  both sides.    Wisner, visiting South Korea for the first time, is  scheduled  to visit the U.S. Second Infantry Division, an underground  tunnel dug by North Koreans in the Demilitarized Zone, South  Korea's First Infantry Divison and the Joint Security Area of  the truce village of Panmunjom before departing on Thursday.</p>

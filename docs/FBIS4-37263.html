			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source in the Democratic </F> Republic of Yemen"; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] At a time when the DRY [Democratic Republic of  Yemen] announces its agreement to arrangements for an urgent  meeting between the two sides, the southern and northern sides,  in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, in order that an agreement may  be reached on a machinery to supervise the task of the  cease-fire, and to establish it in accordance with the UN  Security Council Resolution No. 924 observing any violation of  it; and at a time when the DRY has informed Mr. Lakhdar  Ibrahimi, the envoy of the UN secretary general, on the evening  of 16 July about this, [passage omitted] the ruling military  regime in Sanaa continued its flagrant challenge to the will of  the Arab and international community. It embarked, since early  this morning, on random and barbarous attacks with rockets and  heavy, long-distance artillery against the peaceful residential  areas in the suburbs of the city of Aden as well as against  vital economic installations. This has resulted in the martyrdom  of more than 20 persons, most of them children, women and the  elderly, as well as a number of injuries.    This was accompanied by attempts to advance on all fronts  towards the capital, Aden, a matter which compelled our  defensive Armed Forces to repulse decisively this new aggression  of the forces belonging to the ruling military regime in Sanaa.  They stopped them from advancing. Battles were still  continuing while this communique was being prepared. [passage  omitted]</p>

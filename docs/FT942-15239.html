			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / No-fly zone patrols halted The US yesterday suspended for at least 24 hours all fighter patrols over the 'no-fly' zone in northern Iraq where two US jets shot down two US helicopters on Thursday, killing 26 people. Flights by Awacs radar aircraft are not affected. Mr William Perry, defence secretary, said he had ordered an immediate review of all operational procedures, including those mandating 'hair-trigger' responses, in the three areas where the US participates in no fly zones  - northern Iraq, southern Iraq and Bosnia. Mr Perry said that the fighter pilots' failure correctly to identify the helicopters in clear air was a major factor in Thursday's accident. No voice contact between the fighters and helicopters was established, he said. The White House reacted strongly to Republican criticisms that the Clinton administration's cuts in defence spending had contributed to the accident, saying 'attempts to politicise the tragedy are highly inappropriate'.</p>

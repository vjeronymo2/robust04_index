			<p>BFN     [Text] In the opinion of President Martti Ahtisaari, the  expansion of the European Union [EU] is important from the  viewpoint of security policy. Addressing the annual meeting of  the Civil Defense Course Association, Ahtisaari said that the  expansion of the EU is the most important factor for the  consolidation of European stability and a vital process for  joint security. According to Ahtisaari, EU membership creates a  new kind of action framework for Finland in foreign and security  policy when it is a member of the chief group influencing  international politics. Ahtisaari said that he expected much  from the civic debate preceding the EU referendum, adding that  the Finns must make it clear to themselves and others in which  direction they want to take this country.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Meciar repairs coalition A NEW coalition government has been formed in Slovakia between prime minister Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS) led by Mr Ludovit Cernak, a former economy minister. The agreement follows months of wrangling between the two parties after their earlier coalition collapsed last spring. It will end a period of growing political uncertainty overshadowed by calls from the left wing opposition for early elections to resolve the crisis. New ministers were sworn in yesterday by president Michal Kovac, including Mr Jan Ducky, a former president of the Slovak Industry Confederation, as economy minister. Mr Ducky worked in the industry ministry under the former regime, then became industry minister for nine months after the 1989 revolution that ended communist rule. Mr Julius Toth, a close ally of Mr Meciar, remains as finance minister. Mr Meciar will retain control of the privatisation ministry. The combined representation of the HZDS with 66 seats in the 150-seat parliament, and the SNS with 14 seats, will give the new coalition a clear majority. Few policy changes are expected.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yeltsin weakens the D-Mark THE D-MARK had a weaker tone against the dollar and European currencies yesterday as President Boris Yeltsin's declaration of direct rule raised deep concern about political stability in Russia, writes James Blitz. Political tension in the former Soviet Union tends to have a negative impact on the German currency. Germany is perceived to have a high level of foreign investment in Russia, while the physical proximity of both countries raises concerns that Bonn might one day face an even worse refugee crisis than the current one. Consequently, the D-Mark lost some of the ground it had made against the dollar at the end of last week. After closing at DM1.6330 on Friday night, the dollar rose as high as DM1.6473 in Europe yesterday morning. However, the US currency was unable to sustain the rise, and fell back to close at DM1.6375, up nearly  1/2 a pfennig on the day. Several factors limited the dollar's upside yesterday. First, there was speculation in currency markets that the Bundesbank would today ease its repo rate - the interest rate at which it offers short term funds to commercial banks. The level of German call money - at 8.65 per cent  -remains well above the new Discount rate of 7.50 per cent, and the Bundesbank may want money market rates to come into line. However, instead of cutting the repo rate today, it may choose to inject a large amount of liquidity into the banking system. Secondly, the dollar was capped by expectations that the next batch of US economic indicators will be on the weak side. Mr Christian Dunis, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, expects tomorrow's Durable Goods Orders for February to be poor. Finally, there is no reason to think that the dollar should make long-term gains from a Russian crisis. Mr Gerald Holtham, chief economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said he found it hard to recall the last time the dollar enjoyed a sustained rise from an east European crisis. 'If anybody will lose his peace dividend from this crisis it is President Clinton, not Chancellor Kohl,' he said. Last week's tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism were offset by the Russian crisis. Having fallen as low as FFr3.4150 on Friday, the French franc closed at FFr3.400 last night. However, sterling - which is outside the system - failed to make the same headway because of a poor set of UK trade figures. The pound closed up 1/2 a pfennig at DM2.4375. The excellent performance by right wing parties and the National Front in the French elections might have worsened the franc's plight had it not been for the crisis in Moscow. Dealers have been suspicious that a new French administration might be less tied to President Mitterrand's European policy. Markets may exert more pressure once a new administration is in place.</p>

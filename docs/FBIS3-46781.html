			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia has been learned to be looking into ways of  coordinating tripartite cooperation between the ROK, North  Korea, and itself.    According to Russia's Foreign Ministry report on tripartite  trade obtained by a Moscow-based trade authority of the Korea  Trade Promotion Corporation [Kotra] on 3 January, Russia is  seeking to form a tripartite trading system coordinating  Russia's resources, the ROK's capital, and North Korea's labor.    The source says that Russia is studying the possibility of  tripartite cooperation in 17 projects, including the development  of Russia's iron mines and energy resources and the  reconstruction of a railway traversing the Korean peninsula  vertically.    Particularly, Russia assesses that it will take the helm in  tripartite cooperation. In other words, Russia believes that it  can play the role of mediator for dialogue if North Korea  rejects cooperation with the ROK.    The reconstruction and joint operation of a railway  traversing the Korean peninsula vertically is one of the  tripartite cooperation projects Russia is now considering. In  this project, the ROK is supposed to provide financial  assistance and Russia is to provide locomotives and  transportation machinery.    The tripartite cooperation projects also include a plan to  develop the Tuman River basin as a center of traffic, where sea  routes linking Russia's Far East ports and ROK ports with the  trans-Siberian railway converge. This plan will be promoted in  connection with the Tuman River development plan.    Furthermore, while reviewing a plan to offer markets to  North  Korea in order to enhance the operation rate of its light  industry, Russia is planning to offer the ROK raw and subsidiary  materials.    Russia hopes to modernize plants and to build new production  lines with ROK finances, facilities and technology while it  supervises facilities and provides concrete designs for North  Korea's nonferrous metals, shipbuilding, train and  transportation equipment, ship repairing, construction  materials, and light industries.    At the same time, Russia is also looking for ways to  coordinate North Korean labor and ROK capital and equipment in  its development of agriculture, forestry, fishery, coal  industry, energy resources, and iron mines. Russia desires the  participation of ROK construction companies in the construction  of energy, petrochemical, and electric appliance production  bases in its Far East and Siberia. It may compensate North Korea  in cash or barter trade.    Regarding this, Kotra said, "It is difficult to put the  tripartite cooperation into practice now, but an environment for  this is maturing." He then added, "The ROK needs to prepare for  this, and establishing a special body, such as an  ROK-Russia-North Korea intergovernmental advisory committee for  promoting cooperation projects, may be worthwhile.</p>

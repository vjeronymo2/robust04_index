			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Rail talks start today as employers cope with disruption Negotiations will start today in moves to resolve the three-month rail signal workers' dispute. Officials from Acas, the independent conciliation service, held talks yesterday at the headquarters of both the RMT transport union and Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible for administering the network's infrastructure. The decision to restart talks follows Monday's decision by the RMT executive to back a return to the negotiating table. Union officials insist that there must be two sets of negotiations in parallel. One would deal for the first time with the complex and far-reaching restructuring package designed to modernise the work of the signal workers. The other would be concerned with the union's original pay claim for an 11 per cent wage increase for its signalling members for past efficiency achievements. Railtrack would have preferred the RMT to call off Friday's planned one-day strike as a sign of goodwill but the company did not make this a condition for the start of the negotiations. The company is also unhappy about the RMT's decision to hold 48 hours of disruption from September 29 and it hopes at least an interim deal can be ready before the end of next week. A survey of 200 central London employers has found that a third of them have had production disrupted by the strike, Richard Donkin writes. Most, however, have been learning to live with the strike, the Institute of Personnel and Development, which carried out the survey, says. Only 6 per cent of the employers said the strike had significantly affected their operations; 30 per cent reported some effect and 63 per cent said disruption was minimal. Employees are also finding ways of circumventing the strike disruption. At the beginning of the strike more than 13 per cent of the survey companies' employees failed to get to work. The proportion has now fallen to 3 per cent. The most popular methods used by companies to minimise disruption involve allowing staff to work from home, practised by 75 per cent of companies in the survey; providing overnight accommodation, adopted by 43 per cent; and providing buses for employees, used by 18 per cent. Some 43 per cent of the employers were compensating staff for extra costs incurred in getting to work. Half of the employers, however, expected staff who found themselves strike-bound to take their absence as annual leave.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Advertising Standards Authority rules HEA claim 'inadequately substantiated' A claim by the Health Education Authority that rainforest trees are burnt in the growth and production of tobacco was 'inadequately substantiated', the Advertising Standards Authority ruled in its monthly report. The claim, which appeared in advertisements in the HEA's youth magazine, was objected to by the Tobacco Advisory Council and the International Tobacco Growers' Association. The HEA said it had evidence that some tobacco-producing countries were responsible for de-forestation. Last month a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority from the HEA led to Imperial Tobacco, the Hanson subsidiary, scrapping its advertising campaign for Embassy Regal cigarettes.</p>

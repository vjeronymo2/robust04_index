			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Eni's net profits this year may exceed L1,000bn Eni, Italy's state-owned energy and chemicals holding company, could increase net profit this year to more than L1,000bn (Dollars 641m) if the recovery of the first five months is maintained. Sources at Eni yesterday confirmed reports that Mr Franco Bernabe, the group's chief executive, would present managers with an upbeat forecast for this year, when they meet later this month. Last month Eni reported a return to profit of L419bn in 1993, from a loss of L815bn in the previous year. Eni is underlining the improvement in its prospects as its oil and gas interests - Agip and Snam - are likely to be sold off by the state within the next 12 months. The improvement in the 1994 results will be built on the recovery at the loss-making Enichem chemicals subsidiary, which announced last month that it expected this year to halve 1993's L2,668bn loss. The forecast also provides a timely riposte to reported criticism by Italy's vice-premier, Mr Giuseppe Tatarella of the neo-fascist National Alliance. On Wednesday, Mr Tatarella called for the resignation of Mr Bernabe and attacked the level of mediocrity at Eni. Eni managers hit back at the declarations, and warned the government against trying to interfere with the final stages of Eni's restructuring. 'We are convinced that the future of a group of this importance ought to be built on co-operation with the government and on the basis of programmes shared with the management,' the managers said in a statement. 'But we are also absolutely certain that better results can be obtained by leaving each (to carry out) his own responsibilities, and evaluating managers . . . on the basis of results obtained according to objectives established by the shareholder, whoever it might be,' they added.</p>

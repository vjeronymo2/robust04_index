			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: BMW expects fall in car deliveries BMW, the German luxury car maker, expects deliveries to distributors to fall this year for the first time since 1974. The setback follows progress in 1992 when BMW recorded a 4.7 per cent increase in turnover and a 7.6 per cent rise in deliveries to 598,000 units. However, turnover growth was hit by currency devaluations and the increased share in sales of the cheaper 3-series. Profits, which were not disclosed, were satisfactory, the group said in a letter to shareholders yesterday. Publication of the letter knocked DM15.30 off BMW shares in Frankfurt, which closed at the day's low of DM501.50. The DAX index of 30 leading shares fell 18.40 points to 1,569.24. The group said it expected world demand for new cars in 1993 to stagnate at 1992's level of 33.5m. Recovery in the US was likely to be offset by weak demand in Japan and Europe. The group said economic improvements, expected in the second half, would not prevent a fall in BMW deliveries for the year. This would be only the second interruption to more than 30 years of progress. Productivity improvement, which last year saw 1,800 job losses in Germany, would be continued. Last year, new BMW registrations in Europe climbed 7 per cent to 440,000 units. Sales in the US rose 23 per cent to 65,700, reversing a long-term decline.</p>

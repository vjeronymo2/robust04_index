			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] Russia does not rule out that at a certain stage it  may join NATO, just like any other country, however, it believes  it should be in no hurry to do so, Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev has said. He was speaking at a news conference in  Brussels following his talks with the U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher.    Kozyrev said that "Partnership for Peace" was enough to  develop cooperation with that alliance.    Kozyrev said that at his talks with the U.S. Secretary of  State six questions were discussed -- President Yeltsin's visit  to the United States scheduled for late September, the G-7  summit in Naples next month, the UN Security Council's draft  resolution on North Korea's nuclear program and situations in  Latvia and Estonia, and Bosnia.    Kozyrev said that the sides had proved to have close or  identical attitudes to all fundamental aspects of the North  Korean nuclear problem. "Our representatives in New York are  still to do some editing", Kozyrev said.    As he answered questions, Kozyrev warned that sanctions  against North Korea would be inevitable in 30 days unless that  country took positive steps to meet the international community  half-way. He said North Korea should be helped by convening an  international conference.    About the Baltic countries the Russian Foreign Minister said  Latvia had adopted laws that do not hold water.    As for Estonia, there might be an early agreement on the  withdrawal of troops from that country on the condition Tallinn  displayed goodwill.    About Bosnia Kozyrev said that the liaison group was to meet  in session on June 28 to produce a plan for a settlement in  Bosnia.    He said that the liaison mission would use the stick and  carrot policy towards the warring factions.</p>

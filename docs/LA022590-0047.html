			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORDSTROM 'GUILTY' OF REWARDING INITIATIVE, BUT OTHERS ALSO REQUIRE WORK 'OFF  THE CLOCK'  </P> <P> Your article on Nordstrom gave me cause to smile. Having worked at Bullocks  several years ago, the scenario described was very similar.  </P> <P> We were never told to work extra hours, but it was very clear that you were  expected to clock out at your regular hour and then return to the selling floor  for another four hours or come in early and then clock in at your regular time.  This boosted your selling quota considerably, thereby making you one of the  so-called good sellers.  </P> <P> Nobody complained then, I guess, because we were young and needed the job. I'm  glad to see the practice uncovered.  </P> <P> JACK MASON  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

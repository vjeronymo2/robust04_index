			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Council swaps cases resume A FRESH attempt is being made to bring cases to court in order to establish legal guidelines for resolving about 200 outstanding actions between banks and local authorities arising out of the interest rates swaps debacle. The House of Lords ruled in January last year that all swaps deals were invalid because they had been outside councils' legal powers. It left 80 banks facing losses of about Pounds 560m on swap transactions with 130 councils. Their only recourse was to try to recover about a quarter of their losses by suing councils for restitution of funds earned by writing swap contracts. Yesterday the High Court judge in charge of the litigation named another set of lead cases to replace the original six, all of which have been settled out of court. Mr Justice Hirst said the outstanding litigation involved several dozen banks and a greater number of local authorities. By far the most important issue in all cases was whether the banks' claims for restitution were legally sound. He selected a claim by SG Warburg against Birmingham City Council, involving more than Pounds 5m, as the principal leader on restitution, setting January 11 as the hearing date. If that case is settled out of court, the lead role will be taken by Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, claiming Pounds 1.145m from the London Borough of Islington, and Kleinwort Benson v Sandwell, in the West Midlands, in which the claim is for more than Pounds 360,000. The second main legal issue concerns intermediation - where a local authority acted as an intermediary between a bank and another council. Lead case on that issue will be Morgan Grenfell's Pounds 2m claim against Welwyn Hatfield District Council. The second-tier cases will be three actions by Chemical Bank against Welwyn Hatfield, Sandwell and the London Borough of Richmond, involving claims of Pounds 3m, Pounds 7m and Pounds 3.7m respectively, and claims by Kleinwort Benson (nearly Pounds 1.6m) and Morgan Grenfell (Pounds 700,000) against South Tyneside council.</p>

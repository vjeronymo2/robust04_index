			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Tax avoidance scheme blocked A tax avoidance scheme on share issues was blocked within the amendments to close tax avoidance loopholes. Changes were announced to the rules on VAT and incidental financial transactions, which is estimated to cost up to Pounds 100m a year. In addition to revenue protection, the move will bring UK law in this area into line with European Community law. The changes will come into effect from December 1 1994.</p>

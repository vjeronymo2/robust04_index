			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Setbacks at Japanese oil distributors Japan's leading oil distributors saw declines in sales and operating profits for the first half to September, due to the the time lag in transferring crude oil procurement costs to wholesale prices. Nippon Oil, the industry leader, saw non-consolidated interim recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - decline 31.4 per cent to Y13.3bn (Dollars 137m) on a 0.7 per cent fall in sales to Y868.9bn. Operating profits plunged 42.9 per cent to Y5.9bn and after-tax profits declined 24.7 per cent to Y6.8bn. The company said procurement costs rose before they could be factored into its wholesale prices. It also failed to benefit from the 40.8 per cent rise in fuel oil sales triggered by demand from an increase in electric power generation due to the hot summer. For the full year to next March, the company expects the rise in crude oil prices to continue to affect its profitability, in spite of an expected rise in sales volume. Unconsolidated recurring profits are forecast to fall 21.9 per cent to Y33bn on a 1.3 per cent increase in sales to Y1,830bn. Cosmo Oil said sales fell 1.8 per cent to Y678.8bn and operating profits declined 12.4 per cent to Y14.5bn. Current earnings, however, rose 4.2 per cent to Y12.9bn due to rationalisation efforts and an improved balance on its financial items. After-tax profits rose 1.9 per cent to Y5.3bn. The company said procurement costs rose by Y5.2bn. In spite of a rise in other costs, the company refrained from increasing wholesale prices in fear of further dampening demand. For the full year to next March, Cosmo expects a 0.6 per cent rise in recurring profits to Y39bn on a 0.1 per cent increase in sales to Y1,440bn.</p>

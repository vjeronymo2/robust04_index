			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (14): Night and day access This business caller is able to access his computer - reading and sending electronic messages, and giving instructions for information to be sent elsewhere, when the office is closed and he is miles away 'on the road.' The commuter is using WordPerfect's new Telephone Access Server (TAS) - codenamed Telemail. The product is due for release later this year. Using a touchtone telephone, TAS-users can send electronic messages, listen to and update their calendars, accept or decline appointments or tasks, at any time  -'turning even a mobile phone into their own 24-hour global office,' says a WordPerfect spokesman.</p>

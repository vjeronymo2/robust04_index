			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Rockwell Int'l posts 20% advance to Dollars 147m ROCKWELL International, the California-based high technology group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent increase in third-quarter net income and forecast that full-year earnings per share would be at least 15 per cent higher than last year. The group reported net income of Dollars 147.2m, or 66 cents a share, compared with Dollars 122.6m, or 55 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales rose from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 2.8bn. Mr Donald Beall, chairman, said third-quarter figures were ahead of the company's expectations, with three of its four business units reporting substantial earnings increases - aerospace and automotive were each up 38 per cent while electronics, the group's largest business, was up 28 per cent. The fourth, graphics, had a loss, due to 'continued depressed worldwide newspaper printing press markets'. The company said, however, that it was beginning to see signs of an upturn in demand for large newspaper presses. For the first nine months, net income was Dollars 411.9m, or Dollars 1.87 a share, up 19 per cent over the Dollars 344.9m, or Dollars 1.54, reported the previous year prior to accounting changes. Mr Beall said the third-quarter figures demonstrated performance improvements through company-wide initiatives in 'progressive management practices'. Aerospace's return on sales was up 3 percentage points, while electronics and automotive were up almost 2 percentage points.</p>

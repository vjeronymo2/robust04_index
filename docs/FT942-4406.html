			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World News in Brief: German court clears IRA suspects of soldier's murder A German court acquitted three suspected IRA terrorists of murdering a British army officer but said it was convinced they were IRA members. Paul Hughes, 30, Donna Maguire, 27, and Sean Hick, 33, had been charged with the 1990 shooting of Major Michael Dillon-Lee in Dortmund. The presiding judge said the trio were part of an IRA 'active service unit' on the European mainland, but this itself was not a crime in Germany. They were also acquitted for lack of evidence of attempted murder charges in the failed 1990 bombing of British army barracks at Langen Hagen, when a sentry disturbed armed attackers trying to prime some 100 pounds of Semtex explosives.</p>

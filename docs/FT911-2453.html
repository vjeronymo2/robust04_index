			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (6): Indicators that point all ways - Property THE pent-up demand caused byfears during the Gulf War crisis erupted, in the case of The Waterside condominium project, with 100 eager homebuyers and speculators camping overnight outsidethe sales office. Within nine hours, the more fortunate of the 400 people who turned up to buy the 168 apartments, had snapped up 93 per cent of the units worth up to SDollars 1.1m. Within days, some were being advertised at a 32 per cent mark-up. However, that scenario was not repeated for the office, retail, hotel and factory sectors. Only the supply of quality warehouse space has been tight in the past few years due to a lack of development. Office rents rose 35 per cent in the first 9 months of 1990, stabilised, and then fell; retail rents along the main Orchard Road shopping belt dived during the Gulf crisis before levelling off and pulling upwards and no one is building hotels. In spite of The Waterside's success, property experts generally agree on several trends: rental periods will be of longer duration; rents and prices for all sectors are going down; and buildings are going to be decentralised. Several crucial factors impact the property sector: the supply coming onstream, the projected slowdown in the economy, government plans to make landed property more affordable to Singaporeans while influencing market prices through land sales. The Japanese are enlarging their impact on the property scene, while there is theHong Kong factor to consider. Residences will be more affordable when the government eases planning guidelines to make landed properties more affordableto Singaporeans by allowing smaller semi-detached houses to be built, new type terrace houses closer to the road, and bigger built-in areas for bungalows. Meanwhile, property consultants Jones Lang Wootton forecasts 4,115 apartmentsand condominiums being marketed this year, and 4,853 more over the next two. Forseeing a substantial increase in the supply of office space, landlords have been offering six-year leases instead of the traditional three years. This appeals to tenants, particularly multinational corporations used to longer-term agreements to help fix rentals and increases. The office sector reached historical levels in rentals, values per sq foot and yields in 1990, notes RichardEllis, property consultants. However, the Gulf War uncertainties and weakening economies of Singapore's trading partners caused rents to stabilise and capital values to drop about 10 per cent. Rents of SDollars 12 per sq ft have dipped to SDollars 8, leading landlords to offer perks such as four-month rent holidays towoo tenants. There will also be more diversification in the quality, price and location of office space, predicts Richard Ellis, adding that the stock of private quality office space will almost double by 1994. There should be 12m sq ft available by 1995. This is welcome news to Singapore. In January 1990, it was the 10th most costly city to be located in, in terms of commercial rents, points out Mr Christopher Fossick, a Richard Ellis director. Halfway through1990, Singapore had risen to 6th place just behind Tokyo, London's West End, and Hong Kong, making it more expensive than Milan, Toronto and Los Angeles. There were only three large commercial buildings opened in 1991, with 3.5msq ft of office space available in 1991. There is also a long list of properties on sale. The listed property companies mostly met analysts' forecasts of their rental and development income but some lost money on equities trading. To ease their debt burden incurred on acquiring properties, large companies such as City Development, DBS Land and Wing Tai Holdings are expected to make cash calls. In spite of record tourist numbers to Singapore, retailers once too eager to jump on board the brand name bandwagon are faced with falling sales andincreasing operating costs. They had been banking on the purchasing power of Japanese tourists but, with the removal of commodity taxes on retail goods in Japan, including branded items, Japanese tourists are less keen to buy brand name items overseas, especially with a weaker yen. Richard Ellis sees another trend emerging: regional shopping centres. As more women join the workforce, household incomes have more than doubled while leisure time has decreased. Regional shopping centres were established to meet the changing shopping needs of the increasingly cash-rich but busy consumers. Decentralisation hasalso spread to other properties. Retail outlets can be found outside Orchard Road at Scotts or Beach Road; residential projects are being built outside the choice locations; offices are relocating in the Alexandra corridor and business parks; even the central bank is overseeing the development of a 30-hectare hi-tech park for the financial sector at Tampines. The tenants will be those not dealing directly with the public and could include the stock exchange financial regulatory bodies and back-room services of banks. Singapore wants tobe a regional base for large financial houses such as Chemical Bank. 'Like theUK and US, these parks allow multi-functions under one roof with operations such as research and development and light manufacturing,' says Mr Fossick. The added allure is a back-up power supply to ensure uninterrupted trading in case of a power failure. The Japanese are concentrating only on what they consider prime properties. Having invested more than SDollars 1bn of real estate or 22 per cent of total investments in 1989, their share shrank to 17 per cent or SDollars 446m in an overall smaller market in 1990. Hong Kong-based buyers accountedfor SDollars 354.2m or 13 per cent of overall investments in 1989 and SDollars 208m or 4 per cent last year. Some 200,000 - 300,000 sq ft of property was taken up bycompanies relocating from Hong Kong in 1990. They are taking up more space, more in line with what they would have taken up in the colony. There is no sense of panic in the republic as many people believe that rents and capital values will eventually reach reasonable values in the medium-term.</p>

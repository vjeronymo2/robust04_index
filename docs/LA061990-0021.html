			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> BOTH WILSON, FEINSTEIN SEEN AS ALLIES BY LOCAL LEADERS  </P> <P> Californians in November will elect a former big-city mayor as governor for the  first time in more than half a century, to the delight of problem-plagued  leaders of California's 58 counties and 456 cities who look forward to having  an experienced ally of local government in Sacramento.  </P> <P> They will have such a friend regardless whether California voters choose former  San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, a Republican U.S. senator, or former San Francisco  Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat. Both nominees have already pledged to  develop a stronger, more sympathetic relationship between state and local  government.  </P> <P> If they can deliver, their proposals could lead to the most significant  realignment of governmental powers in California in decades, and certainly  since the passage in 1978 of Proposition 13, the property tax-cutting  initiative that precipitated a major shift of power and finance from city halls  and county courthouses to Sacramento.  </P> <P> Wilson left the state Assembly in 1971 to win election as mayor of San Diego,  serving in that post through 1982. Feinstein was the chairman of the San  Francisco city-county Board of Supervisors in November of 1978 when Mayor  George Moscone was shot to death, and she automatically succeeded to the  mayor's office. Feinstein subsequently won election to two full terms ending in  early 1988. Wilson has been president of the League of California Cities, and  Feinstein has been a league board member. Since San Francisco is both a city  and a county, her administration also was active in the County Supervisors  Assn. of California.  </P> <P> Both candidates have made strong statements of support for local government  programs. Each has vowed to stop the Legislature's practice of dumping  additional responsibilities onto cities and counties without giving them the  money or revenue sources to finance such duties. Each has promised to establish  an intergovernmental structure to involve cities and counties in the formation  of state policy and budgets.  </P> <P> Feinstein has gone further than Wilson in supporting the goals of the county  supervisors -- to suggest, for example, that the state take over all financing  and administration of welfare from the counties. Wilson told The Times last  week that he opposes such a move and is more inclined to decentralize welfare  administration to give counties more discretion in running the system.  </P> <P> The candidates also differ over the creation of a split property assessment  roll to require businesses to bear a bigger share of the property tax burden  than residences. Feinstein has said a split roll "makes a lot of sense to me."  Wilson opposed the split roll because, he said, heavier business taxes would be  bad for economic development.  </P> <P> Their differences, however, do not dampen the enthusiasm of local officials for  having two nominees for governor who have experienced their problems firsthand  as local administrators.  </P> <P> Donald C. Benninghoven, executive director of the League of California Cities,  said, "They have been on the firing line. They have been major managers of an  urban area. They understand what it's all about. We're just delighted to work  with both candidates in coming to grips with issues that need to be dealt  with."  </P> <P> Larry E. Naake, Benninghoven's counterpart at the County Supervisors Assn.,  said that George Deukmejian also pledged to work closely with local government  when he became governor in 1983. He established a local-government liaison in  the Office of Planning and Research. The system "worked pretty well for a  couple of years, but now has just sort of petered out," Naake said. While the  local government emissary was a member of the governor's staff, the office was  in a building away from the Capitol and did not have the access to power  enjoyed by staff members within the governor's Capitol compound.  </P> <P> Feinstein has endorsed the supervisors' proposal for a state-local government  commission that would be involved in the governor's budget process. Naake noted  that about $13 billion of the current $42-billion state general fund budget  "finds its way to or through the counties, but we're out of the process."  </P> <P> Wilson has talked of creating a body similar to the federal Advisory Commission  on Intergovernmental Relations with a less-direct role than the supervisors'  proposal. But in a meeting with California county sheriffs last week, Wilson  pledged, if elected, to meet with supervisors and other county representatives  to review the existing structure of government.  </P> <P> "What we intend to do is make sense of what now makes no sense," Wilson said.  "It makes no sense for Butte County to be on the verge of bankruptcy, saved  only by a one-time infusion of state funds. What makes sense is to reorder  priorities and to say that county governments are to do those things that are  most important. And the most important in my judgment is public safety."  </P> <P> Benninghoven said the form of the bureaucratic structure is less important than  the governor's personal commitment to the concept. "The best relationship we  ever had was way back with Pat Brown when cities and counties sat with the  Cabinet at regular monthly Cabinet meetings," he said, referring to the  governorship of Edmund G. Brown, 1959-67. "That has never happened before -- or  since."  </P> <P> The major problem facing counties is the growth of programs such as welfare and  the courts. A constitutional mandate that the state pay for new or expanded  services it requires of local government does not apply to such big-ticket  programs. Naake said that 65% to 70% of all county income was spent on state  services 20 years ago. Today, the figure has grown to 95% while county income  has declined. This has put the squeeze on traditional county services such as  law enforcement, libraries, parks and health care.  </P> <P> "It is just totally eroding our ability to deal with local demands and local  services," Naake said.  </P> <P> A 1972 state law incorporated into the state Constitution by the Gann  spending-limit initiative of 1979 prohibits the Legislature from imposing new  services from local government without also financing them. But the Legislature  often skirts the requirement by declaring new laws exempt from the financing  provision.  </P> <P> Both Wilson and Feinstein have promised to end this practice, with Wilson  vowing to veto any bill that puts a new duty on local government without  providing the needed money. Feinstein has said there is a need for "reliable  funding for the mandates so that counties won't have to divert money from  sheriff patrols, fire protection and other vital day-to-day services to pay for  them."  </P> <P> Feinstein has not said just where the state would get the money. But in an  appearance before county supervisors during the primary campaign, she said,  "There can be much more discretion in deciding on what priorities should be  addressed and what funds should be used."  </P> <P> Wilson has said major savings can be achieved through cost controls in the  provision of medical services to the poor and through preventive health care.  And local government must be given more authority to set its own spending  priorities, he said.  </P> <P> In spite of Proposition 13 restrictions, the cities have more authority to  raise needed revenue than do the counties. Thus, the municipalities' financial  problems are not as severe. The major challenge facing cities in the 1990s is  growth management, Benninghoven said. "That will require a very close and very  sensitive new and more effective relationship between state and local  government. That's going to be tough."  </P> <P> For the first time, the state will have to provide local government with  long-range direction in the field of land-use planning, Benninghoven said,  adding: "That's where the state is going to be spending a lot of its  policy-direction time. . . . I think both candidates frankly realize that."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR'S RACE;  </P> <P> CANDIDATES REAFFIRM ABORTION STANDS  </P> <P> Don't be confused. Even though he's a man, a Catholic and the attorney general,  John K. Van de Kamp is a strong supporter of abortion rights.  </P> <P> Sometimes, "assets are also liabilities," Van de Kamp told an audience  Wednesday in Irvine at the Planned Parenthood Western Regional Conference,  where he appeared along with his rival for the Democratic gubernatorial  nomination, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein.  </P> <P> "That has created some confusion," Van de Kamp said. "So let me state once  again, for the record, that I have always supported Medi-Cal funding for  abortion; that I am opposed to the parental consent law, and that I strongly  support increased funding for desperately needed family planning services.  </P> <P> "Some of our characteristics, like gender, are dealt to us by nature," he said.  "Others, like our records, we build and we earn."  </P> <P> In the abortion politics of the California governor's race -- where all three  candidates support abortion rights -- the contest has been over the degrees of  restrictions.  </P> <P> Feinstein said she would support an initiative to guarantee abortion rights if  they are threatened by the state government. She said, however, that "for the  moment, abortion is safe in California."  </P> <P> "But we need to elect leaders who are unequivocally pro-choice. And I just  happen to know one woman for governor who fits that bill," she added.  </P> <P> A representative for Sen. Pete Wilson, the Republican candidate for governor  who also supports abortion rights, spoke at the conference.  </P> <P> Last month, Van de Kamp called on state health officials to allow testing of  the pill RU 486, which has been found to induce abortions within five weeks of  conception. If the drug is proven safe, Van de Kamp said, he believes it should  be marketed.  </P> <P> The drug's manufacturer, however, is a French company, Roussel Uclaf, which has  not applied for a license to test its product in California. And, Van de Kamp  acknowledged, there's no guarantee the firm will supply the drug for testing.  </P> <P> Abortion rights advocates called Van de Kamp's proposal "smart politics" and  good news for American women. Feinstein suggested the attorney general was  "trying to one-up me with the female vote."  </P> <P> Feinstein leads Van de Kamp among women voters by more than a 2-to-1 margin,  according to a recent Los Angeles Times Poll.  </P></p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / On the lookout for the vision thing: David Goodhart on the need for fresh ideas at this week's annual gathering of the battered TUC Britain, according to many trade unionists, is an increasingly unpleasant place in which to work. A shrinking number of employees, they argue, enjoys 'steady jobs' offering security and prospects, while a growing army of workers - from highly skilled professionals to labourers - is subject to the hire-and-fire whims of hard-pressed, or plain ruthless, employers. Much will be heard about this Britain at the 125th annual gathering of the Trades Union Congress which opens today in Brighton. But not many of the 1,000 delegates will be reflecting on why, if working life is so unpleasant, the number of people reaching for the protection of the trade unions is falling. Even in the late 1980s, when more than 1m jobs were created, the trend was downwards. Now, TUC-affiliated unions represent only 30 per cent of the workforce. Moreover, the row over the return of the Electricians Union to the TUC and other domestic tiffs will distract delegates from pondering what trade unions have to offer their other customers: employers, not to mention the national economy in the latter 1990s. One person with longer-term strategy on his mind is Mr John Monks, 48, the thoughtful new general secretary of the TUC, who promises a relaunch of his battered organisation and, he hopes, the whole trade union movement. The arrival of a new leader is generating a flutter of optimism among the trade union elite that the movement can make itself more relevant. On the face of it, however, its prospects are gloomier than ever. Despite the loss of political influence under Tory governments and the more restrictive legal framework of the past decade, British unions still have an influence greater than warranted by their actual numerical strength in large manufacturing plants and the public sector. But that position is now under serious threat. Financial constraints, caused by falling membership, will be exacerbated by government moves to curb the automatic deduction by companies of trade union dues from wages. More worrying for the unions is the way in which the withdrawal by employers of union recognition, once the exception, is becoming common. The oil industry provides the latest example. 'In some workplaces, unions have become so marginalised that they are disappearing with scarcely anyone noticing. In many other workplaces the union presence is poised on a knife edge, with employers now considering whether the hassle of getting rid of them is worthwhile,' says Mr Alan Cave, a management consultant and former head of research at the GMB general union. Many would regard that view as exaggerated, but certainly some union officials fear the devolution of decision-making to local managers in the public sector will threaten this heartland of trade unionism. In addition, in both public and private sectors, employers are increasingly removing their most-prized employees from collective bargaining and offering them individual contracts. These trends towards derecognition may be irreversible, but there are other reasons for the decline of trade unionism which the TUC could address. In particular, union leaders need to improve their record of recruitment in those areas where new jobs are being created and among women, who are filling most new vacancies. 'Unions are still not female-friendly organisations and, until recently, they have done very little on pushing for equal pay,' says one woman union activist. The middle-ranking supervisor or lower manager of 'middle England' - pinpointed by Mr Monks as another key group needing union support - also still regards the unions with suspicion. 'Ideally we would start again with a new name and without the cloth cap associations which the unions still have,' says one TUC official. 'This should be a great time for union recruitment. The fact that it is not is more our own fault than down to employers or the government.' Middle England is not at ease with the unions' collectivist traditions or its Labour party links. Mr Monks, unlike the leaders of some of the biggest TUC unions, is keen to distance the TUC from the Labour party and turn it into a much more apolitical lobbying organisation. Even Mr Monks, however, is enough of a traditionalist to baulk at the argument that unions must accept the decline of collective bargaining and concentrate resources on assistance to individual employees, for example in negotiating individual employment contracts. However, there is evidence that the tailoring of union activities to individuals has widespread support among union members. A 1992 survey by the Nupe public services union found that, even among relatively low-paid health service and local government workers, advice on disciplinary issues and grievances came ahead of pay bargaining on the list of reasons for joining a union. Unions are already providing such legal services for many members and are effective at negotiating redundancy deals. Making a virtue of that and selling union membership as an individual's workplace insurance may run against the collectivist grain for many unions, but it may be a necessary ingredient for survival. Yet to remain an effective mass-membership organisation, as opposed to just a political lobbying organisation as in France, will also require the union movement to keep at least tacit support from employers. That is a point Mr Monks acknowledges, boasting that some of the most efficient and successful companies in Britain recognise unions - including most of the UK's 50 leading exporters. According to Mr Robbie Gilbert, head of employee relations at the Confederation of British Industry, unions still have a role in channelling the employees' 'voice', especially where there are large groups of workers who do not qualify for individual treatment. By increasing employee security, unions can also help in the management of change. At Rover Group, for example, the unions helped to negotiate a 'no compulsory redundancy' agreement during the transition to Japanese-style working practices. That has helped to allow considerable flexibility within the company because employees do not fear losing their jobs. Mr David Bower, Rover personnel director, also reports record numbers of employee efficiency suggestions - which last year saved Pounds 10m. Unions, say consultants like Mr Cave, can provide a useful pressure on employers by 'whistle-blowing' on everything from cutting training budgets to poor health and safety standards. Union lobbying, even on non-employment issues, for example on higher investment in research and development, can make a difference inside companies without requiring a formal apparatus of worker representation. Unions also have a potential to act beyond the confines of individual companies. Unlike most companies, unions have links across whole industries which they can use strategically, for example, by trying to establish a better trade-off between pay and jobs across a sector. Mr Gilbert of the CBI suggests that unions could have a role in creating a better balance between employee security and labour flexibility. That could be achieved, he believes, be encouraging employees to develop mobile skills, rather than clinging to particular jobs. 'That means unions lobbying companies and the government for the highest possible level of training and retraining so that, if people do lose their jobs, it is not a disaster because they are readily employable elsewhere.' This is not an easy agenda for unions. But there are some workplace trends in their favour. For example, the increased emphasis on teamwork production methods has the potential to increase shop-floor clout in large manufacturing companies. The challenge for Mr Monks over the next decade is to ensure that union influence does not retreat - US-style - into a few ghettos in manufacturing and the public sector. This week he must show he has the vision and imagination to prevent that fate.</p>

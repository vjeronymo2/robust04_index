			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURPLUS FOOD  </P> <P> (While working at a market) recently, I threw away 196 half-gallons of milk.  Although this was an unusual occurrence, precipitated by an ordering error, I  felt like I was committing a crime.  </P> <P> Every week, I trash varying amounts of milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, hot dogs  and various other deli items. My job is to ensure that there is always adequate  product on the shelf. The result is some of the product exceeds the expiration  code and must be thrown away.  </P> <P> There is nothing wrong with the product. Most dairy products are good for four  to five days if kept refrigerated. The problem is that there is no mechanism  for the hungry or malnourished to gain access to these items before I throw  them in the dumpster.  </P> <P> The problem is that every grocery store throws away food while people are  hungry. The solutions are easily worked out, if we simply would possess the  interest to do something about it.  </P> <P> JOHN C. HATT  </P> <P> Alta Loma  </P></p>

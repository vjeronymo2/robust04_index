Zhao Zhongling, director of the Bureau of Tibet Livestock  Farming, said that last year, meat output in the sector reached  100 million kilograms and dairy products, 185 million kilograms,  respectively increasing by 6.77 and 5.38 percent over 1980.    He said that wool output reached a record 8.9 million  kilograms.    As one of the five major livestock producing regions in  China, Tibet has 22.8 million head of cattle including yaks and  sheep.    There are about 82 million hectares of grassland in Tibet  with about 52 million hectares of grassland available for cattle.    He said that since Tibet popularized scientific methods of  breeding and raising among the herdsmen, its livestock farming  has enhanced its anti-calamity capacity.    He noted that now, after big calamities, the survival rate  of  newborn cattle is kept at more than 80 percent.    Last year, the region set up 366,000 hectares of fenced  grazing land and more than 20,000 hectares of man-made grassland.    The Bureau of Tibet Livestock Farming has trained about  10,000 technicians at county, township and village levels each  year in application of grassland transformation and protection  and refined cattle breeding.</p>

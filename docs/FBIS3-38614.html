			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto by </F> Emilie Harantova in Prague on 1 February: "According to Heikki  Haavisto, Finland Is Not Afraid of Russia" -- first paragraph is  MLADA FRONTA DNES introduction]    [Text] Following the disintegration of the USSR, the  position of Finland is similar to ours. The market -- to which  one-fifth of Finnish exports used to go -- no longer exists, and  the security guarantees provided by the neutrality forced onto  the Finns -- and guaranteed -- by the Soviets has expired. In  the words of Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, who  granted an interview to MLADA FRONTA DNES, however, as opposed  to the central European countries, Finland is not afraid of its  large neighbor and is interested neither in joining NATO nor in  an active part in a future defense structure of the European  Union [EU] (it does want to join the EU itself). It only wants  to join as an observer.    [Harantova] Do you believe that observer status would do for  your security needs?    [Haavisto] Yes. We feel completely safe, and want only to  be included in the joint structures with other European states  also in the security sphere.    [Harantova] Do you have any specific reason for this?    [Haavisto] We do not feel the need to contemplate new  security structures and defense solutions. We have decided to  be impartial and our own military defense.    [Harantova] Do you want to reinforce your Army like Sweden,  for instance, which is afraid of Russia?    [Haavisto] No. I believe that our Army is quite good, and  we maintain very normal and very good relations with Russia.    [Harantova] Like with any other state?    [Haavisto] Yes, very normal and very good relations.    [Harantova] So, you are not afraid of Russia?    [Haavisto] I believe that the developments there are moving  in a democratic direction.    [Harantova] Even after the latest changes in the government,  when it seems that the reform route will be abandoned?    [Haavisto] We are not afraid of the current development. We  do not expect the new parliament to alter fundamentally the  foreign policy, and there is also the president, who has  extensive powers.    [Harantova] What if there no longer is President Yeltsin  but, let us say, President Zhirinovskiy?    [Haavisto] I believe that they will know how to choose  another wise president. Furthermore, aggressive persons of  Zhirinovskiy's type appear now and then in every country.    [Harantova] Your special relations with the USSR enriched  the international glossary by the term Finlandization. Does the  term still have a real basis today?    [Haavisto] No. And the term itself has always been rather  dumb. I believe that if a country has very good relations with  its neighbor, it always is a positive phenomenon.    [Harantova] Would Russia mind if you wanted to join NATO?    [Haavisto] There is no need to discuss this because we do  not want to join NATO.    [Harantova] Does Finland want to join at least Partnership  for Peace?    [Haavisto] I believe that Partnership for Peace is meant  particularly for the central European countries, which do not  have such a great feeling of security, and not for a neutral  country like Finland.    [Harantova] What were the major problems for Finland in the  talks concerning the entry into the EU?    [Haavisto] I believe that it is ridden with problems if the  country involved is an agrarian one, because the rules applied  to this area have been conceived for the central European  region. The countries there have summer two to three months  longer, and the temperatures are twice as high as in our  country. Therefore, we have asked for special adjustments that  would guarantee the equal position of our farmers. We should  join the EU at the beginning of 1995. I believe, however, that  this term cannot be kept.    [Harantova] What is the major benefit you expect from your  entry?    [Haavisto] The most important is that we will remain  together with the other European states and will partake in the  joint building of the European economy so that the continent can  compete with the southern and eastern Asia.</p>

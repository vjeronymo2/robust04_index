			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KILIM RUGS DATED BACK TO STONE AGE  </P> <P> Turkey's Anatolian kilim rugs, once used as export wrapping for more valuable  pile carpets, have soared in value as they have become prized by collectors.  </P> <P> Now new research says they date back to the Stone Age.  </P> <P> "We have found evidence in Turkey of the oldest woven textiles yet found in the  world, and there is a direct line of descent to kilims still being woven  today," British archeologist James Mellaart said.  </P> <P> Historians say women weavers in many Turkish villages have for 9,000 years  preserved patterns that may shed new light on the region's forgotten social and  religious past.  </P> <P> Mellaart and two colleagues, Turkish kilim expert Belkis Balpinar and West  German photographer Udo Hirsch, are to publish later this year a study  comparing archeological remains with present-day kilims.  </P> <P> "I think it's very exciting. It's a very respectable theory and I'm dying to  see the book," said Alan Marcuson, editor of Hali, an authoritative Oriental  carpet trade magazine.  </P> <P> Mellaart said he first made the link in 1961 when excavation of a late Stone  Age site at Catalhuyuk, east of Ankara, produced evidence of geometric patterns  and textile wall hangings.  </P> <P> "My Turkish colleagues immediately said, 'Those are kilims,' " Mellaart said.  "But nobody then knew what kilims were, so we had nothing scientific to go on."  </P> <P> Until about 10 years ago, the flat-weave wool rugs were still being ignored by  carpet collectors.  </P> <P> They were highly prized in the Turkish villages but were known to the outside  world only when they were used as wrappings for the more valuable pile carpets.  </P> <P> Since then their low price compared with pile carpets has sparked the interest  of collectors, and there has been a flood of catalogues, exhibitions and even  conferences.  </P> <P> Gaudy tourist kilims now sell as fast as knotted pile carpets in the Istanbul  bazaar and decorate homes worldwide.  </P> <P> Serious collectors have made old kilims an investment, and one group now bids  up to $100,000 apiece for fragments hundreds of years old still being found in  Turkish mosques.  </P> <P> Balpinar, who in 20 years as a former curator and official Turkish collector  has seen innumerable examples, said the dating of old pieces was unreliable  because patterns did not change.  </P> <P> "But I can sometimes tell the place of origin down to a single village or  tribe, because the pattern is handed down from mother to daughter, probably for  thousands of years," she said.  </P> <P> Some skeptics see the theory as farfetched, including a claim that the niche  pattern now used for Moslem prayer rugs in fact derives from religious forms  far older than Islam.  </P> <P> But Balpinar cites a total of 14 kinds of kilim motifs woven today that she  believes can be traced back to ancient cults in Anatolia, the rectangle of Asia  Minor that is now Turkey.  </P> <P> The most striking of these is the Mother Goddess represented in dozens of  examples of Stone Age figurines in museums all over Turkey as fat and pregnant,  with overflowing breasts.  </P> <P> This fertility goddess is also now the most common kilim pattern, called  elibelinde by weaver women and reproduced in scores of stylized combinations of  head or body with hands on hips or under the breasts.  </P> <P> "In one village, they still sacrifice a sheep before weaving an elibelinde  kilim," Balpinar said. "They say, 'If we don't please the god, we will be  punished.' "  </P> <P> Balpinar said traditional kilims were woven in at least half of Turkey's 35,000  villages, showing a strong thread of continuity from prehistoric times.  </P> <P> The theory challenges Turkish lore that Turkey was first populated by nomads  who arrived from Central Asia from the 11th Century onward.  </P> <P> Hali magazine's Marcuson and Jaqueline Bing of the Islamic section of London's  Sotheby's auction house told Reuters that the Mellart-Balpinar theory was  accepted in outline among carpet specialists.  </P> <P> "Anatolia was not empty before the arrival of the Turks," Mellaart said.  </P></p>

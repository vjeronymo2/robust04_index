			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Intermediary set up to borrow for housing providers THE MARKET in finance for UK housing associations was widened yesterday with the creation of the first capitalised intermediary to borrow on their behalf from UK institutions. Finance for Homes, which has eight member-associations, successfully placed Pounds 100m of 10 1/8 per cent debenture stock due 2018 at a yield 160 basis points over UK government bonds. Five per cent of the proceeds will be retained in FFH and invested in gilt-edged stock. The rest will be distributed among the eight member-associations, secured on the broad spread of their rented housing, valued on a tenanted investment basis. Despite the extra security offered by the structure, the bonds did not command a premium over earlier issues by housing association intermediaries. A Pounds 51.5m issue from The Housing Finance Corporation, launched last year, was trading at a yield spread of 157 basis points yesterday, having advanced since its launch spread of 182 basis points. 'The question for the housing association movement now is what advantage has this sort of structure given them?' said one banker close to the transaction. He added that it was difficult to break the existing market consensus on the premium housing associations should pay for finance, since only around 10 insurance companies and pension funds are big investors in such issues and effectively determine the yields offered. The issue had attracted at least five institutions which had not previously invested in housing associations, according to Mr Adrian Bell, executive director of Hambros Bank, which led the issue. However, at least one of the UK's biggest insurance companies said yesterday that it had yet to take part in any housing association transaction. 'Some areas of the documentation, such as income definition, could do with tightening,' said an executive. 'The loan documentations that have come to the market have not been sufficiently rigorous.' If one borrower is unable to service the loan, FFH will use the 5 per cent reserve to service the debt. This would be sufficient to service the debt of the largest borrower for over two years - long enough, according to Hambros, which led the issue, for cash-flow problems to be sorted out. Non-defaulting borrowers would have to restore the reserve, so that members are on risk to each other for the first 5 per cent of their borrowing.</p>

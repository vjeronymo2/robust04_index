			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 23 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Agriculture  Secretary Mike Espy said Monday [23 May] that Washington should  renew the most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status to China.    Espy said his visit to China last October made him aware  that  "China represents a very important market for U.S. agricultural  commodities, an important market that will be increasingly  important in the next decade."    "If somehow we would rescind MFN to China, other nations  against whom we compete would just come in and fill the vacuum,"  he noted. He has made these concerns very clear to the White  House, he added.    Another cabinet member of the Clinton administration, Ronald  Brown, secretary of commerce, indicated today that from the  perspective of the Commerce Department, the answer to what the  U.S. should do on the issue of China's MFN "is increasingly  clear."    "We know that China is growing at about 13 percent a year or  more. We know that China is going to spend probably 600 billion  U.S. dollars in infrastructure projects between now and the year  2000. I very much want American business and industry, small  and large, to participate in the economic benefits of that  growth in China," he said.    President Clinton is required to make up his mind whether to  extend China's MFN with no conditions attached by June 3. It is  "a difficult decision to make," Brown observed.</p>

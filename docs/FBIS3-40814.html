Narasimha Rao, today assured the country that the Government  would take action "where called for" in the light of the  recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on  the securities scam, as earlier promised in the Lok Sabha by "my  Finance Minister," Dr. Manmohan Singh, but not before the main  Opposition parties had staged a walkout in both Houses of  Parliament.    The action would be based on a detailed examination of the  report, Mr. Rao said speaking briefly in the Lok Sabha after Dr.  Singh ended a 45-minute thought-provoking reply to the two-day  special debate on the JPC report, in which he said the  Government would come to Parliament with a blueprint of action  within three months. The Opposition followed a similar pattern  in the Rayja Sabha.    It was a pity that the entire Opposition, barring the AIADMK  (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and the Muslim  League, had walked out in protest against the Government's  decision to let the Finance Minister, rather than the Prime  Minister, reply to the debate.    It was sad to see Dr. Singh reply to a half-empty chamber.  In  a sense the debate had centred on him, and he had been praised  by all Opposition for owning moral responsibility and offering  his resignation.    While the discussion was running perfectly smoothly, not  long  before the reply was due, the Opposition leaders -- including  Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Mr. Sharad Yadav, Mr. Somnath  Chatterjee, Mr. Indrajit Gupta and Mr. Chandra Shekhar -- set up  a clamour that they would accept a reply to the debate only from  the Prime Minister.    They urged the Speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil, and the  Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, not to be  "bound down by rules," according to which, any Minister can  answer for the whole Government in a special discussion under  rule 193, and in this case, as Mr. Patil noted, the "nodal"  Ministry was, indeed, Finance.    The Opposition argued that the special status of the  occasion  demanded that the Prime Minister himself reply, as a large  number of Government Ministries and departments were scrutinised  by the JPC (Joint Parliamentary Committee). Moreover, they said  it would not be proper for a Minister who was believed to have  tendered his resignation, to reply to the debate.    The Finance Minister noted at the beginning of his reply  that  he was speaking in his capacity as the Finance Minister. He said  the JPC had made a deep study of the problem, and that he  accepted full "constitutional responsibility" for the scam, even  though the process had commenced some five years before he  became the Finance Minister. He also said he was answerable to  Parliament, the Prime Minister, and the people and would accept  any "punishment" Parliament desired to hand down to him.    However, the Finance Minister observed that he differed with  the appreciation of the JPC that the Finance Ministry or he  himself had failed to anticipate the sensational scam, had  lacked in "purposeful response" once it broke, failed to manage  it adequately, or apply correctives with despatch and punish the  guilty.    Citing detail after detail, he said he had begun the  clean-up  and the investigation through various instructions and setting  up of high-powered bodies within a month of becoming the Finance  Minister, though he had to immediately plunge into the  budget-making exercise, and devise strategies "with the  blessings of the Prime Minister" to manage the country's very  precarious finances, as India was being virtually written off  worldwide as a country gone bankrupt.    The ruling party in the Rayja Sabha launched a direct attack  on the JPC report in the face of vociferous demand from the  Opposition for the resignation of all the Ministers against whom  adverse comments have been made in the Committee report.    Barring the melodrama towards the end that centred around  the  remarks made by Mr. Ram Jethmalani (JD) (Janata Dal) on the CBI  (Central Bureau of Investigation) and the Prime Minister which  led to adjournment of the House and walkout by the Opposition  demanding reply from the Prime Minister, proceedings in the  Upper House were lack-lustre. The Left members who stayed in the  House kept shouting, even as Dr. Singh rounded-off the debate in  a brief speech which could not be heard in the din.    What began as a veiled criticism of the contents of the  report by the Power Minister, Mr. N.K.P. Salve, during the day  became a full-fledged attack by his party colleague, Mr. R.K.  Dhawan, who spoke towards the far-end and accused the committee  of having shown "total lack of respect for rules and  regulations."    The Opposition members on their part while reiterating their  demand for the head of all the Ministers indicted by the  committee, took serious exception to the description of the JPC  report by the Congress(I) members and Ministers. Mr. Salve was  repeatedly interrupted by the Opposition, when he sought to  convey his "distress and dislike" over the debate and maintained  that the committee report was not entirely "impartial."    The Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Sikandar Bakht, and Mr. S.  Jaipal Reddy (JD) were on their legs immediately after Mr. Salve  took the position that the debate was devoid of merit and  objectivity and wanted to know if he was speaking in his  capacity as a member or a Minister. If it was the later what he  said amounted to virtual denigration of the committee report.    Undeterred by the interruptions, Mr. Salve dealt at length  on  what he termed as informities in the contents of the committee  report and the constitutional position on issues like collective  responsibility and sustainability of the comments in the report  against the Finance Minister and his Ministry, Mr. N. Giri  Prasad (CPI) (Communist Party of India) contended that argument  of systemic failure cannot hold water, as no system worked  without individuals who were responsible for its functioning.    In his intervention, the Commerce Minister, Mr. Pranab  Mukherjee, asserted that there was no constitutional obligation  for Ministers on the basis of reports of parliamentary  committees and sought to make a distinction between the outcome  of a commission of inquiry and the parliamentary committee. He  argued that Mr. K.D. Malaviya and Mr. T.T. Krishnamachary had  resigned following indictment by a commission of inquiry by a  sitting Supreme Court judge.</p>

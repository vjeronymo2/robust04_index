			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taiyuan, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Rich in coal and  other energy resources, north China's Shanxi Province is also a  leader in the fast-growing non-metallic minerals world.    The province plans to invest more than six billion yuan in  development of non-metallic minerals with 54 exploration  projects.    The province's verified reserves of refractory clay amount  to  537 million tons, about 26 percent of the country's total. Its  annual clay output reaches over one million tons.    Other major non-metallic minerals include alumina, zeolite,  rutile, pearlite, potassium, lime and plaster stones, ranking  first in the country both in such reserves and their quality.    The increasing exploration for non-metallic menerals is  attributed to the country's fast-growing construction and  industrial demands and the minerals' high economic returns.    Analysts here say that the costs of exploration for and use  of non-metals are very low and the prices commanded by non-metal  products can be ten times, or even a hundred times those for raw  metallic ores.    In addition, they have a wide use in many industrial  sectors,  including metallurgy, chemistry, light industry, construction  materials, agriculture and environmental protection.    Yangquan, known as a coal city in the eastern border area of  Shanxi, produces refractory materials which have been sold to  many countries in East Asia and the Western world, as well as to  most of China's domestic iron and steel companies.    The city's annual output value for refractory materials has  been over 200 million yuan over the past few years.    It also plans to build a new center with a production  capacity of one million tons of refractory materials yearly and  another for high-quality production of half a million tons of  such materials.    The province also has an ample storage of construction  materials such as red and black granites, which have for some  time enjoyed a good reputation on the world market.    For this reason, five big rock materials processing  companies  will be built in Lingqiu, Hunyuan, Jiangxian and Wutai counties,  and Xinzhou City, with a total output of 200,000 cubic meters of  rock materials and 1.45 million square meters of rock plates  each year.    The richness of the non-metallic resources also promotes the  province's chemical and porcelain industries. The provincial  government has decided to rebuild a chemical plant to bring out  a series of expanding clay products which have a wide use in  casting, textiles, cleaning, and the national defense industry.    In the porcelain sector, the production targeted for this  year is a total of 61.75 articles for everyday use and 1.4  million square meters of decorative porcelain.    Figures show that out of 115 kinds of ore reserves that have  been discovered in the province, 64 are non-metallic, accounting  for 55.6 percent of the total.    Analysts here attribute the province's wealth of nonmetals  to  the constant changes in its special geologic structures formed  in different periods.    About 45 non-metal materials have been explored and widely  used in many fields. The non-metals sector has now become a  mainstay industry of the province.</p>

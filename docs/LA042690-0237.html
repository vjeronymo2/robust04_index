			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LITHUANIA WILL BEGIN TO RATION FOOD  </P> <P> Lithuanian lawmakers decided today to impose food rationing May 1 as the  rebellious republic continued to struggle under an economic blockade that has  reduced its supplies of fuel and medicine.  </P> <P> Lithuania widened efforts to circumvent sanctions imposed last week by Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who wants Lithuania to rescind laws designed to  implement its March 11 declaration of independence.  </P> <P> A Lithuanian delegation was due in the northern Russian city of Leningrad on  Friday to talk with local officials about a direct exchange of goods either for  hard currency or barter, a Leningrad journalist said.  </P> <P> In addition, Estonia today ordered its railways to defy the Soviet blockade,  and Latvia ended gasoline sales for private cars.  </P> <P> Estonia, itself moving step by step toward independence, said it will deliver  all goods ordered by neighboring Lithuania.  </P> <P> Juhan Hindov, spokesman for the Estonian prime minister, said the republic's  railways have been instructed to disregard orders from the central ministry in  Moscow to halt deliveries.  </P> <P> "Estonia continues to send goods to Lithuania, and as far as I know all  shipments are moving normally," he said by telephone from the Estonian capital,  Tallinn.  </P> <P> The move was in direct defiance of a Kremlin bid to strangle the Lithuanian  economy with a blockade steadily expanded from fuel to include parts vital to  factories, cloth and imported industrial materials.  </P> <P> Lithuania's prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, announced Wednesday that  Lithuania had halted its usual supplies of meat, milk and other food products  to the rest of the Soviet Union. She instead urged Lithuania to settle its  accounts with the republics "almost in marketplace conditions" of bartering for  other goods.  </P></p>

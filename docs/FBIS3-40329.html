Law No. 32/1991 was published in  MONITORUL OFICIAL Part I, No. 70 of 3 April 1991)  <H5>  Article 1 </H5>   Income from salaries and other salary-related rights, earned  by Romanian or foreign persons or legal entities in Romania, are  subject to the provisions of the present law.    Considered as salaries earned in Romania are salaries paid  in  money and in kind, received by employees from persons or legal  entities who reside or are headquartered in Romania, as well as  salaries received from abroad by persons who conduct their  activities in Romania.    Not subject to the provisions of Para. 1 and 2 are salaries  and compensations in foreign currency, established as net  amounts, paid by Romanian public institutions to Romanian  personnel conducting their activities in diplomatic missions,  consular offices, and other forms of Romanian representation  abroad.  <H5>  Article 2 </H5>   Salary income and other taxable salary-related rights  include  all payments received during a month, independently of the  period they cover, and which are obtained from:    a) Salaries of any sort;    b) Raises of any sort;    c) Compensations of any sort;    d) Profit sharing incentives, rewards, and bonuses of any  sort;    e) Social security payments in case of temporary work  disability and maternity;    f) Rest leave periods;    g) Any other earnings in money or in kind received in  payment  for work, from employing persons or legal entities, including  those obtained on the basis of collective work contracts, with  the exception of those in kind paid to hired household help;    h) Payments to employees in the form of indexing or  compensation for price and rate increases;    i) Payments to founding members of commercial companies  formed with public shares, as apportionment of net profits, in  accordance with Art. 30 of Law No. 31/1990.    Products tendered as payment in kind are evaluated at their  sale price per unit for products produced in-house and at their  purchase price for other products, and in the case of services,  at the rate charged for those services. Prices and rates are  those in effect at the time of the payments in kind.  <H5>  Article 3 </H5>   By derogation from the provisions of the previous article,  salaries and other salary-related rights or discrepancies from  those paid in the past on the basis of final court judgements,  on direct initiative of the employing persons or legal entities,  or as a result of procedures stipulated in Art. 13 of the  present law, are deferred from the tax for the months to which  they apply, and are cumulated with the rights received during  the respective months.    The provisions of Para. 1 also apply to salary differentials  for periods previous to the months in which they are paid on the  basis of salary regulations, as well to vacation compensation  when the duration of the latter is greater than a calendar  month, and to payments made on the basis of the provisions of  Art. 2, letter (i).  <H5>  Article 4 </H5>   Under the conditions of the present law, the following  personal monetary rights are taxed:    a) Earnings of daily or temporary employees;    b) Fees received by lawyers through their bar association;    c) Payments received by doctors and health personnel in  paying clinics;    d) Payments received through collaborations of any sort;    e) Fees received for consultations of any sort;    f) Monetary payments for inventions and innovations.

If the payments cover a period shorter than one  year, they are tax deferred over the months which they cover.  These rights are not cumulative for taxation with other income  from units in which employees serve their basic function.  <H5>  Article 5 </H5>   Not included in taxable monthly incomes and not taxed are:    a) Payments based on work contracts, on statutes and legal  provisions, as a result of shifts or transfers of employees to  other locations in the interest of their job, payments covering  moving expenses in the interest of the job, as well as  compensation attendant to new hires;

   f) Military personnel in service, military pupils and  students, for the monetary rights they receive.  <H5>  Article 7 </H5>   Income taxes are calculated monthly, at each work site, on  the total income received during the past month by each  employee, on the basis of the following rates:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Taxable Monthly Income                |Monthly Tax                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Up to 2,700                           |5%                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2,701 -- 3,000                        |135 + 8% over 2,700                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3,001 -- 4,000                        |159 + 14% over 3,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |4,001 -- 6,800                        |299 + 17% over 4,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |6,801 -- 11,000                       |775 + 18% over 6,800                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |11,001 -- 16,400                      |1,531 + 19% over 11,800               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |16,401 -- 27,700                      |2,557 + 20% over 16,400               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |27,701 -- 38,600                      |4,817 + 21% over 27,700               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |38,601 -- 54,900                      |7,106 + 22% over 38,600               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |54,901 -- 82,400                      |10,692 + 25% over 54,900              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |82,401 -- 110,000                     |17,567 + 28% over 82,400              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |110,001 -- 137,500                    |25,295 + 32% over 110,000             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |137,501 -- 157,400                    |34,095 + 36% over 137,500             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |over 157,400                          |41,259 + 40% over 157,400             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The portion of the total taxable monthly income that exceeds  300,000 lei is taxed at the rate of 60 percent.    When these tax rates reduce the net monthly income of an  employee at the unit where he serves his basic function to under  7,600 lei, the tax is reduced so as to ensure this amount of  income. Income in the form of salaries and other salary-related  rights received by employees for work performed outside of their  basic functions and outside the units which hold their work  cards is taxed separately at each work site at the rate  stipulated in Para. 1 of this article, with the tax increasing  by 30 percent.    In the case of salaries and other salary-related rights in  foreign currency, the tax is calculated by an exchange to lei at  the exchange rate valid on the last day of the month in which  the payment is made, after which the tax in lei established on  the basis of the rates in Para. 1 is converted, withheld, and  deposited in the budget, in foreign currency, at the same  exchange rate.    Together with indexing, as well as for salary compensation  allowances, the government will appropriately modify the taxable  monthly income categories stipulated in Para. 1, the amounts  established by Para. 2 and 3 of the present article, as well as  the amount indicated in Art. 6, letter (c) of the present law,  so as not to annul the effect of the indexing or compensation.  <H5>  Article 8 </H5>   The income tax is calculated by payers and is withheld  monthly from the amounts due on the second 15-day period of the  month.    For the monetary rights stipulated by Art. 4 of the present  law, taxes are calculated and withheld at each payment, by  cumulating the amounts paid previously during the same month by  the same payer.    If the payer has a bank account, the income tax is withheld  and disbursed together with the collection of the amounts to be  paid for the second half of the month.    When the amounts for payment of salaries in Rumania or to or  from abroad are collected, banks must verify the withholding and  disbursement of the income tax to the budget of the central  public administration.  <H5>  Article 9 </H5>   Excess income tax is returned to employees by the payer  within 30 days of the date when the overpayment is discovered.    Reimbursement of the amounts withheld in excess, can be made  for a period of three years following the date they were  withheld.    Income tax not withheld in time or in legal amounts is  withheld by the payer of the income from the respective  employees for a period of three years following the date of  discovery. Withholding can be carried out in equal installments  over a maximum of 12 months from the time of discovery of the  failure to withhold.    If the income tax can no longer be recovered from the  respective employee, it is paid by the payer of the salary.  <H5>  Article 10 </H5>   Persons or legal entities who have employees as part of  their  activities must file every six months, with the financial agency  within whose jurisdiction they reside or are headquartered, a  report of the calculation, withholding, and disbursement of  income tax to the budget of the central public administration.  Specialized economic entities, defined according to law, will  file this report with the Ministry of Finance.  <H5>  Article 11 </H5>   An increase of 0.3 percent for each day of delay is charged  for failure to disburse income tax on time (see Government  Ordinance No. 14 of 17 August 1992, published in MONITORUL  OFICIAL, Part I, No. 209 of 26 August 92, whose provisions  became effective on 1 September 1992).  <H5>  Article 12 </H5>   Audits of the calculation, withholding, and disbursement of  income tax are conducted by the fiscal agencies with whom the  salary payers must file reports one the calculation,  withholding, and disbursement of income tax.  <H5>  Article 13 </H5>   Within 30 days from the date of income tax withholding,  employees can file complaints with the persons or legal entities  that employ them, against the manner in which the provisions of  the present law are implemented by these persons or entities.  Within 30 days from the date of the filing of the complaint, the  person or legal entity acting as employer must recheck the  manner in which the taxable monthly income is determined, and in  which the tax is paid, and must issue a decision that will  include the results of the reexamination. The decision will be  communicated to the respective employee.  <H5>  Article 14 </H5>   Within 30 days from the date when the decision is  communicated by the employer, the employee can file an appeal  addressed to the general directorate of public finances and  state financial control in whose jurisdiction the person or  legal entity resides or is headquartered, with the directorate  being under obligation to resolve the appeal within 30 days from  the filing of the appeal. The appeal is resolved through a  decision communicated to the respective employee.    Within 30 days from the communication of the decision of the  general directorate of public finances and state financial  control, the employee can file an appeal with the Ministry of  Finance, who must resolve it within 40 days from its filing. The  resolution of the Ministry of Finance is final and is  communicated to the respective employee.  <H5>  Article 15 </H5>   Challenges and appeals regarding income tax are exempt from  the stamp tax.  <H5>  Article 16 </H5>   In soundly justified cases, the Ministry of Finance can  allow  installments or the postponement of income tax payment, and  installments, postponements, reductions, or exemptions of  payment of late penalties.  <H5>  Article 17 </H5>   The following are offenses unless they are considered  infractions according to penal law:    a) Failure to file a report of the calculation, withholding,  and disbursement of income tax within 15 days from the closing  of a six-month period;    b) Refusal to make available to fiscal agencies, documents  regarding the calculation, withholding, and disbursement of  income tax to the state budget.    The offense under letter (a) is fined by 50,000 to 150,000  lei, and the offense under letter (b) by 100,000 to 200,000 lei  (also see Part IV of the Appendix to Government Ordinance No. 23  of 21 August 1992, published in MONITORUL OFICIAL, Part I, No.  213, of 28 August 1992).    The findings of offenses and the fines imposed by the  present  law are implemented by specialized agencies and their  territorial units in the Ministry of Finance, within three years  from the date the offenses are committed.    The documents of findings by agencies empowered to  investigate and impose fines, are executory instruments under  the law after they become final.    Banks will execute these instruments without the consent of  the payer.

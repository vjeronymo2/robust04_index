			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Engineering faces decline in orders ORDERS TO engineering companies in the West Midlands, traditionally the heart of UK manufacturing, have slowed again after a brief surge in the spring, dissipating the belief that economic recovery has started. The Engineering Employers Federation in the West Midlands, which surveyed 520 companies, reported yesterday that, in the three months to August, 39 per cent of companies had seen orders decline, compared with 25 per cent in the three months to May. The proportion of companies receiving more orders shrank to 31 per cent in the August quarter from 46 per cent in the May quarter. Mr David Botterill, the federation's regional chief executive, said: 'Similarly, more companies are now experiencing a reduction in the utilisation of their manufacturing capacity than was the case in the spring. More plans for capital investment appear to have been shelved for the time being as cashflows worsen.' Evidence of the retarded recovery from recession has dented business confidence. More than half the companies in the federation's West Midlands May survey had expected an improvement in orders - now the proportion has fallen to 30 per cent.</p>

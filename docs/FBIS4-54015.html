			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "How Will the Tense Political Situation Change in </F> the Future?" column; interview with Akira Yamagishi, chairman of  Rengo (Japanese Trade Union Confederation), by unidentified  ASAHI SHIMBUN correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The opposition Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] appears to be intending to force the Hata cabinet to  dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a general  election by submitting to the Diet a vote of no confidence  against it. What is your opinion?    [Yamagishi] The LDP is asserting that the Hata cabinet  deserves to be voted out of power merely because it is a  minority government, but I believe that the LDP's assertion  lacks persuasive force. The opposition Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ] has to alter its simple logic that "the enemy of  my enemy is my friend."    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some SDPJ members are voicing their support  for holding the next general election under the current  multiseat constituency system. What do you think?    [Yamagishi] If the next general elections are held under the  multiseat constituency system, the SDPJ would win some more  seats in the House of Representatives, but the LDP also would  increase its seats there. The next general election could be  held under the multiseat constituency system depending on how  the political situation develops in the future. I, however,  believe that it is desirable to hold the next general election  under a new electoral system. The SDPJ is now at a loss. If  the SDPJ intends to rally liberal forces, it cannot forge any  alliance with the LDP. If the SDPJ does not take the position  of not allowing the LDP to retake power, it would leave ruling  coalition parties in disarray.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of the SDPJ  returning to the ruling coalition?    [Yamagishi] I believe that it would be difficult for the  SDPJ  to return to the ruling coalition unless a major development  occurs which makes the people understand its return to the  ruling coalition.    I hope that such a "major development" will occur to open  the  way for the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition. The SDPJ's  intention of rallying the liberal forces does not contradict its  return to the ruling coalition. If the SDPJ does everything it  can to rally the liberal forces, this would cause the "major  development" to occur. There is no change in the widely held  impression that the coalition government is shored up by new  conservative forces and liberal forces.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you mean by the major development?  May I interpret the major development as the resignation of  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] representative Ichiro Ozawa?    [Yamagishi] If I comment publicly on that, it would cause  confusion and make it hard for the major development to occur.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Hata government is shaky because it is a  minority government. Do you think that the Hata government can  trigger the major development?    [Yamagishi] Given the values and integrity of Prime Minister  Hata, I cannot rule out that possibility.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of Mr. Ozawa?    [Yamagishi] I do not know him well, but he is currently  making a lot of belligerent comments. He imposes his ideas on  others when he holds a dialogue with them. He is causing human  relationships to worsen.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of the SDPJ  returning to the coalition government?    [Yamagishi] The possibility still exists. If the SDPJ clings  to its own policies, it is doubtful whether it can reach an  agreement on basic policies with Sakigake [Harbinger]. The SDPJ  would be isolated from the rest of the political parties in the  end.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Will it not difficult for the SDPJ to rally  the liberal forces prior to the general election?    [Yamagishi] If the SDPJ fails to rally the liberal forces  prior to the general election, it will face self-destruction.  If only the SDPJ and Sakigake wage a concerted campaign under  the single-seat constituency system, they will be no match for  other political parties. A majority of the liberal forces are  now in the ruling coalition parties, and they are affiliated  with the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], the Japan New Party,  Shinseito, and a splinter group from the LDP. Now is the best  time for the SDPJ to open the way for concluding a policy  agreement with those liberal forces, forging an alliance with  new conservative forces in Shinseito and Komeito, and choosing a  single candidate to run in the next general election. Hokkaido  Governor Takahiro Yokomichi and Sakigake representative  Masayoshi Takemura can take the lead in rallying the liberal  forces. I think that it is desirable to form a liberal  coalition policy study group which transcends party affiliations.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is whispered that DSP Chairman Keigo  Ouchi  will resign as chairman at a party convention scheduled for June.    [Yamagishi] Any decisions to be made at the party convention  will have a great impact on the future of the former ruling  coalition parties, including the SDPJ. I will pay close  attention to the party convention. I hope that the DSP will play  a key role in urging the SDPJ to return to the coalition  government.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] When are you going to give your approval to  raising indirect taxes with "some conditions attached?"    [Yamagishi] In principle, I do not favor raising any taxes,  but I intend to urge the Policy Consultative Council formed by  the SDPJ and the DSP to speedily work out a joint proposal,  thereby deepening their mutual understanding, and to ask the two  parties to present the joint proposal to other parties.</p>

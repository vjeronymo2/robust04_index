			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRINGLE GETS HIS YARDS, THEN SOME  </P> <P> Mike Pringle has goals for himself, but he keeps them to himself. They are the  sort of thing he can think about on Sundays while soaking in a tub, coaxing  away the aches left over from Cal State Fullerton's football games on  Saturdays.  </P> <P> Sometimes he thinks about what he heard from a teammate at practice last week,  and then read in the newspapers and heard on TV. Pringle was leading the nation  in all-purpose running, the statistical category led last season by Barry  Sanders.  </P> <P> Pringle almost wishes he had never heard.  </P> <P> "Now I want to stay there," he said. "Now it's in the back of my mind: Am I  still there? Am I still there?"  </P> <P> This week, he is not. He is second, behind Houston's Chuck Weatherspoon,  formerly of La Habra High School. It still is not a bad place to be for a  5-foot-9, 190-pound running back who once figured he must be jinxed.  </P> <P> During the past two years, Pringle has suffered a season-ending broken jaw at  Washington State, transferred to Glendale College, transferred to Cal State  Fullerton, missed one game and parts of two others with an ankle injury, and  been suspended for two games by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. because  of a transfer eligibility ruling resulting from a Fullerton error.  </P> <P> But Pringle, dogged and resilient when running with the ball, is the same way  off the field.  </P> <P> It looked as if that persistence might have been for naught in the Titans'  first game this season. Pringle was handed the ball 10 times, and he was  stuffed by Northern Illinois on almost every one of them, finishing with 14  yards.  </P> <P> "The 14 yards didn't discourage me," Pringle said. "I know if I get the ball  more than 15 times, I'm gonna get some yards. I'm the type of back that needs  to get the ball a few times just to see the hole and know how to hit it, so I  know next time how to hit it and when to hit it."  </P> <P> What was easy to overlook in that game was that Pringle finished with 169  all-purpose yards, 149 on five kickoff returns and another six on three  catches.  </P> <P> "What I set out to do each week is if I were to get shut down running, to be  able to catch the ball and get yards receiving. Or if not receiving, on  returns," Pringle said. "I look at it like that. If one doesn't work, I want to  make the other work."  </P> <P> Against Cal State Northridge the next week, Fullerton gave him the ball 28  times in a studied attempt to establish a running game. Pringle responded with  164 yards, a career-high, and the first of three consecutive 100-yard games. He  caught a pass for four yards and returned four kickoffs for 95 yards.  </P> <P> Against Colorado State, he had 137 yards rushing and 90 yards on returns.  Against San Diego State, he had 158 yards rushing, 34 receiving and 110 on  returns.  </P> <P> These are the numbers that have given him a 240.3-yard all-purpose average, and  a 118.3-yard rushing average, ninth in the country.  </P> <P> There is one nagging stat: If he could throw out that first game, he would be  leading the nation in rushing with a 153-yard average.  </P> <P> Pringle returned kickoffs last season when he was available, and had good  success. Against West Virginia, he set a Mountaineer Field record with 202  yards in kickoff returns. But he has never returned one for a touchdown. That  is one goal Pringle is willing to discuss.  </P> <P> "I want to break one before I'm through here," he said.  </P> <P> By the end of last season, wary opponents shyed from kicking to Pringle. That  hasn't happened yet this year.  </P> <P> "This year, I'm not gonna say they've been gutsy, but they have confidence in  their kickoff coverage," Pringle said.  </P> <P> That's fine with him.  </P> <P> The receiving has been an addition. The word on Pringle last year was that he  couldn't catch the ball, and Fullerton rarely threw to him.  </P> <P> Pringle claims that was just a misconception on the coaches' part.  </P> <P> "I told them I could always catch in games. I just had trouble catching in  practice," he said.  </P> <P> In any case, he is proving he can catch. Against San Diego State, he had six  receptions, one fewer than he had all last season.  </P> <P> The Titans, much in need of a consistent offensive performer, couldn't be much  more pleased with Pringle.  </P> <P> "The only thing I do as a coach is point Mike Pringle in the right direction,"  said Preston Dennard, who coaches the running backs.  </P> <P> Said Coach Gene Murphy: "He's short and runs close to the ground. You gotta get  up under his pads to stop him. That's tough."  </P> <P> Pringle is not particularly big nor fancy-footed, but he is fast -- he has run  the 40 in 4.37 seconds -- and durable. Fullerton has rushed 115 times, and  Pringle has carried 88. He seems likely to average around 25 carries a game, a  fairly high number for a college player.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it looks like I'm getting banged up out there, but it's nothing  serious," Pringle said. "It looks worse than it is."  </P> <P> It looks pretty good to the Titans.  </P></p>

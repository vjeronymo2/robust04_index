			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Foreign Ministry issued a statement noting  that yesterday at noon, it received a report from the Egyptian  embassy in Khartoum saying that Sudanese security forces had  expropriated three houses owned by Egyptian military attaches.  One was occupied by the assistant air force attache, and the  other two by embassy staff.    According to the report, the Sudanese security forces seized  the residence of the Egyptian chairman of the joint irrigation  authority of the Nile River water, in addition to 30 other  residences owned by the Egyptian Irrigation Authority that were  occupied by large numbers of Egyptian irrigation mission  personnel and their families. The Sudanese security forces  prevented these employees and their families from entering their  homes.    At the same time, the Foreign Ministry statement adds, the  Sudanese security forces expropriated the building of the  Egyptian sports club in Khartoum.    In view of these measures, the Foreign Ministry immediately  summoned the Sudanese charge d'affairs in Cairo to strongly  protest the unacceptable and unjustified conduct which primarily  targets Egyptian individuals and families residing in Sudan.

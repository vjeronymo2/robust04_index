			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Increased efficiency behind CWS rise Co-operative Wholesale Society, the largest co-operative food and non-food retailer and the UK's biggest farmer, yesterday reported an increase in trading profits from Pounds 51.3m to Pounds 58.7m, in spite of a difficult UK trading climate. Total turnover for the year to January 8 declined slightly from Pounds 3.21bn to Pounds 3.11bn, due to the sale of milk businesses and the transfer of some warehouses to retail societies. Mr David Skinner, chief executive, said the retail business, which was now the society's biggest activity, had performed well in spite of intense price competition in the grocery sector. Total retail sales increased 5 per cent to Pounds 1.62bn, although like-for-like sales increased only marginally. But profits increased 36 per cent to Pounds 38.8m. The increase in efficiency resulted largely from the creation of the Co-operative Retail Trading Group, a partnership of several regional co-operatives and CWS Retail. Mr Skinner said many smaller stores were being converted from supermarkets into convenience stores, which was helping them to withstand the growing competition in the grocery market. Many had a strong customer base and were in locations where the large grocery multiples were unlikely to open stores. Total sales in the food manufacturing division were unchanged at Pounds 304m, with an increase in sales to UK multiples offset by a fall in sales to co-operative customers. CWS is in discussion about the possible sale of the food manufacturing group. Profit before interest rose from a restated Pounds 30.8m to Pounds 50.7m, while the interest charge fell by nearly Pounds 4m. Dividend and share interest payments to members went up by 30 per cent to Pounds 7m.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Carolco Pictures on brink of collapse Carolco Pictures, the independent Hollywood film studio which has teetered on the brink of financial collapse for several years in spite of producing box-office hits such as Cliffhanger and Terminator 2, warned yesterday that its immediate survival was in doubt because of severe liquidity problems. The debt-laden studio, which agreed earlier this year to merge with Live Entertainment, the video and music retailer, in an effort to stave off insolvency, said it had been forced to use its current cash balances to fund the continued production of two films - Showgirls and Cut-Throat Island. Carolco said problems in casting and production for the two films would delay the availability of production loans needed to complete the films until later in the fourth quarter. In an attempt to solve the short-term financial crisis and continue with the production of at least one of the films, Carolco said it was negotiating to transfer its rights to Showgirls to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, another troubled Hollywood studio. MGM last year was part of a group of investors which pumped Dollars 112.5m into Carolco to keep it afloat. Carolco said it had negotiated an agreement with RCS Video Services International, an Italian company which is due to buy Carolco debt in December. This would allow the Hollywood studio to borrow against the anticipated proceeds of the sale of that debt, and secured prepayments of various funds from Pioneer of Japan and Le Studio Canal of France related to the licensing and sale of Carolco films. The studio said the proceeds from these agreements should total about Dollars 20m, which would allow it to continue with the production of Cut-Throat Island. However, if the agreements - which are subject to the approval of the various companies' boards - break down, Carolco said it may not be able to continue operating.</p>

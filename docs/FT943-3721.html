			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Walker denies 'bogus' film deals Brent Walker's film division was never involved in bogus transactions, Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of the property and leisure company, said at the Old Bailey yesterday. Beginning his second week in the witness box, Mr Walker strongly denied prosecution allegations that he had helped inflate Brent Walker's profits by illegally removing money from the company and then falsely declaring it as income from sales of film rights. Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, both deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiracy to falsify accounts. Cross-examined by Mr Peter Rook QC, Mr Walker agreed that until 1989, Brent Walker had successively reported increased profits. However, he denied Mr Rook's suggestion that, had the film division's accounts been properly reported, this would have had a 'devastating effect'. 'If I had dropped dead, it would have had a devastating effect,' Mr Walker replied. Mr Rook then suggested that the reason some staff in the film division had never heard of some of the transactions involving Universal Talent Management, a company run by Mr John Quested, the managing director of the film division, was because they were bogus. Mr Walker said the auditors would have spotted bogus transactions. Mr Walker did agree that he had signed documents related to some of the transactions but denied he had detailed knowledge of the deals. He largely relied upon Mr Quested to handle them, he said. The trial continues today.</p>

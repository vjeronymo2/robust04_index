			<p>BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Everything is now set in  three poor counties in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous  Region to improve land and train technical staff with the help  of the World Food Program (WFP).    After an official inspection of the area, which aims to lift  local farmers from poverty and improve the environment, a  committee of experts from the WFP's Beijing office said they  were quite satisfied with the preparation work and ensured the  Chinese side that they could find no reason to delay the project.    As one of China's largest overseas aid projects in the past  few years, the five-year project will involve aid in wheat worth  13 million U.S. dollars from the WFP and 22.86 million yuan  (about 2.5 million U.S. dollars) in investment from China's  central and local governments.    The aid will be used for five major agriculture, forestry  and  water-conservancy projects in the three mountainous counties of  Guyuan, Longde and Pengyan, located in the south of the region.    The project includes the construction of a group of  reservoirs, wells, and technology centers to improve irrigation  and transportation, and train technicians, especially women.    The illiteracy rate in the area is expected to drop from the  existing 36.3 percent to 18.7 percent, provincial officials said.    When the project is completed in five years' time soil  erosion will have been brought under control and water resources  will have been protected, which is expected to double the output  value and rescue 175,000 people from poverty, they said.</p>

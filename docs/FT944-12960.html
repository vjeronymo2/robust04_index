			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: More power to the people - The Pounds 186m payout to shareholders by East Midlands Electricity Shareholders in East Midlands Electricity will be celebrating Christmas early this year, and other electricity company shareholders could be joining them. On Monday, East Midlands announced a special interim dividend of Pounds 186m, or 85p a share. Since the average shareholder owns 200, this will produce a cheque for Pounds 170 some time towards the end of November. Like the share buy-backs that other utilities have announced in recent weeks, East Midlands' sudden generosity was prompted partly by the embarrassingly large amount of cash it has accumulated since privatisation and partly by a fear that Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, might try to get his hands on it when he brings down the Budget next month. For a number of reasons, East Midlands thought the special dividend was a better way of getting this cash to shareholders than buying in shares. According to chairman Nigel Rudd, it is fairer: all the shareholders get the cash, rather than just those who are lucky enough to be at the top of the buy-back queue. It is also better for East Midlands' staff who are saving up to exercise options on shares at a set price: it gives them a bigger profit when they exercise the options. The third reason is that there is greater tax certainty: the Inland Revenue has said that the dividend will be treated like any other, and those who qualify for a tax credit will get it. In the case of a share buy-back, decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. The dividend was only half the story, though. East Midlands also announced it was consolidating its shares on a 22-for-25 basis. This will offset the value by which they might be expected to fall to reflect the amount of cash being taken out of the company. So, at the end of the day, the share price should remain the same. (At the moment they are ex-special dividend and trading well below their earlier price. This will remain the case until November 24 when shareholders are due to approve the transaction). In the long run, though, Rudd says earnings per share should benefit because the company has become more-highly geared because of the pay-out, and its assets will be working harder. Analysts generally welcomed the pay-out and cast around for other possible candidates. The obvious ones are Yorkshire Electricity and Southern Electric, the only two regional electricity companies which have not, so far, passed surplus cash back to their shareholders. Another possible is Eastern, which did its buy-back before the industry regulator introduced new price formulas in August which enabled companies to work out how much surplus cash they would have. The cash hand-outs may have got the stock market excited but they were not popular politically. East Midlands' move brought angry protests from consumer groups which thought the money should go to customers rather than shareholders. Labour's trade and industry spokesman, Jack Cunningham, also called for an inquiry into 'profiteering' and said: 'East Midlands' consumers have been forced to pay 20 per cent more for their electricity since privatisation.'</p>

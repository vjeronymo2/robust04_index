			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 3 (BTA) -- Belgium's Deputy Prime  Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Willy Claes arrived on  an official visit here this afternoon. I would like to  strengthen our bilateral relations but I must take the  opportunity to discuss Bulgaria's contacts with the European  Union as well as the problem of stability and security in  Central Europe, he said upon his arrival.    Diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Belgium were  established in 1879 and were suspended between 1941 and 1947.  The latest visit of a Belgian foreign minister to Bulgaria took  place 10 years ago. In a televised interview last night  Bulgaria's ambassador to Belgium, Ms. Lea Cohen, described the  visit of Mr. Claes as a "revival of active contacts between  Bulgaria and Belgium".    Tomorrow morning Mr. Claes will have talks at the Bulgarian  Foreign Ministry. In the afternoon he will be received by  President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur  Yordanov and acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. On Tuesday  Mr. Claes, who has graduated from a music-school and has  conducted almost all symphony orchesrtas in Belgium, will  conduct the Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra in the National Palace  of Culture.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Transportation Minister Yisra'el Qeysar has stated  that no arms will be allowed aboard the six planes to be used by  the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The head of the  Civil Aviation Administration made it clear that the security  arrangements in the two airstrips in Gaza and Jericho will be  similar to security arrangements in the Rafah and Allenby Bridge  border terminals. The Palestinians will be allowed to use two  helicopters and four light planes, including Yasir 'Arafat's  plane, which will serve him in his flights between Gaza and  Jericho. All the Palestinian aerial activity will be conducted  under the supervision of the Israel Civil Aviation  Administration, and the pilots will have to undergo a special  test by this body.    Minister Qeysar, who toured the Jordan Valley settlements  and  the Bet She'an Valley region today, also said that the  construction of the Jericho bypass road will cost approximately  200 million shekels. Minister Qeysar added that his office has  already prepared detailed plans and maps toward the resumption  of the land and sea link between Israel and Jordan after a peace  agreement is signed between the two countries. He noted that  Israel is interested in supplying Jordan with transport and  commerce services via the ports of Haifa and Ashdod.</p>

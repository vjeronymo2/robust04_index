			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 13 KYODO -- The Tokyo District Court  approved prosecutors' request to detain former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura, now under arrest for alleged bribery,  for 10 days beginning Sunday [13 March], prosecutors said.    Nakamura, 44, was arrested Friday on suspicion of receiving  a  10 million yen bribe from giant contractor Kajima Corp. in  January 1992.    Under the code of criminal procedure, a suspect can be  detained for up to 20 days for interrogation before indictment,  following the initial two to three days of detention after the  arrest.    The money Nakamura allegedly accepted was intended as a  reward for using his influence as a Diet member to help block  the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) from filing an accusation  against a cartel of 66 contractors, including Kajima, over  bid-rigging practices, prosecution sources said.    At the time, Nakamura was the deputy chief of the Special  Committee on Antimonopoly Laws of then governing Liberal  Democratic Party.    Now an independent member of the House of Representatives,  Nakamura has been in custody at the Tokyo detention house since  Friday to undergo interrogation by prosecutors.    His arrest came immediately after the Diet stripped Nakamura  of parliamentary immunity from arrest following prosecutors'  request.    He had refused to comply with prosecutors' questioning over  his bribery suspicion. In Japan, apprehending a Diet member  while in a parliament session needs Diet approval. The Diet is  in a 150-day regular session.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / UK Company News: Loss mounts to Pounds 5.6m at Reed Executive THE CHAIRMAN and execut-ives at Reed Executive agreed to take pay cuts of up to 42 per cent as the employment agency's losses for the nine months to December 29 deepened to Pounds 5.62m. The pre-tax result compared with losses of Pounds 798,000 for the year to March 31 as Reed has changed its year-end. Mr Alec Reed, chairman, said that as part of a cost-cutting programme, executive directors would restrict their emoluments to Pounds 80,000 this year. This represented a 42 per cent decline in his salary and 33 and 20 per cent for two other executive directors. Mr Reed had some encouragement for investors, saying that the group was experiencing a rise in activity which appeared to be slightly stronger than the earlier - and unsustained  - one referred to at the interim stage. 'The danger might be that it is only the honeymoon after the election,' he said. Reed's exposure to the south and south-east of England meant that the recession had taken a heavy toll on volume and margins. Turnover fell to Pounds 63.9m in the nine months, compared with Pounds 119m for the previous year. Margins had declined by about 20 per cent, said Mr Reed. The supply of permanent employees continued to be the hardest hit, with business down about 35 per cent. Temporary placements were about 25 per cent lower, Mr Reed said. During the nine months, Reed closed 10 of its 150 branches. This resulted in an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.2m, while redundancies added a further Pounds 119,000 in above-the-line costs. The loss per share deepened from 1.5p to 8.5p, and there is no dividend.</p>

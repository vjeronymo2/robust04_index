			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Leading Article: How to pluck the geese SUPPOSE THE UK chancellor decides that a further fiscal adjustment, beyond that left behind by Mr Norman Lamont, is indeed required. How should he go about it? How far, in particular, can he rely on cuts in public spending, rather than increased taxation? The answer is that he will be forced to rely on taxation. As the Green Budget from the Institute for Fiscal Studies demonstrates, the government would be doing well even to keep to its announced targets for public spending. This is so for three reasons. First, on the government's forecast of inflation, the real growth of the new control total, which covers supposedly non-cyclical public spending, is set at less than 2 per cent in each of the next four financial years. This is less than the growth of total public spending in the recovery years of the last cycle, even though Mrs Margaret Thatcher was then in charge and the government's majority was much larger. Second, most of the programmes that were easy to cut have already been severely trimmed. Thus 72 per cent of general government expenditure is now accounted for by social security (29 per cent), health (15 per cent), education (12 per cent), defence (9 per cent) and debt interest (7 per cent). Debt interest is bound to rise. Defence spending is already set to fall to just over 3 per cent of GDP by 1995, well below previous levels. Any 'cuts' elsewhere are likely to be absorbed in those self-same programmes. In the case of health, for example, present plans are for increases in real spending of 1 per cent a year. Such a low rate of increase is virtually inconceivable. Manifesto commitments Finally, some important programmes are protected by manifesto commitments: to increase the level of real resources in the National Health Service year by year, for example, and to preserve child benefit. This does not mean that it would be impossible to cut public spending, even drastically. But it would be possible only if the government were to make radical changes in politically sensitive areas. With Mr Major as prime minister and Mr Clarke as chancellor, that will not happen, bar the far from inconceivable onset of an overwhelming fiscal crisis. For the moment at least, adjustment will have to come on the side of taxation. This 'political' chancellor is likely to see the desirability of announcing the bad news now, even if additional taxes are once more to come into effect in future years. He will want to introduce measures that are neither too visible nor too inflationary. He will also want measures that can be presented as part of a desirable fiscal reform (though Mr Lamont's attempt to portray VAT on fuel as an environmental measure was notably unsuccessful). Ideally, the chancellor would in fact have radical reform in mind, though there is little reason to suppose he does. Splashy ways If good performance of the economy were to allow announced tax increases to be 'given back' in subsequent years, the chancellor could always oblige. He would want to do that in splashy ways. What would be most undesirable would be for increases in distorting, but less visible taxes, such as national insurance contributions, once again to be used to finance cuts in less distorting, but more visible taxes, such as income tax. The Green Budget notes many ways of raising revenue. The tax value of personal allowances could, for example, be restricted to the 20 per cent rate, which would raise Pounds 5.7bn; allowances and thresholds could be frozen at current real levels, which would raise Pounds 1bn; mortgage interest relief could be phased out, which would raise Pounds 3bn-Pounds 4bn; advance corporation tax and the tax repayable to tax-exempt shareholders could be reduced from 20 per cent to zero, which would raise Pounds 3bn; and standard rate VAT could be imposed on zero-rated goods (excluding housing), which would raise Pounds 10.7bn (but increase consumer prices by 3.7 per cent), while a 5 per cent VAT would raise Pounds 3.1bn. None of these options would be popular. Some would be both unpopular and retrograde. Restrictions on allowances and thresholds would probably be the least painful and the least damaging. Whatever Mr Clarke does, the geese will hiss. But he has no prudent alternative. They will have to be plucked once again.</p>

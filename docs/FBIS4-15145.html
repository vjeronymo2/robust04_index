			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] According to a report by our  correspondent in Simferopol, Yevgenyy Nurikov, Crimean President  Yuryy Meshkov gave a statement on television on the evening of 6  April addressed to the Republic's citizens. Among other things,  he said:    [Begin Meshkov recording] We have all been notified that by  decree of the president of Ukraine a presidential mission to the  Crimean Republic has been set up in the Crimea. I am unable to  see this step as anything other than a simple political  provocation. [end recording]    [Announcer] Meshkov laid all responsibility for the possible  consequences of this provocation on the highest leadership of  Ukraine. The Crimean president expressed the hope that new  politicians would come to power in Ukraine as a result of future  presidential elections with whom the Crimean leadership would be  able to hold a constructive dialogue. Yuryy Meshkov added that  he did not intend to enter into contact with the Ukrainian  president's representative, Valeryy Gorbatov, who had arrived in  Simferopol.    Our correspondent, Ilya Kapelevich, managed to contact by  telephone Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevgenyy Saburov in  Simferopol:    [Begin recording] [Kapelevich] Please tell us what has  happened and what the situation is now.    [Saburov] Ukraine has broken its own law. It has broken  resolutions by the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea and has  introduced the institution of governor general to the Crimea.  The governor general has said he is going to deal with all of  Crimea's external links, that his functions are political, that  he is going to be the father of the people, and that he has been  called on to lead our dim-witted [malorazumnyy], colonial people  to a bright, communist future under the guidance of, so to  speak, the Ukrainian leadership. The reaction in the Crimea to  this, how should I say, joke of a step is extremely negative.    [Kapelevich] You met Leonid Kravchuk and you thought that it  was quite a positive dialogue. Indeed, Leonid Kravchuk reacted  positively after the personal meeting. Did he not warn you or  notify you at all of his subsequent actions?    [Saburov] The conversation was, of course, quite serious and  profound. Some of our economic proposals were given a positive  reception straightaway, some with caution. On the whole, there  was a lot of fear, I could see, but the conversation was fine.  And then right after this new decree appeared.    [Kapelevich] What do you know about the deployment of five  Ukrainian Navy warships, of an additional contingent of  Ukrainian special forces?    [Saburov] All sorts of rumors are going around and I do not  have any reliable information regarding whether Ukrainian  soldiers have landed or have not landed. I do not know what the  aim was if they did. Maybe just to stretch their legs or  inspect something or other? The fact that they did all this  when President Meshkov was away is probably just another  coincidence -- or maybe it is not. On the whole, this manner of  operating on the sly is quite widespread here, and although  Ukraine is supposedly closer to Europe than Russia, scratch the  surface and it is more like Asia.

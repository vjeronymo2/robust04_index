			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vytautas Zimnickas, chairman of the Lithuanian </F> Seimas Economic Committee: "Key Tasks"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Reform practices in other  countries show that the difficulties Lithuania's population is  facing today are unavoidable during transitional periods.  However, a stabilization of production and the declining living  standards is already noticeable. The government managed to curb  inflation in late 1993 -- the key problem of the developing  crisis.    Therefore, I dare maintain that it is high time to begin the  restoration and restructuring of the Lithuanian economy. It is  very important to strengthen economic entities and orient them  toward production, create dynamic businesses, and an efficient  stratum of owners in this stage.    Currently, important processes are going on in the country's  economy.    The creation of small- and medium-sized enterprises has  gathered momentum, and they will undoubtedly have an important  place in Lithuania's economy. However, it would be incorrect to  think that the chaotic emergence of small and medium-sized  businesses alone will make the country's priority industries  competitive on the world market. Therefore, first of all, the  government must make its choice, one way or another, concerning  the "Program for Industrial Restructuring and Changing  Specialization of Large Enterprises," which the Industry and  Trade Ministry somehow managed to draft. One must immediately  say, however, that this long-awaited program is only a  compilation of theoretical statements. The program lacks a  clear-cut expression. It is restricted to inarticulate  theoretical postulates and propaganda. I suppose that this  program must be promptly specified so as to make clear the  development of which industries and enterprises will attract  foreign investments, and which of them will be subject to  protectionism, if you like. We must decide which strategy to  follow, although the ways of its implementation may run counter  to the interests of separate social groups.    Speaking about other development programs for separate  industries, which are being prepared or which have already been  adopted, it must be noted that all of them are being drafted  idly, as if fearing their execution and, which is even worse,  the responsibility of their ruination. Judging by the  conclusions of the preliminary analysis, one can claim that the  coordination of the aforementioned programs is insufficient and  the resources necessary for their implementation are not  balanced.    I fully agree with the prime minister's idea expressed in a  radio program on 2 March, when he said that ministries must pass  from the direct management of enterprises over to the creation  of conditions for their activities. They must primarily support  exporting enterprises. Finally, programs are necessary for  ministries themselves to understand clearly what and how they  are doing. I would like to mention the "National Program for  the Development of Transportation in the Republic of Lithuania"  adopted by the government as a positive example. Although I  cannot agree with all of its principles, this program at least  clearly outlines the position of the ministry and the government  on this issue. [passage omitted]    Speaking about the recently more heated debates on the tax  system, I must say that Lithuania has accomplished much in  restructuring its legal system. The laws on the incomes of  physical persons, general and individual excise duties, customs  duties, and market-places have been adopted. However, normative  documents on taxes are constantly upgraded and amended, which  evokes rightful reprimands for the lack of stability. The most  prominent example of irresponsible decisions is the law on the  VAT, adopted in late December 1993. Although the law has not  yet come into force, its authors and the government are already  proposing to amend it. Meanwhile, the same remarks were made  when discussing this draft law.    The current key issue in this sphere is the draft law on the  principles of the tax system and the coordination of all tax  laws.    The package of tax laws is closely linked with investment,  which is the essential factor for economic development.  Privileges for duties on imported resources and export products  should be one of the key factors for promoting exports and  foreign investments. The policy of loans, guarantees,  restrictions, tariffs, and, certainly, national currency should  serve this purpose. The current perceptible tendency is to  increase taxes, although the latter must be collected more  efficiently from those who do not pay them at all or conceal  part of their incomes.    The current most important tasks in economic reform are the  following:    -- To immediately conclude the preparation of, correct, and  adopt development and restructuring programs for all industries;  to organize the activities of the Executive Branch strictly in  line with these programs;    -- To set up the State Property Agency; the Seimas  [parliament] has already submitted its draft resolution on this  issue;    -- To discuss the draft law on stock companies in the Seimas  as an emergency issue;    -- To form a socially oriented market (by way of upgrading  the tax system, the law on bankruptcies, and so on);    -- To speed up privatization for investment coupons and  immediately pass over to a qualitatively new stage in  privatization;    -- To act more energetically in attracting foreign  investments; to establish the Foreign Investment Agency and the  banking system to this end;    -- To speed up the creation of the legal basis for taxes and  other related issues; to adopt the law on the principles of the  tax system in the first place;    -- To normalize the economic and financial situation in  industry, regulate inflation, and support social groups that are  its greatest victims;    -- To upgrade the structure of management and seek its  greater efficiency;    -- To make key production competitive on the Western market;    -- To ensure the preservation of people's residential  environment while restructuring industry;    -- To resolve crime problems that are having a negative  effect on economic reform and halting foreign investments;    -- To prepare a program for the provision of resources  (particularly in the energy system) by projecting their  alternative sources;    -- To work out a program for the development of tourism;    -- To create a common Baltic market, remove customs houses  between the Baltic states, and facilitate the movement of labor,  capital, and goods among them.</p>

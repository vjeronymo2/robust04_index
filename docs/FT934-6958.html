			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / European markets slip on rate fears Weakness in securities markets in Japan and the US brought setbacks in share prices throughout Europe yesterday. Disappointing money supply statistics from Germany increased apprehension that global interest rates might be about to turn upwards. In London, the FT-SE 100 Share Index fell 37.4 points to 3,070.6 and analysts began to question whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would be able to deliver the cut in domestic interest rates that has been widely predicted in the Budget. Wall Street opened sharply lower, but recovered to close 23.76 down at 3,670.25. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond rose to 6.38 per cent from 6.33 as signs of a stronger economy brought back fears of inflation. In Germany, the DAX index of leading stocks shed 2.3 per cent, while in France the CAC-4O index tumbled nearly 3 per cent. The markets had earlier been undermined by a 3 per cent fall in Tokyo. Analysts said the German money supply figures indicated there was now less scope for interest rate cuts before the end of the year. They warned of a further share price fall if German inflation data later this week turned out to be disappointing.

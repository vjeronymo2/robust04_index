			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL FEAT GIVES TITANS LAST-SECOND WIN, 62-60  </P> <P> Colorado State had more fans in Titan Gym than did Cal State Fullerton  Saturday, but Titan fans had more fun, storming the court after Joe Small's  acrobatic, 16-foot shot as the game ended beat the Rams, 62-60.  </P> <P> The score was tied, 60-60, with three seconds to play when Small attempted an  off-balance three-point shot that bounced off the front of the rim. Small ran  in, leaped for the ball at the free-throw line, caught it and released a shot  at the top of his jump. The buzzer sounded and the ball went in, igniting a  wild celebration and giving the Titans (7-2) their seventh consecutive victory.  </P> <P> "Just like we diagrammed it," joked Small, who scored 26 points and made six of  nine three-point attempts. "The ref said it counted and that's all I remember.  I got tackled. I was looking for my teammates. I didn't know where they went."  </P> <P> The crowd of 3,729 -- about 2,000 of them Colorado State fans in town for the  Rams' Freedom Bowl football game against Oregon -- must have wondered where  Small went in the second half.  </P> <P> After making a three-point shot with 18 minutes remaining to give Fullerton a  41-35 lead, the Rams (7-3) threw a box-and-one defense at Small and shut him  out for more than 15 minutes.  </P> <P> Behind the shooting of guard Mark Meredith, who scored all 13 of his points in  the second half, Colorado State took a 55-50 lead with 5:55 to play.  </P> <P> After the teams exchanged missed shots and turnovers, Titan forward Agee Ward,  who scored 15 points and grabbed eight rebounds, made a short jumper to make  the score 55-52.  </P> <P> Bruce Bowen then drew a charge on Meredith -- the Ram guard's fifth foul -- and  Small responded with a three-point basket to tie the score, 55-55.  </P> <P> Colorado State forward Chuckie White, the Indiana transfer who made all eight  of his field-goal attempts and scored 19 points, answered with a basket and a  free throw, but Fullerton's J.D. Green came right back with a three-point play  -- a driving basket and free throw -- that tied it at 58-58 with 1:51 to play.  </P> <P> The Titans went ahead on Ward's follow shot with 58 seconds left, but Ram guard  Lynn Tryon tied it with an 18-foot bank shot with 25 seconds to go. Fullerton  then rode Small's last-second heroics to the victory.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Over 2,000 students of 40  universities and colleges in Seoul including Seoul National  University, Yonsei University and Korea University had the  inaugural ceremony of the seventh-term Seoul District Federation  of General Student Councils (Sochongnyon) at Hongik University  on May 4 and staged a demonstration calling for an objection to  treacherous rice market opening and U.S. troops' withdrawal,  according to a radio report from Seoul.    They said that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique yielded to the  U.S. pressure to open market so the lives of 10 million peasants  and even workers are being threatened.    The students charged that the United States continues to  threaten the North with a nuclear war and increase the war  atmosphere on the Korean peninsula. They demanded that  authorities refuse a "ratification of the final act of the  Uruguay Round of world trade talks at the National Assembly,"  object to rice import liberalization and realise the U.S.  troops' pullout and denuclearisation and disarmament and signing  of peace agreement.</p>

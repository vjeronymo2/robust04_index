			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Pyongyang warned Japan on  Thursday [9 June] that it cannot avoid punishment if it joins in  with sanctions against North Korea over the north's continued  refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities.    The North Korean Foreign Ministry, in a statement condemning  Tokyo's "hostile policy" toward pro-Pyongyang Korean residents  in Japan, reiterated that sanctions would be considered a  declaration of war.    The statement was reported by the official KOREAN CENTRAL  NEWS AGENCY in a dispatch monitored in Tokyo.    "If Japan, failing to atone for the never-to-be-condoned  crimes it had committed against the Korean people in the past,  should join force in any sanctions against us, we would regard  it as a declaration of war, and Japan would be unable to evade a  deserving punishment for it," the statement said.    The statement condemned Monday's mistaken police raid on the  offices of the Kyoto chapter of the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun) and a search of Chongryun  offices in Osaka in April.    It charged that Japanese authorities are "taking advantage  of  U.S. attempts to isolate and stifle our republic over the  nuclear issue" in order to suppress Chongryun and Koreans in  Japan.    The statement also said Koreans "can hardly repress  resentment" over the "immeasurable misfortunes and hardships"  inflicted upon korea during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial period  and that Japan "is still suppressing and persecuting Koreans in  Japan."    Kyoto police searched Chongryun offices and its affiliate  school on the mistaken assumption that the group had failed to  submit a report, required under the national land utilization  law, on the intended use of land acquired in 1990 and 1991.    City officials later discovered their oversight and  apologized Tuesday.    In April, Osaka police searched Chongryun offices after a  melee erupted during a demonstration by a rival group of Korean  residents demanding the release of political prisoners in North  Korea.    The protest was disrupted by men thought to be associated  with Chongryun.</p>

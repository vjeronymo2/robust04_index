			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / US growth no threat yet to prices The strong US economic recovery is putting only mild upward pressure on consumer price inflation, official figures indicated yesterday. The Labour Department said the consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent and by 2.5 per cent in the year to February, in line with market expectations. Separate figures showed that the housing industry is beginning to recover after disruptions caused by severe winter storms. Housing starts rose 4.1 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.31m. But figures for January were revised down to show a fall of 22 per cent rather than 17.6 per cent. Bond prices rose modestly in early trading following release of the price report. The core consumer price index  - which excludes the volatile components of food and energy  - also rose 0.3 per cent last month and by 2.8 per cent in the year to February. Earlier this week official figures showed little evidence of inflationary pressures at the wholesale level. The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.5 per cent but this reflected a surge in energy costs. Core producer prices rose 0.1 per cent and by 0.4 per cent on an annual comparison. The consumer price report showed a continuing divergence in inflation trends in goods and service industries. The index for services other than energy rose 0.4 per cent last month and by 3.7 per cent in the year to February. The core index for goods fell 0.1 per cent last month and rose only 0.8 on an annual comparison. The increase in housing starts was restricted to the north-east and south. Starts fell in the midwest and the west. Most analysts expect a stronger rebound in housing activity this month, despite a fall in building permits in February, reflecting the low level of mortgage rates and a rise in consumer confidence in recent months.</p>

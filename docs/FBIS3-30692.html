			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, Feb 5 -- The post-communist Social Democracy  of the Republic of Poland (SDRP), the leading element in the  Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), on Saturday called for urgent  consultations with its government coalition partner the Polish  Peasant Party (PSL), in a move aimed to defuse the crisis caused  by the resignation of Finance Minister Marek Borowski.    Commenting on Saturday's extraordinary session of the SDRP  Supreme Council, SLD parliamentary spokesman Jerzy Szmajdzinski  said that the party saw no reason to allow an escalation of the  conflict, and that the SLD-PSL coalition, which took power to  resolve the most pressing problems facing poland, could resolve  the present dispute. He reported that sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy  (SLD) had held a meeting with prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak on  Saturday morning, and that the prime minister had stressed his  wish to avoid further tensions.    Szmajdzinski said that the SDRP Supreme Council accepted  with  regret the resignation of Marek Borowski, but hoped his  competence and qualifications would be used to full advantage in  the future.    Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of the SDRP and also of the  SLD, said that he hoped a coalition meeting could be arranged  within hours, and said that it would be very bad if the  existence of the coalition were threatened. He stressed that  the SDRP council was firmly convinced borowski was the  best-qualified person to hold the post of finance minister.    Despite the SDRP calls for an urgent coalition meeting, it  seemed unlikely on Saturday evening that a meeting would be held  over the weekend. At PSL headquarters in Warsaw city centre,  there was no- one present on Saturday evening to comment on the  SDRP request.    Kwasniewski also stressed the need for transparency in the  regulation of relations within the coalition, which would not  disintegrate so long as the guide-lines were clear, and as long  as both parties wished for agreement. For our part, that was  our clear intention, he said, adding that the Saturday session  of the SDRP Supreme Council repeated this once again, and that  it was hoped that the PSL would make the same declaration.    However, the SDRP leadership was at pains to stress that,  were the coalition to fall, the result would be political  instability. "We trust that Mr Pawlak and the leadership of the  PSL are aware of all the consequences of a failure to agree,"  commented Szmajdzinski. He recalled once again the need on both  sides to honour the coalition agreement, and noted that most of  the demands which Marek Borowski had put forward as his terms  for remaining as finance minister formed part of that agreement.    Late on Saturday, PAP received a statement from the SDRP  Supreme Council, which appealed to the leadership and the  parliamentary group of the PSL for "a meeting as soon as  possible between the leading elements in the coalition to  examine the clauses of the coalition agreement, and to make such  changes so that it would not be possible to breach its letter or  its spirit."    The SDRP statement concluded: "We unanimously expect the  Government of the Republic of Poland to adopt a document  defining precisely the competences of persons in high office,  the range of their responsibilities, and their obligations  towards their coalition partner."</p>

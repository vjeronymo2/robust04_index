Simmonds  made the appeal ahead of Wednesday's start of a new session of  parliament.    Simmonds went on ZIZ, the state-owned radio and television  system, Monday night to urge restraint in the face of a planned  protest demonstration by the St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party  (SKNLP). Simmonds said his opponents should pursue the  parliamentary process and the courts to settle their grievances.    The Labour Party, like Simmonds' People's Action Movement  (PAM), captured four seats in the November 29 poll but a larger  majority of the popular vote. PAM teamed up with the Nevis  Reformation Party to form a minority government. The Labour  Party has been canvassing support across St. Kitts for a show of  strength on Wednesday. The successful SKNLP candidates say they  will not be taking up their seats in parliament, but would  instead protest the swearing in of the minority government.    The installation of the government led to clashes between  the  police and Labour Party supporters on December 2. Prime Minister  Simmonds said the police had given no permission for a  demonstration on Wednesday and warned: "Those who break the law  will be dealt with appropriately."    Referring to the December disturbance, which hurt the  tourist  industry, Simmonds said: "...We cannot afford or tolerate any  similar disturbances now or in the future. We saw how quickly  our country was set back and how abruptly the cruise ship trade  dried up. Our economy is strong now and we need to keep it that  way, but it can only remain so by the maintenance of law and  order. But the Labour Party has threatened to close down town.    Dr. Assim Martin, one of Labour's successful candidates,  said  the price for freedom and democracy was high "and we are  prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice, not just for ourselves,  but for all the people. We are prepared and ready, just like the  people of South Africa who will get the choice of majority rule  in April," said Martin.</p>

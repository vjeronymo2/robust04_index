			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINNESOTA IS ACCUSED BY NCAA;  </P> <P> ENFORCEMENT: PARCELING OF UNIVERSITY FUNDS TO ATHLETES CALLED MOST SERIOUS  VIOLATION.  </P> <P> University of Minnesota athletes and recruits received cash, loans,  entertainment, money for parking tickets and other benefits in violation of  NCAA rules, according to allegations announced Friday by the NCAA enforcement  staff.  </P> <P> The letter of official inquiry requested responses from the Big Ten school to  21 apparent violations, the most serious stemming from the activities of Luther  Darville, a former university administrator who admitted giving university  funds to athletes.  </P> <P> "This case appears to be major in nature," David Berst, the NCAA's assistant  executive director for enforcement, said in the letter. "It appears reasonable  to expect that the NCAA Committee on Infractions will find violations of NCAA  legislation."  </P> <P> The infractions committee plans to give Minnesota a hearing during its next  meeting Feb. 1-3 at Coronado, Calif.  </P> <P> The letter arrived a day after Philadelphia Daily News columnist Paul Domowitch  reported that the investigation was the impetus for stepped-up efforts by Notre  Dame's Lou Holtz to coach in the NFL. Holtz coached at Minnesota in 1984 and  1985 and was implicated by LeRoy Gardner, a former Minnesota academic adviser,  who said the coach once gave him $500 to give to a player.  </P> <P> Jerry Keeble, a former player, has said he received $500 from Gardner and  another $500 from Holtz's secretary. Holtz denies both accusations.  </P> <P> "In my 22 years of being a head football coach I have never been accused nor  have I been guilty of violating NCAA rules," Holtz said during a news  conference at South Bend, Ind.  </P> <P> "I have always conducted my program both within the letter and the spirit of  the NCAA rules. I'm looking forward to meeting with the NCAA in February, and I  feel confident that they will conclude that I did not intentionally violate  NCAA rules."  </P></p>

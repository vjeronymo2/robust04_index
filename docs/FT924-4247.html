			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Labour dithers THE LABOUR party is dithering about its relationship with the trade unions. So long as it does so it will remain stuck in a swamp of mistrust. This was recognised in the immediate aftermath of the party's fourth election defeat in a row. At that time - barely seven months ago - the party's national executive was committed to one-member-one vote (OMOV) for the selection or deselection of candidates for parliamentary elections. Proposals to reform the system for electing the leader and the deputy leader were in the air. The union share of voting at the annual conference was to be reduced from 90 to 70 per cent. When he campaigned for the post of leader Mr John Smith declared himself in favour of OMOV. Since then Labour has divided itself into two camps. The modernisers understand the argument for a complete severance of formal ties with the unions. They are opposed by nature's conservatives, who appear to be in a majority on the special committee set up to study Labour-union links. So far, most of the union members of the committee have put their weight behind a complicated scheme for 'registering' Labour supporters within trade union ranks. These would then vote as individuals in local constituencies. It seems like a technical device to avoid OMOV. Proposals under discussion do further reduce the bloc vote at conference, but not, alas, to zero. If this sounds like dither, Labour apologists reply that these are early days. Mr Smith only became leader in July and he has yet to assert his authority over the links committee. The government's current troubles have demanded his full attention. He is moving steadily. He has, for example, sagely chosen Sir Gordon Borrie to be chairman of the party's commission on social justice. Sir Gordon, until last June director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, will inquire into the tax and benefits system. This is an opportunity to influence the direction and financing of social security policies for the 21st century, as the Beveridge report has done for the latter half of the 20th. So long as Labour remains in thrall to the trade unions this will not benefit the party. Sir Gordon may produce pearls of the utmost wisdom, but it will not be a Labour government that selects among them for adornment of a government's programme. Social justice may, for example, demand a more targetted system of benefits. Voters will ask themselves 'which target - the poor or the public-sector unions?' There has to be a break as decisive as that between the AFL-CIO and the Democrats in the US. The TUC can always send a cheque. Labour fears that without trade unions to protect it, it might be hijacked by middle-class radicals. There is only one way to avoid that while maintaining a chance of winning general elections. It is to build a new Labour party that merits the support of people acting as individuals, not as the foot-soldiers of the unions.</p>

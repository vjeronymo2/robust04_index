			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / European Court questions Danish tax A DANISH import and production tax on companies was illegal under European Community law, according to the advocate-general of the European Court. In an opinion delivered yesterday in Luxembourg, the advocate-general said the tax conflicted with the EC's sixth value-added tax directive, which forbids new taxes levied on a VAT basis. The tax was introduced in 1987 after the conclusion of a particularly expensive collective wage round. The government scrapped the employers' social security contribution, levied on the basis of the company's wage bill, and introduced in its place a tax levied on the company's total import bill and on value added in production for the domestic market. The tax, which did not apply to export sales, was levied at 2.5 per cent. Import companies brought the case against the government, claiming that the tax was discriminatory and in conflict with the Treaty of Rome. The case was originally taken to a Danish court, which asked the European Court for an opinion. The tax raised DKr9.4bn (Pounds 850m) in 1991 and, over four years, has raised more than DKr30bn, equal to about 40 per cent of last year's revenue from value-added tax. In November last year, the government, in anticipation of the court's verdict, repealed the tax and instead increased the standard value-added tax from 22 to 25 per cent, with effect from January 1 this year. It is thought unlikely the European Court will ask the government to repay the taxes. Trade groups representing Danish companies said yesterday they were considering whether or not they would seek reimbursement through the Danish courts, although it is unclear what sums might be involved since much of the tax was passed on to customers through prices. Mr Henning Dyremose, Danish finance minister, said he still expected that the European Court's final judgment would go in favour of the government, while Mr Thor Pedersen, home affairs minister, said there could be no question of repaying the tax to business claimants. The advocate-general's opinion is usually followed by the European Court.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Chrysler sells Italian sports car marque THE LAMBORGHINI sports car group, an icon of Italy's business heritage, has been sold for an undisclosed price to Indonesian buyers. The deal is the latest in a series of transactions this year to provoke an outcry in Italy. Gucci was one of the better-known names to have passed to new owners abroad. The Lamborghini deal, greeted cautiously by union leaders yesterday, is slightly different. The sports car group, founded in the 1960s by Mr Ferruccio Lamborghini, was already in foreign hands, after having been sold in 1987 to Chrysler of the US for Dollars 25m. The new buyer is Megatech, a Bermuda-based holding company believed to be owned by Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, a son of Indonesia's President Suharto, and Mr Setiawan Djody. Mr Djody already owns 35 per cent of Vector Aeromotive, a Californian sports car maker, with which Lamborghini may now co-operate. Based, like its arch-rival Ferrari, in the the northern Italian engineering region of Emilia Romagna, Lamborghini is best-known for sleek, exotically-named sports cars such as the Miura and the Diablo. The latest deal marks the second disposal of a specialised sports-maker by a mass-market manufacturer in a matter of months. Earlier this year, General Motors sold Lotus, the UK-based car-maker, to Italy's revived Bugatti company. Mr Robert Eaton, Chrysler chairman, said he hoped the sale would 'give the best opportunity for the future to the company and its workers'. Chrysler is expected to continue to collaborate with Lamborghini on various projects. Mr Djody, who controls Indonesia's Setdco group, said the deal would enable 'Lamborghini (to) build prestigious cars which will excite the world'. The resolution of a legal dispute between Chrysler and Mr Lamborghini's son is thought to have opened the way for the deal.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Kozlov report in the "Russia -- Kazakhstan" column: </F> "Alma-Ata Has Not Given Way to Moscow Over the Issue of Dual  Citizenship. But In Two Months the Situation Could Change"]    [Text] The question of dual citizenship, which in the last  few months (especially since Kazakhstan introduced its own  currency) has become one of the most problematic issues in the  dialogue between Moscow and Alma-Ata [Almaty], was also a  central point in the Russian-Kazakh talks that have just ended.  The Russian delegation at the meeting in Alma-Ata was headed by  Abdulakh Mikitayev, chairman of the Commission on Citizenship  under the Russian Federation president. Acting also as Boris  Yeltsin's personal envoy during this visit, he conveyed a  message from him to Nursultan Nazarbayev. Mikitayev also met  with representatives of Russian public organizations from  Alma-Ata and Taldy-Kurgan. Judging by the results of the  talks, the main Russian-Kazakhstan contradictions were not  resolved this time either. Alma-Ata still does not accept the  idea of dual citizenship while Moscow (true, not so decisively  as before) is trying to keep this subject on the agenda of the  negotiations.    "We believe," Abdulakh Mikitayev stressed after the meeting  with Kazakhstan officials, "that this institution will become a  token of trust between states. Therefore the signatories to  this agreement will confirm to their citizens that they will  live in peace and friendship in the future."    The Kazakhstani officials' main argument against dual  citizenship is that it could affect the evolution of the young  state. Alma-Ata also maintains that in this event, more than  half the Kazakhstan population would be placed in a privileged  position compared to the indigenous population. But, according  to Mikitayev, all these problems could be settled through  separate bilateral agreements.    Speaking about the problem of loyalty which could emerge,  according to some experts, the head of the Russian delegation  said that the Russian draft resolution on the issue "contains no  such notion as 'dual loyalty'; at any rate, we do not stipulate  it. Loyalty can be only with respect to the state where a person  resides permanently." Legal grounds for such a formulation of  the question could be provided by Article 4 of the Kazakhstan  Constitution which says in particular: "A person who is a  citizen of the Kazakhstan Republic is not deemed as enjoying the  citizenship of another state with the exception of cases  stipulated under the present Constitution and the state treaties  of the Kazakhstan Republic. All the republic's citizens who  were forced to leave its territory, as well as Kazakhs living in  other states, shall have the right to hold citizenship of the  Kazakhstan Republic along with citizenship of other countries  provided that this does not contradict the legislation of those  states whose citizens they are."    Incidentally, Kazakhstan officials have more than once tried  to give an excessively "liberal" interpretation to this article  which, as international observers have noted repeatedly, has an  ethnic coloring, stressing primarily the formulation: "Citizens  who were forced to leave its territory." The absurdity of such  an approach, renowned Kazakhstani lawyer Vitaliy Voronov noted  at a recent international human rights conference, is belied by  the very practice of local and immigration authorities, whose  arbitrariness had to be curbed by President Nazarbayev himself  with a special edict which defined the limits of kinship to help  overcome ethnic and bureaucratic barriers for reunification with  relatives.    The "expanded" wording again refers only to the ancestors of  "indigenous" representatives of the republic's population who  were forcibly moved, mainly to China after 1917 and after the  well-known famine in 1930-33. However after 1917, as is known,  many representatives of other ethnic groups left Kazakhstan as  well, in particular, Uygurs and Tungans. Also Cossacks.    Yet today everybody in Kazakhstan (even officials)  understand  very well that it is virtually impossible for these immigrants  who "have temporarily left" Kazakhstan territory to come back or  acquire Kazakhstan citizenship (let alone dual citizenship,  under Article 4).    Furthermore, Mikitayev noted, the sides could start  implementing Nazarbayev's idea about creating "a single  citizenship space" even now. As concerns an exodus to Russia,  this process also worries the Russian side greatly. According  to Moscow, in 1988, 23,600 people left Kazakhstan; in 1989,  53,000; in 1990, 306,000; in 1992, 369,000; and in the nine  months of 1993, 247,000.    It needs to be noted that these figures hardly reflect the  true picture of emigration because the Russian embassy in  Alma-Ata registers far from all those leaving.    Nonetheless, Abdulakh Mikitayev was optimistic and assured  that an agreement regulating the question of citizenship will be  concluded within the next two months.</p>

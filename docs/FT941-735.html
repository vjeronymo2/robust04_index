			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Race bias complaints against police rise Allegations of racial discrimination and serious assault against police officers rose sharply last year, but the total of complaints of all kinds fell, the Police Complaints Authority said yesterday. The authority considered 17,991 complaints last year, a fall of 7 per cent on the previous year. It allowed 17 per cent more complaints to be dropped by police forces than in 1992 - 7,075 compared with 6,035. These included allegations lodged for malicious or tactical reasons or where the complainant chose not to co-operate with the inquiry. The remaining 10,916 investigated complaints was 18 per cent down on 1992. Complaints alleging corruption arose from 12 in 1992 to 17 last year.

Overall, forces referred 4,139 cases for possible supervision, 7 per cent down on 1992. The number of complaints of racial discrimination rose from 67 in 1992 to 291. Disciplinary action was taken on 4 per cent of those complaints, compared with 10 per cent of all investigated complaints. Sir Leonard Peach, chairman of the complaints authority, said: 'This substantial rise is due in part to more accurate recording and a greater awareness of the complaints system, but there may be a greater unwillingness to accept racially offensive behaviour.' It was difficult, however, to substantiate the complaints to the required level of proof - beyond reasonable doubt. 'Officers are unlikely to use offensive language within the hearing of independent witnesses,' he said. 'It is frequently difficult to prove a complainant was specifically targeted because of his or her ethnic origin.'</p>

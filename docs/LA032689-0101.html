			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGROUPING IN THE COLD WAR;  </P> <P> BIRCH SOCIETY TO CLOSE WEST COAST OFFICE  </P> <P> In outward appearance, the John Birch Society's West Coast office on Mission  Street in San Marino is not much different from the chiropractic clinic next  door or the legal and financial offices down the street. Except, that is, for a  large world map in the window that shows the battle lines in the Cold War.  </P> <P> There are three categories of nations in the Birch view of the communist  advance: those under communist control, those still free of communist  domination and those in which the communist influence has reached 65% or more,  a group that on the map includes Sweden, Spain, Mexico and large chunks of  Africa and South America.  </P> <P> Conditions may have changed since the map was drawn in 1984, said Jim Toft, who  manages the San Marino office, but the anti-communists' position has not  improved. These days, he complained, "it's chic to be pro-Soviet. We're being  lulled to sleep by glasnost."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strategic Retreat  </P> <P> Indeed, it is the John Birch Society that is in strategic retreat, planning to  close its headquarters in Belmont, Mass., and its West Coast office in San  Marino this summer and consolidate operations in a new office in Appleton, Wis.  </P> <P> John McManus, national public relations director, said the national and  regional staff of 50 will be trimmed to 30. Only three of the eight employees  in San Marino will be moving to Wisconsin.  </P> <P> Not many people come by the San Marino office these days, although dealing with  the public has never been a vital function. A regional office was established  here 25 years ago because office space was available from a member. The office  has been moved twice, both times to buildings owned by members.  </P> <P> Most of the work involves serving chapters in 13 Western states, maintaining  membership rolls and research files, and filling requests for society  publications. A bookstore is maintained in front, Toft said, for the  convenience of local members, although the curious occasionally wander in.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mistaken Impression  </P> <P> Char Gonzalez, a black woman who sits at the receptionist desk, said people are  sometimes shocked to see her there because they are under the mistaken  impression that the John Birch Society is racist.  </P> <P> "Back in the '60s, a lot of articles printed (about the society) in the  newspapers were unfavorable," she said. "I think it was probably a communist  sympathizer doing all the printing . . . they must have paid an awful lot of  money to have this (bad publicity) in the papers."  </P> <P> Books and pamphlets defending Sen. Joseph McCarthy are on display in the  bookstore that occupies the outer lobby. Visitors can also find everything from  McGuffey's Readers to books on homosexual influences on society. The political  books range from the Federalist Papers to "Teddy Bare," subtitled "The Real  Story of Chappaquiddick."  </P> <P> Toft said a number of society members have expressed interest in maintaining a  bookstore after the San Marino office is closed. Otherwise, he said, members  would have to travel to the group's bookstores in Downey or North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Although closure of the office will be a loss to local members, Toft said, it  will improve the organization. "It's the old business axiom of reducing the  overhead and putting it into the product," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Membership Declined  </P> <P> McManus said the Reagan years were tough on the John Birch Society. Although  membership increased last year, he said, it declined during most of the  Administration of President Reagan, apparently because some people felt that a  strong conservative in the White House made the work of the John Birch Society  less important. McManus said the society tried to tell its members that  Reagan's "rhetoric would not be matched by his deeds," but it took a while for  people to see that.  </P> <P> McManus said the society does not disclose membership figures, but he said the  total is in "the tens of thousands." He emphasized that the John Birch Society  is not cutting its services to members or reducing its staff of about 40 field  workers, who organize volunteers and serve chapters across the nation.  </P></p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Middle-size companies go abroad for growth Medium-sized companies have more extensive international operations than is frequently recognised, according to a survey* by accountants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International, writes Charles Batchelor. Forty-nine per cent of middle market companies - typically with sales of up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 58.4m) and most without a stock market listing - had established manufacturing operations abroad while 86 per cent sold abroad. The most common reason for going international was to exploit growth opportunities (cited by 84 per cent), followed by a desire to reduce dependence on the home market (39 per cent), customer demand (34 per cent) and an attempt to reduce costs (24 per cent). 'It is interesting that the cost factor is relatively unimportant compared to the more positive market-oriented factors,' the survey noted, though in high-wage countries such as Germany and in Scandinavia, cost was a more important reason. The common reasons for not establishing foreign operations were that the risks were too high and likely profits too low (23 per cent), or that companies could not find a suitable business partner (16 per cent). Almost 400 companies 'below the level of multinational' in 20 countries were questioned. *Why Companies Go International. Touche Ross, Hill House, 1 Little New Street, London EC4A 3TR.

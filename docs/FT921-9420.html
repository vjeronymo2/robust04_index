			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report Tin ended near six-month highs on the LME, supported by the scarcity of quality metal and tightness of April supplies. Brazil's recent absence as a seller was underlined by the high Dollars 100-a-tonne premium being asked for Mamore brand tin. Straits metal in Rotterdam was also steady, at a Dollars 20 premium. Copper was lower for most of the day in London before gains in New York helped the market to rally. Overall trading was subdued due to a holiday in Japan and this week's industry event in New York. Nymex platinum futures were slightly lower at midday, weighed down by early losses tied to a decline in overseas prices. In Chicago wheat prices were plunging by midday on thin commission house selling. Brisk buying buoyed wheat and oat prices early but a slide in oats sparked swift selling in wheat as well, traders said. 'The market was overdone,' one broker said of Monday's rally which propelled wheat and corn contracts to new highs and lifted oats limit up. New York's arabica coffee futures were modestly ahead at midday. News that Colombian president Gaviria had urged Brazil's president Collor de Mello to support an international coffee agreement had little effect on trading, analysts said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

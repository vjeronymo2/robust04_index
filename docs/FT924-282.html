			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Consensus Earnings figures under the old accounting rules were never much more than a useful ready reckoner. At worst, they were misleading. Companies which stretched the old accounting rules to boost earnings were often priced accordingly. But so long as less scrupulous finance directors retained latitude over what to include in earnings per share, there was a danger that investors could be hoodwinked. They will be protected from that, but that does not mean they will have an easy life. The ASB has placed the onus on investors to make up their own minds, based on the whole - and still complicated - picture. Some consensus on interpreting the new figures would be useful. Since the ASB is adamant that it is not in the business of issuing guidance, institutional investors and analysts could take the lead. Investors may be tempted, for example, to adjust or 'normalise' FRS3 earnings to reach a figure comparable to that reported under the old rules. That might at least offer a consistent basis of valuation during the transition to FRS3. It is easier said than done. The standard places companies under no obligation to disclose the impact of exceptional provisions on tax or minority interests. Simply shuffling aside exceptional items will not take these factors into account. The dissenting view of FRS3 put forward by Mr Roger Bradfield of Cazenove, a member of the ASB, makes just such a point. In theory, the new standard allows the market to go one better and calculate 'maintainable earnings'. It demands that the contribution of acquisitions and discontinued operations is laid bare. But again, arriving at maintainable earnings also entails allocating tax and interest charges between acquisitions, continued and discontinued operations. That is often an arbitrary decision.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: James Beattie falls 31% to Pounds 1.22m at half year SIR ERIC Pountain, chairman of James Beattie, the West Midlands stores group, yesterday reported a 31 per cent fall in profits from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 1.22m pre-tax for the half year ended July 31. He said trading conditions had 'continued to suffer from the measure of uncertainty which has inhibited consumer spending for so long'. On a more confident note, Sir Eric said there were grounds 'for belief that the worst effects of the recession have worked through'. First-half sales, excluding VAT, rose by 5.1 per cent to Pounds 31.9m. The figure included a six months' contribution from the Worcester store against four months last year. Operating profits declined to Pounds 595,000 (Pounds 725,000) while investment income and interest dropped from Pounds 1m to Pounds 626,000. Earnings fell to 1.73p (2.51p) but the interim dividend is being lifted from 1.4p to 1.5p.</p>

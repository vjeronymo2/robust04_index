			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARVEL COLLINS; WILLIAM FAULKNER EXPERT  </P> <P> Carvel Collins, considered the world's foremost authority on the complex and  controversial author William Faulkner, has died in an Oceanside hospital after  a massive cerebral hemorrhage. He was 77.  </P> <P> Collins, who had lived in Vista in San Diego County since his 1978 retirement,  died Tuesday.  </P> <P> First intrigued by Faulkner in 1929 as a student at Miami University, Collins  was the first professor in the world to offer a course solely devoted to  Faulkner. He did that at Harvard in 1942 -- seven years before Faulkner won the  Nobel Prize and with it worldwide critical acclaim.  </P> <P> Collins spent more than five decades researching Faulkner, but, to the  disappointment of many scholars, never wrote a planned biography.  </P> <P> "I've never tired of knowing Faulkner," he told a Los Angeles Times interviewer  in 1986. "My joy in this search is inexhaustible. Never been dull. The more you  know, the more you realize how divine he really was."  </P> <P> He had personally promised Faulkner never to write his biography until after  his death, which occurred in 1962, Collins said in that interview. His plans  were further delayed, he said, when Faulkner's widow authorized another writer  to do a two-volume biography published in 1974 and 1984.  </P> <P> Collins did write scores of articles on Faulkner and introductions to books of  Faulkner collections he edited, including "New Orleans Sketches" and "The  Unvanquished."  </P> <P> He had arranged for his prodigious research files, which filled his workroom  behind the garage of the Vista house, to go to the University of Texas  Humanities Research Center.  </P> <P> Born June 14, 1912, in West Union, Ohio, Collins earned his bachelor's degree  at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and his master's and doctorate at the  University of Chicago.  </P> <P> He taught English at Colorado State College, Stephens College, Harvard  University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Collins' first marriage, to Mary Brewster, ended in divorce. He is survived by  his second wife, Ann Greene Collins; his daughter from his first marriage, Lucy  Emerson Collins of New York City, and a brother, Charles, of Phoenix.  </P></p>

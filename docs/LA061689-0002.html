			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. POLICY IN CENTRAL AMERICA  </P> <P> Another fallout or residue of the Reagan legacy made print on the front page of  The Times ("U.S. Seeks to End Contras' Base in Miami, Rebels Say," June 8)  showing how our past President wasted taxpayer money in pursuit of his "dirty  little war in Nicaragua."  </P> <P> The story reveals how a small group of Contra leaders now refuse to return to  their homeland to participate in efforts to ensure democratic elections,  preferring, in the words of a Bush Administration official, to live "the easy  life in exile" in Miami.  </P> <P> Further in the story it was revealed that since 1982, the CIA has been funding  these people to the tune of $500,000 a month. They've now been reduced to  $200,000 monthly. The Contra military organization also receives $4.5 million a  month in non-military aid to maintain an estimated 12,000 troops and their  families in Honduras and Costa Rica.  </P> <P> How many homeless Americans would this money house? How many hungry Americans  would this money feed? How many elderly Americans would this money comfort?  </P> <P> When will our so-called leaders, both in the executive and legislative branches  of government, open their eyes and bring an end to this madness?  </P> <P> I submit, at this point in time, the enemy is not in the Soviet Union or its  satellite nations; the real enemy is in Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> BEN URMAN  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 22 (CTK) -- At its session today the  cabinet did not approve a constitutional bill on higher  self-governing units which has been submitted by Deputy Premier  Jan Kalvoda, Deputy Premier Ivan Kocarnik told reporters today.    However, the cabinet must submit the bill to parliament by  June 30, Kocarnik added.    He said the government had thoroughly discussed the document  which anticipated the creation of 13 units which would include  units formed on the basis of administrative centers of the  former regions (Brno is a chief city of the former South  Moravian region) and new districts of Karlovy Vary, Liberec,  Pardubice, Jihlava, Olomouc and Zlin.    According to the bill, Prague and Central Bohemia would form  one unit.    There were initially seven regions (five Czech and two  Moravian) - Central Bohemia with Prague as a chief city, South  Bohemia - Pardubice, West Bohemia - Plzen, North Bohemia - Usti  nad Labem, East Bohemia - Hradec Kralove, South Moravia - Brno  and North Moravia - Ostrava. The city of Prague was also a  region. These regions were abolished in 1991, and 72 districts  came into existence instead.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tory scientist - Ballot Box A lone scientific voice has spoken up to defend the Conservatives against a barrage of attacks from researchers who say British science has declined since 1979. Terence Kealey, a clinical biochemist at Cambridge University, says 'all that criticism of Tory policy is unfair'. He maintains that total support for university science grew during the 1980s because funding from non- government sources (industry, charities and private) doubled. 'I don't personally know anyone who agrees with me,' Kealey admits cheerfully. But after writing to The Times, challenging the anti-Tory views of fellow scientists, he received several letters of support from 'distinguished science-policy people'. Apart from Kealey, the only scientist that Conservative Central Office could name as a defender of government policy is Philip Treleaven, professor of computing at London University. He is also the Tory candidate in the London constituency of Southall.</p>

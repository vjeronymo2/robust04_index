			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Quarrel in the family: Europe and the US must refine Nato roles Once today's funeral service of Nato secretary-general Manfred Worner is over, senior ministers of the 16-member western alliance will return to the task of forging a more mature defence relationship. Improving transatlantic understanding was a loudly proclaimed goal of the Nato summit eight months ago, when the US, like a weary parent, acknowledged that its European 'children' had come of age. In cold war days, European dreams of self-sufficiency in defence were dismissed in Washington as the foolish and irresponsible fantasy of adolescence; but in January, US President Bill Clinton finally told his European counterparts that he wanted them to do much more for themselves. The Franco-German Eurocorps, a budding European land army which also involves Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg, received Washington's blessing; so did the idea of upgrading the nine-nation Western European Union into a properly functioning military club that could act alone. Under America's benign gaze, new and adaptable taskforces were to be designed, ready to sally forth and deal with any medium-sized military challenge that came along. These taskforces would consist of carefully selected bits and pieces from the arsenals of, say, three or four European countries, not all of which would need to be members of the Atlantic alliance. But Nato, like a decent old soul, would still provide these forces with all the military assets they lacked: long-range transport, intelligence, mobile headquarters and so on. In practice, most of the assets would have to be furnished by Uncle Sam, because he is the only member of the Nato family who possesses them in sufficient quantity. All this talk of high-minded, disinterested generosity sounded too good to be true, and so it was. Progress towards redefining the relationship between Nato and the WEU has been painfully slow, and the much-vaunted taskforces have hardly got on to the drawing board, much less off it. The reasons for this are clear. France, as the driving force in the WEU and the strongest advocate of European self-suffiency in defence, wants anything the continent does in the military sphere to be as free as possible from US influence. The US, predictably, is not willing to put its military assets at its allies' disposal unless it can retain some say over how long, when and for what purpose they will be used. In a sense, both sides are trying to have things both ways. The French want maximum access to US facilities and the minimum US influence, while the Americans want to scale down their commitment of hardware and soldiers to Europe without losing their political prestige. For politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, there is something tempting about the idea of a military force made up of highly visible European servicemen and armour, discreetly backed up by US command systems and technology. For the Europeans this model could provide the continent with a measure of self-sufficiency, or the appearance of self-sufficiency, much sooner than they could otherwise afford. For the Americans, the taskforces could be a crafty way of retaining a discreet veto over European operations while reducing the number of men and weapons that it deploys abroad. But it seems doubtful whether both these cards can be played at once. By trying to be too clever, the Europeans could find themselves losing out every way: as dependent as ever on US technology and strategic military assets, but more vulnerable than before to the dangers posed by instability to their east and south. For now, this transatlantic misunderstanding over defence may be nothing worse than a bad-tempered family quarrel, which does not call into question the family's existence. But the consequences could be more serious in a few years. US irritation with Europe could translate into mounting congressional pressure for a faster and more total disengagement from the continent than currently planned; and that would leave Russia - despite its current upheavals - by far the strongest military power in the European security equation. It may be argued that some development along roughly those lines - US disengagement from Europe, greater European vulnerability to Russia - is virtually certain to unfold anyway. Indeed, there are some voices in Europe, particularly on the German left, who would see nothing wrong with that turn of events, so long as there is a balance of economic and military dependence between the European Union and Russia, without one side putting unbearable pressure on the other. But nobody would gain from a US disengagement from Europe so abrupt and ill-tempered that the Europeans did not even have time to consider how to respond: whether to develop real (as opposed to phoney) self-sufficiency, or simply learn to live with a large, unpredictable Russian neighbour. To avoid that danger, there is a need for some straight talking from both sides of the Atlantic, with neither pretending it can get something for nothing. As a first step, both sides could acknowledge, more clearly than they currently do, the existing reality: the European members of Nato are a long way from possessing the capacity to fight even a miniature version of the Gulf conflict on their own. Even if they took a firm decision tomorrow to acquire that capacity as rapidly as possible, they would be hard pressed to do so before the end of the century. So there is no magic formula to transport western Europe instantly to the happy state of real self-sufficiency in defence, and it is naive to imagine that the Americans will provide such a blueprint and seek nothing in return. On the other hand, unless the Europeans sit down and ask themselves what sort of military operations they could reasonably conduct and finance themselves, then US weariness of its European burden could reach breaking point. Nato's new secretary-general will have to grasp these realities and bring a note of reason to the current transatlantic dialogue of the deaf, before both sides walk off in a huff.</p>

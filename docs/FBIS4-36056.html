			<p>BFN     [Text] Their Highnesses the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council]  foreign ministers this afternoon ended the meetings of the 51st  session of the Ministerial Council, which was held in the city  of Abha and lasted for two days.    At the end of the meeting, GCC Secretary General Shaykh  Fahim  Bin-Sultan al-Qasimi read the press release, which said the  following:    [Begin al-Qasimi recording] The Ministerial Council followed  with great anxiety the painful developments in Yemen and the  consequences of the continuation of the internecine fighting,  which made the leaders in South Yemen declare the setting up of  the Democratic Republic of Yemen. In this context the council  welcomed the issuance of the UN Security Council Resolution No.  924 and expressed its great regret for the continued fighting  despite the issuance of that resolution.    If the UN Security Council stressed in its Resolution 924  the  eagerness of the international community to protect peace and  stability in Yemen, this eagerness increases within the  framework of the GCC; thus, the council calls on the Yemeni  leaders to put the interests of Yemen and its people above all  considerations and to respond immediately to the requirements of  the UN Security Council by ending the military operations  forthwith and having recourse to dialogue in order to avoid  bloodshed and protect lives and property.    On the premise of the fact that unity is a request of the  sons of the Arab nation, the council welcomed Yemeni unity when  it was set up by consent of the two independent states, the  Yemeni Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of  Yemen in 1990. Consequently its continuation can only take place  with the consent of the two sides.    Faced with a de facto situation embodied by one of the  parties announcing the return to its former status and the  establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, the two sides  cannot deal with each other in that framework except through  peaceful ways and means.    While the council appreciates the desire of Yemen's sons for  unity, it stresses that it cannot at all impose this unity using  military means. The council states that the continuation of the  fighting must have repercussions, not only on Yemen but on the  council's states, making them take suitable stances toward the  party that does not abide by the cease-fire agreement.    It will also make them consult with Arab and international  parties on necessary measures to be taken in the Security  Council toward that deteriorating condition in line with the  principles of the United Nation's Charter.    The GCC Council condemned the Iraqi regime for not  completely  abiding with international legitimacy, for continuing its  procrastination, violating cease-fire terms underlined in  Resolution 687 by reiterating its expansionist claims on Kuwait,  and not recognizing its sovereignty, threatening its  independence, and endangering regional security.    The statement expressed its appreciation to member states in  the Security Council for their firm stance calling on the  necessity for Iraqi respect for the sovereignty, independence,  and international borders of the State of Kuwait in a legal,  documented way.    The council expressed its utmost concern for the unity of  Iraq, its sovereignty, and the safety of its lands, and its  sympathy for the brotherly Iraqi people in their plight -- for  which the Iraqi regime was fully responsible.    The Ministerial Council also reviewed the latest development  regarding relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran; and  reiterated its firm stance that supports and backs the United  Arab Emirates' [UAE] sovereignty on its three islands: Upper  Tunb, Lower Tunb, and Abu Musa. The council stressed its full  support for all the peaceful measures and ways undertaken by the  UAE to recover its sovereignty over its three islands.    In its final press release, the council denounced the  continuing campaigns that are being waged by Iranian mass media  against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia regarding pilgrimage  arrangements -- a matter that contravenes relations of good  neighborliness. It does not serve the boosting of relations and  the establishment of an atmosphere of trust and tranquility in  the region.    The council expresses its utmost gratitude and praise for  the  huge and sincere efforts that are deployed by the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia, at its forefront King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al  Sa'ud, custodian of the two holy mosques, to enable the pilgrims  to carry out their pilgrimage rituals in security and ease.    The council also discussed the developments of the peace  process in the Middle East. In this context, it expressed its  aspirations that bilateral negotiations would achieve a  fundamental progress on all levels; especially Syrian and  Lebanese levels. In this connection, the council welcomes the  signing of the Cairo Agreement on 4 May 1994, because it  represents a positive step on the path of finding a just,  comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause and  the Arab-Israeli conflict.    The council also followed with concern the continuing  Israeli  violations of the sovereignty of Lebanon -- a matter that  contravenes international charters and the spirit of the peace  process. The Ministerial Council strongly condemned Israel's  attacks against Lebanese villages; the killing of civilians, the  destruction of properties and its hampering of the ongoing peace  efforts.    The council renewed its call to the UN Security Council to  enable the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to exercise the  legitimate right of self-defense in accordance with Article 51  of the UN Charter; including the lifting of the arms embargo  that has been imposed; the tightening of sanctions; the increase  in pressure on Serbia and Montenegro; and to prevent reward for  the aggressor.

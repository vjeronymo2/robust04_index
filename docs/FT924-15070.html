			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Brussels to extend multi-fibre pact THE EC has decided to extend the Multi-Fibre Arrangement covering international textile trade and renew MFA pacts with certain third countries. EC foreign and trade ministers approved the move in Luxembourg yesterday, despite opposition by France, wanting more protection for European textile industries. Asian countries are likely to be disappointed that the new EC mandate, dependent on a successful Gatt accord, is not more generous on extending access to European markets. Linked to this tough stand, EC ministers opened talks on plans to give the European Commission more power to push through 'commercial defence measures' covering anti-dumping duties, quotas and safeguard clauses in the European single market. Yesterday's meeting marked the start of the 'trade weapons' debate which could see sharp splits between traditional free traders such as the UK and Germany, and Spain and Italy which fear free circulation of goods after 1992 might weaken EC trade policy. Another debate centred on the EC's proposals for reforming its banana import regime in time for the 1992 single market. Member states are divided how best to reconcile the EC's treaty obligation to support favoured suppliers from the Caribbean, while not discriminating against 'dollar' banana producers from Latin America. A Commission plan to propose an EC-wide quota on banana imports from central America risks violating Gatt procedures. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a British Foreign Office minister, said he hoped for agreement before the end of Britain's presidency this year, but issues were complex. 'There is no such thing as a straight banana.' Ministers agreed to offer modest concessions on liberalising trade in farm products with Romania and Bulgaria.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- The government is planning  to send Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa to South Korea soon for  bilateral ministerial talks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi  Kumagai said Monday [6 June].    "We are currently considering the convening of Japan-South  Korea foreign ministerial talks," the top government spokesman  said at a news conference.    But Kumagai hastened to add that the schedule has yet to be  fixed and the planned session does not necessarily aim to  discuss the two countries' response to North Korea's alleged  push for nuclear arms.    It will be meaningful to exchange views at a high-level, he  noted.    Kumagai said he will discuss the planned talks with South  Korea when he meets with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and  Kakizawa later Monday.    Hata, Kakizawa and Kumagai meet on Monday night to listen to  a report from Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign  Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, who represented Japan at  trilateral talks with the United States and South Korea last  week.    At that time, the three countries adopted a united front and  urged the U.N. Security Council to take prompt action against  North Korea, including the consideration of economic sanctions.</p>

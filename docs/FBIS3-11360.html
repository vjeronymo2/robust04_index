General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir acknowledged that health  and  education are priorities and expressed the Armed Forces'  willingness to support President Reina's decision to implement  the social assistance program he promised the Honduran people.    The planned 10-percent reduction of the Armed Forces' 270  million lempira budget represents a 27 million-lempira cut  which, according to Discua Elvir, will negatively affect the  military's community programs.    Right now the military is engaged in assistance programs to  improve education, environmental protection, and health, which  includes the vaccination of the canine population.    Regarding an eventual privatization of Hondutel, the  military  chief said: "This is a profitable enterprise that has been very  good for the government. Any eventual privatization should be  carefully analyzed." The Armed Forces, however, acknowledge  that "the final decision rests with the executive branch."    Discua Elvir announced that he will ask the Comptroller  General's Office to audit the offices managed by the Armed  Forces, something that has been done since 1990.    The military commander reiterated his opposition to military  service becoming an all-volunteer institution because he  believes it would be the end of the Armed Forces.    Gen. Discua is of the opinion that military service must be  "constitutional and educational" (obligatory), but a  presidential promise describes it as "voluntary and educational."    On this point, as on others, the military chief concedes  that  the final decision is in the hands of the president of Honduras.</p>

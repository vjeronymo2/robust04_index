			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / First tests of cancer vaccine on humans to start soon THE FIRST human tests of a vaccine designed to prevent cancer will start at the end of this year, the UK Cancer Research Campaign announced yesterday. CRC researchers believe viral vaccines will become one of the main methods of cancer prevention during the next century. The new vaccine stops infection with the Epstein Barr Virus, which is known to cause several types of cancer. Only a few years ago most scientists would have dismissed the idea of a link between viruses and cancer as wild speculation. However, recent evidence suggests viruses are responsible for at least 20 per cent of all cancers - perhaps 5m cases a year worldwide. Epstein Barr Virus does most damage in China where it causes 60,000 deaths a year from cancer of the nasal cavity, and in tropical Africa where it leads to several thousand cases a year of Burkitt's Lymphoma, a childhood cancer. In Europe and north America, the main health effect of EBV is to cause glandular fever but recent evidence suggests it is also associated with Hodgkin's Disease, a cancer of the lymph nodes which affects 1,200 people a year in the UK. Dr John Arrand is leading the EBV vaccine programme at the CRC's Paterson Institute in Manchester in collaboration with CRC researchers in Bristol and Birmingham. Safety tests are due to start on about 20 healthy volunteers within a year. The next step would be to test the vaccine's effectiveness in a larger clinical trial, probably among university students who are not infected with EBV. According to Professor Gordon McVie, CRC scientific director, 80 per cent of un-infected undergraduates pick up the virus while they are at university. EBV, a member of the herpes family of viruses, is spread by kissing. If that trial confirms that the vaccine prevents transmission of EBV, the CRC will move on to extensive field trials in China and/or Africa in collaboration with a commercial vaccine manufacturer. 'It may be 10 years before we can show clearly that the vaccine prevents cancer,' Dr Arrand says. But he foresees a time when EBV vaccine will be administered routinely worldwide as an ingredient of the childhood vaccination cocktail. Prof McVie says viruses are now known to cause at least a fifth of all cancers, often in association with dietary or environmental factors. Apart from EBV, three other cancer-causing viruses have been identified.</p>

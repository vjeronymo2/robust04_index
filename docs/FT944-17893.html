			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Nursery education to be made a duty Delegates approved a resolution calling for the provision of nursery education to be made a statutory duty for local authorities. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said Labour was already committed to a 'dramatic extension' of existing facilities. A Labour government would set targets to establish nursery education as a right for every three and four-year-old - subject to parental agreement - as part of a co-ordinated programme of childcare provision. Mrs Taylor promised that the 'bureaucracy of Tory patronage and sleaze' would be swept away, as would the centralisation of control of education. The first quango to go would be the Funding Agency which provides finance for grant-maintained schools.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CROSSROADS FOR CHILD CARE'  </P> <P> As The Times continues its assessment of our nation's child-care crisis  ("Crossroads for Child Care," editorial, March 27), further analysis needs to  be conducted regarding the true cost of "quality" child care and who can afford  it. The Times identified $75 per week as an average urban rate for child care  in a provider's home. The Times doesn't clarify that such a fee is inadequate  to pay for quality center-based programs, some of which may be those  church-related programs mentioned later in the editorial where hundreds of  thousands of children are cared for daily.  </P> <P> The current debate on child care fails to adequately address what constitutes  quality care, what such care costs and the effort that will be required to fund  it. For many years now, research has demonstrated that quality programs require  adequately compensated educated staff, small group sizes of children, and  ratios of teachers to children that are generally better than the minimums  currently mandated by the state of California.  </P> <P> In Southern California providers and consumers of quality center-based programs  recognize that the cost is closer to $150 per week for infants and $90 per week  for 3 and 4 year olds. The fact is that parents from all but the highest income  levels require financial assistance in obtaining care for their children that  is truly beneficial rather than custodial, or at worse, damaging.  </P> <P> The magnitude of such costs seems to discourage a more careful examination of  what we mean by "quality child care," but such an examination is precisely what  is required if we are truly committed to establishing quality care for  children. Excellent guidelines for quality have been established by the  National Assn. for the Education of Young Children. Numerous groups have  proposed strategies for funding such quality. What is clear is that all sectors  of our society will have to make a commitment and work together cooperatively  if our children are to have what many of us older Americans took for granted --  an enriching, safe, and most important, happy childhood.  </P> <P> ERIC NELSON  </P> <P> Director  </P> <P> JPL Child Educational Center  </P> <P> La Canada  </P></p>

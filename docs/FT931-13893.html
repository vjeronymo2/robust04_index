			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont 'affected' by tabloid stories SENIOR government officials told MPs yesterday that Mr Norman Lamont's ability to perform his official duties as chancellor had been affected by press stories in April 1991 over a self-styled 'sex therapist' who had rented part of his London house. Sir Peter Middleton, the former permanent secretary of the Treasury, told the cross-party public accounts committee: 'It undoubtedly affected his official business and his ability to perform his official duties. It took up time and affected his reputation.' Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, told committee members the issue had affected the credibility of the chancellor's position and the attention he could give to his duties if no action were taken. The committee is examining a Pounds 4,700 payment by the Treasury covering legal expenses incurred by Mr Lamont in evicting the woman. Sir Robin and Sir Terry Burns, the Treasury permanent secretary, agreed to review the guidelines on meeting ministerial expenses, though they defended the Treasury contribution to Mr Lamont's costs. The two told the committee that the payment was so definitely within the existing guidelines that it was not thought necessary to highlight it in the departmental accounts. This was not affected by the differences among senior officials about how much of the Pounds 22,000 total bill should be met. Their justification to the committee, which monitors government spending, was that there was a public interest because the story was affecting Mr Lamont's work. The officials said the need to deal urgently with the matter was underlined by the presence in London of finance ministers from abroad that weekend for a G7 meeting. Sir Terry acknowledged that in the light of experience it would be sensible to revise the guidelines, but cautioned against the idea that guidance could be devised to meet every set of circumstances: however detailed, it would still be a matter for officials' judgment. Sir Robin said the growing number of cases arising from ministers' personal lives affecting their official duties meant it made sense to consolidate the guidance 'dotted about here and there' on questions such as press officers' involvement with personal ministerial matters.</p>

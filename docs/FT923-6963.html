			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney These days a 7 per cent fall in Euro Disney's shares is almost unremarkable. Yesterday's slide, though, highlights how easily the French stock market can be unsettled in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum. True, the markets are thin and there was selling from New York, but in more confident times such pressure would have been easily absorbed. The fall also points up the market's difficulty in valuing the shares. With the company likely to report a loss this year and doubts about dividend prospects for 1993-94, Euro Disney still looks expensive. Bulls argue that the cash flow models used to value the shares at flotation may have been over-optimistic, but that when fed with current assumptions they justify the share price. As dividends slowly approach, the idea still deserves a hearing. But with investors refusing to take anything on trust at present, the market is likely to turn a deaf ear.</p>

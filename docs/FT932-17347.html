			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Observer: Picked off the shelf High Street retailing is the sort of business which lends itself to a heavy turnover in chief executives. Most recently, Kingfisher lost its finance director, Archie Norman, to Asda while Sears poached Liam Strong from British Airways. Retailing thrives on fresh blood. However, the transfer market in CEOs tends to be dictated by adversity. It's hard to remember the last time that one apparently well-run retailer poached a chief executive from another. Hence the interest in Alan Smith's move from Marks and Spencer to the chief executive's chair at Kingfisher. In one respect it's surprising that more M&amp;S chieftains have not defected before. Smith is 52 and has been on the board since 1978. He is only one of 17 executive directors and, however good he is, it's unlikely that he will ever get a shot at the top job at M&amp;S. Sir Rick Greenbury, 56, has only been doing the job for a couple of years and is surrounded by capable types. Hence the attraction of Kingfisher. It is Britain's fourth biggest store group and in terms of its 60,000 staff is a similar size to M&amp;S. Smith, a well-respected retailer, will have a chance to run his own show at last. Or will he? One has only to look at companies such as Glaxo and Tate and Lyle to see that imported chief executives can have a relatively short shelf life when working for a strong executive chairman. Kingfisher's executive chairman, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, will be almost as much on probation as the new boy.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE DIDN'T DO ANY WAXING, HE GOT WAXED  </P> <P> His team lost to Houston on Sunday, and Kansas City reserve running back Todd  McNair covered a lot of ground.  </P> <P> Running downfield in the third quarter as a member of the Chiefs' kickoff team,  McNair was sandwiched between two Oilers. He suffered a mild concussion and lay  unconscious on the turf for several minutes while team officials huddled over  him. Finally, he was led to the sideline in a wobbly state.  </P> <P> And in his native state, New Jersey.  </P> <P> Monday, McNair told Doug Tucker of the Associated Press: "I was dreaming. I was  back home in Jersey with my girl. I was waxing my car down, and then I was  driving my car. It was warm. The windows were down."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Kansas City, it remained cold and rainy.  </P> <P> Add dream state: Said McNair: "They said I came off smiling and telling people  I was going back in. But I don't remember any of that. I got to the sideline  and I saw the players and the fans and I thought, 'Hey, I'm dreaming that I'm  in a game.' "  </P> <P> Team officials said McNair will be able to play Sunday at San Diego.  </P> <P> Said McNair: "Everybody was shook up and scared, but today they're joking.  They're calling me 'Sleepy.' "  </P> <P> Was he scared?  </P> <P> Said McNair: "I wasn't scared because I wasn't there."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Name the only team to lose two games and be ranked No. 1 in the AP  college football poll.  </P> <P> New help: After the Dodgers introduced Bob Ojeda and Brett Butler at a news  conference Monday, Orel Hershiser recalled a conversation he'd had with his  6-year-old son, Quinton, during the weekend.  </P> <P> Said Hershiser: "I picked up the paper and said, 'Gee, we got Butler.' Quinton  said, 'Why do we need a butler? We already have a live-in.' "  </P> <P> Junkyard Dogs: Before the recent Georgia-Georgia Tech game, Tony Barnhart of  the Atlanta Journal and Constitution asked Georgia's athletic director and  former football coach, Vince Dooley, to describe his "funniest memory" of the  rivalry.  </P> <P> Dooley recalled that in 1966, a group of Georgia fans brought a cannon to the  game.  </P> <P> With Georgia trailing, 7-6, Bulldog kicker Bobby Etter was about to make  contact on the conversion attempt when the cannon went off, distracting him.  </P> <P> Georgia won, 23-14, but Dooley recalled: "It was the first extra point he had  missed all year. The next day those fans buried that cannon in the  Chattahoochee (River). We never had any thought of having a cannon here again."  </P> <P> Bring on Trottier: No self-respecting hockey fan will believe this, but Lemieux  is having a great year.  </P> <P> The horse, Lemieux.  </P> <P> A 3-year-old colt named for Pittsburgh Penguin star Mario Lemieux, the two-time  NHL scoring champion, won the $5,000 Open Invitational Trot at the Meadows  harness racing track near Washington, Pa., Sunday night. It was his second  consecutive victory.  </P> <P> That makes six victories in 21 starts. Meanwhile, the horse's namesake  continues to recover from a back infection that has kept him out of action.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Minnesota, in 1960. The Golden Gophers, declared national  champion before the bowls, lost to Washington in the 1961 Rose Bowl and  finished 8-2.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Philadelphia 76er forward Charles Barkley, 27, when asked about  Boston's aging front line of Larry Bird, 34, Kevin McHale, 33, and Robert  Parish, 37: "I'd rather have older guys who are great players than younger guys  who stink."

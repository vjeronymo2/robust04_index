			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUN TO MAKE A BRIEF BOW ON WEEKEND  </P> <P> A Saturday of glorious sunshine will be sandwiched between two, gloomy overcast  days today and Sunday, according to the National Weather Service in San Diego.  </P> <P> No significant rainfall is forecast, but a low pressure system near the central  California coast is causing a buildup of a deep marine layer, said forecaster  Harvey Hastrup.  </P> <P> "This resulted in lower temperatures and cloudy skies on Thursday compared to  the previous few days," Hastrup said.  </P> <P> Sunshine and clearing skies may break through this afternoon as the low  pressure system moves inland, but temperatures will rebound only slightly, he  said.  </P> <P> By Saturday, a high pressure system building along the coast is expected to  drive away the clouds and bring abundant sunshine and warmer weather. But the  reprieve is only temporary, Hastrup said.  </P> <P> Another weak disturbance is approaching San Diego and will bring with it  increasing cloudiness and lower temperatures on Sunday and Monday, Hastrup  said.  </P> <P> At the beaches, the high for today and the weekend will range from 63 to 68  degrees. Sea breezes of 12 to 20 m.p.h. are forecast, with surf expected at 2  to 4 feet. The ocean temperature is 66 degrees.  </P> <P> For the coastal strip, temperatures will range from 67 to 72, dipping down  between 58 and 63 degrees at night, Hastrup said.  </P> <P> Inland areas can expect highs of 69 to 76 and lows 53 to 60.  </P></p>

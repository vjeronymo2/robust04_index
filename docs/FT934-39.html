			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Uk Company News: Sir Alistair Frame - Obituary Sir Alistair Frame, former chairman of RTZ Corporation, who died last Sunday aged 64, was one of the chief architects behind what is now the world's largest mining company. In a 23-year career with the former Rio Tinto-Zinc, he rose to become chief executive in 1978 and then executive chairman from 1985 to 1991. Although RTZ was already emerging as an important force in the 1970s under its then chairman, Sir Val Duncan, Sir Alistair was instrumental in completing the company's transformation from an entrepreneurial finance house into a powerful - and structured - global concern. Under his leadership, RTZ shook off the remnants of its early blue-blooded culture and built up a determined worldwide approach to the mining business, acquiring substantial interests in many of the world's major mineral dep-osits. In the 1980s he pushed through tough management changes which tightened central control over RTZ's sprawling business empire with its far-flung baronies. The crowning moment of his career was the Dollars 3.7bn acquisition in 1989 of British Petroleum's mineral interests, which included Kennecott, one of the US' largest copper companies. This bold stroke propelled RTZ to the top of the world mining league. Shortly afterwards, in 1990, he relinquished top executive responsibility to his chosen successor, Sir Derek Birkin, and took on fresh non-executive interests outside the company. These included the chairmanship of British Steel, Wellcome and Davy Corporation, the last of which he joined just as it hit disastrous problems with a North Sea oil rig contract, forcing the sale of the company to Trafalgar House. After that, ill health obliged him to cut back his business activities. Scottish by birth, Sir Alistair was educated at Glasgow and Cambridge universities and spent his early career as a nuclear scientist with the Atomic Energy Author-ity. The expertise he acquired at that time qualified him to testify at the long-running inquiry into the Sizewell B nuclear station where, with characteristic bluntness, he made sharp criticisms of the Central Electricity Generating Board. Several of his recommendations were subsequently taken up. Sir Alistair was married with one daughter.</p>

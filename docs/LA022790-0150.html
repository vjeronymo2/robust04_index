			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'A GREAT TIME TO BE PRESIDENT' -- DUKAKIS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE LOSER IN THE 1988 ELECTION CHALLENGES PRESIDENT BUSH TO TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF HIS 'EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INTERNATIONAL  LEADERSHIP.'  </P> <P> "It's a great time to be President," said Michael S. Dukakis, who isn't.  </P> <P> The Massachusetts governor visited his might-have-been home for an East Room  reception with President Bush on Monday and afterward said he knows he is  missing out on a spate of good news.  </P> <P> "I don't stay up nights on the subject," Dukakis said. "I must say that this  would be a great time to be President of the United States."  </P> <P> Dukakis, who has had no such luck with affairs in Massachusetts over the last  year, reflected on how events have smiled on his political nemesis.  </P> <P> "We're living through history here. This is unprecedented. The Cold War has  defined everything about our lives about our country, about the world, and all  of a sudden, nobody predicted it, it seems to be sliding away."  </P> <P> The question, Dukakis said, is what Bush can make of the opportunities that  have fallen into his lap.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that this is a very good time for the country, providing we  take advantage of what is an extraordinary opportunity to provide international  leadership. . . . If the Administration does a good job of that, then they're  going to be successful, and if they don't, then somebody else is going to be  President."  </P> <P> Sporting a cast on his left hand because he broke two fingers on Saturday  trying to push a car out of snow, Dukakis made his second trip to the White  House since losing to Bush in the November, 1988, presidential election. He is  in town to take part in the annual National Governors' Assn. meeting.  </P> <P> As one with direct experience in the field of changing political fortunes,  Dukakis warned Bush not to grow overconfident, especially now that a favorite  Republican enemy -- communism -- appears to be waning as a major issue.  </P> <P> "The Republicans have always had this defense thing and, you know, Bush used it  against me and in retrospect, who was the most accurate forecaster? It was the  Democratic nominee," Dukakis said.  </P> <P> "You never know. Things change in this business."  </P> <P> The successful elections Sunday in Nicaragua, Dukakis said, are an example of  the bankruptcy of the Reagan-Bush policy of military aid to the Nicaraguan  Contra rebels. It was a diplomatic approach that opened the door to free  elections, he said.  </P> <P> "What's the record? There was no progress toward genuinely open, free,  internationally supervised elections until the Contra effort effectively was  killed," Dukakis said. "What does that tell you?"  </P></p>

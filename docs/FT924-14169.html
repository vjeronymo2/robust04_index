			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Assault on separatist Kurds Iraqi Kurds attacked ridges guarding the last bastion of Turkish separatist Kurds in northern Iraq yesterday, Reuter reports. Kurdish Peshmerga guerrillas crept up rocky heights which command entry to the Hakurk valley, where Turkey's Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has its military command. The assault, which could take several days, was the climax of a week-old offensive to drive the PKK from their bases in northern Iraq.</p>

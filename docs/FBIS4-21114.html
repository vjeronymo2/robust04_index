			<p>Organization   <F P=102>   94WD0277A Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET in Swedish 22 Feb 94 p  6 </F>  <F P=103> 94WD0277A </F> <F P=104>  Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET </F> <F P=105>  Swedish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Claes von Hofsten: "Cocaine Gang Broken Up"] </F>   [Text] The police in Huddinge have succeeded in cracking an  entire cocaine sales organization in six stages, from the  supplier in South America to the pizza baker who handled local  sales in southwest Stockholm.    There are 18 suspects in all and the judicial examination of  the activity has been divided into several trials. Three people  have already been sentenced, nine more were indicted a few days  ago. Another five people are awaiting indictment in a couple of  weeks and District Prosecutor Ronnie Jacobson hopes that the  ringleader, a Peruvian who was arrested in Chile at Sweden's  request, will be turned over to Sweden a month from now.    "It is quite unusual to get hold of the entire pyramid, in a  manner of speaking. This is the result of a combination of  confessions and surveillance observations on the part of the  police," Jacobson said.  <H5>  Police Intervention in November </H5>   The police stepped in for the first time last November. They  zeroed in on a pizzeria. The police suspected that cocaine was  being sold there and had therefore kept track of traffic to that  location.    The pizza baker, who handled local sales, got the drugs from  a regional salesman, who in turn got them directly from a man to  whom a female courier delivered her smuggled goods.    The volume of drugs the man in custody in Chile sent to  Sweden in this way is not yet clear. A total of 5 kg of cocaine,  worth about 5 million kronor in abuser circles, has been  confiscated in the course of the investigation.  <H5>  11 Years for Drug Dealing </H5>   Svea Appellate Court has sentenced a Swede who has lived in  South America for several years to 11 years in prison for  exporting substantial quantities of cocaine to Sweden.    Swedish drug agents have long regarded the Swede,  29-year-old  Stefan Orning, as one of the worst suppliers of cocaine to the  Swedish market. He was arrested in Colombia about a year ago and  as he did not oppose extradition it was possible to send him  back to Sweden relatively quickly.    The appellate court sentence of 11 years in prison means  that  Stockholm City Court's earlier sentence in the case has been  upheld. The appellate court also upheld the sentence of nine  years in prison for 28-year-old Anders Bennback. In addition,  three young men received prison sentences of one, three, and  four years respectively.  <H5>  Large Amount </H5>   The appellate court described Orning's acts as especially  serious with reference to the substantial amounts of cocaine he  has handled and the fact that he carried out the activity on a  commercial scale for a long period of time. Back in 1988 when  two young Swedes on their way home from South America were  caught with 4 kg of cocaine when they arrived at Arlanda, the  investigation indicated that it was their friend Orning who had  supplied them with the drugs.    That smuggling attempt is one of the shipments for which  Orning has now been sentenced. The charges against him involved  a total of around 20 kg of cocaine.    Despite the fact that Orning's activity has stopped, there  is  no sign that the flow of cocaine from South America has  diminished, according to Superintendent Nils Jornsten of the  Stockholm Police Department's drug division.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS TOUCH ALL BASES ON TOUCHY ISSUE  </P> <P> If Mike Downey really feels there ought to be some respect shown for the Bay  Area's dead, he shouldn't be urging that we cancel the World Series.  </P> <P> He should launch a campaign to shut down Universal Studios' earthquake  attraction. I noted with disgust that although Universal temporarily closed the  "ride," they reopened it in time for the weekend crowds. Money talks, as usual.  </P> <P> Earthquakes are not a joke. They shouldn't be portrayed as thrill rides. Get  serious, Southern California -- you're next.  </P> <P> GLENN KRELL, San Francisco  </P></p>

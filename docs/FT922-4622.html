			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Pay falls for staff posted to Continent BRITISH COMPANIES are significantly cutting pay packages for staff transferred to continental Europe, according to the Confederation of British Industry, Michael Smith writes. Most will be offered transfers abroad on terms matching those for locally recruited staff, possibly with temporary allowances for housing costs and children's education. The research, by the CBI and Mercer Fraser, the consultancy, is based on a survey of nearly 200 companies. Half employed more than 2,000 people worldwide. Companies cited competition, containing costs and the need for equity in the workplace as the main reasons for reconsidering the remuneration of expatriates in Europe. Most organisations provided some sort of assistance with housing but many were considering ending this system.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Speaking Up: Gennady I. Gerasimov, whose statements of "new thinking" in Soviet  foreign policy made him a familiar figure on the world stage, will be presented  the National Assn. of Government Communicators' "communicator of the year"  award tonight in Washington, D.C. Gerasimov, 60, chief spokesman for the Soviet  Foreign Ministry, is the first-ever foreign recipient of the award.  </P> <P> Speaking Out: It was the not-so haunting theme from the old "Andy Griffith  Show" that led police in Ft. Walton Beach, Fla., to Coco the stolen cockatiel  and his alleged abductor, Frankie LaDel, 20. Coco was lifted Monday during a  home burglary, along with $100 in change and $4,715 worth of camera gear,  electronics equipment, jewelry, shoes and food. The next day, patrolman Jim  Walker heard the unmistakable strains of the tune, punctuated by squawks,  coming from a local tattoo parlor and remembered that the report on the  birdnaping mentioned it was one of the bird's specialties. LaDel was located  and arrested nearby.  </P> <P> Speaking of Animals: Britain's Prince Philip stopped briefly at Orly Airport  outside Paris Thursday to inaugurate an exposition of the World Wildlife Fund.  The exhibit will be on view at Orly Airport until Jan. 15, during which time  passengers at both Orly and at Charles de Gaulle Airport can place their coins  into a transparent globe of the world held up by a model of a panda, the World  Wildlife Fund's emblem.  </P> <P> The Eyes Have It: Mademoiselle magazine looked into the eyes of some  celebrities and learned quite a bit. A behavioral analyst says that Tom  Cruise's left eye is bigger than the right one, showing a sense of  spirituality, while Julia Roberts' long eyebrows mean she is artistic and  independent. Warren Beatty's eyes reveal that he lacks commitment, and Anjelica  Huston's powerful gaze says that she is straightforward while Meryl Streep's  shows intelligence and dedication to family. Paul Newman's trademark blue eyes  haven't faded, a sign of good health.  </P></p>

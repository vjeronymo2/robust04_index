The SDPJ, the largest force in the seven-party coalition  government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, has  traditionally had friendly ties with North Korea.    Chung Hae ryong [name as received], president of the Korean  Residents Union in Japan (Mindan), gave an address to SDP  representatives on the first day of the two-day convention.    But the leader of the pro-Pyongyang General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyun) -- effectively a  Tokyo-Pyongyang contact channel as North Korea and Japan have no  diplomatic relations -- did not attend the SDPJ convention.    Moreover, the Workers' Party of North Korea has not sent the  SDPJ a congratulatory telegram for the convention as it always  had previously, SDPJ officials said.    The development is regarded as an expression of Pyongyang's  disapproval of the move by the SDPJ, which has gradually shifted  its stance toward South Korea since joining the coalition in  August.    Former SDPJ Chairman Sadao Yamahana, who is currently state  minister in charge of political reform, visited South Korea in  September last year, the first time the head of the SDPJ has  done so.    The SDPJ has also adopted a new foreign policy which  includes  a balanced stance toward South and North Korea.</p>

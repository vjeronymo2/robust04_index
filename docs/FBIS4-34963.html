			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, 21 Jun (PL) -- It was reported today that  Turkey and Cuba have assessed the possibility of increasing  economic ties, especially in the areas of commerce, tourism, and  business.    Those possibilities were studied during Cuban Ambassador to  Turkey Jorge Castro's visit to the city of Izmir, an important  agricultural and industrial center in Turkey, where he met with  local authorities and industrial and commercial representatives.    The report given by Cuba's diplomatic office added that they  had agreed to hold a meeting of Turkish and Cuban businessmen  shortly to determine Cuba's participation in the construction of  houses in that city.    Jorge Castro's two-day visit allowed him to discuss, in a  friendly atmosphere, the development of bilateral economic ties  and tourism investment and to give Izmir Mayor Burhan Dapatura a  message from his Cuban counterpart, Pedro Chavez.</p>

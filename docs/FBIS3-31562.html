The concerted action came after Kofi Annan, the chief of UN  peacekeeping operations, said in New York that the United  Nations planned to reopen the huge Tuzla airport on March 7.    The international community turned its attention to enclaves  around Bosnia following the success of a NATO ultimatum, which  threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions unless  heavy weapons were withdrawn from around Sarajevo by midnight  GMT Sunday.    "The UN and NATO have decided to strike while the iron is  hot" in the wake of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  ultimatum on Sarajevo issued on February 9, commented a UN  officer here, who declined to be identified.    The Tuzla airport, which has been closed by Bosnian Serb  gunners since May last year, is scheduled to open March 7, said  Annan after meeting with UN member countries involved in the  peacekeeping operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    UN troops backed by air support could be used to reopen the  airport if necessary following discussions with the parties on  the ground, Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has told the  Security Council.    NATO last month renewed an offer to use its warplanes to end  the strangulation of Bosnian Serb-besieged Moslem communities if  requested by the United Nations.    The million-strong mainly Moslem population of Tuzla, which  includes a large minority of refugees fleeing the Bosnian  fighting, has been supplied by road convoys alone because of the  airport's closure.    According to the UN officer here, the Serbs could no longer  prevent the airport reopening at Tuzla, and ``NATO planes can  overfly Tuzla as they do for Sarajevo, and take out any weapon  targeting the airport.    "The balance of power has changed, and the Serbs, who have  realised that in Sarajevo, would do well to realise it in  Tuzla," he added.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, quoted by the TANJUG  news agency, hinted Monday that the Serbs were ready to discuss  the airport reopening, although he argued that from a  humanitarian point of view it was not necessary as road  corridors to the town were open. [passage omitted]    Road convoys can be stopped "like turning off a tap,"  according to Tuzla UNHCR chief Robyn Ziebert. "If we could get  the necessary convoys through, we wouldn't necessarily need the  airport," he said Tuesday.    The 2.5 kilometre (1.5 mile) runway has been under the  threat  of Serb gunners who are on three sides of the airport.    On February 1 and 2, about 40 shells exploded inside the  airport perimeter. On Monday, as the international community  began to single out Tuzla for attention, 17 shells landed just  outside.    The Swedish peacekeepers, from their observation posts,  noted  the positions from where the shells were fired but were  powerless to riposte.    After months of hesitation, the 1,000 Swedish and Danish UN  troops stationed near Tuzla began preparing to reopen the  airport some nine weeks ago.    "Everything is ready so that we can land the first aircraft  four days after taking control of the area," said Colonel Bengt  Berlin of the Tuzla contingent.</p>

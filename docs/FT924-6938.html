			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Philippines may set up new bank The World Bank has asked the Philippines to look at the feasibility of setting up a new bank that would cater to the needs of local exporters suffering the effects of a strong peso, Reuter reports from Manila. 'I think they are biased towards a separate institution like a Philippine Eximbank (export-import bank),' trade and industry secretary Rizalino Navarro said. He said the proposed bank could tap a Dollars 150m export development fund from the World Bank. Mr Navarro said one alternative open to the government was to convert an existing export-oriented institution. An Eximbank is seen as an ideal solution to local exporters' financial woes since it could provide long-term concessional loans and be used as a conduit for development funds, officials said. The government could convert the Philippine Export and Guarantee Loan Corp (Philguarantee) into an eximbank, Mr Navarro said. But the cash-strapped company would have to be nursed back to health, he said.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Late-paying debtors - right to interest is necessary, but perhaps unenforceable Sir, I read with some interest and approval the article contributed by Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, on the subject of late payment of debts and the basic fairness of an interest entitlement on overdue amounts (Personal View, September 23). The British Chambers of Commerce has surveyed its membership and has concluded that late payment of debts, particularly by large organisations, including government departments, is a major problem to small and medium-sized enterprises. However, I would point out to Lord Alexander that I have on many occasions, particularly over the past two years, in consultation with clients' bankers, been told by them in no uncertain terms that existing facilities cannot be exceeded and the only way to comply is by delaying payments to creditors. I suggest that, as in so many other instances, the banks may be accused of speaking with more than one voice. The solution surely is, as Lord Alexander suggests, to change the law so as to oblige debtors to meet obligations on time. Perhaps Lord Alexander's campaign can be joined by other persons of influence to achieve more order and stability in our trading environment. A J Westall, chairman, South West Chamber of Commerce, Foliot House, Budshead Road, Plymouth, Devon PL6 5XR</p>

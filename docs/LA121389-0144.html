			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Reaching Out: The Museum of Contemporary Art says it will use a new $250,000  National Endowment for the Arts challenge grant to establish an outreach  program to take contemporary art into the neighborhoods of Los Angeles. "We  will work with artists and educators and community leaders . . . the program is  a very major decision on MOCA's part to really involve itself with our  neighbors," said Vas Prabhu, the downtown museum's director of education. Also  receiving an NEA challenge grant is the Huntington Library, which was awarded  $100,000 to establish a fund for art conservation projects. Both institutions  must raise $3 in matching funds for every federal dollar given. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

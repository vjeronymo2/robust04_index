			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, addressed today's session of the  main committee of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] with the  following words:    In our assessment we should prevent the continuation of a  war  waged on two fronts, which is suffocating us. We have reached  the conclusion that one front has to be extinguished, and that  it would be better and less painful if it were done with the  Croats. True, our wounds are still fresh from the conflict with  them, but they are nonetheless lighter than the ones inflicted  on us by the Serbs.    It is also important to say that the chetniks' loathsome  project had the support of their academicians and the church,  which is not the case with the Croatian policy. The Croats did  not have the backing of either the church or of a large number  of people in Croatia. Fewer people in Croatia have messed  things up, Izetbegovic said.</p>

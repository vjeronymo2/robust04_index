			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Slow progress in Taiwan Gatt talks Negotiations on Taiwan's application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are making slower progress than expected, virtually ruling out the possibility of membership by the end of the year, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. Talks in Geneva, which ended yesterday, failed to start drafting detailed entry terms. No date has been set for the next meeting. Taiwan's Gatt application was accepted in September 1992 on the understanding that China would join first (even if only just before). However, negotiations with China are also proceeding at a more sedate pace than the Beijing government would like. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's director general, on a visit to Beijing last week, said it would be 'extremely difficult' for China to join Gatt this year. Negotiations are due to resume next month, after the decision by the US on the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status.</p>

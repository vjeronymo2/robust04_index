			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Mexicans relieved at choice of ambassador THE Mexican government has reacted with relief to reports that the new US ambassador to Mexico will be Mr James R. Jones, chairman of the American Stock Exchange and a former politician with good contacts in the US Congress. The government and US officials believe Mr Jones has influence on Capitol Hill that should be helpful in the run-up to the vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement, expected this year. Mr Jones was a Democratic congressman for 14 years, chairman of the powerful budget committee for four years, and before that a top aide in the Johnson White House. A senior Mexican official said: 'He is a very adequate person for the circumstances. He has a long relation with Congress, is close to Clinton and knows about trade between Mexico and US. All the opinions have been very favourable.' A US official added that Mr Jones 'would send a strong positive signal to Mexico about Nafta and bilateral relations if nominated and confirmed.' During his presidency of the American Stock Exchange, the US's third largest exchange, Mr Jones introduced a series of innovative trading instruments that helped to make up for a slowdown in traditional equity trading business. Foreign currency warrants were especially successful.</p>

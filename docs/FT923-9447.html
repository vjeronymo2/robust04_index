			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London COCOA prices rose on the back of an overnight surge in New York, which also opened steadier than expected yesterday. The market's continued strength was even more remarkable given talk of origin sales - perhaps 25,000 tonnes of Ivorian cocoa and some Ghanaian. On the LME three-month COPPER prices continued to meander around Dollars 2,500 a tonne. A decline of 4,600 tonnes in warehouse stocks to 15-month lows aided sentiment as withdrawals were expected to tail off during the summer. TIN clawed back some lost ground in the afternoon; three-month metal closed above earlier eight-week lows of Dollars 6,650 a tonne, but prices remained soft, with the market depressed by speculative selling and a lack of consumer purchases. GOLD and PLATINUM showed little movement on the London bullion market as the second day of the strike in South Africa spurred no new buying. Overnight news that Uruguay's Central Bank had sold 50,000 ounces of gold in July for about Dollars 17.9m created no impact although the bank said it was part of a new policy of converting its gold reserves into dollar and mark denominated fixed-term deposits.

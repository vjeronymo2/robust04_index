			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Husni Mubarak at the signing ceremony </F> of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement at the  International Convention Center in Cairo -- live]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.    Yasir 'Arafat, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, dear guests,  ladies and gentlemen: In the life of nations, there are  historic moments that cannot be deleted by time or shrouded in  obscurity. These moments always remain, handed down from one  generation to another. The major developments witnessed by these  moments have a deep and radical impact on the strategic  interests and the basic rights of peoples.    In the life of the Middle East peoples in particular, there  are unforgettable historic moments, moments that brought much  hope and many dreams after much pain and suffering. They  allowed the peoples of the region to continue their march toward  peace and along the road of prophets, may God's peace and  prayers be upon them, the prophets sent by God to spread virtue  and right in the world and to cleanse hearts of hatred, vice,  and rancor. God Almighty created man on earth to entrench the  foundations of peace, to build and reconstruct, not to burn or  destroy. Man was created to fill the universe with light,  knowledge, and happiness and to eliminate coercion, fear, and  darkness.    Today we are experiencing one of those historic moments as  we  see the signing of the agreement on the establishment of the  Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho as part of the first  phase of the Palestinian-Israeli peace. This proceeds from the  Declaration of Principles that was signed in Washington. This  step, therefore, is a culmination of hard and strenuous efforts.  Many sides did all they could to turn general rules and  principles into detailed, precise provisions that can be  urgently implemented and can effect a revolutionary  transformation in the reality of the Palestinian and Israeli  peoples.    The Palestinian problem proved difficult to solve for 45  years. Time only added more complications, hatred, and  suffering. Many thought it had turned into a chronic problem  from which there was no way out and that its obstacles could not  be overcome. Calls of despair and despondency spread against  the peacemakers and the instigators of hope. Many people  thought peace was an unattainable objective.    But God Almighty provided the peoples of the region with a  group of people who believed in their God and their mission on  this blessed earth. They remained steadfast in their call for  peace and sincere in their endeavor to achieve a just and  honorable settlement that preserves a party's dignity and right  to a secure life and protects its legitimate rights and  interests in accordance with the laws accepted by the  international community after centuries of experiments,  successes, and failures. It was not strange to see this march  on the course of peace led by great men and noble strugglers who  have experienced war, lived through its horrors and atrocities,  and witnessed the killing, the dismemberment, the burning of  land and crops, and the spreading of ruin as far as the eye  could see. These things were the result of war. It was natural  for these heroes to turn their minds and beliefs from the war  and its horrors and evils to peace with its hopes and broader  horizons that would heal the wounds, resist annihilation, end  the suffering and pain, and allow man to continue his noble  mission worldwide.    This faithful group of heroic men undertook the task of  working for peace to their last heart beat and of devoting their  lives and hearts to turning the dream into a reality regardless  of the sacrifices. They realized with their sound vision and  deep wisdom that peace was the sublime objective of all peoples  and that war was futile even if it brought a temporary victory,  achieved an illusionary security, or changed balances.  Ultimately it incites revenge and motives for retribution. But  a just and honorable peace alone is the right course according  to which everybody can live in security and safety.    The Arab people in Egypt were among the first to believe in  peace as a goal and a course and as a moral commitment  unparalleled by any other commitment. The Egyptian people have  never been reluctant to sacrifice their lives, blood, and  livelihood for the sake of a just and comprehensive peace that  all the peoples of the area can enjoy and through which they can  break the terrible vicious circle of bloodshed and the loss of  sons and fathers. This was reflected in this people's  steadfastness after the glorious October War and their firm  decision to stand by peace when the late President Muhammad  Anwar al-Sadat called for peace [applause] in Jerusalem in  decisive terms that entered and touched every heart when he  said: I did not come to you to conclude a separate agreement  between Egypt and Israel. This is not part of Egypt's policy.  The problem is not Egypt and Israel. Any separate peace  between Egypt and Israel or between any one of the confrontation  states and Israel will not establish a permanent and just peace  in the entire region. Even if peace is achieved between every  confrontation state and Israel without a just solution to the  Palestinian problem, this will never establish the permanent and  just peace demanded by the entire world today.    This, gentlemen, was Egypt's view of the problem and the way  to solve it at that time. This policy continued to constitute  its people's commitment throughout the years, even after it  regained its territory and completed its freedom. The effect of  all this made Egypt more capable of directing its attention to  supporting its other brothers in their efforts to realize their  hopes for a just and honorable peace, the peace of the heroes  and the bold who can overcome the past and present barriers and  move on to the future. Egypt has never felt that it was alone on  this path, although it was lonely and often faced many  difficulties. Egypt's faith that justice will triumph has never  been shaken. It believes that ultimately the voice of peace and  reconciliation will surge with a roaring force throughout the  Arab world and in Israel.    The world's advocates of peace will support the peoples of  the region in these hard years. They will back them and their  right to look forward to a new era in which the peoples of the  region get rid of fear, hatred, and suffering.    If other steps remain to be taken to achieve the  comprehensive peace to which we have committed ourselves, this  does not belittle the importance of this step and achievement.  Each step consolidates the ones taken before it and paves the  way for those to follow. The success scored by the peaceloving  forces through the agreement we are signing and documenting  today must encourage us to implement it honestly and in good  faith despite all the difficulties we expect to find along the  way, difficulties that we consider only natural. The step  should also prompt us to redouble our efforts to achieve  tangible progress and without delay on the other negotiating  track. By doing this, we will be fulfilling our commitment to  our brothers in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon and we will be  performing our responsibilities toward ourselves and our  neighbors in the region in which we live.    Guests and friends, our belief in the victory of peace has  never been shaken for a moment. And it will not be shaken. Our  struggle for peace has never stopped for a single day. It  didn't take place one year and then not take place the next. It  has been a continuous commitment and sharp observers can see  that at no time in the past 10 years has it lacked a tangible  addition that would help us to mark this achievement, which will  continue to inspire our moves for other courageous steps soon.    It remains for me to point out that some of those events  left  greater impact than others along the road of peace. One of  those developments was the convening of the Madrid peace  conference through the commendable initiative of the United  States and Russia, which volunteered to sponsor the conference  and found broad response from all the parties to the conflict  and from all the peaceloving forces in the world. The  conference laid the foundation stone on a long road that was  full of thorns and roses at the same time.    I believe that it behooves me to express the sincerest  thanks and gratitude to U.S. President Bill Clinton and his  efficient aides led by U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher. [applause] President Clinton kept the problem at  the forefront of his attentions and priorities despite the  urgency of other problems and their daily pressures. This  undoubtedly stemmed from his belief that peace in the land of  peace and the cradle of religions is the cornerstone of world  peace and stability.    The Russian Federation under President Boris Yeltsin and his  aides [applause], and we particularly mention Foreign Minister  Kozyrev [applause], played a tangible role in supporting the  peace efforts and in contacting the concerned parties at the  critical times.    The EC played a role that cannot be belittled. Members  exerted every effort to boost the peace process. They acted  separately and collectively in the direction that led to  completing the steps for the comprehensive and just settlement.  This EC policy and concept was not unusual because they  realized the mutual links between security and peace in the  Middle East and stability and prosperity in Europe.    I do not need to express our thanks and gratitude for the  Arab brothers who came to participate in this historic  celebration, which we do not regard as a mere ceremonial and  formal occasion, but as a living symbol of the entire Arab  nation's choice of the peace course and its commitment to  achieving it. [applause]    Due thanks also go to all the other friends who came to join  this bright occasion appreciating its importance and expressing  their support for its objectives and significance.    Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that all of you join me  in addressing the sincerest expressions of appreciation and  pride to President Yasir 'Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin. [applause] They have shown much courage and feelings of  responsibility and proved that they have a far-sighted view  around which has crystallized their determination to attain the  goal amid strong challenges and pressures that are no secret to  anyone. This is the essence of patriotic and moral commitment.    I salute with them this group of men who stood with them all  along the course. These men enriched the process and added to  it with their sound thinking, sincere work, and creative minds.  I mention specifically Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and  President Yasir 'Arafat's companions [applause] who shouldered  the responsibility with him and performed it perfectly.  [applause]    Now, my friends, we can cast our eyes on the far horizon and  look toward a secure and happy future where the dream turns into  a reality and the hope that has thrived in hearts becomes a  tangible reality.    Doors have been opened, convoys have been set off, and the  historic march toward peace in the land of peace has begun.    Palestinians and Arabs everywhere, Israeli supporters of  right, justice, and life, march forward together. Do not be  afraid. Get together. Do not be divided, so that your efforts  will not be wasted. It is time to shake hands, cleanse hearts,  reassure souls, bring interests closer, and to remove enmity,  which spread in the region when time turned its back. It is  time for us to direct our human and natural resources to what  God has legitimized for us. It is time to reclaim land, mend  what wars spoiled, build bridges, and spread development and  progress in fields, farms, and factories. It is time to redress  wounds, uproot hatred from souls, replace the tendencies of evil  and revenge with love and fraternity, and plant roses instead of  barbed wire.    This is not the choice of an individual or a limited group.  It is the option and indisputable, unanimous decision of  peoples. It is not the choice of one people to the exclusion of  others. It is the choice of all peoples and all those who care  for their present and future and realize the challenges.    If a people decides to have life, fate will inevitably  respond; dark will inevitably vanish and shackles will  inevitably break [Arab proverb].    Let us proceed with God's blessing on the road of peace and  good neighborliness. May Gad guide us and protect our march.  Peace be upon you.</p>

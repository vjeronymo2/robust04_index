			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Philippines and Thailand yesterday concluded  the first round of talks of a joint committee on bilateral  cooperation which led to agreements on the establishment of  business cooperation councils, countertrade arrangements, an  exchange of trade and investment priority lists, and an  investments guarantee accord to strengthen economic ties between  the two countries.    In a press conference, Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto  Romulo and Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri also agreed on  a "joint approach" to trade and commodity issues in  international forums such as the GATT and the ASEAN Free Trade  Area (AFTA), apparently to set an example for other ASEAN  countries in adopting a unified stand.    On political issues, Prasong told reporters that Thailand  and  the Philippines had agreed to support the move to include  Myanmar [Burma] in the Asean Ministers Meeting in July, despite  reservations by other member states due to the country's human  rights record. Prasong said that as head of the ASEAN Standing  Committee, his consultations with other ASEAN leaders on the  issue had been "positive." He, however, refused to divulge  details of his consultative meetings.    During the 1 to 4 March talks of the Philippine-Thailand  Joint Commission at the Manila Hotel, both countries agreed to  establish business cooperation councils in their capital cities,  to facilitate investments and joint ventures.</p>

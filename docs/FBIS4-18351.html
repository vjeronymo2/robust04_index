			<p>BFN     [Text] Andreas Papandreou, prime minister and PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] chairman, sent a message to our  European Union [EU] partners that the Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue cannot be weighed  on the scales of quid pro quos or negotiations. Mr. Papandreou  conveyed the message in his opening address at the PASOK Central  Committee meeting for the organization of the party congress, at  which he also presented the party's new outlook. Referring to  the Skopje issue, the prime minister said:    [Begin Papandreou recording] Greece has made it clear in  every way that it is obliged to defend its national interests  and national security with all its strength. We hope that our  partners in the EU will fully understand this. Until now, there  are no such indications. There are issues that cannot be  weighed by the scales of quid pro quos or negotiations. I  believe that with our actions we now express the feelings of the  entire people and the national sensitiveness of all Greek  people, of all of Hellenism.    The same also goes for the unified defense area on our  eastern borders. We are seeing the dramatic return of extreme  right-wing forces in Italy who are exploiting a long political  crisis. Moreover, we are seeing the rise of Islamists in  neighboring Turkey, particularly in Istanbul, which is a sign of  further concern for our already disturbed region.    In this atmosphere, the change that took place in our  country  on 10 October [1993--PASOK's election victory] is not merely an  oasis in a dark landscape, it is a significant and I would say  historic development in the region and, of course, a big moment  for Greece.

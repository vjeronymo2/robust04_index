			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Sport: One more shot at being an immortal - Wimbledon The odyssey began 33 years ago in Revnice, a small town just outside Prague. On the practice wall at the local tennis club a wiry little girl aged 4 1/2 swung her grandmother's old wooden tennis racket for the first time. Because she was so small, Martina Subertova held the racket with both hands and would spend hours on the practice wall - ' . . . queen of the two-handed backhand', she remembers in her autobiography, Being Myself. An American citizen since 1981 and universally acknowledged as the queen of tennis, Martina Navratilova (she took the name of her mother's second husband), will this afternoon attempt to complete the odyssey on a high note by winning a record 10th Wimbledon singles title. Tomorrow's men's final will be between the 22-year-old American Pete Sampras, who won Wimbledon for the first time last year, and the Croatian left-hander Goran Ivanisevic, a finalist two years ago. Despite losing his first set of the tournament in yesterday's semi-final, Sampras returned the second serve of fellow American Todd Martin with such authority that his 6-4 6-4 3-6 6-3 win had an air of inevitability about it. Ivanisevic was equally impressive in beating three-times former champion Boris Becker of Germany 6-2 7-6 6-4. The Croatian's serve was intimidating and his ability to deliver an ace at will - he sent down another 22 yesterday to take his six-match total to 140 - put Becker under such pressure that he seemed doomed once he had lost the opening set. This will be a battle of the giants, and may become a one-dimensional serving contest. Sampras should win, but he has lost five of his eight matches against Ivanisevic, who also won their only two meetings on grass - the Wimbledon semi in 1992 and the final in Manchester a year earlier. Sit back, fasten your seat belts and stand by for fireworks. Today's women's final will be highly emotional as Martina takes on 22-year-old Conchita Martinez, the first finalist from Spain since Lili de Alvarez, who achieved the feat three years in a row between 1926 and 1928 but never won. It will also be a testing occasion because Martinez is one of the few players with a winning record against Navratilova. However, all four of their meetings have been on the slow red clay of the Foro Italico in Rome, a surface that favours Martinez's topspin baseline game. Navratilova won their first encounter there in 1990 but lost in 1991, '93 and in this year's final, a match that cruelly exposed Martina's relative slowness about the court these days. During her progress through six rounds at Wimbledon, Navratilova has gradually improved her mobility by practising against Jim Courier and some of the other men. She has been urged on by another great former champion, Billie Jean King, who, for four years, has been helping her rediscover the simple joy of hitting tennis balls across a net. This delight was never more apparent than in Navratilova's semi-final on Thursday against her near neighbour in Aspen, Colorado, Gigi Fernandez. Her 6-4 7-6 win was a joyous occasion for both of them. No longer a two-handed player, Martina has brought the art of grass court tennis to near perfection these last 22 years. The ultimate professional, Navratilova's swinging service is the best the game has seen; her touch and power on the volley have never been surpassed; and her variety from the back of the court is greater than any of her contemporaries. To have reached the final for a 12th time is a staggering achievement. Until today Navratilova had shared the record of 11 final-round appearances with Charlotte Sterry who, as Charlotte Cooper, won the first of five titles in 1895. Mrs Sterry was also Wimbledon's oldest champion when she won for the last time in 1908, aged 37 years and 282 days - 25 days older than Navratilova is today. Age may well play a part in today's match. Martinez was noticeably faster about the court than Navratilova in winning her semi-final against Steffi Graf's conqueror, American Lori McNeil. That was another exciting affair, won in the end by Martinez 3-6 6-2 10-8. In the crucial closing stages Martinez was the more determined and the more successful at producing telling shots on important points. Martinez also hits the ball harder than Navratilova, a factor that was decisive in her win against Martina in Rome this year. Against that, the faster grass surface will enable Navratilova to impose her attacking game in a way that was impossible in Rome. There, serve-and-volley were suicidal; here at Wimbledon they could be her salvation. Then there are the imponderables. How will Martinez react to her first experience of a grand slam final? Will Navratilova be able to cope with her own volatile emotions and those of excitable spectators? Whatever the outcome, this will be a momentous occasion. After so many extraordinary upsets following the removal of Graf on the second day, it is tempting to suggest that the gods, in honour of the greatest female player of all time, have decided to give her one last chance at immortality. Certainly Navratilova is ready to grasp the moment this afternoon as she walks out to the roar of her devoted followers for the last time. 'This is what I wanted. I've got that opportunity one more time. That's what I said when I walked off the court last year - I'll be back one more time. 'What a way to go] Geez, this is what I dreamed about. Win or lose . . . this is what I wanted, to go out in style. You know I'm going to absolutely enjoy every moment.' So are we, Martina.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by C Doonan] </F>   [Text] Durban March 30 SAPA -- More than half of the  Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] Natal/kwaZulu supporters will vote  in the April elections, according to the latest opinion survey  by Durban's Institute for Multiparty Democracy.    This is in spite of IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's  warning  that the elections will lead to the destruction of the Zulu  nation and his repeated calls for them to be postponed.    Released on Wednesday, the survey by Data Research Africa  Ltd  and the Human Sciences Research Council [HSRC] in February,  showed 52.1 per cent of IFP respondents said they disapproved of  an elections boycott, and 54 per cent said they would  "definitely vote". "Only one IFP voter in 14 was adamant they  would not vote," said the survey conducted among 2,601  respondents of whom 389 were white, 500 Indian, 100 coloured and  1603 black. "We took particularly painstaking efforts to  achieve a proper rural representation," said the researchers.    On party choice, the survey showed 44.1 per cent of black  respondents supported the African National Congress, and 21.3  per cent were behind the IFP.    Among all races the ANC scored 36.7 per cent support, the  IFP  18.1, the National Party 13.9, the Democratic Party 2.3 and the  Freedom Front and Pan Africanist Congress 0.8.    "Don't know" responses scored 10.5 per cent, followed by  "won't say" 8.4 and "won't vote" 8.2.    Perceptions of who was to blame for violence drew a 27 per  cent response pointing to the IFP and 23.1 per cent blaming the  ANC.    Expectations of the post-election future followed earlier  survey patterns with "general gloom among the non-African  minorities contradicted by the euphoric views of the African  majority". But, the surveyors noted: "The election in Natal is  fraught with contradictions, ironies and sheer tragedy." "The  situation is dominated by the IFP's electoral boycott. As  recently as July 1992, an HSRC survey showed the IFP leading the  ANC in Natal by 37 per cent to 23 per cent, but in only two  years the IFP has slipped from this leadership position to a  clear second place."</p>

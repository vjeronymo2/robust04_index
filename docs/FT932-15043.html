			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Outokumpu to raise FM500m OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, is planning a FM500m (Dollars 88.69m) rights issue this year to strengthen its balance sheet and help finance its investment programme. The Finnish state has already indicated that it would support the issue in line with its 57.5 per cent direct stake in the company. The timing of the move has yet to be decided, but could come as early as the late spring to exploit improved stock market conditions in Finland following the sharp depreciation of the markka and the fall in domestic interest rates. The issue will carry preferential subscription rights for current shareholders. Mr Pentti Hakkarainen, a vice-president, said proceeds from the issue would help the group move closer to its target of a 30 per cent equity/total asset ratio from its current level of around 17 per cent. It would also enable the company to maintain its annual capital expenditure at the FM1.3bn to FM1.5bn level, he stated. Outokumpu has been encouraged to proceed with the plan by its own improving financial performance, with losses before extraordinary items narrowing last year to FM360m from FM768m in 1991. A further improvement in its result is expected this year. Outokumpu was one of five Finnish state-owned groups earmarked for possible privatisation last November. The government said it was looking to expand the ownership base of the companies and to ensure they had adequate financial resources for their development.</p>

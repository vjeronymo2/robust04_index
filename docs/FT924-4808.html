			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / German union 'cautious' on pay HOPES of a return to moderation in German pay deals were given a further lift yesterday as the DAG union accepted that most of its 500,000 members would receive no real increase next year, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. Mr Roland Issen, leader of the white-collar union representing public and private sector staff, said claims for 1993 would range between 4.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent. This 'cautious' starting point took into account fading economic prospects and conditions in the industries employing DAG members. The statement, together with last Friday's agreement among leaders of the oTV to seek a basic 5 per cent increase for 2.3m public sector workers, will dampen expectations among other wage earners and ultimately help reduce inflation. The annual rate of price increases in western Germany, forecast to average 3.5 per cent next year after 4 per cent this year, is a key factor determining the Bundesbank's interest rates policy.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / US grounds aircraft subsidy talks Negotiations on a Gatt code disciplining state subsidies for aircraft ground to a standstill at the weekend after US industry representatives said the proposed agreement was unacceptable. 'Right now I don't see the aircraft agreement as a basis for going forward,' a senior US official said yesterday. The impasse followed strong objections by American engine and component manufacturers to being included in the revised code, which would restrain subsidies of all kinds to the aircraft industry. There were signs later in the day that another attempt might be made to resuscitate the talks. Officials were reluctant to term the issue a 'round-breaker', but failure would be a serious setback to efforts to secure fairer competition in the aircraft sector. Trade negotiators from other countries involved in the aircraft talks said the US industry was making a strategic mistake in rejecting a deal that would rein back state supports for the aircraft industry around the world, including emerging competitors in the Far East. The industry is the US's biggest export earner. The US and EU agreed last year to press for 'multilateralisation' of their 1992 bilateral accord capping state subsidies to the European Airbus and placing a limit on US indirect supports via military and space research contracts for aircraft manufacturers. However, the bilateral pact applies only to large civil aircraft, whereas Gatt's existing civil aircraft code applies to all aircraft and components, and covers 22 signatories with a wide variety of subsidy systems. The US industry is objecting to inclusion in the revised code of provisions that would impose tighter disciplines on research-based subsidies than those included in the separate, and more general, subsidies agreement being negotiated in the Uruguay Round.</p>

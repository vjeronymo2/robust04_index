			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Technology: Spirits lifted in truck industry The world lift truck industry does not have much to be happy about at present, but Bruno Kulick, joint managing director of Lansing Linde, was permitting himself a glimmer of a smile last week. In the middle of a recession that has caused an estimated 40 per cent contraction in the UK lift truck market over the past two years, and which shows no real sign of easing, Kulick and his team at the German-owned company lured 1,000 warehousing managers to Basingstoke to see some important new products and look round the first stage of a Pounds 50m manufacturing investment. 'Maybe it's just my hope, but the number of visitors might show that something positive is happening,' he says. The jamboree marked the latest stage in the transformation of the former Lansing Bagnall, founded by Sir Emmanuel Kaye in the early 1940s, into the UK arm of Linde, the world's largest lift truck group, which bought Lansing in 1989. The deal almost certainly saved Lansing from going under in the current recession. The new Lansing Linde is being turned into Linde's global centre for the manufacture of electric lift trucks used in warehouses - Linde itself is better-known for internal combustion engine lift trucks normally used outside the warehouse. The centrepiece of last week's event was a new range of reach trucks, so named because of their high reach, which are an essential feature of many modern warehouses. The range will become the core product at Basingstoke, accounting eventually for about 80 per cent of Lansing Linde's turnover, says Kulick. The launch is also important for Linde as a whole, because the purchase of a reach truck often leads to orders from the same customer for related equipment such as pallet trucks and order pickers, made elsewhere in the group. But the manufacturing methods and component purchasing policy illustrate how things have changed from the old days at Lansing, which used to engineer nearly all of the lift truck itself. Lansing Linde had overall control of the new range, but handling hydraulics and electronics was a joint effort with Linde. The result is a product that is 60 per cent made in Basingstoke or from UK components, and 40 per cent from foreign components - many of which are common to all Linde lift trucks. And a new flow-line system in the recently-completed assembly plant - which represents one-third of the Pounds 50m investment programme - has reduced the build time from three-four weeks to four-five days. The investment in manufacturing is a timely move for Lansing Linde - and not only because it ensures the future of the company within the German group. According to Kulick, there has been a tremendous change in philosophy in the UK lift truck market over the past three years, with customers shifting away from outright purchase to leasing and other finance deals. As customers increasingly concentrate on their core activities, that leaves the lift truck manufacturers as the real owners of their products, and forces them to consider the 'lifetime cost' of the machines. Fitting a low-cost bearing, for example, might save on the manufacturing cost but could ultimately be a false economy. Kulick and the heads of other lift truck producers will be hoping that UK warehouse managers will be more disposed to buy new equipment in the not-too-distant future than over the past two years. Whether they do remains to be seen, but at least the pound's devaluation has provided an ideal springboard for Lansing Linde's export drive.</p>

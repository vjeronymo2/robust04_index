			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Toshiba plant to make air conditioners TOSHIBA has opened the first Japanese-owned factory in the UK to produce air-conditioning units. The move is part of a plan to to expand the company's presence in the relatively untapped European market. A former Toshiba microwave plant in Plymouth has been converted and extended at a cost of Pounds 10m. The Plymouth plant is Toshiba's first air-conditioning unit factory outside Japan. The plant is likely to intensify competition in the UK market for commercial air conditioners. Sales in the sector have fallen about 25 per cent in the past year because of the effect of the recession on construction and retailing. The move could also increase Japanese dominance of the market for small and medium-sized air conditioners. Five Japanese companies including Toshiba have captured between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of the UK market in small to medium-sized air conditioners in the past 20 years. Employment at the Ply-mouth plant is expected to rise from the current 135 to 220 when full production is reached early next year. The plant will then be capable of producing 25,000 units a year of various sizes, worth Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m. About half of production will be exported. Toshiba, with Japanese companies in other manufacturing sectors, wants to secure its position ahead of the European single-market reforms. EC tariffs on imported Japanese air conditioners are about 5 per cent, and the Japanese want to anticipate any pressure from European producers for an increase. The compressors and controllers for the units produced at Plymouth will be imported from Japan. The aim is to double the local or EC-produced content from 30 per cent to 60 per cent by January. Mr George Williams, managing director of Toshiba's UK audio-visual and air-conditioner division, said he expected the plant to be trading profitably by next year. Japanese air-conditioning equipment producers are attracted to Europe by its long-term growth potential. The use of air conditioning in the UK commercial sector is much lower than in Japan. Toshiba hopes full production at Plymouth will coincide with an upturn in demand in the UK and Europe. Its UK sales have fallen only about 5 per cent in the past year, thanks to strong technology and targeting of the few remaining buoyant market niches. UK air conditioning unit sales prospered between 1982 to 1990 because of the high level of shop refurbishments, but the fall in high-street spending has hit most refurbishment programmes.

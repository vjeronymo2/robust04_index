			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- With the  International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors' meeting  only a week away, the United States and North Korea may meet in  New York soon to resolve the deadlocked nuclear issue, a senior  South Korean Government official says.    "A recent statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry  spokesman that stressed the need to resolve the nuclear problem  is a very significant change," said the official Sunday.    "This (statement) is a big turnaround from the attitude  North  Korea has taken until now," the official said, asking that his  name be withheld. The statement heightened the possibility of  resolving the nuclear question through dialogue, he said.  [passage omitted]    Saturday's statement is a big departure from one issued on  Jan. 31, in which Pyongyang said it would not hesitate to leave  the NPT if the United States continued to press for a  comprehensive inspection of all seven nuclear facilities in  North Korea, the South Korean official said. The latest  statement can be viewed as an expression of North Korea's wish  to resolve the issue through dialogue, he said.    The South Korean Government plans to work with the United  States to help resolve the nuclear problem in the wake of the  North Korean statement, he said.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who has just visited  Washington for talks with U.S. Government leaders, also  evaluates the statement as an indication that North Korea has  "softened" its attitude.    Han, winding up his U.S. visit, noted that Pyongyang has  stressed its willingness to resume talks with the United States  and that the IAEA still wants to conduct inspections in order to  maintain continuity in nuclear safeguards in North Korea. These  developments have helped improve the outlook for resolving the  issue slightly, Han said.</p>

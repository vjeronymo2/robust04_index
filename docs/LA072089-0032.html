			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> SILVA'S STATURE GROWS IN WIN OVER SUN VALLEY  </P> <P> Although he stands just 5-foot-7 and weighs only 140 pounds, pitcher Oscar  Silva continues to baffle Sun Valley batters.  </P> <P> Silva, a right-hander who will be a junior at Canyon High, scattered seven hits  and struck out four as Newhall-Saugus defeated Sun Valley, 12-2, in a  first-round District 20 playoff game Wednesday at Pierce College.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, Silva (2-1) limited Sun Valley to three hits en route to a 8-3  win.  </P> <P> This time, Silva received support from 10 Newhall-Saugus hits and six Sun  Valley errors. The game was called after the seventh inning because of the  10-run rule.  </P> <P> Newhall-Saugus (18-5) broke a 2-2 tie by scoring seven runs in the fifth, three  of which came on a double down the first-base line by Scott Warr.  </P> <P> Harold Whiteside had tied the score for Sun Valley (13-10) in the previous  inning with a solo home run.  </P> <P> Whiteside and Marlon McKinney each had two hits and Abel Trujillo had three  hits to account for the Sun Valley offense.  </P> <P> Shad Martinez was tabbed with six of Newhall-Saugus' seven runs in the fifth as  well as the loss.  </P> <P> Newhall-Saugus will play Panorama City today at 4 p.m. at Birmingham High in  the double-elimination tournament.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Panorama City 3, Woodland Hills East 0 -- Right-hander Rolland De La Maza held  Woodland Hills East to three hits and struck out four to lift second-seeded  Panorama City in a first-round District 20 game at Birmingham High.  </P> <P> David Garcia, who reached base on a bunt single, scored on Shane Wight's triple  in the third. Herman Merchan drove in Adam Clark with a double in the sixth and  Joey Cascione singled home Garcia in the eighth.  </P> <P> Panorama City will play Newhall-Saugus today at 4 p.m. at Birmingham. Woodland  Hills East will play Sun Valley today at 4 p.m. at Pierce.  </P> <P> Encino-Crespi 4, Lancaster 2 -- Mark Venturine hit a single off Lancaster  pitcher Mark Hartman's leg with the bases loaded in the sixth inning to score a  run and help Encino-Crespi pull away in a first-round District 20 game at  Pierce College.  </P> <P> Fifth-seeded Encino-Crespi (14-9) scored on an error in the third and Victor  Seper's single in the fifth before Venturine's shot and Chris Romero's  sacrifice fly accounted for two in the sixth. Lancaster (15-8), seeded fourth,  scored in the fifth and sixth.  </P> <P> Pat Bennett, a right-hander who will be a senior at Crespi High, improved his  record to 5-2 with the win.  </P> <P> Dan Carroll collected his third save after Bennett walked the leadoff batter in  the ninth.  </P> <P> Crespi will play Woodland Hills West today at 12:30 p.m. at Birmingham High.  Lancaster will play Burbank today at 12:30 at Pierce.  </P> <P> Westlake-Agoura 8, Conejo 5 -- Dan Freedman and Mike Lieberthal each collected  two hits and two RBIs as Westlake rolled in a District 16 regular-season game  at Westlake High.  </P> <P> Westlake-Agoura (24-2-4), which has already clinched the district championship,  answered Conejo's two-run first inning with two runs in the first, two in the  second and three in the fourth.  </P> <P> Right-hander Bobby Kazmirski (5-0) scattered five hits and struck out five in  five innings. Left-hander Mike Goldstein cleaned up by striking out three and  allowing a hit in two innings of work.  </P> <P> Freedman, Lieberthal and Joey Medaglia each doubled for Westlake.  </P> <P> The game was called after seven innings because of darkness.  </P> <P> Brent Christenson doubled for Conejo (8-10). Christenson was Conejo's starting  pitcher and he was relieved by Mike Lee in the sixth.  </P> <P> Each team committed four errors.  </P></p>

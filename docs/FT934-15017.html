			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / US investors set to take big stake in Lloyd's agency A GROUP of US financial institutions is poised to acquire a substantial stake in the Merrett underwriting agency in a significant innovation for the Lloyd's insurance market. The Merrett group said yesterday it had approached Lloyd's with an outline plan to transfer its underwriting business to a new agency, in which JP Morgan, the investment bank, Marsh &amp; McLennan Risk Capital, a subsidiary of Marsh &amp; McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, Merrett employees and an unnamed US insurance company would own stakes. It is envisaged that the agency would underwrite business for a subsidiary of the same US insurance company, which would operate alongside Merrett's insurance syndicates on a so-called 'consortium' basis. Together, the insurance company and the syndicates would aim to maintain Merrett's insurance business at its existing levels. The move follows a sharp contraction in the capital base of the Merrett syndicates after the desertion this year of many Names, the individuals whose assets traditionally support Lloyd's. Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman of the Merrett group, has reduced his role in the agency after pressure from Names, and resigned as deputy chairman of Lloyd's last month. Mr Stephen Cane, managing director of the Merrett Group, said the new investors would 'probably' have a majority of the new agency. He insisted that the Merrett Group did not want to leave Lloyd's, but conceded that 'this is a significant departure for a typical Lloyd's underwriting operation'. The insurance company is a 'substantial and significant' US group. It could provide about a quarter of the Merrett agencies' capacity next year, Mr Cane said. More than three quarters of the business underwritten by Merrett syndicates comes from the US. Lloyd's said yesterday that it was 'considering proposals carefully. In so far as they require consent and approval from Lloyd's we shall be approaching consideration of these (matters) from the standpoint of the interests of Names on Merrett syndicates, whose interests are also recognised by the Merrett Group'. Although overseas interests have never before held control of a Lloyd's managing agency, it is understood that there is nothing in the regulatory framework to prohibit such a move. Marsh and Morgan agreed this year to form a new Bermuda-based company to reinsure business accepted by the Merrett syndicates. But the sudden decline in the fortunes of the Merrett Group this year had jeopardised the success of that plan. The group hopes to conclude talks on the new arrangements by the end of the month.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Nato bombs Serb-held airfield: Raid in Croatia launched as response to air attacks on Bihac enclave Nato aircraft yesterday carried out a heavy bombing raid on an airfield in Serb-held territory in Croatia, in the biggest military operation in the history of the Atlantic alliance. The operation, launched in response to Serb air attacks on the embattled Moslem enclave of Bihac in north Bosnia, involved 39 aircraft from the US, Britain, France and the Netherlands. US president Bill Clinton described the Nato action as a 'strong and entirely appropriate response' to the Serb assaults. 'It was the right thing to do,' he told reporters in Washington. Admiral Leighton Smith, the Nato commander for southern Europe who directed the operation, said the raid was successful and all aircraft had returned to their bases in Italy. He said the Udbina airfield - used by the Serbs as a base for two assaults on Bihac last week - had been put out of action, although the Serbs could repair it. The Nato force also struck at anti-aircraft installations and a missile site. In an apparent reference to the fact that no Serb aircraft was destroyed, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the top UN official in former Yugoslavia, described the Nato air raid as a 'limited action'. Nato's effort to police the skies over Bihac - in keeping with the 'no-fly zone' proclaimed by the UN - had been made impossible by the proximity of Udbina, only a few minutes' flying time from the enclave. Officials in the Serb-controlled area of Croatia claimed one person had been killed and seven wounded by the Nato raid which wrecked two villages near Udbina. Locals briefly took two Czech UN employees hostage in retaliation. In Belgrade, the government of rump Yugoslavia described the Nato operation as 'unprovoked and irresponsible' and said it would 'play into the hands of extremists and those who advocate a war option'. State-controlled Belgrade radio reported the Nato attack prominently and echoed the charge that villages had been damaged. The Serbian media have, since August, been virtually blacking out news from the war front in keeping with the more moderate line adopted by President Slobodan Milosevic. The raid, carried out by the Atlantic alliance after receiving a UN mandate, marked a dramatic act of international co-operation after a period in which the US and Europe had been at at odds over Bosnia. President Boris Yeltsin indicated that Russia accepted the need to take action against the Serb forces based in Croatia following their intervention in the fighting around Bihac. Germany welcomed the Nato operation and announced that the international contact group - the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - would convene on December 2 to consider further moves in Bosnia. Despite these signs of improving international co-operation, Mr Yeltsin said Russia and other European countries were still strongly opposed to the recent US decision to stop enforcing the arms embargo against Bosnia. Akashi said the Nato action was a 'necessary and proportionate response' to the air raids launched from Udbina last week in which napalm and cluster bombs were used. UN officials stressed that they had approved the operation on Sunday morning, hours after the passage of an emergency resolution by the UN Security Council. They said bad weather had apparently made it necessary for Nato to postpone going into action by one day.</p>

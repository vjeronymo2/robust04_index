			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Trade hopes take Nikkei 1.1% higher Hopes of a breakthrough for the US-Japan bilateral framework talks on trade, combined with an easing of the yen, prompted active buying. The Nikkei index advanced by 1.1 per cent, led by a rise in large-capital shares, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average rose 226.54 to 20,568.71, and the Topix index by 11.67 to 1,654.21. Profit-taking dropped the Nikkei to a low of 20,328.07 in the morning session, but buying emerged later as the yen fell to the Y104 level; the index rose to a high of 20,574.91 just before the close. Volume totalled 360m shares against 355m. Trading by arbitrageurs, overseas and domestic investors supported activity. The Nikkei 300 rose 2.13 to 302.50, gainers led losers by 621 to 380 with 179 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.52 to 1,355.04. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said that the strong rise in large capital stocks reflected buying by domestic institutions. However, whether the index can sustain its current level to rise further depends on the amount of trading volume, said another broker. Large capital steels and shipbuilders were traded heavily. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y3 to Y369, NKK gained Y10 to Y284 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advanced Y6 to Y714. Takuma, an industrial machinery maker, rose Y50 to Y1,660 on hopes of a rise in profits for the current business year to next March. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y16,000 to Y827,000 on continued selling. The stock has lost 7.2 per cent since the beginning of last week, before the government decided to freeze all planned increases in public sector prices, including a rise in local call rates on Wednesday. Non-life insurance companies, which were also lower on the freeze of the expected increase in fire insurance rates, rebounded. Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance rose Y10 to Y1,340 and Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance rose Y32 to Y863. Retailers were lower on profit-taking. The sector has been strong recently on hopes of a recovery in consumer confidence. However, economists expect that household spending data, due to be announced this week, will reflect continued sluggishness. Seiyu lost Y50 to Y1,370 and Nichii declined Y60 to Y1,490. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 111.94 to 22,619.59 in volume of 17.6m shares. Roundup A quiet session was seen in many Pacific Rim markets as investors awaited fresh incentives. SHANGHAI's B share index, however, rose 4.6 per cent as the renewed confidence that emerged last week brought local and foreign investors back as buyers. The index, which had fallen by 40 per cent since the beginning of the year, rose 3.06 to 70.24 in heavy volume of 14.3m shares, against a recent daily average of 6m. MANILA shrugged off last week's worries and advanced 1.8 per cent on aggressive buying of blue chips. The composite index rose 51.85 to 2,922.17 in volume that eased to 751.4m shares from Friday's 1.5bn. HONG KONG saw profit-taking erase early gains and the Hang Seng index, 141 points higher at one stage, ended 41.85 lower at 9,589.78. Turnover tumbled from HKDollars 7.36bn. to HKDollars 4.22bn. HSBC topped the active list and gained 50 cents to HKDollars 91. It was followed by Cheung Kong, which lost 50 cents to HKDollars 39.25, as the group denied press reports that it was bidding for London's Broadgate office complex. SYDNEY revived during the afternoon to close firmer on a buoyant gold sector. The All Ordinaries index closed up 17.1 at 2,121.0, while the gold marker rose 68.8 or 3.1 per cent to 2,314.1 after the rise in the bullion price. Among gold stocks, Placer Pacific leapt 24 cents to ADollars 3.09, Samantha rose 30 cents to ADollars 5.30 and Newcrest jumped 21 cents to ADollars 6.82. TAIPEI was lightly lower in slow, narrow trade , as investors remained on the sidelines after a week of falls. Brokers said that the market was ripe for a technical rebound after the weighted index lost 13.50 to 5,817.68, turnover falling to TDollars 31.14bn from Saturday's TDollars 32.52bn. BOMBAY was lower in very quiet trade in response to last week's refusal by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to dilute tough conditions for the resumption of the badla, or carry forward system of trading. The BSE 30-share index closed 46.44 lower at 3,737.23. SEOUL was easier for the third consecutive session in mixed trading with persistent blue chip consolidation overshadowing the market. The composite index lost 0.69 to 945.50. SINGAPORE was mixed in sluggish trading ahead of a market holiday tomorrow and the Straits Times Industrials index rose 2.30 to 2,339.31. JAKARTA was in bullish mood with foreign and local investors buying heavily across a range of stocks and the JKSE index rose 10.37 to 498.36. KUALA LUMPUR finished easier after another dull session as lack of fresh factors depressed investors. The composite index closed 2.06 lower at 999.10 in volume of 68.7m shares. BANGKOK was marginally higher in thin trade as most investors remained on the sidelines because of a lack of direction. The SET index closed 0.40 up at 1,338.59 in turnover that shrank to Bt6.2bn after Friday's Bt9.5bn as institutional investors slow down their buying.</p>

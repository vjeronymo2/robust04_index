			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF warns of loss Thomson-CSF, the state-controlled French defence electronics company, yesterday warned that it would report a loss for 1993 because of its 21.6 per cent stake in Credit Lyonnais, the troubled banking group, writes Alice Rawsthorn. The company, which made net profits of FFr1.52bn (Dollars 250m) in 1992, said that it made a 'very good' operating profit in 1993. However, it has been tipped into the red by its share of the FFr6.9bn net loss sustained last year by Credit Lyonnais. The bank has unveiled details of a rescue package, including a FFr1.2bn capital increase. Thomson-CSF will be expected to participate in the Credit Lyonnais rescue. The capital for the package will be provided by the Thomson group, which is Thomson-CSF's parent company. Thomson is considering financing the capital increase by selling up to 8.3 per cent of its 58.3 per cent holding in the defence electronics concern.</p>

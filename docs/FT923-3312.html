			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Books: Tudor soap opera THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII by Antonia Fraser Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 479 pages DIVORCED beheaded died, divorced beheaded survived': as every schoolchild knows, Henry VIII's wives did not have enviable fates. The story of Prince Charming turned Bluebeard, the king who murdered his way through six spouses, is among the most gory and sexy in history. Chills and thrills remain in each re-telling, but what more is there to say? There is nothing new here. Antonia Fraser fleshes out the tale with guesses so fevered and intimate that her book is less history than imaginary portraiture. Queen I, Catherine of Aragon, reigned twice as long as the other five put together, so records are at least sufficient for speculation to be viable. But four of Henry's short-lived wives were commoners about whom nothing - not even their age - is known until the moment he noticed them. Fraser can only exaggerate sketchy stereotypes - Anne Boleyn as cunning temptress, Jane Seymour as docile sweetie-pie. 'Did the earth move for them? . . . the celebrated ultimate conjunction did not actually represent much sexual novelty for either King or Lady', she presumes when Anne Boleyn becomes queen. A historian's trade is inspired guesswork, but it depends on absolute grasp of context. Fraser's old-fashioned, personality-dominated history is flat and wooden because the contemporary world view - the cultural, religious, political ideas which stamped each queen - is woefully missing. Ironically, social historians (Lawrence Stone, Gertrude Himmelfarb) out-thrill her by allowing personality and salacious detail to come alive in their correct setting. Here, lumpen inventories of jewels and costumes stand in for period authenticity. Fraser's queens are 'victims of their biological destiny.' But what about social factors? The commoner wives fell - as they do in the 1990s - because they misunderstood royal rules; the foreign princesses, Catherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves, knowing about royal survival, kept heads and fortunes. Fraser has written on many monarchs. This book joins the recent crop of quasi-feminist biographies arguing independent identities for famous wives. But it is not the separate personalities that compel here; rather, the terrifying mix of individual characteristics and political position, pedigree and likely fertility which determined life for men and women alike in the 16th century. This was the age when children's births and deaths dictated their parents' foreign policy; when lonely teenagers went as ambassadors to marry abroad; when new alliances were dangled as old spouses lay on their deathbeds. Renaissance love and marriage are fascinating because people are pawns; to turn it into Tudor soap opera is both historical and literary misjudgment.</p>

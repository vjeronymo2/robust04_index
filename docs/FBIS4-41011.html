			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gleb Cherkasov under the "Initiative" rubric: </F> "Dudayev Ready To Meet With Yeltsin in Person. People's  Diplomacy As Means of Solving Interethnic Conflicts"]    [Text] Shmidt Dzoblayev, general secretary of the Assembly  of North Caucasus Democratic Forces, told journalists yesterday  about his experience of shuttle diplomacy in establishing  contacts between Chechen Republic President Dzhokhar Dudayev and  Russian President Boris Yeltsin. According to Mr. Dzoblayev, he  was visited Chechnya 13-15 June to hold talks with the  republic's top officials, including President Dzhokhar Dudayev.  Shmidt Dzoblayev said that Dzhokhar Dudayev is ready for  personal talks with Boris Yeltsin, but he insisted that the  meeting be held without mediators, meaning the State Committee  for Nationalities Policy, which was earlier headed and is  currently supervised by Sergey Shakhray, "the enemy of the  Chechen people," and also the President's Administration for  Work With Territories, where Doka Zavgayev, former first  secretary of the Chechen-Ingush Communist Party organization,  currently holds a job. The Chechen president's proposals were  passed by Mr. Dzoblayev to Boris Yeltsin through Sergey Filatov  and Georgiy Satarov. According to Mr. Dzoblayev, the Chechen  president counts on Boris Yeltsin's goodwill despite "the  unwillingness of certain forces in Russia to reach accord." Mr.  Dzoblayev assured journalists that Chechnya wants to have  treaty-based relations with the Russian Federation.    Unfortunately, the leader of the North Caucasus democratic  forces could not shed light on how precisely the Chechen  Republic is going to straighten out its relations with Russia --  whether this will be an agreement between two independent states  or whether it will be modeled on the treaty between the Russian  Federation and Tatarstan. However, Mr. Dzoblayev said, the  Chechnya leaders plan to request guarantees that the republic's  citizens be granted immunity from political reprisals by the  Russian authorities; in addition, Chechnya fully supports the  idea of creating "a CIS defense shield." He noted in particular  that according to high-ranking Chechen officials, Dzhokhar  Dudayev "sees himself as a Russian officer and is proud of it."    As for the geopolitical situation in the region, Mr.  Dzoblayev pointed out that many people are concerned by attempts  to squeeze Russia out of the Caucasus, something in which  Britain is taking a particularly active part, Chechen Republic  leaders think. In addition, Shmidt Dzoblayev expressed his  regret that the leaders of the North Caucasus republics meet  with each other only with Moscow's mediation.    Apparently in order to prop up "state diplomacy" Shmidt  Dzoblayev and his colleagues are planning to set up 25 June an  Assembly of National-Democratic and Patriotic Forces of Russia,  which will include various public and political organizations  from the republics within the Russian Federation, the Russian  Movement for Democratic Reform, and also the Assembly of North  Caucasus Democratic Forces. In Mr. Dzoblayev's words, the new  organization's activity may become a new level of people's  diplomacy aimed at settling interethnic disputes.</p>

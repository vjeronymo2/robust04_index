			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / 'Twere well it were done quickly: A timely increase in US interest rates could safeguard long-term economic growth Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has put the world on notice. It is no longer a question of whether US short-term interest rates are going up, but when. By referring on Monday to current rates as 'abnormally low' and by talking of the need to move to a 'more neutral stance', he may appear to have left his options open. But for Mr Greenspan, a master of opaque language, this was clarity itself. In congressional testimony this week he was sending the White House and financial markets an unmistakable signal. For the first time in five years, the direction of US monetary policy is changing: the Fed, the US central bank, is preparing the ground for an increase in short-term interest rates. The discount rate was last raised - from 6.5 per cent to 7.0 per cent - in February 1989. The key federal funds rate - the rate at which banks borrow from each other - peaked at just under 10 per cent in March 1989. By the late summer of 1990, when the economy slipped into recession, the fed funds rates had been cut to just over 8 per cent. The following two years saw a sharp decline in the cost of money, with the discount rate - the largely-symbolic rate at which banks can borrow from the Fed - and the fed funds rate falling to 3 per cent by September 1992. Official rates have not moved since - the longest period of stability for 30 years. But nothing lasts for ever. This April will mark the third anniversary of the end of what was, in retrospect, a mild recession. The economy is now growing strongly. In the fourth quarter of last year real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 5.9 per cent. Nobody expects that supercharged rate of expansion to be sustained. Indeed, in the short run, the Los Angeles earthquake and exceptionally cold weather last month may artificially depress spending and production. More relevant to the Fed is that the annual rate of growth has averaged nearly 3.5 per cent for two years. And far from slackening, the recovery still appears to be gaining momentum as the benign effects of lower long-term interest rates spread through the economy. But why should the Fed regard robust growth, in itself, as a pretext for raising short-term interest rates? Isn't President Bill Clinton right to argue that, since inflationary pressures are subdued, there is no need to tighten monetary policy and risk choking off the recovery? The Fed concedes that inflation to date has been well behaved. The 'core' consumer price index (which excludes volatile components such as food and energy) was up only 3.1 per cent between the fourth quarters of 1992 and 1993, the lowest annual increase since the early 1970s. The fixed-weight GDP deflator (a broader and probably more accurate guide to underlying inflation) rose at an annual rate of just over 2 per cent in the second half of last year. Unit labour costs are also rising at about this rate, reflecting the positive impact of unusually strong productivity growth. But Mr Greenspan does not regard the current inflation rate as an appropriate guide to monetary policy for two reasons. First, interest rates were cut to the unusually low level of 3 per cent - effectively zero in real terms - for a specific reason: to ease enormous strains on the balance sheets of banks, companies and households following an unsustainable build-up of debt in the late 1980s and a subsequent weakening of real estate prices. For a couple of years, the financial health of the US banking system was in the balance. Today, US banks are highly profitable, having restored their capital ratios to prudent levels. Companies and households have reduced their debt burdens and are borrowing again. It is difficult to argue that the monetary accommodation essential during the 'credit crunch' is still appropriate. Mr Greenspan's second argument for higher rates is that inflation is a lagging indicator. He told Congress: 'By the time inflation pressures are evident, many imbalances that are costly to rectify have already developed, and only harsh monetary therapy can restore the financial stability necessary to sustain growth. This situation regrettably has arisen too often in the past.' In other words, the Fed wants to stay ahead of the game. Mr Clinton's observation that inflation is not now a problem is thus beside the point. Since changes in monetary policy take effect over a period of 12-18 months, the Fed has to consider the outlook for inflation in the second half of next year. If growth continues for another 18 months at the 3.5 per cent level registered in the past two years, capacity constraints probably will be biting by then, causing quite strong upward pressure on US domestic prices and wages, regardless of what is happening in the rest of the world. This could be so even if corporate restructuring has raised the US's long-term potential rate of growth. Conventional estimates suggest the potential growth rate is 2.0-2.5 per cent. This may be too pessimistic, but no credible forecaster believes it is more than 3 per cent. Excess capacity is thus disappearing. If the Fed does tighten policy, it will not be trying to choke off recovery but rather to safeguard what many observers (including Mr Greenspan) describe as the most promising long-term economic outlook in two or three decades. The US is enjoying a spontaneous business-led recovery. Because the federal budget deficit was so large at the end of the 1980s, fiscal reflation was not an option for either the Bush or Clinton administrations. Private capital formation rather than government purchases or consumer spending is thus at the cutting edge of this recovery. Last year business fixed investment rose 15 per cent in real terms - and it was not all computers. Excluding computers, business investment rose 8 per cent in real terms. Since the end of the recession, investment has contributed a larger share of economic growth than in any upturn in the past 30 years. The restoration of 'animal spirits' reflects the decline in long-term interest rates which in turn reflects the drop in inflation expectations since the late 1980s, supported by the Clinton administration's efforts to cut the federal deficit. The still imponderable question is how soon and how aggressively the Fed will raise rates. One view is that Mr Greenspan would not have sent so clear a signal if the Fed were not planning early action, perhaps soon after the meeting today and tomorrow of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policymaking body. But the consensus view on Wall Street is that the Fed will not act until March or April. Long-time observers of the bond market, such as Mr Henry Kaufman, believe Mr Greenspan lacks an immediate justification for action and is in only the early stages of a process of 'conditioning' US politicians to the need for higher rates. On this view the Fed will issue several further warnings and quite possibly delay action until well into the second quarter. Since the risk of a surge in inflation is slight, it seems safe to assume that any increase in rates will be gradual. Mr Greenspan was a 'gradualist' during the recession, favouring quarter- or half-point cuts in rates. He is likely to favour the same strategy on the way up. And his influence on timing may be enhanced by the vacuum created by the unexpected resignation this week of Mr David Mullins, the Fed vice-chairman. There are now two vacancies on the Fed's seven-member board and Mr Clinton is notoriously slow in making appointments. The timetable of rate increases, of course, will depend on trends in inflation and in the real economy. But a reasonable expectation is that short-term rates will rise to 4 per cent by the end of this year and 5 per cent by the end of 1995. One prediction seems safe. The sooner the Fed acts, the smaller will be the overall increase in interest rates in this economic cycle. This is because early action would nip inflationary pressures in the bud. If action is timely, the impact on long-term rates and hence on business investment will be modest. And the healthy expansion now under way could then be sustained for several more years.</p>

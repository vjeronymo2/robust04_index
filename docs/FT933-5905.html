			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / 'Fiddling' bias draws fire THERE IS one law for the rich who fiddle their taxes and another for the poor who fiddle their social security payments, Ms Dee Cook, a lecturer at the Department of Criminology at Keele University, told the British Association meeting. She said the scale of social security fraud was dwarfed by tax evasion, yet more staff and resources went towards policing benefit claimants than taxpayers. Ms Cook said figures for money 'saved' by DSS investigators represented an actuarial amount rather than an actual sum. Fraud officers multiply a fraudster's weekly benefit payments by 32 (the notional number of weeks the fraudulent claim may have lasted) to arrive at the sum the DSS says it has saved. Using this formula the DSS said it had saved Pounds 416m in 1991-92. But in 1991-92 the Inland Revenue's investigation work yielded Pounds 4.9bn, equivalent to between 2p and 3p on the basic rate of income tax. There were 4,379 prosecutions for benefit fraud in 1991-92 compared with 249 for tax fraud. Ms Cook said that in contrast to the high-profile crackdown on DSS fraud, there had been little attempt to direct popular attention or additional resources to the 'burgeoning problem of tax evasion'. She added: 'Recent figures of yields from compliance work show an unrelenting increase which on the one hand shows the effectiveness of the investigating officers involved, but on the other hand indicates an underlying disregard for tax law.' In spite of this, she said, tax evaders were seen as victims of harassment by the Revenue while benefit fraudsters were simply villains.  ----------------------------------- Money raised by Revenue's detection of tax evasion  ----------------------------------- 1989-90       Pounds 2.874bn 1990-91       Pounds 3.884bn 1991-92       Pounds 4.905bn  ----------------------------------- Estimate of benefit savings from DSS investigations 1987-88       Pounds 196m 1991-92       Pounds 416m  ----------------------------------- Sources: Inland Revenue and DSS  -----------------------------------</p>

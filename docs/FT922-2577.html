			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Venture financing recovers slowly THE VENTURE capital market in the west Midlands is slowly recovering, but most finance is directed at corporate restructuring, particularly management buy-outs, fund managers have reported. Mr Alan Lewis, regional director of County NatWest Ventures, said higher demand for development capital as companies sought equity to finance expansion out of recession - a trend expected since the general election - had not taken place to any marked degree. That indicated 'the recovery is a slow and painful process at best'. 3i, the UK's largest venture capital group, has seen its activity decline since the pre-election period, although it is committing more funds to management buyouts. Mr Chris Rowlands, Birmingham director of 3i, said this meant 'our activity is very strong, but it is not an accurate reflection of underlying economic activity'. Only 10 per cent of a Pounds 20m fund set up by 3i last August for small inner-city businesses in the west Midlands had been taken up. Most of the management buyouts were deals of up to Pounds 10m.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Race was hurdle at Cheltenham THE Liberal Democrat gain in Cheltenham and the defeat of the black Conservative candidate, Mr John Taylor, follows one of the Tories' most damaging constituency rows over the last few years. Mr Taylor would have been the Conservatives' first black MP and was seen as a standard-bearer of Mr Major's classless society. The loss of Cheltenham is likely to fuel further discord within the local Conservative party. The selection of Mr Taylor, a 38-year old barrister, last December after the retirement of Sir Charles Irving, was highly controversial and led to a split within the local conservative organisation. While he was supported by the constituency chairman, who said he was an outstanding candidate, a minority opposed him on the basis that he was not local. Mr Taylor was subsequently subjected to personal criticism widely considered to have been motivated by prejudice. Eventually, Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, felt obliged to give Mr Taylor an unprecedented personal endorsement. He was selected from 254 applicants and a shortlist of 22 who were interviewed by the executive committee. The seat is one that the Liberal Democrats have targeted for many years. Mr Nigel Jones, the Liberal Democrat candidate, said last night the campaign had been clean and fought on national issues. However, the Liberal Democrats did stress during the campaign that Mr Jones was a local. They won 47 per cent of the vote; Conservatives 45 per cent; and Labour 6 per cent. The Liberal Democrat vote increased by 5 per cent while the Conservative vote fell by the same amount. Mr Colin Lear, a local member who challenged Mr Taylor's selection, said last year that his opposition had nothing to do with his colour, but was because Mr Taylor would lose the election. Sir Charles had a majority of 4,896 over the Liberal Democrats. Mr Taylor said last night that he was very disappointed but was not going to start making any allegations of racism. 'I feel I had the right background to represent Cheltenham,' Mr Taylor insisted.</p>

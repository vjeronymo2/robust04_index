Currently in The Hague on an official visit and addressing a  group of foreign reporters, Cetin said Turkey has sent troops to  Korea and Somalia and he sees no reason why it should not send  any to Bosnia.    He said Turkey wants peace and stability in the Balkans,  underlining the fact that a plan to reach peace in Bosnia and  proposed 20 months ago was refused.    "It was later understood that Turkey was right in its point  of view, but it was too late," Cetin said.    Turkey was since the start of the conflict favoring limited  military air intervention in Bosnia.    Answering reporters' question on terrorism, Cetin said in  Turkey there is no such thing as a "Turkish-Kurdish problem,"  citing as example the northern Iraqi Kurds.    "Who else except Turkey helps the Kurds in northern Iraq,"  he  said adding Kurdish origin Turkish citizens would escape to  Holland and not other Turkish provinces, if there was such a  problem.    On Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] issue, he said Greece should refrain from escalating the  tension, adding the embargo imposed on the former cannot be  compared to the ones imposed to Iraq or Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Last week Greece announced it would let only humanitarian  supplies of food and medicine across the border with FYROM and  would deny its neighbour the use of the port of Salonika.    Cetin said Turkey will provide humanitarian help to FYROM  and  try to meet its need for oil, adding it is not sending that  country any arms, artillery or soldiers.    Foreign Ministry spokesman told the press on Wednesday  Turkey  will give gasoline and diesel fuel to the FYROM at favorable  prices to meet its vital and urgent needs, adding Turkish sea  ports will be opened to the FYROM's sea transportation.    On the Cyprus issue, he said Turkey favours a lasting and  just peace, to be reached by way of dialogue, adding both sides  should not be influenced by provocations from other countries.</p>

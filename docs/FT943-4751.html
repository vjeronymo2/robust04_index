			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Gaskell Gaskell, the carpet manufacturing group, announced a fall in pre-tax profits for the six months to July 1, down from Pounds 393,000 to Pounds 24,000. However, turnover was ahead at Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 14.3m), and the company described its fortunes as improving; the 1993 interim pre-tax figure was struck after an excep-tional payment of Pounds 913,000 for assets destroyed by fire (nil). The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p. Earnings came out at 0.2p (5.2p), or 0.2p against losses of 13.6p excluding the exceptional payment.</p>

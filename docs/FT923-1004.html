			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Court pitches Collor's fate into Congress PRESIDENT Fernando Collor's fight for survival moved into the political arena yesterday, the Brazilian Supreme Court having closed all possibility of delaying the Congressional vote next week on whether he is to face an impeachment process. His last hope of winning more time to defend himself was dashed on Wednesday night when six of the nine court judges rejected his appeal. The court also ruled that the vote will be secret, a further blow to Mr Collor. He was described by aides as 'shaken'. He might be out of office - suspended from duty during the process - as early as next Tuesday. The president is increasingly isolated and his only remaining chance is to prevent the opposition mustering the two-thirds (336 members) of the House of Representatives needed to initiate an impeachment process. Mr Etewaldo Dias, his spokesman, admitted: 'We have lost the legal battle. We now have to win in the political arena.' The Supreme Court ruling was welcomed by the opposition and described by Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, chairman of the House, as 'a victory for Brazil's institutions'. Large street celebrations were held in several Brazilian cities. The financial markets reacted positively to the news, which could mean a rapid end to the four-month crisis. The main Sao Paulo stock exchange index closed 11.9 per cent up yesterday after very heavy trading. Pro-impeachment demonstrations suggest public opinion is heavily against Mr Collor but he claims to have enough Congressional support to survive. The opposition argues that it has 360 votes - more than enough to win. Mr Collor's chances have been weakened by the court decision. He has suffered a further blow with the suspension by a federal judge of all spending by the Banco do Brasil Foundation, a state-owned funding agency. This has been one of the president's main sources of funds for securing Congressional support. Over the last two months, the foundation has granted 99 spending requests from politicians. Legal suits are also in hand to suspend the president of the national savings bank, one of Mr Collor's main political allies, for alleged use of social security money for political ends. Mr Roberto Jefferson, a key member of Mr Collor's so-called 'shock battalion', said the government's strategy would now be obstruction. The pro-Collor forces could move their Congress members out of Braslia in an attempt to make meetings inquorate. Mr Jefferson met Mr Collor yesterday to demand a cabinet reshuffle. Accusing Mr Celio Borja, justice minister, and Mr Francisco Gros, central bank governor, of 'stabbing Collor in the back', he said, 'either we govern with loyal people or we won't win the vote.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Last-minute negotiations  to bring Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the European  Union [EU] faltered here Tuesday [22 February] because of  disputes over money, farm prices, truck pollution and fish.    French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said there  was "one chance in two" that the two sides would meet their  March 1 deadline for completing the negotiations so that the  candidates can join the Union next January 1.    Austria refused to accept EU demands that it shorten an  11-year accord which restricts polluting truck traffic across  the Austrian Alps and would contravene the Union's regulations  on free movement.    The candidate countries gave a cool reception to a Brussels  compromise whereby European Community funds would boost  development in sparsely-populated Arctic areas but to a lesser  extent than in poor areas in existing EC countries.    Finland and Norway protested that this was not good enough,  since these areas would get 10 percent less than struggling  regions of existing EC members despite the special problems of  Arctic farmers.    "We are not pleased with the EC position on Nordic  agriculture," Norway's Trade and Shipping Minister Grete  Knudsen, told journalists.    Some EC countries, particularly Spain, opposed the  applicants' pleading for special treatment and exemptions from  the Union's trade and aid regulations.    The EC countries could not agree on demands from Spain and  Portugal for access to Norway's fish-rich waters. France and  Ireland insisted on curbs against imports of cheap Norwegian  fish.    "Fish will occupy us right up to the end of negotiations  unless the god of the sea, Poseidon, helps us and that would be  a miracle," said Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros  Pangalos, who is chairing the negotiations.    Brussels turned down Sweden's demand that it be allowed to  gradually phase in annual payments of around 857 million dollars  a year to the EU budget over five years, instead of being liable  immediately on entering the Union.    All sides are pushing for maximum advantage as the year-long  negotiations approach their climax at a marathon negotiating  session next weekend, with the hardest issues still unresolved.    Finnish Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen was upbeat.  "We have moved forward today quite considerably," he said.    But Austrian Transport Minister Viktor Klima warned that the  talks could collapse if the EC insisted on loosening  restrictions on trans-Alpine truck traffic through Austria in  accordance with its rules on free movement.    He said the Austrian position had been strengthened by a  referendum in Switzerland last Sunday where a majority of voters  decided that all foreign truck traffic should be put on trains  after 2004.    Pangalos suggested that the two sides might find a  compromise  date to terminate the trans-Alpine accord some time after 1997,  the date suggested by the EC, but before it expires officially  on December 31, 2003.    Austria, Finland and Norway all objected to Brussels'  insistence that they lower their heavily-subsidised agricultural  prices to EC levels in one fell swoop upon entering the Union.    The applicant countries are asking that the high prices,  necessary to subsidise farmers in icy and low-yielding Arctic  and Alpine regions, be phased out gradually, and that the EC  help to compensate farmers for the change.    Austria and Finland announced one major concession. They  agreed that any local restrictions on the purchase of holiday  homes would have to be non-discriminatory, so that they apply to  locals as well as foreigners.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ACLU WINS COURT ORDER TO PREVENT ABORTION BLOCKADE;  </P> <P> FEDERAL JUDGE ACTS IN FACE OF THREATENED PROTEST ACTION  </P> <P> Hoping to thwart protests planned in San Diego this weekend by anti-abortion  activists, ACLU officials have obtained a federal court order to prevent  protesters from blockading medical clinics where abortions are performed.  </P> <P> Officials of American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, including  those from San Diego and Imperial counties, said they obtained a statewide  preliminary injunction from U. S. District Court Judge A. Wallace Tashima in  Los Angeles on Monday. The action was in anticipation of anti-abortion protests  targeted for one or more clinics in the San Diego area Saturday.  </P> <P> ACLU officials said they will ask Tashima to levy fines of up to $10,000  against any protester violating the injunction, said Betty Wheeler, legal  director of the ACLU Foundation of San Diego and Imperial counties.  </P> <P> "The ACLU of San Diego and Imperial counties is taking legal steps, in  conjunction with the ACLU of Southern California, to make sure that all women  in San Diego County will be able to exercise their constitutional right to  reproductive choice . . .," Wheeler said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Vigorously Pursue Proceedings'  </P> <P> "The ACLU will vigorously pursue contempt proceedings against those persons who  . . . deprive others of their constitutional rights," she said.  </P> <P> Under the preliminary injunction, demonstrators will be barred from trespassing  or forming blockades on the property of medical facilities that perform  abortions and other family-planning services. They will also be banned from  conducting so-called sidewalk counseling, which the clinics claim is a tactic  to impede the movement of their patients.  </P> <P> Saturday's protest will be sponsored by Project Rescue in San Diego, a local  branch of the national group called Operation Rescue. The national group gained  widespread attention for its practice of forming human blockades to prevent  women from entering clinics, as well as for its participants' willingness to go  to jail for their cause.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Abortion Clinics Closed  </P> <P> More than 500 Operation Rescue activists were responsible for closing two  abortion clinics in Los Angeles in February, and another protest is scheduled  there from March 22 to 25.  </P> <P> To prevent such closures of San Diego clinics, ACLU officials said they decided  to seek the court order to make sure women will not be barred from medical  services this weekend, Wheeler said.  </P> <P> The ACLU chapters sought the order on behalf of medical providers such as  Planned Parenthood and Womancare, Wheeler said. Other states have used such  orders to ensure that women have full access to clinics, she said.  </P> <P> San Diego clinics are also planning to have volunteer guards on hand to escort  women through protesters and into the medical offices, said Patricia O'Neil,  associate director of Womancare.  </P> <P> Despite the federal court order, Project Rescue officials have said they will  continue their efforts to discourage women from obtaining abortions.  </P> <P> "In order to stop the slaughter of unborn babies from conception to birth,  those participating in Project Rescue will passively, repentantly and  peacefully block the entrances of abortion clinics with their bodies," San  Diego organization leaders stated in a press release.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rescue Efforts 'Not Militant'  </P> <P> The Rev. Mick McCoy, pastor of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship of East San  Diego County and one of the clerics involved in Project Rescue, said Tuesday  that the group's efforts are "not militant."  </P> <P> "It's a peaceful, nonviolent attempt to stop the murder of unborn children," he  said, distinguishing his group from more militant anti-abortion activists.  </P> <P> McCoy could not say if the preliminary injunction would prevent some  anti-abortion activists, most of whom are Christians, from joining the protest  Saturday. But he said it is a "shame" for those who want to protect an "unborn  child from death to receive a criminal charge for that."  </P> <P> O'Neil of Womancare disputed the assertion that the blockades and sidewalk  counseling against medical clinics have been peaceful.  </P> <P> "Across the nation, it's not been anyone's experience that they are peaceful  protesters," O'Neil said. "It's violence against women who are being publicly  humiliated for a decision."  </P> <P> Lenore Lowe, director of community affairs for Planned Parenthood of San Diego  and Riverside counties, said it is a "miscalculation on the part of Operation  Rescue organizers that the public will stand for such action. . . . Women  resent someone else making this a public issue."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Hundred Expected  </P> <P> Project Rescue organizers said they expect several hundred anti-abortion  activists to attend a rally on Friday at the Youth for Christ Conference Center  in Mission Valley, where the primary speaker will be Joe Schiedler, author of  "99 Ways to Stop Abortion."  </P> <P> Participants won't be informed of the targeted clinic or clinics until the next  morning, said Rick Monroe, publisher of "Good News, Etc," a San Diego County  Christian newspaper.  </P> <P> According to Operation Rescue statistics, more than 22,000 protesters have been  arrested in more than 20 cities in the United States during protests, most of  whom have been released after a day or so in jail.  </P> <P> ACLU officials, however, hope their federal injunction will "up the ante" and  discourage the protesters from blocking entrances to the clinics.  </P> <P> An Operation Rescue supporter said the large fines stemming from the court  order won't make a difference to protesters.  </P> <P> "It (protesting) was illegal before and it's still illegal now," said an  assistant in the Operation Rescue office in Los Angeles who gave her first name  as Angela. "Nobody pays the fine anyway. We'd rather do jail time than pay the  fine," she said.  </P> <P> But organizers for Project Rescue in San Diego say the goal of their protest  "is not to be arrested, but to save women from being exploited . . . and to  protect the life of the unborn," McCoy said.  </P> <P> "If that means putting ourselves physically between the child and the  abortionists, then so be it."  </P></p>

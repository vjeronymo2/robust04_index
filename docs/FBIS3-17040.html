He  commented the memorandum of March 16 on the delay of the  construction of the terminal. The memorandum was addressed to  the President Algirdas Brazauskas by the Union of Motherland  /Lithuanian Conservatives/.    Vaisnoras said a lot of political groups were interested  that  the object of vital importance to Lithuania was not built. In  recent times, ways of development of Liepaja oil terminal are  often discussed. He said these ways were unacceptable as an  alternative because Latvian-Russian political relations became  complicated and oil artery from Russia may be broken off.    Eimantas Dragunevicius, chairman of energy committee of  Motherland' Union, who also participated in the news conference,  said that Lithuania's situation in energy is worse than  Estonia's or Latvia's, that's why the problem of the terminal is  so important.    Dragunevicius also criticized intentions of the Ministry of  Energy to privatize five biggest objects of Lithuanian energy  system. It should not be done until the property is not indexed.</p>

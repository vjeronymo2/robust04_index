			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAY INCREASES AT SADDLEBACK COLLEGE  </P> <P> There they go again. At their meeting of Feb. 6, the Saddleback College  District trustees voted to grant healthy salary increases for 1988-89 to  administrators, while some instructional programs are still on a strict diet.  </P> <P> The 4.7% cost of living increase (retroactive to July 1, 1988) probably  reflects the actual inflation in this area. But in addition, the trustees voted  a $200-per-month car allowance for all "Category 1 vice-presidents." An outside  observer might reasonably conclude from the trustees' actions that the  Saddleback College District budget is plump and will likely remain so (salary  adjustments are permanent fixtures in all future budgets).  </P> <P> But in the Saddleback College reading program, the picture painted by the  administration is quite different: The reading lab, where students are required  to improve their skills as part of their course work, has had to be closed all  afternoons and Fridays. The reason: no funds to pay for a lab instructor to  help students. It is the same old story in many school districts: plenty of  money for management, while funds for direct instruction are lacking. The  trustees claim they are only bringing the Saddleback District administrative  salaries and perks in line with those of our neighboring colleges. Can we  suppose that the reasoning is that if their administrative spending is bloated,  ours should also be at least as bloated as theirs?  </P> <P> We certainly have no objection to cost-of-living increases for employees of the  district, but the trustees' priorities are certainly open to question when they  grant $200-per-month car allowances to vice presidents who already earn more  than the highest paid professor with 30 years of service.  </P> <P> ROBERT KOPFSTEIN  </P> <P> SUSAN MUSGROVE  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / World Trade News: EU declares end to row over bananas The European Commission yesterday announced that its long-running dispute with Latin American countries over banana imports to the European Union was over. It said the EU would increase its current 2m-tonne annual quota for Latin American bananas to 2.1m tonnes this year and 2.2m tonnes next year. In return, Costa Rica has joined Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela in agreeing not to pursue its complaint to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade about the EU's preferential banana trade with former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP). Guatemala is pressing its complaint, which has been upheld by a Gatt panel, but the Commission decided to go ahead with the deal anyway since Guatemala accounts for only 1.5 per cent of the market. The deal still has to be approved by member states, some of whom, led by Germany, are unhappy with the Commission's handling of the dispute and want EU banana trade to be more open. Germany, which had special permission under the Treaty of Rome to allow free access for Latin American bananas to its market, has taken a case to the European Court against the new EU banana regime introduced last July. It disputes member states' right to have approved the regime, which imposed EU-wide import tariffs on Latin American bananas, by a qualified majority. Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, warned agriculture ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday that failure to back the deal with the Latin Americans could endanger the Uruguay Round Gatt deal, due to be signed in Marrakesh next month. Under yesterday's deal, the Commission agreed to reduce the tariff charged on Latin American bananas within the quota to Ecu 75 a tonne from Ecu 100. This was a concession to Costa Rica, one of the biggest suppliers to the EU. It is granting specific quotas to the four countries based on their past share of the EU market - 23.4 per cent to Costa Rica, 21 per cent to Colombia, 3 per cent to Nicaragua and 2 per cent to Venezuela. The governments of those countries will also be able to grant export licences, a move aimed at encouraging producer co-operatives to sell direct to the EU for a better price, rather than through the multinationals.</p>

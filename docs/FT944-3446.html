			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: British Thornton Sega, the Japanese computer games group, has informed British Thornton Holdings that it will not be renewing its exclusive distribution contract when it expires next March. BTH said the terms required to secure renewal would not have provided it with a satisfactory return, adding that it believed longer-term market volumes in the video games industry would continue to decline. BTH said its trading results for the year to April 30 1995 would not be materially affected by the termination of the contract.</p>

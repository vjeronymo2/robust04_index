			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Rush to give blacks a share of capitalist cake: Attempts to dismantle economic apartheid 'Nationalise the mines,' says the election manifesto. 'Take the country's wealth out of minority hands and give it to the people.' The slogans may have a contemporary ring in South Africa, but they come from a 1948 pamphlet published by the National party in the year it came to power. Big business panicked, realised the need for Afrikaner stakeholders in the private sector, and rapidly sold off big chunks of the economy to Afrikaner interests. The process, which culminated in the purchase of General Mining, later Gencor, one of the big gold mining houses, by an Afrikaner consortium proved successful and the new government decided not to follow through with its threats. Now, with South Africa's first black government expected after elections next week, the same slogans are being bandied around by the African National Congress, and big business is trying to shape a similar response. In the past year, the country's giant conglomerates have sold off The Sowetan, the country's biggest daily newspaper, Metropolitan Life and African Life, two life assurers, and Prima, a merchant bank now renamed Miba, to black investors, all on favourable terms and often with generous financing. Now, to put the icing on the growing black corporate cake, Anglo American, the country's most powerful corporation, has announced plans to sell control of most of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, another of the big mining houses, to black investors. But while this profusion of deals testifies to the growing visibility of black businessmen (there are few women), it is also symptomatic of their continued weakness. Organisations such as the Black Management Forum, a group helping identify and develop black managers for the private sector, are expanding rapidly, but the pool of qualified, and wealthy, black people who can be tapped for such initiatives remains small. Blacks still own fewer than 5 per cent of shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and black directors make up only 2 per cent of the total - although this compares with   1/4 per cent five years ago. Reflecting this, blue chip directorships tend to go to individuals with relatively little direct business experience but good political contacts or a high profile. Some, such as Mr Enos Mabuza, a former 'homeland' leader with close ties to the ANC, are in the enviable position of being forced to turn down board positions such has been the proliferation of offers. The exact mechanism of the JCI transfer has yet to be announced. It is estimated that black savings societies, companies and union pension funds could raise at most R3bn (Pounds 560m) to finance the transaction, short of a purchase price in the region of R5bn. Even among unlisted businesses, black dominated sectors are few and largely restricted to the black customer market, such as the minibus taxi sector or black hair-care products. Such companies are also hampered by a lingering suspicion about black managerial ability - even within the black community itself. 'The main problem is that people don't want to buy shares in a black company because they think it will go under,' says Mr Sam Mkhwanazi, a shareholder in Methold, parent company of Metropolitan Life, South Africa's first black-owned and black-run insurance company. Gone are the days when owning shares was viewed as ideologically unsound by blacks, under the influence of radical unions allied to the South African Communist party. Still, says Dr Nthato Motlana, Methold chairman, 'the sale of shares to black South Africans has never been easy' - and it is not easy now. 'There is still a basic lack of trust in black skills and this will only wear off with time,' says Mr Thami Mazwai, editor of Enterprise, a black business magazine. These perceptions are reinforced by recent media allegations of mismanagement at companies such as National Sorghum Breweries, the country's largest black-owned and black-run corporation. Impressive recent growth of the National African Federated Chamber of Commerce, the country's premier black business organisation, has brought its membership to 150,000, but the majority of these are essentially one-man shows such as taxis and shopkeepers. Mr Archie Nkonyeni, Nafcoc president, estimates that, including the informal sector, black-run enterprises account for only some R20bn in an economy with a GDP of about R400bn, although they make up 75 per cent of the population. One route being explored is joint ventures or franchising schemes with foreign companies. Both the US government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation and Nafcoc are seeking out American parents for black South African business. Already, companies such as Nike, Pepsi and Sun Microsystems have selected black partners for their return to South Africa. Inevitably, however, most of these schemes tend to enrich the same small group of prominent businessmen as the only available blacks with the expertise. 'There is tremendous potential for black entrepreneurship,' asserts Prof Wiseman Nkuhlu, President of the BMF. However, A recent World Bank study notes that inadequate technical, administrative and managerial skills and lack of access to financing are severely hampering further growth of black-owned enterprises. Aware of these constraints, the ANC has said that nurturing black business is now one of its 'central economic strategies'. As a result, the new government will be expected to redirect both small business development aid and state contracts to black companies. Indeed, the precedent of successful National party patronage for Afrikaner business is widely recognised. Says Mr Nkonyeni: 'State assistance can be very useful in empowering the black community - and there is still a very long way to go before blacks are properly represented in the economy.' For apartheid had a double impact: not only did it impede blacks from entering the corporate world, it undermined their ability to succeed once they got there. And worst of all, its legacy is likely to live on into the new South Africa: prejudice against black companies will not disappear until blacks prove that they can compete in what will remain a predominantly white corporate world.</p>

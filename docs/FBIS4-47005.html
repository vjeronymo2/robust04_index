			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Rustam Narzikulov: "President Provokes a </F> Reformist Rush"]    [Text] It is pure cunning--to equate the significance of  five decrees hastily signed by the president with that of the  January reform of 1992; we should not, however, blame Aleksandr  Livshits for this trick, since it is his job to substantiate his  boss' grand- sounding political statements.    In reality, only Edict No. 1007, "On Repealing Quotas and  Licenses on Exports of Goods and Services" (the shortest of them  all--only half a page), may lay claim to being called radical,  since it essentially removes the last direct administrative  restrictions on the movement of Russian goods--this time in the  sphere of international trade.    The edict becomes effective on 1 July, which means that,  beginning in the second half of 1994, all the goodness the  bureaucrats derived from granting quotas, licenses, and  preferences in custom duty taxation is out; naturally, the  beneficiaries will be the Ministry of Finance and the budget,  whose revenue part until now has been in inverse proportion to  the go-getting power of exporters and regional administrations.    Liberalization of foreign trade should bring about the end  of  the omnipotent "nontariff regulation," and the volume of exports  of goods and services will depend on the commercial  effectiveness of the exports and the size of export duty, which,  in turn, increases the role of the customs.    It is unlikely that we will see a violent reaction of the  world markets on liberalization of Russian exports. Some of them  (aluminum and uranium) already are protected from an  unpredictable increase in Russian exports by corresponding  agreements, and Edict No. 1007 reaffirms obligations in this  respect. As to other raw material exports (first and foremost,  oil), it is impossible to increase their exports overnight  because of transport limitations.    The "anti-theft" Decree on the Reform of State Enterprises  is  more of a declaration of the state's intent to control the  utilization of property that belongs to it, but certainly not an  immediate introduction of the institution of treasury-owned  property. By the way, the draft document was prepared a long  time ago and had not been signed--not the least because of  resistance by Anatoliy Chubays, who apparently detected that  treasury-owned economic entities represent a method of reforming  state property as an alternative to privatization.    As to the remaining three financial-monetary edicts, there  is  nothing "reformist" in them, since the subject is a routine  change in tax rates, combating tax evasion, and improvements in  money clearing. Such documents, which clearly are below the  status of presidential decrees, have been, are, and will be  issued every time the government (the Ministry of Finance or the  Central Bank) makes a decision to change tax parameters or the  mechanism for legal entities to settle accounts with the budget  and among themselves.    These documents will get into the orbit of Yeltsin and his  administration's attention only in the event the president once  again "discovers" economic problems that are well-known to the  majority of the population. The utility of periodic splashes of  the head of the state's interest in the economy is  unquestionable--the needed documents are signed without delay  and get the highest status. Compared to this, the costs in the  form of canceled official visits (this time, Aleksandr Shokhin's  to Seoul) and additional apparat hustle seem minimal.</p>

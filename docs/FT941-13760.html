			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: The balance in power Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, has yet to produce his verdict on the generating companies, despite a promise to deliver it by mid-January. His report may not now be published until next month. Investors, probably correctly, have concluded that the delay implies that talks are still going on which will avoid the companies being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The regulator seems to want National Power and PowerGen to agree to dispose of some generating plant and accept a voluntary cap on spot electricity prices. Since the companies probably have more to lose through an MMC reference, they are under pressure to agree. On the other hand, practically none of the important political constituencies now want a reference, so the regulator is a little hemmed in. If a deal is done, there will probably be some impact on profits. The generators' high dividend cover and provisions do, however, offer a defence. Even so, with the shares now yielding 20 per cent less than the market average, a good part of the growth prospects are already in price. By contrast, the regional electricity companies are still cheap, with above average yields, since investors regard them as pure utilities. Yet their financial strength and dividend growth prospects are not those of a utility. The strong cash flow and low ratings may soon attract predators. If the RECs do not move quickly to unlock the value of their National Grid holdings, and return other excess capital to shareholders, someone else may do it for them.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Haydn's Creation KLAUS Tennstedt was originally booked to conduct the London Philharmonic's two performances of Haydn's Creation this week at the Royal Festival Hall. Tennstedt, though, was advised to rest after some strenuous touring; forced to look elsewhere for a conductor the LPO struck lucky: the concerts were taken over by Roger Norrington. The results were certainly very different from any notion of what a Tennstedt Creation might have been. For though Norrington was working with a modern symphony orchestra without a period instrument in sight, he was still able to bring bear a whole range of stylistic insights derived from his experience of conducting it with his own London Classical Players. Every texture was opened out, and the bright dabs of instrumental colour that fleck Haydn's score made to acquire an extra luminosity. Light and shade was everything. Recitatives were accompanied by a fortepiano, the strings found their natural inclination to vibrato had been strictly controlled - many passages, the opening prelude the first, arresting example, were delivered with wonderfully chaste, limpid string chording - while the woodwind solos were etched in sharp relief. The distinguishing characteristic of every Norrington performance is its rhythmic acuity and it was no surprise to find every phrase here sharply profiled, each accompanimental figure deftly worked. So every aspect of this Creation was rendered elegantly buoyant, a tapestry of deftly worked instrumental strands and vigorously alert singing. The soloists were a distinguished set - Felicity Lott, Anthony Rolfe-Johnson, David Wilson-Johnson - all imposing characters in their own right. With a less characterful trio Norrington might have been tempting to impose his own precepts, encouraging a little more flexibility, perhaps more ornamentation; instead he gave them expressive licence and they sang most elegantly. The London Philharmonic Choir coped well too with his demands for sinewy precision; indeed, as an example of what can be achieved within the constraints of big-band symphonic Haydn the whole evening was an instructive and inspiring model.</p>

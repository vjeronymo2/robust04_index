			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (4): 'I've been careful to control my attitude' - Four times prime minister, twice deposed by a military coup, and now almost certain to be elected president, Suleyman Demirel is the arch-survivor of Turkish politics. Two days after the death of President Turgut Ozal last month, Mr Demirel talked to Edward Mortimer and John Murray Brown Some Turks are saying President's Ozal's death marks the end of an era in Turkish politics. How do you evaluate his contribution? Let me say this. I knew him for almost 43 years. Between 1965 and 1971 he was my adviser, then he was under-secretary of the planning division: I put him there. In 1979, I brought him into the administration again. Later we had some problems, because between 1980 and 1987 I was not free. In 1991 we campaigned to remove him from Cankaya (the presidential palace). We were not able to get enough votes, and since then I've been very careful to control my attitude, so as to protect the country from any harm. And now this happened, I am awfully sorry. Because once you have so many years as friends, it doesn't matter what happens in the last five or 10. Do you think those who are pressing you to accept the presidency really want you to step down from power? (laughing) That's possible] But the president is very important. He can prevent both government and parliament from functioning. The president should have some understanding, and be helpful to the government. Even if it is composed of parties difference from his own? When you become president, you should forget the parties. Mr Ozal is credited with opening the way to a solution of the Kurdish problem. What is your attitude? One can argue about that. The problems are still there. None of them have been solved. Abdullah Ocalan (head of the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party) has agreed to extend his ceasefire. Are you closer to a solution? We never hear him, whatever he says. If you start hearing him, then he becomes a party to the problem. If we make him a party to the problem, then we should be dealing with him. We should never deal with him. I don't think we should deal with the man attacking us. We won't tell him 'don't stop', but nor will we tell him 'we are very happy that you've stopped', and then negotiate. How helpful a role has been played by Mr Jalal Talabani and the Iraqi Kurds? I saw Talabani five or six days ago, and told him: 'You shouldn't be a mediator between the Turkish state and those terrorists, but if you think they are Kurds killing Kurds, brothers killing brothers, then if you as a Kurd yourself say it should be stopped, it is up to you'. I am not telling him 'don't do anything', but 'don't be a mediator, don't get any instructions from us'. I am not closing the door. We don't want bloodshed. We are trying to have a soft approach to the problem. We offer them justice and the rule of law. Justice or even a degree of clemency? Actually there are laws. They can benefit from the 'repentance' law, and parliament may even enlarge it. Would part of this soft approach be to allow Kurdish schools, or introduce the Kurdish language into schools? No, that is something else. We won't do anything which would be understood as a gain for terrorism. Then we wouldn't be able to run this country. But leaving terrorism aside, might there not be a strong case for doing it in its own right? If there is a strong case for anything else to be done, we will do it, but not now, because then it would be seen as a concession, which would fuel terrorism in the coming years. What does Kemalism mean in the 1990s? Kemalism, as we understand it, is not a regime. It's a target. Ataturk said the supreme willpower of the nation should govern the country. He said the people of Turkey should reach contemporary civilisation. If that's Kemalism, I'm a Kemalist. What about his principles of 'etatism' and secularism? In 1923 the Turkish state had about 10m people and its cities were devastated by war. There weren't enough private entrepreneurs, and they didn't have enough capital or know-how, so the state had to step in. When you come to 1980, the whole thing changes: having the state in the economy does not pay now. But secularism is very important. It's actually a protection of the right of religion: you can believe as you want. What is your reaction to recent gains by the (Islamic) Welfare Party? It's very local. They can get up to 15 per cent, not more than that. Is Turkey still on schedule for customs union with the EC in 1995? Will you scrap the mass housing fund by then? It has to be negotiated. You know, Turkey is the only country that is going to be in a customs union without being a member of the EC. Definitely Turkey should negotiate that. When do you expect to start these negotiations? Very soon, whenever the EC is ready. Is full membership still a realistic objective? In 10 years, maybe. Turkey may be a full member with some exceptional conditions. It depends on the Community, but I think within the next 10 years Turkey should be a full member. You know, membership for Turkey means catching up with Europe. If we feel we can catch that level, for us I think the target is reached. How dangerous for Turkey is the situation in the Caucasus? We are being pushed, and we are under pressure from pro-Azerbaijani public opinion. People say we should intervene. Actually we can intervene, but that won't be the end of the problem. Maybe the problem will start when you intervene. We intervened in Cyprus, but we still have the problem there. Bosnia is a different thing. In Bosnia you have the international community, but in the Caucasus only Turkey is under pressure. If the international community wants to intervene to settle the problem, then Turkey will a partner. As in Bosnia, if the international community decides to intervene, we will supply forces, but we cannot intervene by ourselves. Whatever we do, we should do it with the world. That means the Russians have a veto? Yes. We should do it with the world including the Russians, as in the case of Kuwait. Russia should be convinced what needs to be done. In the case of the Caucasus, too, Russia shouldn't be left out. On Bosnia there are some efforts. Let us hope they will have some results. Pressure will be put on the Serbs. Up to now there was no deterrent factor. Now Nato is going to control the no-fly zone. Our planes left for Italy today. Is a deterrent needed on the ground as well? It's up to the soldiers to evaluate that. But now Nato has been put into force, let us see how things will develop. And what is your policy towards Central Asia? Is it going to lead to a revival of Pan-Turkism? People in Central Asia and in Anatolia speak the same language. They share the same history, the same traditions . . . They are our cousins, but we have never lived in the same state. Therefore Pan-Turkism is just a Utopia. All we want is that they stay as independent states. They should be running themselves: we do not have any desire to run those countries. What about a Turkic commonwealth, an economic commonwealth? Not for the time being. Actually we have an agreement between Iran, Turkey, Pakistan and the Central Asian states, called ECO. If we can develop some regional economic relations, why not? All we want is these countries to open up to the world. They used to know the world as only Moscow. Now they have seen that there is a world beyond Moscow. We have given them a lot of help: we have 10,000 students in Turkish schools; we have provided TV and telephones; we have 42 agreements signed. More than 500 Turkish companies are working in those countries. Relations will be bilateral, based on economic interest. Is this pulling Turkey in another direction, away from the EC? Our desire to be a member of the EC is not for economic factors only. We are Europeans. We would like to stay as Europeans. We would like to live with Europe. We would like to act with Europe. We share the values of European civilisation in addition to our own values. As a member of Nato, we have defended those values. Europe is not a geography: Europe is a set of values. If Europe says, 'we don't want you to defend our values', that is something else. But if I were Europe I should say, 'Let us have more people defending our values'. We can take those values to Central Asia. That is the extension of Europe, not as geography but as culture, as civilisation. In Bishkek (capital of Kyrgyzstan), for instance, 75 per cent of the population are Russians and Germans. They are Europeans. It's a beautiful city: it's not an Asian city, its a European city. They're all intermingled. Are you implying that those countries, too, might be members of the EC? Not for the time being. But as Turks, we can take European values to those countries.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR REBUKED BY U.S. OVER DEATHS OF 7 PALESTINIANS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: HIS REJECTION OF PEACE PLAN CONTRIBUTED TO THE 'POTENTIAL FOR  SENSELESS VIOLENCE,' WASHINGTON SAYS.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, in a stinging rebuke to Israel's embattled caretaker  government, said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir must share the blame for the  massacre of seven Arab workers and the rioting that followed because his rebuff  of a U.S.-backed peace initiative contributed to the "potential . . . for  senseless violence."  </P> <P> State Department spokesman Richard Boucher accepted Israel's explanation that  the killings at a highway crossroads near the Israeli town of Rishon le Zion  were the work of a mentally unbalanced man. But he said that does not relieve  the Israeli government of responsibility for the murders and the violence that  followed.  </P> <P> "In the absence of the peace process, the potential for this kind of senseless  violence and spiraling responses afterwards goes up," Boucher said, reading  from a statement.  </P> <P> Also, Boucher criticized the Israeli army for inflicting an excessive number of  casualties in its effort to put down the violence that followed word of the  shootings.  </P> <P> "When you have this kind of very horrible, very tragic sort of incident, and  then that's followed by responses that lead to further violence, we see that as  another sign that there must be a peace process and people have to be able to  believe in a peace process," Boucher said.  </P> <P> Asked if he would join Israeli government leaders in urging Arab governments  and Palestinian activists to refrain from exploiting the killings to incite  further violence, Boucher said Washington "calls on all sides to make an effort  to reduce tensions." But he immediately turned back to his criticism of Israel.  </P> <P> "It is not merely enough to have restraint," he said. "We need an active,  viable peace process to create hope for the future."  </P> <P> Shamir had balked at a peace plan advanced by Secretary of State James A. Baker  III that was designed to lead to negotiations between Israel and Palestinians.  </P> <P> As a consequence, the Labor Party, which supported the Baker initiative, pulled  out of Israel's national unity government in March and brought it down.  However, since then, no party has been able to put together a majority in  Parliament, so Shamir has continued to lead a caretaker regime.  </P> <P> U.S.-Israeli friction over Shamir's refusal to go along with Baker's plan has  driven the relationship between the traditional allies to the lowest point in  at least a generation. Boucher's statement Monday is sure to cause additional  tension.  </P> <P> The Israeli government launched a major public relations campaign Monday. It  directed its embassies around the world to explain its policies in the occupied  West Bank and Gaza Strip and to assure the world that the government did not  condone the Rishon le Zion killings.  </P> <P> However, Boucher responded by renewing U.S. criticism of the Israeli army for  its use of force in trying to put down the Palestinian uprising.  </P> <P> "We're disturbed by the number of casualties inflicted by the Israeli army," he  said. "We've repeatedly called upon the government of Israel to exercise  restraint in these situations in order to avoid heavy casualties such as took  place (Sunday)."  </P> <P> By contrast, Boucher praised the government of Jordan for its handling of a  Palestinian gunman who sprayed a busload of French tourists with bullets after  shouting slogans of revenge for the Arabs killed in Rishon le Zion.  </P> <P> "We deplore this tragic incident and extend our sympathies to the wounded and  their families," Boucher said. "The Jordanian authorities have acted quickly to  contain the incident, and we understand they are taking steps to ensure the  security of foreign tourists and others visiting Jordan."  </P></p>

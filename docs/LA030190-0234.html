			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SPACE SHUTTLE TO RETURN SUNDAY  </P> <P> NASA said today that the space shuttle Atlantis will return to Earth on Sunday,  an announcement that may indicate that the five-member military crew has  already deployed a $500-million spy satellite.  </P> <P> In a three-sentence statement that is the first break in a Pentagon-imposed  news blackout on the military mission, NASA said the "expected landing day" for  Atlantis is Sunday.  </P> <P> No landing times were provided.  </P> <P> The mission is expected to last 4 1/2 days, ending with a landing at Edwards  Air Force Base in California.  </P> <P> "The (Atlantis) crew is doing well, and orbiter Atlantis continues to perform  satisfactorily," the terse Mission Control announcement concluded.  </P> <P> The cargo carried into orbit by Atlantis reportedly is a 37,300-pound satellite  capable of taking super-sharp photographs and listening in on electronic  communications around the world.  </P></p>

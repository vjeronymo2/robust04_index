			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak prepares for a new image - The chairman decided the company should concentrate on its core operations The announcement by Mr George Fisher, chairman of Eastman Kodak, that the group would sell its healthcare businesses delighted Wall Street for a simple reason: many analysts and investors doubted that the new Kodak chief had the guts to do it. Ever since Mr Fisher joined the struggling photographic products group from Motorola last December, Wall Street has waited for him to outline a strategy for turning around Kodak, which has been criticised for its lacklustre financial performance. Most analysts were hoping Mr Fisher would choose to sell off Kodak's non-core operations so it could concentrate on its photographic products and imaging business. But few analysts were sure that he would be able to engineer such a dramatic shift at a company renowned for its stodgy corporate culture and resistance to change. After all, Kodak had made five attempts in the past 10 years to restructure its businesses and generate better earnings, and none had really worked. Why would it be any different this time? Yet, it was to be different because the new chairman realised soon after joining Kodak that non-core operations were diverting much needed resources away from the all-important imaging business. As he said yesterday: 'It became increasingly apparent to me that we had this great set of businesses, each of which had investment requirements that Kodak could not afford to adequately cover.' Consequently, Mr Fisher decided that if Kodak's imaging business was to prosper in an increasingly competitive market, healthcare operations had to go. Under the plan unveiled yesterday, the group will sell its pharmaceutical and consumer health products unit Sterling Winthrop, its personal care and household products business L&amp;F Products, and its Clinical Diagnostics division. Between them, the three businesses generated almost a quarter of Kodak's 1993 revenues of Dollars 16.4bn. After the divestments, Kodak will be left with its imaging business and the Health Sciences division. The latter, with its X-ray film and electronics-based medical, cardiology, and dental diagnostic businesses, is regarded as a vital part of Kodak's imaging strategy. The ultimate aim of the restructuring is to allow Kodak to devote more funds to developing its imaging business. Most of Kodak's photographic earnings are derived from its traditional film products, which uses a chemical process to create images. It is this business which is threatened by the rapidly growing market for digital, electronic imaging. Without the burden of supporting the healthcare operations, Kodak will be able to spend more money on developing the electronic side of the imaging business while simultaneously protecting its traditional imaging business from competitors, and building sales of its photographic products. The immediate impact of the divestments will be to improve dramatically the group's financial condition. Kodak is labouring under Dollars 7bn of debt, and the proceeds from the sale of the healthcare operations will go a long way towards sharply reducing that figure. In turn, the reduction in debt should lead to an improvement in the group's credit ratings. Kodak does not expect the divestments to be dilutive. Mr Harry Kavetas, chief financial officer, said: 'We would not expect any dilutive effect on continuing earnings per share . . . because decreases in interest expense that we will realise by applying the proceeds (of the sales) to debt reductions should offset the loss of near-term profit contribution from the sold units.' Much depends, however, on what Kodak gets from the sale of its non-core businesses. Although the group should have little trouble finding a buyer for Sterling (the German group Bayer has already expressed an interest), few expect it to recover the Dollars 5.1bn it spent acquiring the unit in 1988.</p>

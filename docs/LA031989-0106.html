			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LACK OF CLEAN WATER, SEWERS BREED DISEASE IN BORDER SETTLEMENTS  </P> <P> Eleazar and Maria Morales say they detest hauling water, a daily chore in the  rural West Texas slum where they live without indoor plumbing or proper sewage  disposal.  </P> <P> Their home is in Sparks Addition, a hodgepodge of substandard housing in the  desert near here.  </P> <P> The neighborhood is a colonia, the Spanish term for subdivision that has become  synonymous with the predominantly Latino rural slums that have grown up along  the U.S.-Mexico border over the last 15 years.  </P> <P> In El Paso County, about 28,000 people live without running water, and 53,000  have no sewer system.  </P> <P> Along the U.S. side of the Rio Grande, a further 150,000 people live in  colonias where septic tanks overflow every time it rains and the contaminated  mud breeds illnesses that are rare elsewhere in the nation.  </P> <P> There are colonias all along the border, from San Diego to Brownsville, Tex.,  but social workers say the problem is worst in Texas, where counties have no  zoning powers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refugees From Cities  </P> <P> Many colonia dwellers are refugees from city slums and housing projects, and  most are American citizens or legal immigrants.  </P> <P> "I was desperate for a place to live," Morales said. "Rents in El Paso  tenements were too high, and the living conditions in the city are not good for  raising children."  </P> <P> The 40-year-old unemployed construction worker said he had always dreamed of  owning a home. He said he bought his small piece of desert land from a  developer who promised that water and sewers would soon be available.  </P> <P> Morales and his wife, Maria, 45, built their house, a cinder-block building  with three bedrooms, living room, kitchen and two baths -- and a huge septic  tank out back.  </P> <P> "We haven't gotten sick from the water yet," Morales said, and quickly added:  "Thank God."  </P> <P> Like the others in the colonias, the Morales family relies on friends and  relatives for drinking water, which they store in drums outside the house.  </P> <P> A community well supplies brackish water not fit for drinking but useful for  bathing and washing. Residents line up at the well to fill barrels and tanks  with the salty water and haul it back home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Just Need Water'  </P> <P> "We stay here now because it's home," Maria Morales said. "We're here in the  desert where there's no smog and no crime. We just need water."  </P> <P> Armando Esquivel, 48, also an unemployed construction worker, said he doesn't  have a steady job and could not afford to hook up to water and sewage lines  even if they were available.  </P> <P> The cause of the colonias has been championed by El Paso Interreligious  Sponsoring Organization, an Industrial Areas Foundation community group  organized to help the poor to help themselves.  </P> <P> The Rev. Ed Rodan, a spokesman for the group, said the colonias have sprouted  as economic conditions in the city grew worse, suitable public housing became  scarce and families sought a better life style for themselves and their  children.  </P> <P> "I'm not sorry we live here," Esquivel said. "I'm just sorry we don't have any  water yet."  </P> <P> Rodan blames the land developers. He calls them "greedy liars, looking for  quick and easy money at the expense of unsuspecting buyers."  </P> <P> "Many of the people of the colonias moved out of El Paso housing projects that  are riddled with violence, crime and drugs," he said. "Others can't find public  housing, since El Paso has only a 1% housing vacancy for low-income families  and a frozen waiting list."  </P> <P> For many in the colonias, he said, moving from the city to the country to get  away from crime has brought an encounter with a different kind of crime, that  of "uncaring and dishonest developers."  </P> <P> There have been no deaths reported from the unsanitary living conditions, but  public health officials say life in the colonias means illnesses usually not  associated with life in the United States.  </P> <P> Dr. Laurance Nickey, director of the El Paso City-County Health Unit, said the  rates of dysentery, hepatitis and lice infestation around El Paso are twice the  regional average.  </P> <P> He said that in 1987, the last year for which statistics were available, El  Paso County had almost four times the national rate of salmonella dysentery and  almost twice the rate of shigella dysentery.  </P> <P> The incidence of infectious hepatitis A in the county was more than five times  the national rate, Nickey said. El Paso County had more cases of hepatitis A in  1987 than 24 states, more cases of hepatitis B than 11 states, more shigella  dysentery than 20 states and more tuberculosis cases than 19 states.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Children Sick  </P> <P> Nickey said that 85% of the children in the Sparks Addition, one of the  county's worst colonias, suffered from skin rashes, yeast infections, diarrhea  or vomiting.  </P> <P> The Sparks Addition is not the only colonia with problems. A recent study found  that water from 98% of 100 wells tested in the San Elizario was unfit even for  bathing or washing dishes because it was being contaminated by sewage.  </P> <P> Antonio Parra, public relations director for the San Elizario Independent  School District, said the study proved that the people are bathing in their own  sewage. He said many households have placed septic tanks too close to the  shallow wells, or use open pits that leak into the ground water.  </P> <P> While water is a problem around El Paso and in some rural areas of New Mexico,  Arizona and California, the biggest residential problem in the Rio Grande  Valley of Texas is a lack of proper sewer systems.  </P> <P> Cameron, Hidalgo, Willacy and Starr counties have about 500 colonias with a  combined population of about 150,000, said Sister Christine Stephens of Valley  Interfaith, the Industrial Areas Foundation organization working in South  Texas.  </P> <P> "People are building on very small lots," she said. "Each family builds a  septic tank, but the soil is not able to percolate the sewage. When it rains,  the tanks overflow."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nation's Poorest Counties  </P> <P> Then the contaminated mud causes serious sanitation problems, she said, and  poverty in South Texas complicates the the problem. The four counties are the  poorest in the nation.  </P> <P> The colonias of the Rio Grande Valley are larger than those in West Texas, she  said.  </P> <P> The 34 small towns in the area are operating on slim budgets and unable to  assume the cost of extending sewer systems to outlying areas.  </P> <P> Since national news reports have called attention to the area, Texas  politicians have made proposals that may eventually lead to correction of the  squalid conditions.  </P> <P> State Comptroller Bob Bullock has suggested a $500-million bond issue to set  aside aid money for the 25 poorest counties.  </P> <P> Bullock said the bond money could be matched with equal federal funds. His  proposal was developed in cooperation with the Texas Water Development Board  and the lieutenant governor's and state treasurer's offices.  </P> <P> It would take about $6,700 per household to supply the colonias with drinking  water and install sewers, the comptroller said.  </P> <P> A similar measure introduced in the Texas Senate by state Sen. Tati  Santiesteban, Democrat of El Paso, has the backing of senators from the border  counties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Border Panel Proposed  </P> <P> U. S. Rep. Ron Coleman (D-Tex.) in the last session of Congress proposed a  Border Commission to enlist federal resources in solving the problem. His bill  passed the House but died in the Senate, and Coleman said he would try again.  </P> <P> State Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox has initiated a vigorous program of lawsuits  against the developers, applying the state's Deceptive Trade Practices Law to  the advertising used to attract land buyers.  </P> <P> Attorneys said the county governments cannot force developers to provide water  and sewers because Texas counties do not have ordinance-making power.  </P> <P> Mattox has filed about 20 suits during the last two years, citing developers  for not giving buyers essential information on access roads, septic tank  requirements and regulations on the proper installation of water, electricity  and telephone lines.  </P></p>

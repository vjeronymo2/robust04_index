			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Foods' shares dive as interim is cancelled CLARKE FOODS, Britain's second largest ice cream maker, yesterday saw two thirds of its stock market value wiped out after announcing that a cash shortage had led it to scrap plans to pay an interim dividend and open talks with its bankers. The company, which declared a 0.75p interim on August 3, said yesterday its current difficulties made payment no longer appropriate. The shares fell 43p to 21p. Clarke blamed unexpectedly poor weather since late July, which had enabled the company to achieve only 25 per cent of its planned ice cream sales. This had resulted in a large build-up of unsold stocks and delays in payments to suppliers and creditors. Cash resources had dwindled because lower sales had prevented it from using more than half its invoice discounting facility, its only external source of working capital. The facility was arranged with Lombard Invoice Discounting, part of National Westminster Bank, after Clarke acquired the Lyons Maid ice cream business in February. Under the arrangement, Lombard advances working capital only after Clarke presents invoices from sales to retailers. Though Lombard recently raised its working capital payments from 55 per cent to 60 per cent of the value of invoices, Clarke had been unable to take advantage of the increase. Mr Manjit Sahni, finance director, said Clarke was discussing with NatWest proposals to convert all or part of the cash discounting facility into a conventional overdraft. He expected a decision from the bank in the next two weeks. Mr Sahni said some of Clarke's creditors and suppliers had threatened to take legal action, though none had so far done so. The cash shortage is the second setback this year for Clarke, which suffered a decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 364,000 to Pounds 168,000 on sales of Pounds 10.4m in the six months to May 2. The fall was blamed on problems in commissioning new production equipment, which had prevented the company from meeting demand for ice cream in the early summer. The company said yesterday that the problems had now been solved. Last March Mr Henry Clarke, chairman, announced ambitious plans to re-launch the Lyons Maid brand and introduce a super-premium ice cream, backed by Pounds 4.5m of advertising campaigns.</p>

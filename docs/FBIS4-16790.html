			<p>BFN     [Text] There will be a big shortage of draftees in the  Russian army this spring. Only about 216,000 young men will be  drafted, although the demand of the armed forces is 700,000.  The draft and allocation to units will be completed by July 1,  Commander of the Main Organizational and Mobilization Board of  the Russian Armed Forces' General Headquarters General Vitaliy  Bologov told INTERFAX on Tuesday.    He said that the shortage in the army is caused by the fact  that many young men have the right to postpone their service, as  well as by the worsening of draftees' health condition. The  General noted that in the spring the armed forces can draft only  27 percent of available "mobilization resources." He also said  that in other countries the figure is 50 to 75 percent.    Bologov noted that the Defense Ministry will suggest that  parliament introduce amendments in the near future to the laws  on military service, on defense and some others in order to  reduce the number of privileges and delays for draftees.    Commenting on the Russian president's decree on draft of  citizens born in 1967-1976, Bologov noted that according to the  Constitution of the country, a young man not older than 27 can  be drafted to the army.    Bologov said that the autumn draft of 1993 was fulfilled to  90.6 percent. He said that of more than 500,00 citizens 480,000  were sent to serve in the army. The General added that 320,000  draftees graduated from secondary professional-technical schools.</p>

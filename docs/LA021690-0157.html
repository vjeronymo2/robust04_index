			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABC SIGNS JAMES L. BROOKS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT  </P> <P> ABC made its long-simmering deal with Emmy- and Oscar-winning  writer-producer-director James L. Brooks official Thursday, announcing that it  had signed him to an exclusive contract under which his company, Gracie Films,  will develop at least three comedy series for the network.  </P> <P> Gracie Films will continue to produce "The Tracey Ullman Show" and "The  Simpsons" for Fox Broadcasting.  </P> <P> Unlike ABC's exclusive deal with writer-producer Steven Bochco ("Doogie Howser,  M.D."), Brooks' does not specify any time constraints on when the projects must  be developed.  </P> <P> "We want their best work," Robert Iger, president of ABC Entertainment, said of  Brooks and his associates, "and (we) feel that this agreement, free of the  usual time strictures, should prove fruitful for both organizations."  </P> <P> Brooks was co-creator of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and wrote and produced the  films "Terms of Endearment" and "Broadcast News."  </P></p>

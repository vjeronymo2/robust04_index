This is an important decision made at the GATT Uruguay Round  talks as well as an important change in the international  multilateral trade system. According to the schedule in the  wake of the Uruguay Round, the World Trade Organization will  probably take effect on 1 July 1995, but the exact date will be  finally fixed at the Uruguay Round ministerial meeting in  Morocco this April.    The idea and proposal of establishing a world trade  organization was put forward by the EC and Canada in the later  stages of the Uruguay Round talks. However, they called it a  multilateral trade organization which was intended to  effectively implement the results of the Uruguay Round talks,  expand the scope of GATT, and include the results of the Uruguay  Round talks on the three new areas of intellectual property  rights, investment measures, and service trade in the legal  framework of the multilateral trade system and make GATT an  official international trade organization and a permanent  international trade agreement.    The basic principles and goals of the World Trade  Organization are basically the same as those of GATT, that is,  to promote the achievement of the goal of liberalizing world  trade through implementing the principles of market opening,  nondiscrimination, and fair trade. However, the former  represents world trade in a wider scope, is more formal in  organizational structure and legally, and has a much wider scope  of functions. This is concretely embodied in the following  aspects:    The World Trade Organization is very wide-ranging in  content.  It not only includes the goods trading rules which are  traditional and which were amended in the Uruguay Round, but  extends the world trade rules to such new areas as farm  products, which have long been excluded from GATT, and  investment measures, intellectual property rights, and the  service trade. As an official international trade organization,  it makes up for the shortcomings of GATT and is legally on an  equal footing with other international organizations. It has a  larger scope of functions. In addition to GATT's original  functions of organizing the implementation of multilateral and  submultilateral [ci duo bian 2945 1122 6708] trade agreements,  offering an arena for multilateral trade talks, and acting as a  forum, it will also be responsible for periodically examining  the trade policies of its members, handle trade disputes between  members, and be responsible for strengthening cooperation with  the IMF, the World Bank, and their subsidiary organizations so  as to achieve uniformity in global economic policy. All  agreements (excluding several submultilateral agreements such as  government purchase agreements) will be a unified agreement and  a basket of agreements and will not allow for optional signing.  It will considerably amend the mutually inapplicable GATT  clauses and allow its members to negotiate with a new joining  party on tariff reductions and concessions. But upon the entry  of the new joining party, the two sides have the right to  determine that their clauses are mutually inapplicable to each  other.    Unlike GATT, since the World Trade Organization will be an  official international organization, all joining parties will be  called "members." The World Trade Organization will have two  types of membership status, namely founding member and new  joining member.    Founding members must possess the following qualifications,  neither of which are dispensable: They must be GATT members  when the World Trade Organization takes effect; they must sign a  basket of Uruguay Round agreements; they must make tariff and  nontariff reductions and concessions, and reductions and  concessions in the area of the service trade in the Uruguay  Round and make these reductions and concessions part of the  Uruguay Round reductions and concessions list and the reductions  and concessions list of the service trade general agreement.    New joining member of the World Trade Organization refers to  a country or an independent tariff region which possesses full  rights over foreign trade that has become a member after  negotiating joining conditions with the World Trade Organization  after the World Trade Organization agreement takes effect. A  decision of the World Trade Organization regarding acceptance of  a new member must be approved by a two-thirds majority at a  ministerial meeting.    The establishment of the World Trade Organization will have  a  huge and far-reaching influence on standardizing and managing  the future world economy and trade and on promoting the  liberalization of global trade to a much greater extent and in a  much wider scope. The World Trade Organization has inherited and  developed the open and cooperative multilateral trade system  represented by GATT, and thus greatly enhances people's  confidence in the multilateral trade system. This is the motive  power for the multilateral trade system to be long-lasting. The  series of agreements under its jurisdiction will become new  "traffic rules" for future world trade and will help ensure that  international trade proceeds under normal order.    Since the Uruguay Round trade liberalization measures  concretely organized for implementation by the World Trade  Organization will make all markets around the world more open  and enable them to gradually benefit from this, it is  undoubtedly very conducive to promoting international trade and  economic growth and to increasing the employment opportunities  of all countries. Its unified dispute resolution mechanism will  mediate international trade disputes much more quickly and  effectively and will to some extent reduce the unilateral  retaliative acts of some big trading nations.    Nevertheless, as a product of the Uruguay Round, the World  Trade Organization has some shortcomings due to the limitations  of the Uruguay Round. It does not take into sufficient  consideration the interests of developing countries, in  particular. It has not resolved all problems in the sphere of  international trade, such as the issues of trade and the  environment and the issue of restrictive commercial practices.    The Uruguay Round has only temporarily balanced the  international trade interests of some Western powers. Following  the implementation of a basket of Uruguay Round agreements, they  will unavoidably have new contradictions and conflicts of  interests and will need the World Trade Organization to  coordinate and resolve them. Therefore, the tasks faced by the  World Trade Organization will be very heavy.</p>

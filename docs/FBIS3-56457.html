			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] A meeting of the bureau of the parliamentary faction  of the Russia's Choice bloc was held this morning. Sergey  Yushenkov, secretary of the faction, said that members of the  bureau unanimously backed Yegor Gaydar's decision to resign from  the post of first deputy prime minister. Yushenkov also said  that Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov also intends to leave the  government because, like Gaydar, he is unable to bear  responsibility for a policy that will inevitably result in a new  spiral of inflation. However, Boris Fedorov himself has so far  declined to give any information about his own plans. He said  that Yegor Gaydar's statement on his refusal to join the  government came as a complete surprise to him.    Meanwhile, leading Russian banking circles have told  Interfax  that they regard Boris Fedorov as a symbol of reform in Russia  and that they might perceive his departure from the top echelons  of the government as symptomatic of a possible change in the  direction of the reforms.    At his press conference, Yegor Gaydar stated that Viktor  Chernomyrdin had asked him during their conversation about his  view of the possible appointment of Grigoriy Yavlinskiy to the  post of first deputy prime minister in the new government.  Gaydar said that he would warmly support his candidacy. As for  Yavlinskiy, the leader of the Yabloko parliamentary bloc, he  told the Interfax agency that no one has offered him a place in  the Russian Government. Asked whether he would accept such an  offer were it to be forthcoming, Yavlinsky replied: Most  probably not, but all the same it is too soon to say. Moreover,  an offer to join the government in the post of first deputy  prime minister has to come from the president, and I have my  doubts as to whether I could work with Boris Yeltsin, Yavlinskiy  stressed.</p>

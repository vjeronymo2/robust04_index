			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Bank regulators bribed by BCCI, US suit alleges: Former defence secretary Clifford charged THE most sweeping charges to date against former executives, shareholders and associates of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International were brought yesterday by the US authorities in a carefully co-ordinated operation. The charges accused those involved of being part of a 'sophisticated and corrupt criminal enterprise' which bribed and cheated its way across the world to gain power and money. Among those charged in New York and Washington with fraud, bribery, conspiracy, larceny and racketeering was Mr Clark Clifford, the 85-year-old former US defence secretary who was once a leading Democrat. Charges were also brought against Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's ailing founder, Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of BCCI, and Mr Ghaith Pharaon, the Saudi Arabian financier. The indictments also allege that 'huge bribes' were paid by BCCI to bank regulators and senior central bank officials in Pakistan, Nigeria, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Congo, Zambia, Argentina and Peru. These payments were allegedly made to ensure favourable treatment for BCCI and to cover up deceitful banking practices in which BCCI was engaged. Mr Robert Morgenthau, Manhattan's forceful district attorney, said the bribes led to frauds being perpetrated on the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Nigerian National Supply Company and the African Development Bank. Mr Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, his law partner who was also charged, were briefly placed under arrest in New York yesterday and indicted for criminal conduct, including receiving bribes, conspiracy and a scheme to commit fraud. The charges against them stem from their roles in the allegedly illegal acquisition by a BCCI holding company of First American Bankshares, Washington's biggest bank. Mr Clifford and Mr Altman were respectively chairman and president of First American. Mr Clifford and Mr Altman entered pleas of not guilty and said in a joint statement: 'We totally and categorically deny all charges. They are the result of mean-spirited suspicion and unfounded speculation.' In a related development, it was disclosed that Sheikh Kamal Adham, the 61-year-old former head of Saudi intelligence, flew from his home in Cairo to New York on Monday to sign a plea bargain agreement that allowed him to avoid more serious indictments while admitting to a misdemeanour. Sheikh Kamal admitted in court that he was part of a group which secretly and illegally gained control of First American's New York operations. He pleaded guilty to violating New York banking law, agreed to pay a Dollars 105m (Pounds 54.9m) fine and promised to co-operate with US prosecutors. The charges, filed exactly a year after the first indictments in the US, come as the Serious Fraud Office in London has been investigating the UK aspects of the BCCI fraud. The British government this week received a confidential report which is expected to criticise the role of the regulatory authorities, led by the Bank of England. Mr Morgenthau said the indictment 'spells out that this massive fraud was not just a criminal fraud scheme, as we charged last year, but a sophisticated and corrupt criminal enterprise, organised from the top down to do just this - accumulate money and gain the power and prestige that the money provided'. In Washington, Mr Clifford and Mr Altman were indicted on charges of conspiring to defraud the Federal Reserve Board and of concealing material facts relating to BCCI. The Fed also said it had begun civil proceedings to determine whether the two should be barred permanently from engaging in the banking business. In addition to charges of grand larceny and bribery Mr Abedi, BCCI's former chairman, and Mr Naqvi, were also charged with racketeering along with Mr Pharaon and Mr Faisal Saud Al Fulaij, a Kuwaiti businessman who is alleged to have been a frontman for BCCI. Mr Morgenthau said the four were 'members of a corrupt enterprise, the BCC group, that set up and conducted BCCI as a criminal conspiracy'. BCCI indictments, Page 6</p>

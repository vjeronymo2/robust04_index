			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] In Queretaro, Luis Donaldo Colosio, Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI] presidential candidate, has just ended  his first campaign tour. He visited Pedro Escobedo and San Juan  del Rio and later went to Hidalgo. Pablo Martin Contreras,  president of the Otomi people, gave Colosio the staff of command  in Ixmiquilpan, in the heart of the Mezquital Valley, where  Colosio received the support of the Indian population. In  downtown Ixmiquilpan he met with PRI members from Hidalgo. He  said that what is most painful is learning first hand the  difficult conditions that many Mexican communities face daily.  He added that shortages are intolerable and cannot be accepted  and that poverty should not be accepted as one's destiny.    At an event attended by thousands of peasants, Colosio  emphasized that things must be called by their names because  Mexico rejects lies and demagoguery, which are deceptive. The  PRI candidate called for a decisive battle to end poverty,  deprivation, and inequality in Mexico. He also talked about the  Chiapas situation.    [Begin Colosio recording] In the difficult times that  Chiapas State is experiencing, we must all reiterate our desire,  our fervent desire, and our determination to have only one  Mexico. To face the challenge of poverty, the fatherland needs  unity, harmony, and work. This is what the gleam of hope in the  eyes of Hidalgo children, of Chiapas children, and of all  Mexican children is asking. [end recording]    Colosio said that the Chiapas and Mezquital Valley  situations  demonstrate the urgent need for more just conditions. He  added that the solution is sweeping social reform.    [Begin Colosio recording] Today we are encouraged by  progress in the negotiations. The Mexican Army's declaration of  a cease-fire shows willingness to find ways to bring peace to  this Mexican region. [end recording]    Colosio pointed out that talks, reconciliation, and the  strengthening of the state of law will continue to promote  stability in Mexico. Later, he met with the PRI political  council in Pachuca and with Hidalgo women. He also attended a  social event.</p>

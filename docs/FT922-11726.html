			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / World Trade News: Japan agrees to cut car exports to EC JAPAN has agreed to cut its 1992 car exports to the European Community, a European Commission spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. He said Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) agreed at late night talks in Tokyo to cut sales by somewhat more than the expected 5 per cent decrease in EC car market demand this year. The spokesman said the Japanese side expected that disruption to the EC's new car market could be avoided if Japanese exports to the 12-nation bloc this year were reduced from 'a rate somewhat above that of the expected decrease of the total demand' after taking into account the state of the market and the specific difficulties the Community's motor manufacturing industry faces. The spokesman would not say exactly by how much Japanese car exports would be cut this year, but said they had shipped 1.25m cars to the EC last year, and Community new car demand was expected to fall by 5 per cent this year. The spokesman announced that a compromise had been found after two days of talks in Tokyo following the Commission's request to the Japanese to cut car exports to the EC. The Commission, the EC's executive body, asked for the cuts in view of poor operating results by some Community carmakers, falling domestic demand, and difficulties facing the EC industry as it undertakes expensive restructuring to make itself more competitive with its more efficient Japanese rivals. An EC-Japan agreement last July provided for a transition period until the end of 1999 before the EC car market is thrown open to unrestricted Japanese competition. The agreement provided for monitoring of Japanese car exports in the transition period, in line with annual shipments of up to 1.23m units. This figure was based on 1990 levels and assumed that the EC new car market by the end of the century would be 15.1m vehicles annually, compared with 13.8m in 1990. John Griffiths adds: Earlier this week, Japan announced details of reductions in direct car exports to the US. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) announced individual company quotas for an overall reduction of 28.2 per cent, to 1.65m vehicles this year from 2.3m vehicles in 1991. However, actual exports to the US last year are estimated at only 1.73m vehicles.</p>

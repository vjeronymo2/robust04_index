To provide service for persons who are hearing- or speech-impaired, this number may be reached via TDD by dialing the Federal Information Relay Service on 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;TDDY (1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339) or 202&hyph;708&hyph;9300.

As a result of questions that have been raised by potential applicants, in this notice the Department is amending certain parts of the NOFA. For further clarification, the Department also is advising potential applicants of changes that have been made in the application kit. Under section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545) and the requirements of 24 CFR 12.12, the Department therefore is extending the deadline for submitting applications for funds made available under the NOFA until 30 days from today's publication. In addition, the Department announces that the information collection requirements contained in the NOFA have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned control number 2502&hyph;0504.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Potential applicants have raised several questions about some of the certifications contained in the NOFA and application kit. As a result, one of the certifications (see item 8 in Section V.C, ``Submission Requirements,'' 59 FR at 30648 of the NOFA) has been revised to clarify that, although an applicant should not apply for these funds with the intention of purchasing properties that are to be assisted with these funds, the Department recognizes that future circumstances may warrant the applicant or its affiliate to seek an ownership interest as purchaser of last resort in such properties. In these cases and in recognition of the Department's overriding goal to maintain the greatest possible number of affordable housing units available for moderate-, low- and very low-income families, special dispensation of this rule, on a case by case basis, may be granted by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another certification, included in the application kit as Exhibit 8 (pursuant to item 9 in Section V.C of the NOFA), has been revised to clarify that recipients of Preservation Technical Assistance or Resident Capacity Grants are eligible applicants for Preservation Support Grant funds. The applicant must certify that it will perform activities described in its application, and the proscription against the applicant serving as a pass-through intermediary applies to administering allocations of both components of the Preservation Support Grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These revised certifications are available from the Multifamily Housing Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 6424, Rockville, MD 20850, telephone number: 1&hyph;800&hyph;955&hyph;2232. Please refer to FR&hyph;3613 and specify that you are seeking the revised certifications.

This change is needed to correct the discrepancy between the NOFA and the application kit definition of a CBO. The correct definition is in 24 CFR 248.101, which requires that the CBO maintain at least one-third of its governing board's membership for low-income neighborhood residents, other low-income community residents, or elected representatives of low-income neighborhood organizations. In addition, page 2 of Exhibit 1 in the application kit is to be deleted; that page was inadvertently included in the application kit and does not apply to this competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Department announces that the information collection requirements contained in FR Doc. 94&hyph;14344, the NOFA for Preservation Support Grants, published on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30640), have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned control number 2502&hyph;0504.

This change is needed to correct the discrepancy between the NOFA and the application kit definition of a CBO. The correct definition is in 24 CFR 248.101, which requires that the CBO maintain at least one-third of its governing board's membership for low-income neighborhood residents, other low-income community residents, or elected representatives of low-income neighborhood organizations. In addition, page 2 of Exhibit 1 in the application kit is to be deleted; that page was inadvertently included in the application kit and does not apply to this competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Department announces that the information collection requirements contained in FR Doc. 94&hyph;14344, the NOFA for Preservation Support Grants, published on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30640), have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned control number 2502&hyph;0504. Further, FR Doc. 94&hyph;14344 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 6 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian Air Force (FAP)  commander General Jose Nadal Paiva has resigned suddenly.  General Enrique Astete replaced him as the FAP commander today.    Nadal submitted his resignation just as the U.S. Government  halted the supply of radar obtained information to the FAP for  use in the struggle against drug trafficking. According to  military sources, the two are in no way connected.    The same sources stated that the Air Force commander  resigned  for "very personal reasons." Other sources stated that he  resigned for health reasons.    Nadal Paiva should have retired, due to his age, in 1993 but  continued following a decision by Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori, who is also commander in chief of the Armed Forces by  a mandate of the Constitution.    The new FAP commander was the Air Force chief of staff and  prior to that director of military operations and attache at the  Peruvian Embassy in the United States.</p>

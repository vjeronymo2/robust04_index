			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (3): Saturation problem looms - Asia-Pacific region poised for star performance in the 1990s THE 1980s were years of expansion for the Asia-Pacific credit card market as ever more vacationers returned home having discovered plastic money as one of the greatest wonders of the western world. This, combined with rapidly rising affluence and declining social stigma attached to borrowing, should enable the Asia-Pacific region to remain the credit card industry's star performer through the 1990s. At industry leaders Visa International and MasterCard, the number of cards in the region reached 45.5m and 32m respectively at the end of September 1991, 17.5 per cent of their combined global total, according to European Financial Management and Marketing Association statistics. Visa's figure increased 500 per cent in the five years through 1991 and is continuing to more than double annually in a number of countries, a company spokesman adds. Meanwhile, total Visa card sales in the 40-nation region jumped 28.7 per cent last year to Dollars 37.7bn, more than twice the 1988 level and approaching 10 per cent of worldwide sales. 'The Taiwanese market is about to explode' because of financial deregulation and the expected addition of about 50 new bank issuers, the Visa International spokesman says. In Japan, which dominates the regional market with about 80 per cent of cardholders, annual growth in total credit cards averaged 16 per cent in the eight years through March 1991, according to the Japan Consumer Credit Industry Association (JCCIA). By 1989, credit card charges amounted to Y23,000bn, or nearly 10 per cent of personal consumption. Consumer credit firms, bank affiliates and retailers are Japan's leading card issuers. The market share of banks has doubled over the past decade to about 50 per cent of the 180m cards in circulation. All leading firms now offer Visa and MasterCard memberships along with their own name. Visa says Japanese issuers are sending out its cards at a rate of nearly 1,000 per hour. Meanwhile, the consumer credit specialists have held firm, issuing about 20 per cent of new cards, while department stores, petrol and other retailers have lost market share. Saturation is rapidly becoming a problem, however, with 1.5 cards in circulation for every man, woman and child. The result is not surprising: like Japanese companies in many other industries, credit card issuers are turning from a fixation on market share to improving profitability. 'Our growth averaged about 20 per cent over the past five years since we've made strong efforts to expand, but with cards now widespread it will probably be closer to 10 per cent in the near future,' says Mr Shinobu Fukuoka, manager of corporate planning at DC Card, a Mitsubishi Bank group company affiliated to Visa and MasterCard. 'Around the middle of last year the economy and consumer spending began slowing in response to the bursting of the bubble economy, and we're seeing a declining asset effect,' he adds. 'We'll therefore aim for good customers and increased use per customer. In Japan, the average credit card sale is about Y20,000 versus Y5,000 in the US, so use here can rise significantly.' Mr Steve Norris, general manager marketing in the Asia-Pacific region for Visa International, says: 'The slowing in Japan is largely due to a consolidation phase after an incredible increase in the number of cards over the last five years.' Young cardholders are the main focus of marketing efforts at Union Credit, another bank affiliate, according to Mr Mikio Ohkawara. 'They lead the market, but we're also trying to get people in their thirties and forties to use their cards more.' Widespread press reports that excessive credit card use was responsible for last year's surge in personal bankruptcies to the highest level since 1984 are accelerating the shift away from expansion at all costs. Still, the problem appears overblown, given that just 24,000 people went under, including individual proprietors and others hit by economic hard times. Of the total, sour credit card debt was responsible for about 18,000 bankruptcies, estimates Mr Paul Heaton, senior analyst at Smith New Court in Tokyo. 'The problem has been put on the consumer credit companies' door, but that's not fair,' he says. 'Lots of others are issuing credit cards.' At the same time, industry officials concede credit standards have been slack. In their rush to sign up card holders, issuers have required little more than a name, address, income figure and place of work, says DC Card's Mr Fukuoka. The industry is now rushing to install more point-of-sale credit confirmation terminals. However, the tenfold increase since 1984 to 80,000 units and planned doubling again within three years will cover only a fraction of the retail outlets that accept credit cards. Another initiative involves improving credit reporting. In the past, issuers had access only to so-called black information on credit card defaults. The Credit Information Centre (CIC) for the first time this year also is making available 'white' information - loan values outstanding and repayment records among individuals who have not defaulted. This will enable the CIC's 800 member banks, consumer credit firms and car distributors to obtain outstanding card balances and presumably prevent consumers from taking on debt with one card to pay off another. Next June, the CIC will add data on housing loans and other items. Many individual issuers also have cut one-time purchase limits significantly to the Y200,000-Y300,000 range, including lower maximums for young cardholders. Partly in response to US pressure to stoke domestic consumption, Japanese authorities last month granted bank card issuers rights similar to consumer credit firms' to issue revolving credit. DC Card is planning to begin offering such terms from autumn, though 'there are some worries about people delaying payment', says Mr Fukuoka. The Y10bn cost to the industry of setting up computer systems to track revolving balances is another big hurdle, adds Mr Ohkawara. For issuers, interest rates of 13-14 per cent on revolving credit could nevertheless add a large new source of revenue to the 2-3 per cent commissions charged to shops and 28 per cent for loans via automated cash dispensers. A big problem is bad publicity, says Mr Norris: 'Although revolving credit is a major source of revenue in the US, in Japan so many articles have appeared about young people going beyond their means that I don't think anyone is going to take a hard stand until the educational function is carried out on how to use this service.' At the same time, Japan's frugal ways will die hard, argues industry analyst Mr Heaton: 'I don't think it will make a big difference to banks because most people don't want to take on debt. They just want to put off payment until the end of the month,' he says. Even the nation's consumer credit firms, among the largest card issuers with rights going back decades to issue instalment credit have found few takers for this option, he notes. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry's support for revolving credit also seems lukewarm at best, suggesting the movement could take some time to gain momentum, an industry official adds. Financial authorities in other Asian nations are also wary of a credit explosion, given savings and consumption patterns in the west. Although the Visa spokesman said the company faces a 'generally positive regulatory environment,' he cited Singapore's minimum income requirement and South Korea's limits on overseas spending among local constraints on card issuance. Looking to Japan, the most mature market in the region, issuers are finding that wide card distribution and changing demographics will require them to offer unique services. DC Card is looking into making hospital payments and other services through its card, says Mr Fukuoka.</p>

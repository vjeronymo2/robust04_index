			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Enrique Pedroza Flores] </F>   [Text] Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, 14 December--Since last  February the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic  [PGR] and district judges seized approximately 80 farms and 55  residences from presumed drug traffickers in Tamaulipas. This  announcement was made today by the director of the state's  Public Property Register, Francisco Gerardo Campos Martinez.    Although not citing statistics, he claimed that the number  of  confiscations far exceeds those made of landed properties last  year.    This increase is a result of the intensified action on the  part of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic to  combat the drug traffic since Carpizo McGregor became head of  that department.    He stressed: "What has occurred is just a reflection of a  more persistent battle against the drug trade by the PGR."    As for the confiscations, Campos Martinez claimed that most  of the real estate and rural properties involved are located in  the municipalities of Matamoros, Reynosa, Nuevo Laredo, and  Miguel Aleman.    It should be noted that the judges and the PGR will maintain  the impoundments until a determination is made of whether or not  the owners are guilty of the illicit acts charged.    Finally, the official revealed that, in some instances, as  many as two farms and several residences have been seized from a  single presumed drug trafficker.</p>

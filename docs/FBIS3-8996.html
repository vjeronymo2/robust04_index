			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Army General Lyuben Petrov, commander of the </F> Bulgarian Army General Staff, by Neneva Andonova; place and date  not given: "Main Thing Now Is To Remove the Barrier Created by  the Cold War"]    [Text] [Andonova] General, do you seriously think that  Bulgaria will be the first state to join NATO if the Alliance  starts to admit new members?    [Petrov] This is our wish and we would like to think that it  will be so. To judge from the hospitality that we were shown at  NATO Headquarters, and if the Alliance really expands, we could  be optimists and believe that in the near future Bulgaria will  receive a vote of confidence and will be among the first new  NATO members.    [Andonova] Do you think that our state enjoys greater  attention than the other Eastern European states?    [Petrov] I cannot commit myself to assessments as to who is  in first place in NATO's eyes. It is the politicians who must  follow and assess this. From my position as an observer I think  that confidence in Bulgaria is strengthening daily in NATO's  higher structures.    [Andonova] What do you think determines whether a state is  admitted to NATO, the behavior of the candidates or  international circumstances?    [Petrov] The admission of any Eastern European state depends  on NATO's leadership. According to the Washington Charter it  alone can propose and invite new members. Naturally, the  activity of the candidates in strengthening the structures of  international security is of exceptional importance. I think  that NATO will also have other criteria, but I do not want to  dwell on them -- this is not within my scope of activity.    The main thing now is to remove the barrier created by the  Cold War between East and West. We must stop seeing each other  as enemies. Mutual reproaches as to who was guilty are  senseless and obsolete relics, which we must forget.    [Andonova] Has the "old thinking" been overcome in the Army?    [Petrov] We are doing everything possible to overcome the  image of the enemy, especially in the Balkan peninsula, and I  think that we have achieved a lot. However, all the state  institutions must work in the same direction. The contours of  the past have not been fully eliminated.    [Andonova] Where do those contours still exist -- at the  level of the higher leaderships or at the lower levels of the  army's hierarchy?    [Petrov] At all levels.    [Andonova] Do you see common denominators in the military,  regardless of what specific country is involved and of what  specific organization it is a member?    [Petrov] I fully agree that the military has similar  criteria and assessments regarding security, and are equally  concerned with the stability of regions that contain hotbeds of  tension.    [Andonova] Is NATO seriously concerned with the  Yugoconflict?    [Petrov] NATO is following with great concern the events in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and is determining its steps with exceptional  caution. I can say that they are more concerned than the Balkan  states. It may sound strange, but this is what I felt during my  meetings in Brussels.    [Andonova] Is this the reason for NATO's increased attention  toward our country?    [Petrov] Perhaps. They are interested in all the factors  that could influence the conflict, and in the historical factors  in the Balkans. They are carefully observing the behavior and  position of every state in the region regarding the crisis.  From this point of view we really are the object of increased  attention. They assess our position very highly and do not hide  this. I think that Bulgaria's principled position will have an  important role in resolving the conflict.    [Andonova] Why is NATO more concerned than us with the  Yugocrisis?    [Petrov] I have the feeling that people in our country think  that foreign structures and factors will resolve the problem.  The absence of an immediate threat prompts us to assume a calm  posture, and this situation could play a bad joke on us at some  given moment.    [Andonova] Our integration in the international security  structures could be a gradual process. Do you think that from  this point of view the Partnership for Peace initiative has a  serious role?    [Petrov] The new partners must participate in the initiative  in such a way that it could justify the very existence of the  initiative. One cannot speak about integration through the  initiative, but it will strengthen East-West confidence to a  large degree.    The Partnership for Peace has a certain aspect, which  justifiably causes concern among our public and other countries  that have signed the framework document. We all want guarantees  of our security, but the Partnership for Peace initiative does  not provide such guarantees. Both the framework document and  the invitation to participate point out that no guarantees are  assumed. They envisage political consultations under NATO  leadership when security is threatened, but this is no guarantee.    [Andonova] Our country must prepare a document on our  participation in the initiative. Are you informed about the  preparation of this document?    [Petrov] A supradepartmental commission has been  established. Representatives of the Ministries of Defense,  Foreign Affairs, and Finance are on it. The General Staff also  has a basic role in preparing the national program. We must  prepare a realistic and feasible program, even though our  financial means are very limited. As you know, all expenditure  on joint enterprises must be financed by the partners. The  framework document allows every state to determine alone the  degree of its participation. The commission is working hard and  in the near future it will propose a draft to be submitted to  the Council of Ministers and then parliament. Only then could  we talk about real participation.    [Andonova] What does the draft contain more specifically ?    [Petrov] Naturally, certain enterprises could be eliminated  from and others included in the draft. It envisages the  participation of our military representatives in NATO's  Coordinating Center in Mons -- most probably three Bulgarian  officers. We discussed this with the supreme commander of NATO  Allied Forces, General Dowland [title as published]. They even  expressed their considerations on the qualifications of our  officers. We will also have representatives at NATO  Headquarters -- probably politicians or representatives of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense. On the  basis of the national program our military and political  representatives will make proposals and coordinate our  participation in NATO. In addition to forums and consultations  joint training is also envisaged. Since participation in such  enterprises is rather expensive, at this stage we will restrict  ourselves to minimal formations. We will begin at a lower level  and gradually increase the scope of our participation.  Actually, it is to early to reveal the entire draft program.    [Andonova] Is there good coordination between the General  Staff, the Defense Ministry, and the military office of the  president in deciding on participation in joint initiatives?    [Petrov] The Ministry of Defense has made a special decision  to instruct the defense minister to coordinate this activity and  propose a final draft.    [Andonova] My next question is "personal": Are there  serious differences among the leading figures regarding our  behavior toward NATO?    [Petrov] As far as a new element in our relations with NATO  is involved -- the beginning of partnership -- it is normal to  have differences regarding our participation in this initiative.  One should not make any tragedy out of this. The moment the  program is adopted it becomes a national program and thus  obligatory for all the institutions involved. I cannot commit  myself to assessing the various positions, but if everything is  determined without comparing different positions we could not  speak about democracy.    [Andonova] Are we left with any choice after joining the  international security system, for example, outside the  Partnership for Peace initiative?    [Petrov] So far we have achieved a lot on the bilateral  foundation for strengthening confidence with NATO -- with all  states, including European states outside NATO. The Partnership  for Peace initiative allows for cooperation on multilateral  foundation and expands the scope of activities without  restricting bilateral contacts.    [Andonova] With which NATO members will we have the most  active contacts?    [Petrov] We will continue to develop our relations with our  neighbors Greece and Turkey very actively, and also with  Belgium. It is with Belgium of all the other Western European  states that we have the best mutual relations and close  cooperation. Confidence between us is at the highest level.  One of our officers worked for three months on the General  Staff of the Belgian Army. We have become acquainted at very  close range with their military structures and the organization  of their work. We have much in common in anything related to  the number of population and the size of the army. We also have  similar problems in implementing the reform -- the Belgians are  advancing toward a professional army. For the time being only  the United States, the UK, and Luxembourg have such armies. All  other countries only claim that they will advance toward this.  Belgium is the first to make serious steps toward this and its  experience will be very useful to us.    [Andonova] You also were received by NATO's political  leadership, visited SHAPE -- NATO's supreme headquarters in  Europe -- and met with the chief of the Belgian General Staff.  What were the most important elements of your visit?    [Petrov] You see what the level of the meetings was -- there  was not a single secondary or unimportant talk. At joint  briefings at the headquarters and the Supreme Command we were  briefed in detail about NATO's structure and tasks under the new  international conditions, and on the envisaged cooperation with  the new partners. We briefed them on the progress of the reform  in the Bulgarian Army. Actually, they are well informed about  our military doctrine. We were flattered by the exceptionally  positive reaction of specialists of the highest rank regarding  the context of our military doctrine and its European spirit.  In SHAPE in Mons we discussed with General Dowland and top  officers future cooperation in the military sphere and within  the Partnership for Peace initiative. The supreme commander  himself showed us the building in which our officers will work.  The offices, halls, and so forth are ready. Generally, I saw  real soldiers and real professionals at NATO Headquarters.    My last meeting was with my Belgian colleague, General  Charlier. We visited a mechanized brigade and were briefed on  details related to its transition toward professionalism. We  saw the training of pilots at air force bases. We also viewed  the training of a "blue helmets" unit that will be sent to  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Andonova] Were you informed about NATO's intentions  regarding Macedonia?    [Petrov] We asked both at NATO's headquarters and in Mons  what additional steps they envisage regarding former Yugoslavia.  The answer was -- "what the politicians decide." As all  military everywhere, they will carry out any orders that they  receive. We are no different -- we too implement political  decisions. In this respect I see absolutely no difference in  our positions.    [Andonova] Do Bulgarian politicians have a correct attitude  toward you?    [Petrov] I do not want to evaluate them. I have only one  wish -- that they really are more precise in working out their  decisions.</p>

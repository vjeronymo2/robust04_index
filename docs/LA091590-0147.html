			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NUTS AND BOLTS;  </P> <P> FORMICA NOT JUST FOR THE KRAMDENS ANYMORE  </P> <P> Formica, traditionally, has had about the same effect on Americans as jail.  We'll concede that it's probably necessary in the public sector, but we  wouldn't want it anywhere near our house.  </P> <P> When it first appeared in the 1950s, Formica was the interior lineman of  building materials: functional, durable and nobody's idea of subtle beauty,  able to withstand heroic amounts of grime and still come clean. It was the  roadside diner's shield against the world, covering countertops from coast to  coast with low-maintenance -- but nonetheless ghastly -- colors, reeking of  fried onions and Pine-Sol.  </P> <P> In the home, however, Formica was strictly for the Kramdens. It was the table  top of choice for people with children who threw food. You could hose it down,  but you didn't want to put the Waterford on it.  </P> <P> Today, however, you can use that veteran laminate material in your kitchen and  bathroom without risking turning them into a knockoff of every beanery in the  world named EAT. Formica has gone uptown.  </P> <P> Don't worry; it's still Formica. It's still resistant to most of the slings and  arrows of outrageous fortune, like strained beets and certain low-impact  kitchen explosions. But instead of looking like the centerpiece of a cartoon  nightmare, with swirls here and whirls there, all on a background of thundering  yellow, today's Formica can be had in such incarnations as Nile Dorian Marble,  Bronze Lacque Metallique and Vicuna Milano Stripe.  </P> <P> "The patterns and the colors have been so expanded that now you have a rainbow  of things to work with," said Mary Knott, a residential space planner and owner  of Mary Fisher Designs in San Marino.  </P> <P> Knott, who will speak about the uses of Formica at the Orange County Interior  Design and Home Decorating Show at the Orange County Fairgrounds on Sept. 22  and 23, said the popularity of the original Formica was diluted not only by the  limited designs available at the time, but by cheap imitations.  </P> <P> "The patterns they came out with at the time, like the boomerang pattern, for  instance, were very Art Deco, with blues and pinks and yellows, and the  appliances then followed suit in that color range," Knott said. "They were  quite limited and they didn't have the subtle color changes they do now. And,  as with many other things, mass merchandisers get knockoffs that are made from  cheap materials and use them in a way that those materials were never meant to  be used."  </P> <P> What can you use Formica for now? Just about anything except a floor covering,  Knott said.  </P> <P> "So many people think of laminate materials strictly as countertops," she said.  "But one of the best surfaces to use it on is cabinetry. That and wall  surfacing is where I think you're going to see more and more builders and  contractors using it."  </P> <P> Unlike the plain vanilla days, this doesn't mean simply slapping a sheet of  Formica on a surface, said Knott. The Formica Corp. has come up with a laminate  material they call Colorcore that is "solid color all the way through. You can  literally layer these materials and make all kinds of incredible designs. The  only limitations are your imagination and your pocketbook."  </P> <P> The traditional Formica laminate -- which is still available -- is bonded to a  dark-colored backing that is revealed when the material is cut at, say, the  edge of a counter. Colorcore is the same thickness, but the backing is  eliminated. The color is solid throughout.  </P> <P> "You can bevel it, you can round it off, you can do any kind of edge treatment  you want," Knott said. "You can take layers of it and make striping and banding  and wild stuff like pin stripes and make very creative looks."  </P> <P> How creative? Any shape you can cut is fair game. Knott said she had heard of  one application on a wall that involved layering the laminate and cutting one  layer to resemble ripped construction paper.  </P> <P> Also, she said, it's possible to pile on multiple layers and then cut geometric  designs through the layers with a router, allowing all the colors to show  through at the cuts.  </P> <P> But kids, don't try this yourself.  </P> <P> "The key is to have a good fabricator who has worked with the material and is  familiar with the proper tools," Knott said.  </P> <P> "You have to have a fabricator who's willing to take time and work with you and  who knows all the wild stuff you can do with laminates. It really has to be  handled with particular tools, so the best thing to do is to go through the  trade."  </P> <P> This generally means going to a cabinet shop, rather than a lumberyard or home  center.  </P> <P> The more generalized stores may carry some laminates, but the variety probably  will be limited, Knott said.  </P> <P> Formica isn't inexpensive. Price depends on the type and style of the material.  But, said Knott, "it's not as (expensive) as some of the natural materials  around. It's about neck-and-neck with wood."  </P> <P> Not all Formica is doggedly contemporary, though, which ought to be good news  for nostalgia buffs and people bent on re-creating Pop's Malt Shoppe in their  den. In the back of the Formica color catalogue are four pages of examples with  names like Neo Papercraft and Sorbet and Moonstone Papyrus.  </P> <P> But there, at the top of the last page, is an example called Rosetta Boomerang.  </P> <P> It's a deep pink shot through with intersecting yellow, blue and lavender  parabolas. The kind of design you would have seen in Tomorrowland 35 years ago,  a style that was known as futuristic when jet propulsion was new, the stuff  that surely must have covered Buck Rogers' bathroom countertops.  </P> <P> Formica kept it, bless them. The classics never die.  </P></p>

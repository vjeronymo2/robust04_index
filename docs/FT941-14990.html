			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Laws planned for media changes The government made clear yesterday that it is determined to create a legislative framework to cope with the 'multi-media future' - the merging of industries such as computing, entertainment and telecommunications. Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, speaking two weeks after announcing a review of cross-media ownership, said the government would be negligent if it did not create a framework for such changes. A vast new marketplace was developing and the government was determined to ensure there were British stallholders, he said. Broadcasting was a national resource of the greatest importance. He added: 'I would be negligent in my duty if I looked at purely commercial arguments at the expense of cultural. Equally, a short-sighted clinging to the status quo and a failure to recognise the changing needs of the industry would be self-defeating.' Newsprint and videotape were powerful weapons and could do great harm 'in the wrong hands or concentrated too heavily in too few hands'. Mr Brooke said the UK could look forward to the multi-media future with confidence because of the strength of its programme-making, its advanced digital and satellite technology and the 'vibrancy' of its national newspaper market. The review of cross-media ownership is expected to take at least six months.</p>

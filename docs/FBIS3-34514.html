			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>   [Text] Amman--The government will ask the general  prosecutor to investigate charges raised by Minister of Health  'Abd al-Rahim Malhas that a good quantity of food and medicine  that reaches the market is unfit for consumption, Prime Minister  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said Sunday [6 February].    Dr. al-Majali said the government would provide the general  prosecutor with all information it has on the case and ask him  to collect other relevant information from the public and the  Lower House of Parliament.    Instructions will be issued to all government departments to  "put all official documents they have at the disposal of the  general prosecutor," Dr al-Majali told the House at the end of a  three-day session held to discuss Dr. Malhas' charges that  appeared in a weekly tabloid over two weeks ago.    Dr. al-Majali said people suspected of violating regulations  related to food and medicine standards would be referred to  court.    House Speaker Tahir al-Masri asked the Public Freedoms and  General Health committees to provide the House with a report on  the results of investigations that they have launched into the  issue in two weeks.    "The executive authority has prime responsibility in  initiating reform and taking immediate and decisive measures (on  the food and medicine situation). The responsibilities of the  (House) are no less important and the House has to shoulder them  through following up and monitoring the measures the government  will take and putting them in the right direction," Mr. al-Masri  said at the end of the session in which 37 deputies spoke on Dr.  Malhas' charges.    "If it becomes necessary, the House will take all measures  that the Constitution and laws make available to it (to ensure  this)," Mr. al-Masri said.    Mr. al-Masri said the public's response to Dr. al-Malhas'  charges show their thirst for reform in all government agencies,  and asserted that the House would continue to check the  government's actions "in all fields."    Twenty-seven out of the 37 deputies who spoke on the issue  supported Dr. Malhas, while seven severely criticised him for  "failing" to substantiate his charges and not presenting a  reform programme. Four legislators adopted neutrality but  demanded thorough investigations into the charges that have  landed the government in its worst political crisis since it won  the confidence of the house in December.    Many opposition deputies lashed out at the government during  the debate, saying the government was "incapable" of initiating  reform. Over 19 deputies, including the Islamic Action Front's  (IAF) members, urged a vote of no-confidence in the government  over the issue.    Deputies who opposed Dr. Malhas criticised him for failing  to  go through "proper channels" to raise the issue, failing to  prove his charges and shaking public confidence in the safety of  food and medicine and "hurting Jordan's reputation and its  national economy."    Those who supported the minister expressed appreciation of  his "courage" in speaking out about alleged corruption and  determination to fight what he described as a "mafia" of drug  and food merchants who sought fast profits at the expense of the  people and their safety.    Some deputies lashed out at the Ministry of Supply for  allegedly allowing the entry of shipments of sub-standard food  into the market, with one lawmaker saying he would request a  "general discussion" of the situation at the ministry in order  to investigate alleged cases of violations of the law.    In his speech to the House, Dr. al-Majali reaffirmed the  government's commitment to protect the citizens in cooperation  with the House. But he took a firm stand against deputies who  questioned his cabinet's abilities and determination to fight  corruption and bring about reform.    Responding to the severe criticism that deputies made of his  cabinet, Dr. al-Majali said some deputies seized "the  opportunity to shake the status of the government. But we say  here in front of you (that) we hide nothing from you and have  provided you with all (the information) you demanded... we have  nothing to hide or to fear."    Dr. al-Majali said some deputies were still addressing the  government with slanderous language.    "But we will not respond to these accusations and will stick  to (proper) norms of talking... out of our concern for  consolidating democracy," which benefitted from the debate that  took place in the House over Dr. Malhas' allegations, Dr.  al-Majali told the lawmakers.    Dr. al-Majali said that cases of corruption and abuse of  office in Jordan were an exception, saying that they do not  exceed similar violations in any other country.    "I assure you that our food is safe and that our medicine is  safe," said Dr. al-Majali.    But, he said, the government would take more measures to  ensure the safety of food and medicine and raise the standards  governing the safety and quality of food and medicine.    He said the government would prepare draft laws to establish  separate food and medicine directorates and to prevent  monopolies in producing and marketing food and medicine.    He said the government had asked the finance minister to  take  measures against medicine merchants if it was proven that they  charged exorbitant profits.    In comments to the press and later in a speech to the House,  Dr. Malhas said there was a deficiency in laws governing the  sale of drug and food in the country and some traders were  reaping exorbitant profits.    In a response to the deputies' speeches on Sunday, Dr.  Malhas  reiterated these charges but said the Ministry of Health, with  the suport of the government, had started a process of reform  that would plug all loopholes in legislations.    "The government will not allow the entry (into the market)  of  any food and medicine shipments that does not meet (standards  and specifications)," Dr. Malhas told the House.    Dr. Malhas said the ministry in 1993 referred thousands of  violators of the law to courts and would continue to take  measures against any new violations.    Dr. Malhas denied that he was in disagreement with the prime  minister over the need to fight corruption. He reiterated  earlier statements that the disagreement with Dr. al-Majali that  he mentioned in his press interview was restricted to the  interpretation of the law on pharmacies.    Dr. al-Majali also denied that he had any differences over  the issue with the health minister.    Former Minister of Health and serving Deputy 'Arif  al-Batayinah agreed with Dr. Malhas that pressure was  "sometimes" applied on the Ministry of Health but said available  laws empower the minister to resist such pressures.    Dr. al-Batayinah cited incidents that occurred during his  work as minister of health and director of the Royal Medical  Services to prove that laws were sufficient to ensure the safety  of food and medicine and to refer violators of the law to courts.    He also confirmed that foreign countries sometimes apply  pressure to get their exports to Jordan approved for sale,  citing an alleged threat by the Indian minister of trade that if  Jordan did not approve an already rejected shipment of Indian  meat, "our exports of phosphates will be negatively affected."    But as minister of health, he said, he rejected the shipment  and nobody could force him to accept it.    "Wouldn't it have been better for the health minister to  refer the violators to court unless a certain group prevented  him from using his authority," said Dr. al-Batayinah.    Deputy Nazih al-'Ammarin, who pledged support for Dr.  Malhas,  also provided examples to show the drug merchants charge  exorbitant profits. He said manufacturing, importing and sale  of medicine were in the hands of few "sharks" who resist reform.    "There is a confidence gap between the citizens and  officials  and hence is the big noise that this issue has caused," said  Deputy Muhammad Abu-'Alim, voicing support for Dr. Malhas in the  fight against corruption.    "I thanked God when I heard about the food and medicine that  are unfit for consumption because most people in the Jordan  Valley do not eat meat," said Deputy Jamil al-Hushush in a  reference to poverty in his constituency.    "Our children do not drink powered milk," said Mr.  al-Hushush  as about 20 farmers from the valley declared a hunger-strike to  demand measures to help them fight poverty in what they called a  "disaster area."</p>

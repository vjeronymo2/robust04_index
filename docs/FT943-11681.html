			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Reynolds faces beef report A report on alleged irregularities in the Irish beef trade is due to be presented to the Irish government today, with potentially embarrassing repercussions for Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, who was agriculture minister during some of the period under investigation. The report is expected to answer questions raised during the inquiry regarding Mr Reynolds' prudence in providing unprecedented levels of export credit insurance for beef exports to Iraq. Mr Dick Spring, foreign minister, who leads the Labour half of a coalition government with Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail party, is understood to have made allegations about Mr Reynolds in evidence given to the inquiry, which sat between June 1991 and July 1993. The Irish government will discuss the findings of the inquiry, which is understood to have cost IPounds 25m (Pounds 24.7m), at a special meeting next week.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Environmental Achievement 1993: Boilers that make the air less noxious - FKI Babcock Robey FKI Babcock Robey, based at Oldbury in the West Midlands, won an environmental achievement award for developing the Euronox range of low-emission high-efficiency boilers. The boilers, which can burn gas or oil, are designed for general industrial and commercial purposes in the 1 MW to 30 MW range. They cut emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 55 to 60 per cent, while improving operating efficiency by 2 to 3 per cent. NOx is one of the main ingredients in industrial air pollution. Along with sulphur dioxide, NOx causes acid rain. In damp winter conditions it can lead to a corrosive acid fog such as London experienced in December 1991, aggravating asthma and other respiratory conditions. And in summer sunshine NOx undergoes a photochemical reaction with hydrocarbon pollutants, which lead to Los Angeles-style smog - a toxic mixture of ozone, NOx, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and other pollutants. Although vehicle emissions have become the largest source of NOx in most industrialised countries, steam and hot water boilers such as those made by Robey are an important contributor. Robey, boiler manufacturing subsidiary of the FKI engineering group, started developing its low NOx technology about three years ago, says Andy Michel, managing director. The Euronox range was launched 18 months ago. 'We don't know of any other manufacturer in Europe that has anything like our performance figures for NOx and for efficiency,' Mr Michel says. The new boilers are working better than Robey engineers had predicted, he adds, 'and we don't yet know why'. But in general terms the reason why Euronox boilers produce less pollution than their conventional equivalents is that their combustion conditions are less intense. In technical language, they use a two-stage temperature reduction system to cool the recirculated gas prior to its injection into the burner fan inlet. As a result, Euronox boilers are larger than normal, with more elaborate pipework and controls. 'There is a price premium for the technology of about 15 to 20 per cent,' Mr Michel says. 'But if you look at the customer's actual cost of ownership he will get a pay-back in about a year as a result of the increased efficiency.' A typical Euronox system with three 5 MW boilers has been running for six months at Nottingham University, where it supplies all hot water for the main campus. Its gas-fired operating efficiency is 82 1/2 per cent - compared to 80 per cent expected for the best conventional boilers. And its NOx emissions are 35 parts per million, rather than 100 ppm. Robey engineers are now working to extend the Euronox technology, both upwards to the huge boilers required to make steam in power stations and downwards to the household boilers used for domestic hot water and central heating.</p>

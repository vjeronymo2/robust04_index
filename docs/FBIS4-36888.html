			<p>BFN     [Text] Faysal al-Husayni is establishing a shadow  government in East Jerusalem to be made up of nine ministries.  A Palestinian source told our correspondent Moti Amir that the  shadow government will be headed by a prime minister, two deputy  prime ministers, and a financial inspector general who will deal  with the expenses of the government and coordinate it with the  expenditures of the Palestinian Authority in the self-rule  areas. The shadow government will also include a political  affairs ministry and a defense and general security ministry,  contrary to the Palestinian Authority in the self-rule areas.</p>

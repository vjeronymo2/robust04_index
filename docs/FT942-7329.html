			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UDM joins Edwards bidding consortium The Union of Democratic Mineworkers yesterday formed a powerful bidding partnership with the former commercial director of British Coal as it emerged that each of the country's mining regions is likely to attract at least three tenders. The UDM consortium with Mr Malcolm Edwards and Coal Investments, the quoted company he heads, is to consider bidding for the three English regions in the forthcoming privatisation. Coal Investments is thought to be bidding for the south Wales region - but without the UDM. If the consortium decides to proceed it is likely to face competition from bidders including RJB Mining, Ryan Group and at least two management buy-out teams. By yesterday, the final day to register an interest, each of the regions for sale had attracted at least four potential bidders. However, some companies  -such as RTZ, the world's biggest mining company - are thought unlikely to make a bid after studying what is on offer. The UDM decided to link with Coal Investments after its original partner, Jim Walter Resources, withdrew due to problems in the US. Mr Edwards said workers would be offered shares in the group. The following lists some of the parties thought to have registered to 'pre-qualify' to bid. Scotland: Mining (Scotland); Ryan and Miller joint venture; Caledonian Mining; RJB Mining; RTZ. North-east: Ryan/Alcan joint venture; UDM/Coal Investments; management buy-out team led by Mr Bob Siddall, British Coal opencast director; Caledonian; RJB; RTZ. Central North: UDM/Coal Investments; management buy-out team led by Mr Alan Houghton, regional director; management buy-out team led by Mr Siddall; RJB; RTZ. Central south: UDM/Coal Investments; management buy-out team led by Mr Siddall; RJB; RTZ. South Wales: management buy-out team led by Mr Bryan Riddleston, opencast director in south Wales; RJB; Coal Investments; Ryan Group; Caledonian. Companies have paid Pounds 15,000 for each pre-qualification registration and another Pounds 5,000 in regard to stand-alone mines which British Coal has closed but is offering for sale. Bidding is expected in September.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Albino Cehic from the Croatian Government </F> building in Zagreb]    [Text] Official talks between a delegation of the Romanian  Government, headed by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, and a  delegation of the Croatian Government, headed by Prime Minister  Nikica Valentic are under way here. Soon after his arrival in  Zagreb, the Romanian prime minister laid a wreath at the  monument to the Croatian homeland in Medvedgrad. As I have just  said, the official talks are now underway. The talks are  focused on economic issues.    After the high-ranking officials of the two delegations were  introduced, Prime Minister Valentic informed his eminent guest  about great changes in the Croatian economy. In his  introductory speech, Valentic said that there are no political  or economic problems between Croatia and Romania. The two prime  ministers agreed that this is a precondition for doing more in  the econmic sphere, because possibilities abound. In this  respect, trade should be developed despite the fact that Croatia  is not yet completely free.    The Romanian delegation will stay in Croatia until Wednesday  [8 June], when agreements on marine transport and the protection  of investments will be signed.    Talks between economic experts of the two delegations will  soon open in the Croatian Economic Chamber. Later today the  guests from Romania will visit the president of the Assembly,  Nedjeljko Mihanovic, and the mayor of Zagreb, Branko Miksa.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters also criticized &sect;287.9(b) for failing to specify procedures to be followed in the investigation of a shooting incident involving a Service officer and for failing to provide specific rules regarding loss or theft of an approved firearm, inventory controls on firearms and ammunition, and care and storage of firearms and ammunition. Section 287.9(b) of the proposed rule stated that these matters would be addressed in guidelines promulgated by the Commissioner. It is the view of the Department that since all of these matters relate to internal administration, review, and discipline, the level of detail suggested by the commenters is not appropriate for administrative rulemaking, but should be addressed through operational guidelines. The requirement that these matters be governed according to guidelines promulgated by the Commissioner satisfies the congressional mandate set forth in section 503 of IMMACT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters also criticized the authorization in &sect;287.9(b) for Service officers to carry personally owned firearms while on duty, claiming that this will blur the distinction between official and personal use of firearms and inhibit Service control over the use of firearms. The proposed rule required that all firearms, including those personally owned, be approved subject to guidelines to be promulgated by the Commissioner. The authority to utilize a Service-approved, personally owned weapon is needed to respond to the physical diversity of the Service law enforcement workforce, including specific individual characteristics such as the size of an agent's hand. For example, many firearms do not comfortably fit in some smaller or larger hands. Accordingly, the rule is designed to allow flexibility while assuring that each individual agent's firearm has been approved. This is consistent with Departmental policy for the law enforcement community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 287.8(a)(1)_Non-Deadly Force <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters criticized the rule for providing insufficient guidelines on the use of non-deadly force and insufficient inducements for the use of control devices, such as stun guns and gas guns, that do not inflict bodily injury. The commenters also stated that the rule should provide specific requirements for the use of self-defense equipment, including bullet-proof vests and helmets, by Service officers. The Service issues batons, tear gas, bullet proof vests, and helmets to law enforcement agents, as appropriate, and as appropriated funds permit; the Service does not issue stun guns, gas guns, or other such devices for routine law enforcement purposes. The Service and the Department agree that immigration officers should be trained in a broad range of options in the use of force in order to handle varying situations, that the use of lethal force should be minimized, and that Service officers should be minimized, and that Service officers should be furnished with self-protection equipment and techniques. Such standards cannot be appropriately addressed in rulemaking because of the numerous contingencies that are involved. Service officers are trained in such matters and receive updates in their training to incorporate new law enforcement techniques and new protective devices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 287.8(a)(2)_Deadly Force <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters stated that deadly force is an extreme measure and should only be used when an officer reasonably believes it is necessary in defense of human life, including the life of the officer or any person in immediate threat of serious physical harm. To this end, the commenters stated that the rule should require specialized training in specific types of situations to offer guidance to the officer in order to minimize the use of deadly force. Training should include ethics, human rights, and alternatives to the use of force and firearms. ``Reasonable belief'' and ``serious bodily injury'' should be defined, according to the commenters, by current judicial standards. The commenters stated that the rule should require that where use of deadly force is likely, the officer should give a warning and allow sufficient time for the warning to be obeyed, but only when the officer or other persons are not at risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees with many of these suggestions. Furthermore, the rule is consistent with the Department's interpretation of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tennessee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  versus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Garner,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 471 U.S. 1 (1985), and its progeny, as applied to the missions of the respective Service officers. However, the Department disagrees that these issues can be appropriately addressed in this rule. As stated previously, Service training standards on the use of force are in accordance with prevailing guidelines for all federal law enforcement officials. These guidelines include provisions addressing the issues identified by the commenters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

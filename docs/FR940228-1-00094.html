			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary solicits comments on other ways of measuring staff adequacy at newly participating institutions, institutions that change ownership resulting in a change of control and participating institutions with documented administrative problems as well as any other categories of institutions that should be subject to requirements for specific staffing levels. The Secretary further invites comment on how such considerations as the size of the institution, and the volume of Title IV, HEA program funds administered by the institution should determine the number or ratio of financial aid staff that the Secretary should prescribe. For example, the Secretary wishes to know whether a reasonable ratio of staff to applicants or recipients can be established, and, if so, what that ratio might be. The Secretary understands the difficulty inherent in strict application of a quantitative formula; nevertheless, concern was expressed at the negotiated rulemaking sessions about having an adequate basis on which to make fair, worthwhile, and consistent judgments of administrative capability. The Secretary recognizes that appropriate staffing levels must include staff not only in the financial aid office but also in the business office or other offices within an institution, and that the use of third-party servicers and office automation have a bearing on those levels. The Secretary asks commenters to address these factors in their recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to require that to be considered administratively capable, an institution have written procedures, or other written information covering, at a minimum, the nature and frequency of communication of information among all the offices that have an impact on the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs and the responsibilities of various offices with respect to the awarding and delivery of Title IV, HEA program funds and reports to the Secretary. The Secretary encourages institutions to have specific written procedures where possible, preferably in procedural manuals, for this purpose. However, the Secretary recognizes that some of the information might be found in catalogs, student or administrative handbooks, or other sources. The Secretary is proposing to add these provisions because audits and program reviews of Title IV, HEA programs administered by institutions have shown that lack of written procedures in these key areas is frequently a contributing factor to a lack of proper controls, resulting in overawards and inadequate accounting of expenditures. To ensure that only eligible students receive funds and in the correct amount, and that borrowers are tracked accurately and timely, it is essential that each institution be clear about how and when pertinent information is transmitted from one office to another. The proposed addition to the regulations includes examples of the types of information to be transmitted. Similarly, it is critical that each office that is responsible for the approval and disbursement or delivery of Title IV, HEA funds have in writing that office's responsibilities and reporting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to clarify what constitutes division of the authorizing and disbursing or delivering functions by adding an example. In the past, there has been virtually no real separation of these duties in some institutions; this situation has presented an opportunity for significant abuse. It is important that two different individuals authorize and disburse or deliver payment, and that an individual performing one of these functions not have control over the work activities of the person or persons performing the other. To guard against collusion, it is also critical that the individuals not be members of the same family or exercise substantial control over the institution through a combined ownership interest in the institution. The terms  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> substantial control <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ownership interest <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are currently defined in &sect;668.13. The Secretary considers two individuals to exercise substantial control through a ``combined'' ownership interest if the individuals hold  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> together <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at least a 25 percent ownership interest in the institution. Thus, an institution would be precluded from having one individual with a 10 percent ownership interest who awards Title IV, HEA program assistance and another individual with a 15 percent ownership interest who disburses the funds. This concept is designed to allow for those employees who participate to a moderate degree in a profit-sharing plan to be employed in one of the capacities described in this provision without having a detrimental impact on the institution's administrative capability. Finally, the Secretary wishes to clarify that, under both current regulations and the proposed regulations, it is acceptable for a check that is to be disbursed or delivered to a student by another office to pass through the office that authorizes payment, as long as the office that authorizes payment does no more than deliver the check to the office responsible for disbursement or delivery to the student. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

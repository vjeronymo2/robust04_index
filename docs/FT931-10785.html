			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Man in the news: This is your captain speaking . . . - The career and character of the next executive chairman of British Airways Sir Colin Marshall yesterday assumed complete command of the flight deck at British Airways almost 10 years to the day after climbing aboard as first officer. It is the job he has always wanted, though one which, in the final countdown, could have eluded him. As the 'dirty tricks' row with Virgin Atlantic escalated, there seemed a chance that Sir Colin - too often second-in-command in previous jobs  - could be deprived of total control as pressure mounted for a separation of the chairman's and chief executive's responsibilities. Having apparently made clear to colleagues his determination to have full executive responsibility, or none at all, he has won the prize and the challenge of leading 'the world's favourite airline' into its next, ambitious phase of development. His victory means that after a decade of loyal allegiance alongside Lord King, who steps down in the wake of the damaging dog-fight with Virgin, the responsibility is finally his. It is one he will relish. Unlike Lord King, Sir Colin has never been the flamboyant type. The Marshall-King partnership, perceived as a successful duo in the airline industry, will not be repeated now that Mr Robert Ayling becomes group managing director. Mr Ayling, with initially a legal then civil service background as a former under-secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry, is, if anything, even more understated than Sir Colin. There will be no doubt about who is in charge. Mr Ayling is more likely to play the role of consigliere, or chief adviser. His legal experience and familiarity with civil aviation's regulatory background, his DTI background and his willingness to promote bold marketing manoeuvres such as last year's 'World's Biggest Offer', confirmed him as front-runner for number two. If Sir Colin is not a showman he has demonstrated that he is at least a 'mucker-in'. He looked slightly uncomfortable on the cat-walk last week, surrounded by stewardesses and sun-tanned flight attendants, as he presided over the launch of new uniforms for BA staff. Up early in the morning and working sometimes an 18-hour day, a stickler for detail, and performing all the necessary public functions to further his airline's cause, Sir Colin is clearly more at ease inside a corporate executive suite than mingling with models. He is the image of the hard-nosed, US-style businessman. But although he sets high standards, he is also informal and is known throughout the airline as Colin. Lord King recruited him as chief executive in February 1983. He was plucked from Sears after a recommendation by Mr Miles Broadbent of Norman Broadbent, the headhunters. 'Colin has got customer service ingrained into him in the shipping business, in the car business, and working for Sears. Service, service, service, service, that's what he's all about,' says Mr Broadbent. His US corporate experience and concentration on the customer could be one reason why he was considered by American Express to run its travel-related services division two years ago. More recently, he was contacted by Amex and sounded out about the job of group chief executive. Executives at the travel and financial services company say he was a leading outside contender for the job, but the Virgin episode is understood to have cast a cloud over his candidacy. His career had started humbly enough. When he left University College School, Hampstead, Sir Colin joined the Orient Steam Navigation Company as a cadet purser. He became deputy purser of the SS Orsova, voyaging between England and Australia; 'like running a big hotel', he said later. It was in the US, however, that his career took off, when he joined the car rental business of Hertz Corporation in Chicago as assistant to the vice-president of administration. In six years of managing Hertz operations in various parts of the world, the company remained unchallenged as Europe's leading car rental company. He was to change all that, however, when he was poached by Avis and began to transform its service image. Male staff were given red jackets and badges saying 'We Try Harder'. Within eight years, under Sir Colin's leadership, Avis passed Hertz in European sales and earnings. It was during his stint at Avis that Sir Colin forged what was then a valued relationship, but which later at BA became a potential Achilles heal. He prized the qualities of Mr Michael Levin so highly that he brought him in as a personal consultant when he joined BA from Sears. Mr Levin, who died in late 1991, has been described by some observers as the architect of a new aggressiveness at BA that was ultimately to cost its reputation dearly amid the accusations of 'dirty tricks' which led to the Virgin Atlantic fiasco. One observer went so far as to describe Mr Levin as 'the dark side to Colin's moon'. If such a dark side exists, some light may soon be shed on this enigmatic figure. He was an avid note taker and his BA files are reported to have been put up for auction by a New York lawyer. Mr Levin, who once occupied an adjoining office to Sir Colin, was dismissed from BA in late 1989 after a secretary brought a sexual harassment suit in the US. BA eventually settled the Dollars 5m court action. His name could have emerged again had the Virgin libel action continued, since it appeared in notes compiled by Mr Branson in his personal notebook. The spectre of his former adviser has proved an irritant not only to Sir Colin, but to other directors, some of whom seem at a loss to explain his apparent influence during his time at BA. Leaving aside the legacy of Levin's management style and the Virgin debacle  -and it is far from clear yet whether BA has put both behind it - Sir Colin needs to restore morale quickly. BA is currently engaged on several international fronts, pursuing its globalisation strategy as well as having to cope with the current airline industry recession. Global expansion has been the second phase of Sir Colin's overall strategy. The first priority when he joined Lord King was to transform BA's essentially engineering and operational culture into a market-driven one. The real problem with BA, he once wrote, was that the airline 'had forgotten that it was a service industry'. One of the first things he did at BA was to put everyone, starting with himself, through customer service training. 'He leads by example,' observed one former BA consultant. While taking a lead among European carriers in restructuring the airline, with sweeping job cuts and strong emphasis on holding down costs, Sir Colin sought to tailor its operations to its different markets. With retailing experience gleaned as deputy chief executive of Sears, the company he joined after Avis, he brought the concept of branding to BA with the launch of products like Club World and Club Europe. The emphasis was on detail. 'One of the most important tasks in any service business is to keep the shine on the product day in and day out,' he once said. With BA transformed from the airline universally known as 'Bloody Awful' to what is generally acknowledged as one of the world's most efficient airlines, Sir Colin turned his attention to forging international partnerships and investments. BA's record in this respect has met with mixed fortunes, winning stakes in some airlines, like Qantas, but failing to buy into operators like KLM and Sabena. It now believes it has clinched a USAir partnership despite some US opposition to the deal. Though fiercely ambitious, Sir Colin is quietly spoken, controls his emotions and rarely gives anything away. He is a tough negotiator with a knack for remembering people's names. Those who work with him describe him as 'a very straight man who plays it down the middle'. He is essentially a private man who keeps his family life separate from that of his business, though his daughter, Joanna, did gain her pilot's licence at the BA flying school. Away from work, he is also a sports enthusiast, fond of tennis and ski-ing and a supporter of Arsenal football club. Surprisingly, for a man born and educated in London, he retains a love of Rugby League, the gritty northern professional game, that he developed while spending time with his father in Wigan. Back in the boardroom, the quest is on for a restoration of normality. The board acted swiftly yesterday to secure the succession to Lord King, and to put into place checks and balances to ensure further misdemeanours are avoided or rooted out. In the meantime, peace talks between BA and Virgin continue, and both sides hope for an early and successful conclusion. Another falling-out could spell more trouble, with Virgin pursuing in the US and European courts its allegations of unfair treatment at BA's hands. Virgin was not the first airline to feel the hot breath of BA. It happened to Sir Freddie Laker, who was compensated in the courts in 1985 only after his business collapsed in 1982. The lesson was not lost on Mr Branson when Sir Freddie warned him: 'For God's sake sue them before they put you out of business rather than afterwards.' Though some people might have forgotten the Sky Train battle, Mr Branson has not. He christened one of his aircraft the Spirit of Sir Freddie. He will invoke that spirit to haunt Sir Colin wherever he can. Report by Richard Donkin, Paul Betts and Michael Cassell</p>

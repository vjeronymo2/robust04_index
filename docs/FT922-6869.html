			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Shephard creates women's policy unit MRS GILLIAN SHEPHARD, the employment secretary, yesterday announced the creation of a group to advise her on women's issues. Its first task will be preparing to carry out the manifesto pledge on after-school and holiday child care. She said the schemes would be set up through the Training and Enterprise Councils, and emphasised that the approach to dealing with barriers to women at work would be through persuasion. 'I don't think compulsion; legislation; extra burdens do anything to help the cause of women,' Mrs Shephard said. She did, however, indicate that she had already talked to the Equal Opportunities Commission, and would look at its conclusions on how existing legislation was unsatisfactory. A cabinet committee on women's issues will be created from the ashes of the former ministerial group on the subject. Members of the group to advise Mrs Shephard are: Lady Elspeth Howe; Ms Joanna Foster, who chairs the EOC; Ms Sue Slipman, director of the Council for One-Parent Families; Baroness Denton, a trade and industry minister; Ms Sue Rostad, chairman and managing director of Poppies UK, a franchise cleaning company; Mr Peter Davis, chairman and chief executive of Reed International; Ms Sheila Forbes, group personnel director of Storehouse; Ms Kay Coleman, chief executive of Harvey's &amp; Co (Clothing); Mr Graham Millar, managing director of Rowntree Mackintosh Confectionery; Dr Susan MacRae, senior fellow of the Policy Studies Institute; Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman and chief executive of the Post Office; and Ms Margaret Seymour, who runs Seymour Swimming Pool Engineers.</p>

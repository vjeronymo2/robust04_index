			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Leading Article: An end to privilege Finance ministers and chancellors seldom jump at the prospect of making the tax system more efficient. Mostly they need the added incentive that reform will be popular. By all accounts, Mr Kenneth Clarke is becoming convinced that reducing biases against employment in the coming UK budget would meet this condition, making the system fairer as well as more effective. What he may not have realised is that improving the tax treatment of savings offers the same prize. Raising the UK's meagre gross saving rate is a worthy goal, but the evidence is that governments can do little to make their citizens save more. What they can determine, however, is the level of public dis-saving, and the allocation of private savings. After his tough budget last year, Mr Clarke can already claim to have done the first of these. He should explore the other side of a pro-savings policy in his second budget, acting to ensure that the resources he has freed do not have to be mangled by a distorting tax system, but flow to the areas offering the highest pre-tax economic return. The best way to achieve such a neutral treatment of savings would be to move to an expenditure system of taxation. Governments have understandably baulked at the thought of such a drastic reform. But the introduction of fiscally privileged forms of savings - personal equity plans, tax exempt special savings accounts, and, most recently, the venture capital funds which Mr Clarke announced last year - means that most personal saving now receives close to an expenditure tax treatment. Heavily penalised Granting tax privileges incrementally is politically attractive, perhaps, but it goes against the goal of taxing funds efficiently. Offering a mass of different tax concessions only further encourages savers to select assets for tax reasons rather than for the relative economic return. The system is now less distortive than it used to be. But, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out in its recent 'Green Budget', housing and pensions still enjoy negative effective tax rates, whereas standard interest bearing accounts are heavily penalised. If there is one defence for the arbitrary extension of fiscal concessions, it is that sooner or later a privilege becomes a right. This year, Mr Clarke faces just such a moment of truth with regard to TESSAs, introduced in 1990. TESSAs were a way of offering some of the advantages of PEPs to the non-share-owning classes. By opening a TESSA, individuals could receive tax-free interest on savings of up to Pounds 9,000, for a period of five years. For the first TESSAs, that grace period will end in January. Destabilising exodus There are now 4m TESSAs, with combined funds of over Pounds 20bn. Little of this money represents additional saving: by and large, account-holders simply moved funds into TESSAs to earn the extra return. Letting the tax concession lapse risks a highly destabilising exodus of funds, as sophisticated savers rush to transfer their money elsewhere. It would also imply that extending fiscal privilege to the less sophisticated was a temporary gimmick, not a long-term commitment to treating savers more equitably. The least wealthy hold most of their wealth in interest-bearing accounts. Rather than allowing the gap between rich and poor savers to widen, Mr Clarke should decide to narrow it further, combining PEPs and TESSAs into a single scheme. Individuals would be able to earn tax-free returns by investing in any kind of financial asset, including ordinary cash deposits. This could be achieved at little or no cost to the exchequer, if necessary, by setting a limit on contributions somewhat lower than the existing Pounds 9,000 limit for PEPs. Reform along these lines, when combined with the ongoing reduction in the value of mortgage interest relief, would go a long way towards a neutral tax treatment of household savings. Mr Clarke may think fiscal neutrality a rather dull theme for budget day, but he could claim a more resounding motive. Namely, that a government which wants more people to leave the security of the dole, for the ups and downs of the labour market, has no business penalising their attempts to provide themselves with the security of easily accessible savings.</p>

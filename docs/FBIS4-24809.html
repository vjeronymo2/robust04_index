			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Xiao Qing, a young  teacher at Nanjing No. 20 middle school, was very cross when she  was told by a studio assistant that a color film containing  pictures she had taken together with her husband during their  honeymoon had been lost.    For half a year, she complained about her loss to the studio  executives and the relevant departments in charge of the studio,  but without avail.    On April 5, 1993, she brought a lawsuit through a local  court  for protecting consumers' legitimate rights and interests. The  court is part of the People's Court of Qinhuai District in  Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province.    She demanded that the studio apologize to her and compensate  her for her loss.    She did not know then that her case would become the first  case handled by China's first court for protecting consumers'  rights and interests.    During the court hearing, the studio apologized to Xiao  Qing.  Mediated by the court, it agreed to pay her 500 yuan in  compensation for her loss.    Since its establishment in March 1993, the court for  protecting consumers' rights and interests has handled nearly  200 cases, according to Wang Dianyou, president of the Qinhuai  District People's Court.    Wang said that these cases involved a wide range of disputes  between buyers and sellers concerning the quality of goods, such  as a fur-lined coat costing several thousand yuan and a pair of  shoes costing about ten yuan.    He said that the court had made decisions on a small number  of cases and had mediated in the rest.    "With our help, some disputes are resolved easily," he said.    For instance, a woman complained to the court that a skirt  made by a tailor was too tight for her, but the tailor refused  to alter it or give her compensation.    The dispute was resolved within two hours, with mediation by  a court official. The tailor agreed to either compensate her or  make her a new skirt.    Some owners of private shops refused to refund consumers  even  if their goods were found shoddy, Wang said.    But when a court official arrived at such shops, none of the  owners would refuse to refund consumers, he added.    Wang said: "The court for protecting consumers' rights and  interests must speak and act on behalf of consumers. I think it  should enable the people to have a place to give vent to their  grievances."    The court also provides consultancy services to local  consumers, as well as consumers in the Daqing Oilfield in  northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and in the island  Province of Hainan in south China, he said.</p>

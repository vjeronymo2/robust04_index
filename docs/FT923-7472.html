			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Samuel Heath cut to Pounds 308,000 SAMUEL HEATH &amp; Sons, the hardware, pottery and photograph frame manufacturer, saw pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 drop from Pounds 377,000 to Pounds 308,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 7.22m to Pounds 7.1m. The outcome was, however, better than the company had expected at the half way stage. Home sales were still down, though exports were ahead. But the company warned that most of its overseas markets were now suffering the same problems as those in the UK. The company had hoped that it was set for recovery after the election, but was instead having to alter its expectations and cut budgets. There has been an efficiency programme at its main factory in Birmingham, with considerably less raw material and work in progress now carried. Earnings per share came out at 7.3p (8.3p) and the final dividend is maintained at 4p to give a same-again total of 5.5p.</p>

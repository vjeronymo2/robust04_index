			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: GWR shares up since SCPSA man died SHARES IN Great Western Resources, the USM-quoted oil, gas and coal company, have doubled from 5 1/2 p to last night's close of 12p, in the two weeks since a key figure in a court case involving GWR died. The company has made no public announcement. It said yesterday that it would not have been appropriate to comment on the death of Mr Joe Norman, one of three defendants in a case alleging civil conspiracy injuring the South Carolina Public Services Authority, which was at one time GWR's single largest customer. Mr Norman, a former employee of SCPSA, died from a gunshot wound on February 2. SCPSA had charged GWR's coal division, Mr Clyde Goins, its former president, and Mr Norman with conspiracy, fraud and unfair trade practices. In papers filed in a South Carolina state court, SCPSA alleged, among other things, that Great Western Coal and Mr Goins secretly paid Mr Norman to violate his duties as SCPSA's purchasing manager. When asked whether the death of Mr Norman would affect the litigation, Mr Howard Wolf, GWR chairman, said: 'As every student of geometry knows, three points make a plane. If one of those points is removed, obviously there has been a change.' However, Mr John Tiencken, general counsel at SCPSA, said: 'The litigation is ongoing and the death of Joe Norman does not negatively impact our case.' He added that SCPSA's civil case against GWR would proceed as soon as appeals by GWR were disposed of in two federal courts. In recent weeks, three directors have purchased GWR shares: Mr Gary Loveless, who bought 1m at 8p on Tuesday, Mr Bill Syson, who bought 150,000 at 6p on February 4, and Mr Wayne Phelan who bought 104,167 at 12.6p last night.</p>

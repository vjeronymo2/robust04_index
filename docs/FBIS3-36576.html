			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Chernyak report under "From the Life of the Special </F> Services" rubric: "`Vympel' Discards Flak Jackets"]    [Text] According to an officer in the "Vympel"  counterterrorist subunit, 110 of the 180 officers in the subunit  have now submitted a formal discharge request. The reason for  this is their disagreement with Boris Yeltsin's edict  transferring "Vympel" from the former Russian Federation  Security Ministry to the jurisdiction of the Internal Affairs  Ministry.    "Vympel" is the well-known special subunit which was  previously intended for combat operations and counterterrorist  operations, including those carried out abroad. It was intended  that "Vympel" would take part, along with "Alfa," in the October  events and the taking of the White House, but the majority of  officers in the special subunit refused to participate in the  storming and on 4 October sat in buses near the U.S. Embassy.    A highly placed source in the Federal Counterintelligence  Service, who asked not to be named because "Vympel" had left  them in the fall of 1993, reported nevertheless that the special  subunit had effectively collapsed. According to him, on the eve  of the October events "Vympel" was transferred to the command of  the Russian Federation Main Protection Directorate, and then  followed the president's edict transferring it to the Internal  Affairs Ministry system. However, according to the Russian  Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen," men in uniform  cannot be transferred to another department without their  agreement. The source stressed that, according to his  information, the officers of the special subunit had come to  serve not directly in "Vympel" but in the state security  service, which for them was fundamental. He confirmed that the  overwhelming majority of "Vympel" officers and NCO's, not  wishing to serve under Hero of Russia Viktor Yerin [the internal  affairs minister], had applied for discharge.    According to the law, this can be regarded as discharge in  connection with personnel organizational changes, which brings  with it the retention of pensions and all benefits. However, in  the source's opinion, terrorism has existed and will continue to  exist notwithstanding the wishes of the country's authorities,  and it is fundamentally impossible to rely on "Alfa" alone to  combat terrorism; therefore the question of creating new  counterterrorist groups will arise in the very near future.    According to the source, money or benefits is not the main  issue for the former state security officers. He cited by way  of example the reaction of the Lefortovo detention center's  guards to its transfer to the Internal Affairs Ministry system.  According to the source, the overwhelming majority of Lefortovo  guards also intend to submit severance notices.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOWERING CAPITAL GAINS TAX  </P> <P> Until Malcolm Forbes was taken aback by public resentment of his big bash in  Morocco (re: Morris Philipson's "700 Guests Don't Add Up to Fun," Editorial  Page, Sept. 2), he had expected to declare this as a business expense, as he  acknowledged. He has a point.  </P> <P> It would be poetic justice if this silly saturnalia helped to kill George  Bush's capital gains tax cut. In order to make the rich richer, Bush seems to  be hoping to surpass Ronald Reagan's record of more than doubling our  deca-millionaires in a scant five years.  </P> <P> The creed of greed is alive and well.  </P> <P> FRANCES LEVEILLE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

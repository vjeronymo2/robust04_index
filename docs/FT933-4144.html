			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and Palestinians End Hostility: Aid needed at a proper pace PENS are set to be uncapped for the signature by Israel and the Palestinians of an outline agreement on self-rule. Donors are already addressing the question of what aid will be needed to create a functioning Palestinian administration, and an economy integrated with those of its neighbours and the wider world. European Community foreign ministers tomorrow will consider plans for an Ecu500m (Pounds 383m) aid package to the West Bank and Gaza Strip - a package aimed to capitalise on the historic breakthrough by Israel and the Palestinians and to consolidate the EC's importance as a donor and trade partner in the Middle East. Scandinavian countries last week pledged Dollars 140m in aid to the territories over the next four years. The US is seeking to 'facilitate contributions' to the new Palestinian authority, but administration officials have made clear that they do not expect to be the principal source of finance. Japan 'would have to help with restructuring in the region' once the accord was signed, Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, said yesterday. In total, according to estimates based on a draft World Bank report and the views of other economists, the new Palestinian 'entity' will require external financing, both in aid and private capital flows, of more than Dollars 4bn in the next decade. This sum, according to Mr Stanley Fisher, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who helped produce a Harvard University report on the economy of the territories, represents the likely maximum the Gaza Strip and West Bank could absorb. 'No running economy can take in more than about 10 per cent of GDP,' he says, putting the combined annual gross domestic product of the West Bank and Gaza strip at about Dollars 4bn. This would also be a greater sum of aid, proportionate to the size of the territories' economies, than the original post-war Marshall Plan for Europe. Most to the point, according to several economists, such a sum is likely to place Gaza and the West Bank - if adeptly managed - on a sound economic footing. 'All the ingredients for growth are there,' says Mr Fisher. As important as the gross sums of aid, however, will be the promptness and co-ordination of their disbursement. As a first step, officials from the PLO, Israel and its Arab neighbours will meet in Washington on September 20 to discuss creating a central fund to direct international assistance, under the World Bank, whose economists have already created a detailed plan for regional economic development. The Bank can lend only to member countries but is seeking ways around this hurdle for the territories. Swift as the initial response of the EC, the World Bank and others has been, shadows hang over co-ordination of the international aid effort. It is unclear, for instance, how the EC package will be aligned with wider international attempts to create a viable economy in the territories, with proper roads, water, and telecommunications. Japan has already contacted the EC about the Brussels plan, but senior EC officials say there has so far been no contact with the US. What already looks clear, however, is the determination of donors to help this historic opportunity succeed - not simply in creating a viable economy for a Palestinian proto-state, but in encouraging both better Middle Eastern development and the closer integration of the region's economies with, in particular, those of the EC.</p>

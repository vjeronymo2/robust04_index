			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nadav Shragai: "Tel Rumayda--a Caravan Site </F> Whose Inhabitants Have Often Challenged the Army"]    [Text] The clarifications made last week by IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] commanders on the West Bank with regard to  "sizes, weights, and capacities of each of the caravans in Tel  Rumayda" increased the fears of the settlers in Hebron of  evacuation, on instructions from the political echelon.    Tel Rumayda is the only settlement site in Hebron where the  inhabitants live in temporary structures. In the rest of the  enclaves the settlers live in new or rehabilated permanent  homes, in the synagogue of Abraham our father, in Bet Hadassah,  or in Bet Romano.    At the beginning of the eighties, the settlers in Hebron  waged a stubborn struggle aimed at settling on the grounds of  Tel Rumayda, south of the Arab heart of Hebron. This struggle  has seen endless confrontations with the residents of Hebron as  well as with the military administration. Once Arab fruit trees  were uprooted. Other times the settlers tried to fence in  territory, of which the legal ownership was unclear. Thus it  happened that on several occasions the IDF soldiers removed the  fences, and the settlers came back and refenced them.    Most of the land on the Tel was purchased by the Jewish  community in Hebron 150 years ago. Today only a few plots remain  under Jewish ownership. In 1984 the government authorized  several families to settle in temporary structures on one of the  plots. Today seven settler families live on that very spot.  Settlement on the rest of the plots was held up by the national  unity government in the mid-eighties.    On the western part of the Tel is the ancient Jewish  cemetery  in which many generations of Jews were buried, among them rabbis  and cabalists. The Israeli Government prohibited burials there  in the first years after the Six-Day War. But in 1975, when the  boy Avraham Yedidia Nahshon died in Qiryat Arba', his mother  buried him in the ancient cemetery.    The victims of the 1929 riots are buried in another section.  The cemetery was destroyed by the Arabs after the Jordanian  conquest and was rebuilt by the Jews of Qiryat Arba'. In 1976,  remnants of Torah scrolls were laid to rest there that had been  torn up and desecrated by Arabs in the Cave of the Patriarchs.  Their location is marked today by a monument in the form of a  Torah scroll.    In a pamphlet put out by No'am Arnon on behalf of the Hebron  academy, he describes "the large and impressive ancient walls  from the period of the patriarchs," located on the southeastern  part of the Tel. "These walls were excavated in archaeological  digs in the sixties. Further digs conducted on the Tel in recent  years exposed various finds from the Canaanite period and parts  of the city from the time of the First and Second Commonwealth.  On the eastern slopes of the Tel is Ayn Jidira (`the fountain of  Abraham'), that constituted a water supply source for the  ancient city. On the top of the Tel is Dir al Arba'in, an  ancient Crusader fortress, with a beautiful view of the `Hebron  Valley' and the entire city. On this spot there are Jewish  traditions noting the graves of Jesse, the father of King David  and Ruth, the mother of the Davidian dynasty."</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMISSION TO CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR DEALING WITH DUMP PROBLEM  </P> <P> Last year, trucks loaded with two million tons of garbage chugged their way  along winding canyon roads to one of two landfills in north Orange County, and  the giant dumps are now nearly full. The Santiago Canyon landfill east of  Orange will reach its capacity next year, and the Olinda Canyon dump in Brea  will by 1994.  </P> <P> The county Planning Commission will hold a public hearing on Tuesday to  consider 10 options for dealing with the landfill crisis for the area bounded  by Beach Boulevard, the Garden Grove Freeway and the eastern county line. Among  the proposals are expanding the Olinda landfill and building a new dump in one  of the large vacant canyons on the eastern fringes of the county.  </P> <P> "Orange County is at a crossroads in its long-term planning for the future  needs of its citizens," according to a landfill study commissioned by the Board  of Supervisors in 1985 and completed by planning consultants with Michael  Brandman Associates.  </P> <P> "Unlike the past, where after a landfill had filled up it was a simple matter  to locate another undeveloped area and build another landfill, these 10 sites  proposed for the next generation landfill may be the last 10 large viable  disposal sites remaining in north Orange County."  </P> <P> The study recommends that the Olinda landfill be expanded to allow for another  27 years' use and also that the county buy land in at least one vacant canyon  to be used for several hundred years' worth of garbage.  </P> <P> At a meeting last week, however, the county Waste Management Commission  recommended that further environmental studies be authorized for three sites:  Olinda Canyon, West Fremont Canyon and Gypsum Canyon. Although Gypsum has  already been named as the likely spot for a new county jail, environmental  planners say the canyon is big enough for both a jail and a landfill.  </P> <P> The proposal to expand the Olinda landfill is likely to draw fire from Brea  residents, who are not eager to see more trash brought into their area.  </P> <P> Norma Hicks, a former Brea city councilwoman and a member of the Waste  Management Commission, protested the recommendation to expand Olinda,  contending that creating a 690-acre landfill there would involve destroying the  ridge between the Olinda and Olinda-Alpha canyons.  </P> <P> "To me, it's the same as saying, 'Since the McColl dump (in Fullerton) has  hazardous wastes in it, then let's make it the hazardous waste site,' " she  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Council Position  </P> <P> Brea City Manager Frank Benest said that although the Olinda landfill expansion  is a major issue in the community, the City Council has not yet taken a  position on it.  </P> <P> "We all see the trucks going through town," he said. "We all can look up and  see the side of the mountain is open to the landfill." Benest said the county  should be prepared to work with Brea to ease the traffic, noise and air  pollution problems that would result from an expansion.  </P> <P> As it stands, the Olinda landfill is likely to end up with 80% of the amount of  garbage now being hauled to Santiago Canyon when that landfill closes next  year.  </P> <P> The county would have to spend about $36 million to acquire the land to expand  the Olinda landfill. That, according to the study, would be the cheapest of the  landfill alternatives. The other advantages for that alternative, according to  the study, are that hauling routes are already established and county agencies  are already familiar with the facility.  </P> <P> The drawbacks are that the expansion would only take care of north Orange  County for another 27 years and would delay by 30 years a plan to convert the  landfill into a regional park.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Environmental Concerns  </P> <P> In terms of land use, according to the report, the 1,930-acre West Fremont  Canyon would be a compatible choice that could contain north Orange County's  trash for 185 years. However, it would cost the county about $118 million to  acquire the land and build the dump, and there are environmental concerns  associated with destroying vegetation and wildlife in the area.  </P> <P> Gypsum Canyon has even more drawbacks, the report says. Acquiring the land and  building a dump there would cost $200 million, and putting a dump next to a  jail could pose health problems for inmates and employees. Another  environmental concern is that geological studies show that there are artesian  wells in the lower reaches of the canyon that are linked to ground water that  could become polluted by landfill trash.  </P> <P> In addition, part of the proposed eastern transportation corridor runs through  the canyon, therefore limiting the size and choice of location for a landfill.  If the entire canyon was made available for a dump, however, it would take  nearly 600 years to fill it.  </P> <P> The consultants' report also considers alternatives such as recycling,  composting, trash-to-energy conversion plants and taking wastes to a remote  site outside the county.  </P> <P> While such alternatives hold promise, the study says, "these technologies are  not a panacea for the present and foreseeable landfill capacity problem  confronting north Orange County."  </P> <P> The Planning Commission meeting will begin at 2 p.m. in the Planning Commission  Hearing Room in the Administration Building of the county office complex in  Santa Ana. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider the landfill issue  in a meeting on Aug. 16.  </P></p>

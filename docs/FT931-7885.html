			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Monday Interview: Mogul with the most - American entrepreneur David Geffen talks to Alan Friedman What is the definition of a renaissance man in 1990s America? If the criteria were to include an extraordinary business acumen which ranges from founding and selling a company for half a billion dollars to making shrewd investments in commercial property, stocks and bonds - combined with a passion for the worlds of both modern art and national politics, and the ability to produce hit movies, records and Broadway shows  -then David Geffen might just fit the bill. The 50-year-old Mr Geffen made his first Dollars 1m in 1969 in the record business, and went on to reap more than Dollars 700m of cash profits when he sold his shareholding in the November 1990 takeover of the MCA/ Universal entertainment group by Matsushita of Japan. He has invested much of his money on Wall Street, effectively becoming Hollywood's version of Mr Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who figured prominently in the rebuilding of Salomon Brothers last year. Mr Geffen is one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in the US, a consummate telephone schmoozer who moves almost effortlessly across sectors too disparate for most self-made men with net worths of more than Dollars 1bn. Mr Geffen, whose preferred dress is a white T-shirt, jeans and tennis shoes, operates from a comfortable third floor office notable for its L-shaped sofa, absence of a desk and westward view along Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard. He spends an hour each day working out at one of the gyms he has installed in his houses on the beach at Malibu and New York's Fifth Avenue and in his Beverly Hills mansion. 'I am being what I want to be every day,' he declares, clearly irritated by Hollywood speculation about what business venture he will next undertake. Amid the back-stabbing politics of Tinsel Town, Mr Geffen is one of the few individuals who garners nearly universal praise from studio heads and stars alike. The word most often used to describe him is 'smart'. It is an adjective that might also be used to describe the handful of close friends who for years have chatted on the telephone with Mr Geffen almost daily. This inner circle includes Mr Barry Diller, the former chairman of Twentieth Century Fox; Mr Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres; Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, who runs the Disney studio, and Mr Allen Grubman, the leading entertainment lawyer in America. For Mr Geffen, contacts are everything. 'His Rolodex has few rivals, in this town or anywhere,' observes the chairman of a big Hollywood studio. 'He is very tough in business, very direct. He is like a laser beam,' says an old friend who prefers not to be named. Mr Geffen was not born to wealth. He grew in Brooklyn, the son of the enterprising Mrs Batya Geffen, who supported the family by designing corsets and brassieres and eventually became a landlord. The academic life was not for the young David Geffen, who dropped out of university and in 1964 went to work in the mailroom of the William Morris talent agency, where he met his friend Barry Diller. By the late 1960s he discovered Laura Nyro, the folk singer. Acting as her manager and producer, he launched her career and made more than Dollars 1m. It was then a short hop to his successful backing of Linda Ronstadt, The Eagles, Joni Mitchell and many more stars. In 1972 he sold his record label to Mr Steve Ross, the founder of Warner Communications. Mr Ross named Mr Geffen vice-chairman of Warner Brothers, the group's Hollywood studio, in 1975, but he was not comfortable in a corporate structure and soon left. A year later, when he was diagnosed as having cancer, he dropped out of the business world, only to return in 1980 when the cancer scare proved to have been a false alarm. It was the founding of Geffen Records in 1980 that created an asset so valuable that it fetched Dollars 545m in stock when Geffen sold it to MCA a decade later. Eight months after that deal, at the end of 1990, MCA itself was sold, netting Mr Geffen Dollars 710m in cash. Mr Geffen's activities since the MCA deal have been increasingly diversified. The one area he has rarely discussed, however, is his investment portfolio - and Wall Street. The portfolio now totals more than Dollars 750m. 'As an investor I have been averaging a 25 to 30 per cent annualised return since 1990,' he says. 'At first I was doing it with high-yield instruments, but in the past 12 months many of the bonds have been redeemed by the issuers, and I have transferred about Dollars 400m into equities.' Over the past year Mr Geffen has bought big share stakes in companies such as Wells Fargo, the California bank whose stock has jumped by more than 50 per cent; American Express, of which the share price rose substantially after the resignation of Mr James Robinson, its chairman; and RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco group. Mr Geffen considers it 'a good thing' that institutional investors are taking a more active role in shaking up the top managements of US companies such as IBM, General Motors and American Express. He also reckons that 'a great number of companies are trading at very reasonable prices', and says there are now 'tremendous opportunities in the equities market'. In 1991 Mr Geffen showed Wall Street he was prepared to be a big-time corporate player when he teamed up with Bechtel Investments and Mr Richard Rainwater, the Texas investor, to make a Dollars 3bn bid for Executive Life, the failed insurance group. The bid was not accepted but Mr Geffen went on last year to help out his old friend Mr Calvin Klein, the fashion designer, buying a total of Dollars 61m of Klein's junk bonds for an estimated 50 to 60 cents on the dollar. 'Those bonds will be retired by the end of February and replaced with bank debt that has a much lower interest cost,' Mr Geffen discloses, although he will not reveal the substantial capital gain he is expected to make on them. Paper profits are also likely for Mr Geffen in the art world. He says that over the past couple of years he has spent more than Dollars 50m buying the works of masters from the abstract expressionist era to early 1960s pop art. 'I don't think of it as an investment, but as a pleasure.' None the less he also reckons the art market will have turned around within the next year or so. The other new focus of Mr Geffen's life is politics. An ardent supporter of Bill Clinton, Mr Geffen contributed more than Dollars 150,000 to the Democratic party last year. He was also among those at Mr Clinton's economic summit in Little Rock last autumn. 'I found it very valuable. Both Bill and Hillary Clinton are very impressive and there is every reason to expect that a lot will happen in Washington that is valuable for this country.' Mr Geffen has not merely supported the new US president; he has also expanded his private foundation and has been giving away Dollars 5m to Dollars 8m each year to such causes as abortion rights, homelessness and Aids research. He donates to the foundation all his personal earnings from managing the record business now owned by MCA, the movies he makes and the Broadway shows he backs. Mr Geffen has also broken new ground in Hollywood by publicly announcing his homosexuality. Last November 18, with 6,000 people packed into a Hollywood amphitheatre for a concert that raised Dollars 4m for Aids research, Mr Geffen was honoured for his contribution. Yes, he says, 'there was a time in my life when I would have been uncomfortable getting up in front of 6,000 people and acknowledging I was gay. But this was intentional.' The only subject that makes Mr Geffen bristle is the way his Hollywood peers gossip about his next big deal. His response is direct: 'I am running a record company, a big investment portfolio; I am financing Broadway shows and making movies such as the new production of M Butterfly with Jeremy Irons; and I am working with my foundation. Some people might think of that as enough activity.' PERSONAL FILE 1943 Born in New York. 1964 Began work in the mailroom of the William Morris talent agency. 1969 Sold share of Laura Nyro music business, making his first Dollars 1m. 1970 Launched Asylum Records. 1975 Vice-chairman of Warner Brothers studio. 1980 Launched Geffen Records. 1990 Sold Geffen for Dollars 545m in MCA stock; earned Dollars 710m when MCA was bought by Matsushita. 1991 Switched more than Dollars 400m from bonds to equities; net worth now more than Dollars 1bn</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY BACKS AWAY FROM SALE OF LAND  </P> <P> L.A. County has backed away from a plan to dispose of 53 acres of undeveloped  coastal land along the Rancho Palos Verdes-San Pedro border, disappointing  individuals and organizations who had developed plans of their own for the  land.  </P> <P> The county bought the land in the early 1970s for a park that was never  developed.  </P> <P> Environmentalists had become concerned after the county Regional Planning  Commission acted on a finding by the county Department of Parks and Recreation  that the land is no longer needed. It said that sale of the land in Rancho  Palos Verdes, on a bluff overlooking the ocean, would not conflict with the  county general plan.  </P> <P> While acknowledging that the department began the process of declaring it  surplus by asking for an appraisal, chief park planner Jim Park said last week  that there has been no decision on what to do with the land. He called the  commission action premature and said the county's options are to let the  property remain open space, to develop a park or sell the land.  </P></p>

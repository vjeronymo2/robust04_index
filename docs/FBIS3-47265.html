It is because the Korean people  have creditably built the self-supporting national economy, says  NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today.    The article says:    The line of building a self-supporting national economy is  fully displaying its great material strength, great validity and  tremendous vitality in our country.    The invincible vitality of the Workers' Party of Korea's  line of building a self-supporting national economy lies, above  all, in that it helps maintain the political independence of the  country in any circumstances.    Economic self-sustenance is just the way of maintaining  political independence, the life and soul of an independent  sovereign state. The Korean people are always firmly maintaining  the political independence of the country by building the  self-supporting national economy under the wise guidance of the  party and the leader.    Thanks to the powerful self-supporting economy the Korean  people are now creditably defending the dignity and sovereignty  of the nation in confrontation with the U.S.-led imperialists  even under the situation where socialism has suffered setbacks  in some countries of the world.    Its invincible vitality of our party's line also lies in  that  it makes it possible to steadily strengthen the material and  technical foundations of the country and accelerate the  socialist construction at a high speed.    The self-supporting economy of Korea is on a very high level  in the modernization of its technical equipment and in the  building of departmental structures and turns out everything  necessary for economic construction and people's living.    The powerful self-supporting economy helps the party and the  people of Korea to develop the economy at a high tempo on the  basis of their own economic foundations in any circumstances.    An industrial output increased by 50 percent and its average  annual growth rate was 5.6 percent in the period of the third  seven- year plan, which clearly shows how the self- supporting  economy of Korea maintains a steady and high- speed of growth.    The invincible vitality of the line finds its manifestation  in that it makes it possible to steadily improve the material  and cultural living standard of people and highly display the  advantages of socialism.    Having a powerful self-supporting economy the party and the  state can provide the entire people with a happy life.    With the progress of economic construction the people's real  income steadily increases and the party and the state are  pursuing better policies for the improvement of people's living.    All this shows the great superiority of Korean-style  socialism to capitalist society and a proud fruition of the  self-supporting national economy.</p>

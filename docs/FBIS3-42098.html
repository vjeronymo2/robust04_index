			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Pressler Snag"] </F>   [Text] The Pakistan specific Pressler Amendment, ostensibly  aimed at curbing Pakistan's nuclear designs, has been  reincorporated in the revised draft of the Foreign Assistance  Act submitted to U.S. Congress last week by the Clinton  Administration. The discussion draft submitted on 22 November  1993 had sought to repeal the amendment taking the view that all  country specific amendments must be done away with. However, it  was obvious, given he significance of the nuclear issue within  the South Asian context, that Pressler would witness the  fiercest battle between the Administration and the Congress.  Senator Larry Pressler had them vowed to fight tooth and nail  for the inclusion of his amendment. It appears now that he did.  Analysts, both in Pakistan and abroad had built scenarios,  linking Administration's attempts at shooting down the amendment  as reciprocating Islamabad's tacit approval of toeing the  international line on Kashmir. It was thought at the time that  Washington was posturing to indicate to India its  dissatisfaction with the human rights violations as also the  dated Indian rhetoric of Kashmir being its atoot ang [integral  part]. Ms. Robin Raphel's visit and her statements on the issue  and Islamabad's decision to withdraw the resolution in the UN,  condemning human rights violations by India in the valley,  seemed to point to a nexus of sorts. The Administration on its  part had given the general impression that Pressler had failed  to advance Washington's objectives of non-proliferation, raising  hopes that the amendment might be scrapped. The scenario has  come apart.    While the Americans might see this development in the  domestic context of a usual fight between the Administration and  the Congress, the reincorporation of the amendment in the  Foreign Assistance Act has different connotations for Pakistan.  And this does not just include the man on the street, but  virtually everyone. There may be a spate of concerned statements  on Kashmir by Americans, Ms Raphel's being the latest, but it is  obvious that when it comes to the crunch, it is always Pakistan  that falls on hard times. The development also does not  dovetail with the viewpoint of some American analysts who have  been advising Washington to remain even-handed in South Asia,  especially in the military sphere. Simply put it means that the  conventional strength of the Pakistani defence forces should at  least be kept at a level where paranoid does not set in, forcing  it to rely on non-conventional options in the face of growing  imbalance of conventional forces vis-a-vis India. Now with the  amendment still clamped on, the squeeze continues. While the  ground forces could manage to scout for alternatives the air  force, hardest hit by the amendment, is growing desperate.  There is the question of the delivery of 71 F-16s for which  Pakistan has already paid $658 million but which it cannot get  because of the amendment. However, it has to keep paying the  installments, another snag on which the two governments,  according to one report, have been stumbling. While it would be  optimistic to say that Islamabad could survive the amendment,  even if the costs be high, the US response to the people of this  country does not enhance its credibility in the eyes of most  Pakistani. Given the present escalation of tension in the  region on the question of Kashmir, the development could bode  ill, forcing the saner element to concede ground to the hawks.</p>

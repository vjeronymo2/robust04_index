			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / World Trade News: BAe-Taiwan joint venture aircraft would rival Boeing THE RJ-X aircraft for which Taiwan is insisting on a British Aerospace development pledge would be a direct competitor to the Boeing 737, the world's biggest-selling aircraft. BAe has already spent about Pounds 10m researching the RJ-X. Last month it presented documents to Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) showing that the aircraft would be a complete redesign of the existing model, the RJ. Its fuselage would be built of an aluminium-lithium alloy, a material normally associated with military aircraft. Unlike the RJ's configuration of four engines attached to wings above the passenger cabin, the RJ-X would have a more conventional layout of two engines on a wing below the fuselage. There would be two versions of the aircraft, according to documents shown to the Financial Times by Taiwanese officials yesterday, one with 96 seats and the other with 125. Its range would be extended to 'more than 1,500 nautical miles'. This would bring the aircraft into one of the most competitive civil airliner markets, competing against the smaller Boeing 737 versions as well as the latest addition to the Airbus family, the A319 - a smaller version of the A320 which was announced at the Paris Air Show in June. Boeing is now planning to develop a new family of 737 aircraft to give the airliner more efficiency and a longer range. It would also compete directly against the Fokker F-100 and the McDonnell Douglas DC9/MD90. 'Within the next 10 years, many 737s and 727s will retire. This would be a good time to market the RJ-X,' said Mr David Chu, director of the government advisory team. While TAC is insisting BAe commit itself to the development of the RJ-X, the UK company is less confident than Taiwan of its future. It is pressing for a detailed survey of the aircraft's potential market to be conducted first. This position fails to convince Mr Chu. 'Without the RJ-X, the joint venture would not be a success. It's not a question of yes or no but when it would be built.'</p>

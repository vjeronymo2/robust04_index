			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Earnings at Nedcor increase by 15% NEDCOR, South Africa's fourth largest banking group, managed to record a 15 per cent increase in earnings in the six months to the end of March despite the difficult operating environment. Mr Chris Liebenberg, chief executive, said the first half had been much tougher than anticipated. Net interest income rose by 20 per cent to R796m (Dollars 276m) while other income was up by 19 per cent to R493m. Net operating income was 19 per cent up at 443m. The lower bottom line increase - net earnings were up by 15 per cent to R192m - was principally the result of a 23 per cent rise in specific and general provisions for bad debts to R103m. Mr Liebenberg said although only about 4 per cent of the total loan book was to the agricultural sector, the group still felt the effect of the bad drought. The bad debt position was also aggravated by very difficult conditions in the mining industry and Nedcor's high home-loan exposure in the black community where unrest has driven many tenants into arrears. Total assets grew by 13 per cent to R45bn, while advances were 18 per cent up at R33.2bn. Mr Liebenberg said the second half would be very tough, but he expects earnings to be matched or improved. The dividend was lifted by 11 per cent to 21 cents per share on an earnings per share increase of 13 per cent, to 102 cents.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITIES TO FIGHT REDISTRICTING FOR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE MAYOR OF SAN DIMAS IS COORDINATING AN EFFORT TO DRAW UP AN  ALTERNATE PLAN THAT WOULD PLACE MOST OF THE VALLEY IN THE SAME DISTRICT.  </P> <P> Cities dissatisfied with the political splintering of the San Gabriel Valley  under a federally mandated reapportionment of the County Board of Supervisors  are collecting money to hire their own experts to draw up a plan that would  place most of the area in one supervisorial district.  </P> <P> San Dimas Mayor Terry Dipple is spearheading the effort by the San Gabriel  Valley Assn. of Cities to develop the plan by next year, when lines are drawn  for the 1992 County Board of Supervisors elections. The plan would also enlarge  the board from five members to seven.  </P> <P> Dipple has asked 32 cities to contribute $500 each to hire National  Demographics Corp. of Claremont -- at a total cost of $22,500 -- to draw  proposed supervisorial boundaries, using 1990 census data. He said he is also  soliciting $1,000 donations from a number of corporations, which he refused to  name.  </P> <P> Cities that have agreed to contribute include Alhambra, Arcadia, Azusa,  Glendora, La Puente and San Dimas.  </P> <P> The proposed lines would be submitted to the Board of Supervisors next year for  consideration during reapportionment.  </P> <P> The key element in the cities' plan would be expansion of the board.  </P> <P> Without expansion, Dipple said, it would be impossible to keep most of the San  Gabriel Valley intact and also meet a court mandate to provide a Latino  district.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon in August ordered a drastic revision of  supervisorial districts after concluding that the county had drawn boundaries  in a way that discriminated against Latinos. The court-ordered reapportionment  converted the 1st Supervisorial District, now represented by Supervisor Pete  Schabarum, into a predominantly Latino district.  </P> <P> Kenyon added East Los Angeles to the 1st District and removed such cities as  Covina, Claremont, Glendora, Pomona, Temple City and West Covina, shifting them  into Supervisor Mike Antonovich's 5th District. In addition, Walnut and Diamond  Bar were shifted into the 4th District, a largely coastal area represented by  Supervisor Deane Dana.  </P> <P> Although the Board of Supervisors is still challenging the reapportionment in  court, an election to choose a successor to Schabarum in the new 1st District  is scheduled for Jan. 22.  </P> <P> Dipple said the fragmentation of Schabarum's old district will reduce the San  Gabriel Valley's clout on regional issues.  </P> <P> For example, he said, his own city, San Dimas, will be represented by  Antonovich, whose constituencies have included Glendale, Burbank and the San  Fernando Valley. Dipple said Antonovich is unlikely to pay as much attention to  San Dimas and other cities in the East San Gabriel Valley when most of his  constituents live elsewhere.  </P> <P> "We have so much at stake," Dipple said. San Gabriel Valley cities are just  beginning to address transportation, waste management, air quality and other  issues on a regional basis, he said. "We're really becoming a force now, and  it's important to stay in one group."  </P> <P> Dipple said many officials in San Gabriel Valley cities with high Latino  populations would prefer to be in a supervisorial district serving the region  rather than one linked to East Los Angeles. "The Latino makeup and philosophy  in the San Gabriel Valley is different from East Los Angeles," Dipple said.  </P> <P> San Gabriel Mayor James Castaneda, a Latino whose city was moved to the new 1st  District from Antonovich's 5th district, agreed. "The San Gabriel Valley and  Los Angeles are different places," he said. "We have different needs."  </P> <P> But Castaneda said San Gabriel declined to contribute money to the San Gabriel  Valley Assn. of Cities project because the courts have already acted on  redistricting.  </P> <P> Dipple said San Gabriel and some other cities apparently misunderstood the  purpose of the proposed redistricting project. He said he is sending a letter  to cities pointing out that regardless of the court case, supervisorial  districts must be redrawn next year to reflect population changes from the 1990  census and that now is the time to prepare recommendations.  </P> <P> Like Dipple, Castaneda said the best way to serve everyone's interests would be  to expand the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Richard P. Fajardo, staff attorney with the Mexican-American Legal Defense and  Educational Fund, one of the plaintiffs in the reapportionment suit, said the  board would have to expand to seven or even nine districts in order to draw  boundaries that would serve the regional interests of the San Gabriel Valley  and also meet the needs of Latinos.  </P> <P> Otherwise, he said, cities such as El Monte, La Puente and Irwindale would have  to be part of a Latino district in order to preserve a Latino majority. In the  new 1st District, which stretches from East Los Angeles to La Puente and south  to Santa Fe Springs, Latinos are 51% of the registered voters.  </P> <P> In Monterey Park, Mayor Judy Chu said her city, which is within the 1st  Supervisorial District under the court reapportionment, would be better off in  a district centered in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> "There has to be some attempt made to deal with regional interests," she said.  </P> <P> Even before the court-ordered reapportionment, Monterey Park was isolated from  other San Gabriel Valley cities. Monterey Park has been the only San Gabriel  Valley city in the 3rd District, a San Fernando Valley-Hollywood-East Los  Angeles district represented by Edmund D. Edelman. Chu said Edelman has been  helpful to Monterey Park, but the city should be represented by a supervisor  whose concerns are focused on the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Pasadena, Alhambra and South Pasadena are already represented by Antonovich and  would remain in his district under the court-ordered reapportionment. Alhambra  Councilman Michael Blanco said his city "has had a pretty good working  relationship" with Antonovich and is not eager to change supervisorial  districts.  </P> <P> Pasadena Mayor Jess Hughston said the principal problem is that the Board of  Supervisors is too small.  </P> <P> "The five-member board is inadequate," he said, "and I wonder if two more would  be enough."  </P></p>

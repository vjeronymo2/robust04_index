			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- A Japanese Government panel  called Thursday [16 June] for "urgently" implementing a set of  economic restructuring measures to revitalize Japan's economy  toward the next century. "The Japanese economy now stands at  the crossroads," the Industrial Structure Council said in a  report, citing such problems as the rapid aging of the  population, the lingering current account imbalance and the  "excessive" strength of the yen.    The report urged the government to formulate a reform  program  by effectively combining three types of steps -- macroeconomic  restructuring measures like social infrastructure improvement,  microeconomic reforms such as deregulation and narrowing of the  price gap between Japan and other countries, and overhauling the  industrial structure for new business creation.    The advisory body to the minister of international trade and  industry said the government's failure to carry out these  measures would deprive the Japanese economy of "industrial  vitality" toward the next century, promote "industrial  hollowing" and eventually degrade the overall life standard of  the Japanese people. "The report is not merely a collection of  recommendations that simply depict a vision of Japan's future  economy," a ministry official said. "But it reflects a strong  sense of crisis among council members about the future course of  the Japanese economy," the official said.    The council cited 12 industrial sectors as having growth  potential toward the 21st century. They are housing-related  services, medical and welfare services, culture, urban  development, environmental improvement, energy, distribution,  new manufacturing technology, labor services, business support,  information and communications, and cultural services involved  in Japan's internationalization.    The proposed reform steps would help create a substantial  amount of new business opportunities in Japan, with the market  size of such business growing to 210 trillion yen in 2000 from  the current 130 trillion yen in the 12 sectors combined. The  council also said the reforms would produce 2.5 million new jobs  by 2000.    If large-scale industrial restructuring is carried out, the  Japanese economy could achieve an annual growth rate of more  than 3 percent by the turn of the century, the report said. It  also said Japan's manpower structure would undergo big changes  under the proposed economic reform.    The proportion of workers in services and livelihood-related  sectors would increase while those in distribution and  transportation would drop, for example, the report said.  Without the proposed reforms, Japan's economic growth would  slow to an annual average of 1.6 percent during 1992-2000 and an  average 1.2 percent during 2000-2010, the report said. The  council said Japan should propose industrial policy coordination  among developed countries as a way to spur new business  creation, a step that may present solutions for global  unemployment.    The issue of trade and labor standards should be addressed  in  a manner that would enable free trade to be pursued in  developing countries while upgrading labor conditions there, the  report said.</p>

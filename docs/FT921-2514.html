			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: ASH shares drop on 31% decline The share price of Automated Security Holdings, which supplies burglar alarms and other security products, fell from 133p to 102p yesterday - knocking about Pounds 35m off its market value - on disappointing annual results. Pre-tax profit fell 31 per cent to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 33.2m) on turnover of Pounds 193.7m (Pounds 200m) for the year to November 30. The market was expecting nearer Pounds 30m. It was the first profit fall after 18 years of growth. Earnings per share were 51 per cent down at 11.4p (23.3p) on a higher tax rate of 16 per cent. Mr Tom Buffett, chairman and chief executive, said the main damage was caused by large systems contracts for nuclear power stations and property developments. This had turned from an Pounds 800,000 profit in 1990 to a Pounds 2.6m loss. The group had got involved in long-term contracts for the first time in late 1989 and it had turned out to be a mistake. A Pounds 5.9m charge for closing the operation down contributed to a total of Pounds 15.2m taken below the line. Other extraordinary items included Pounds 4m of professional fees for an abortive flotation of a loss prevention division and two halted acquisitions. These costs had been building up over three years. A Pounds 5.3m loss was taken on the disposal of a stake in Gardiner Group, another security concern. In security systems operating profit slipped to Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 37.2m) on Pounds 119.4m (Pounds 120.9m) sales. Loss prevention, including tagging and telesurveillance, improved to Pounds 12m (Pounds 10.6m) on Pounds 61.9m (Pounds 58.9m) sales. ASH planned to integrate the two business segments. In the UK, where 71 per cent of turnover lay, the streamlining already under way would save between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m a year, at an initial cost of Pounds 4m. Net debt stood at Pounds 95m in November, giving gearing of 59 per cent. This was counting Pounds 60m of convertible capital bonds as equity. After their issue in May, gearing had fallen to 37 per cent. Interest costs were Pounds 800,000 down at Pounds 13.9m. The dividend is unchanged at 4.9p after a 2.83p final. It necessitated an Pounds 8.18m transfer from reserves.</p>

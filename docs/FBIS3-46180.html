The "PEOPLE'S ARMY" newspaper today quoted Defence Minister  Vitaliy Radetskyy as saying that Ukraine will demobilize another  70,000 men to bring the size of the armed forces down to 455,000  by the end of this year.    Ukraine has already demobilized 200,000 people since it  inherited a military force of 720,000 men in 1991 when the  former Soviet Union broke up.    He said the strength of the armed forces should be capped  within 450,000 men, or 0.8 percent of the country's population.  The figure was decided by parliament last October.    The total strength should be kept between 200,000 and  250,000  men if Ukraine is to comply with relevant international  agreements.    The slimming operation is only one component of the  restructuring plan. War industries and science and technology  are also essential for the armed forces to be "lean and mean".  But the minister did not elaborate.</p>

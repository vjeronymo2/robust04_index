			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TERM LIMITS FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Your editorial is marching to a different drummer. The majority of the public  did not elect officials for life so that they could pocket perks, pensions and  personal mistresses.  </P> <P> As a lifelong Republican, many of my associates agree with Atty. Gen. John Van  de Kamp that two-term limits are a necessity. We will vote "yes" for this  nonpartisan issue.  </P> <P> Two terms was good enough for the founding fathers, and it should be good  enough for today's politicians.  </P> <P> ROBERT WAGNER  </P> <P> Former Mayor Pro-Tem  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

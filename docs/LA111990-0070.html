			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO JOKE THIS TIME: REBELS ARE THE COACHES' CHOICE  </P> <P> Nevada Las Vegas, the defending NCAA champion and the preseason No. 1 in many  national polls, has been picked to win the Big West Conference title by  conference coaches.  </P> <P> A year ago, they picked Cal State Long Beach in a half-jesting effort to draw  attention to teams other than UNLV.  </P> <P> But this season, with Larry Johnson, Stacey Augmon, Anderson Hunt and Greg  Anthony back from a team that defeated Duke by 30 points in the NCAA  championship game, the coaches made UNLV a unanimous choice.  </P> <P> UNLV is preparing to open its season Dec. 1 against Alabama Birmingham, but  still is awaiting the result of an appeal to the NCAA asking for a reversal of  a ruling that bars the Rebels from defending their NCAA tournament title.  </P> <P> "We hope we're going to be in the tournament," said Coach Jerry Tarkanian, who  has made an offer to sit out the event if the team is allowed to play.  </P> <P> New Mexico State, which tied UNLV for the regular-season title last season and  lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament, was picked second.  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach, which was 23-9 and barely missed making the NCAA field,  was chosen third, and UC Santa Barbara, which was 21-9 and lost in the second  round, was fourth.  </P></p>

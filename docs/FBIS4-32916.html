			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 29 May (PL) -- The Cuban Government today  reaffirmed its categorical rejection of the illegal entrance to  diplomatic offices in Havana as a means to abandon the country.    A press note issued at noon by the national television  newscast referred to the forceful entrance by more than 100  Cubans to the Belgian ambassador's residence on Saturday  afternoon "to apply pressure tactics in order to leave the  country."    It pointed out that "this new incident is nothing more than  the result of provocations to commit illegal actions by  counterrevolutionary stations that transmit from Miami, and  especially the result of the restrictive policy implemented by  the U.S. immigration authorities."    The United States, the note adds, "continues to obstruct the  legal procedures of people interested in migrating to that  country who, after failing several times, resort to illegal  means, even violent ones, to achieve their goal."    The text, which was also aired by the radio stations, says  that the Cuban Government has not prevented the departure from  the island of people who complete their procedures legally.    Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said that the group  occupying the Belgian diplomatic residence must leave that place  "because pressure tactics and forceful means are not adequate  mechanisms to leave Cuba." He pointed out that the island, in  view of this incident, will maintain its usual position and that  the Belgian authorities, being aware of the position toward such  cases, should take the proper measures.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Attempts of Athens and Greek Minority Representatives for </F> Hellenization of the South of Albania -- According to REPUBLIKA  Newspaper" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, June 13 (ATA) -- REPUBLIKA newspaper  published yesterday a letter of the initiating commission for  creating the Dhkoema Party in Albania, democratic party of the  Greek minority in Albania. In this letter, the commission has  requested from the Greek Government to ready the money, radio  stations and arms for liberation of Vorio Epirus (northern  Epirus).    Referring to the letter, REPUBLIKA writes that "It is a  witness of the Athens' attempts and representatives of the Greek  minority in Albania for organizing the Greek forces in Albania  in a radical form. Those who have signed the letter request  from Athens a more careful policy and a greater attention toward  the Hellenization of the south of Albania. They have generous  suggestions, and requests for technical means, arms, money,  self-organization, headquarters in Athens, radio station in  Vorio Epirus etc. They propose Athens that in the centre of its  propaganda with Albanians should be stressed that Italy and  other Western states are not friend countries of Albania.  Intending to create an isolation climate toward Albania, the  objective is that Albania be dependent on Greece and in order  that it might be easier for Greece to exercise its policy of  dictation.</p>

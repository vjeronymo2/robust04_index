			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NRA AND SECOND AMENDMENT  </P> <P> This is a letter to National Rifle Assn. members:  </P> <P> You keep talking about the Second Amendment.  </P> <P> I hate to tell you fellows, but none of today's guns are covered by the Second  Amendment.  </P> <P> Now, if you have a single-shot cap and ball pistol or a single-shot,  muzzle-loading rifle you're covered. Anything else is not covered.  </P> <P> These were the guns the Second Amendment was written for; that's all there were  in those days. Too bad.  </P> <P> RON EKARD  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

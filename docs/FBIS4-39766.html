			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Excerpt] Moscow, 9 Jun -- Russian State Duma chairman Ivan  Rybkin thinks Boris Yeltsin's decrees on economic reform  appeared because of "the known backwardness of Russian  legislation." This is what he stated today while opening  parliamentary hearings on the strengthening of cooperation  between the federal authorities and local state administrative  bodies.    Ivan Rybkin reported that the important gap in the  legislation should be overcome as soon as possible and key  legislative acts needed to be adopted for this to happen,  including civil and land codes as well as a number of laws on  legislation.

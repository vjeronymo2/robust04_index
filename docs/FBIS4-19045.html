			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The GATT Agreement Includes a Long </F> List of Defects"]    [Text] Marrakesh, Duesseldorf, 11 Apr -- German economic  researchers have expressed skepticism about the future role of  the World Trade Organization [WTO] and the GATT agreement, which  is ready for signature. In a poll conducted by HANDELSBLATT,  the Ifo Institute [Institute for Economic Research] in Munich  said that the GATT agreement can make only a partial  contribution to containing protectionism. The decisive thing  is, much rather, that the individual states combat unemployment  and ensure the reduction of foreign trade imbalances.    The IfW [Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research]  stressed that the agreement can stand up to protectionism only  if it is possible to punish the most important parties to the  agreement, above all the European Union [EU] and the United  States, with tangible sanctions in the case of proven violations  of the agreement and to prevent them from one-sidedly  implementing bilateral measures. The Federation of German  Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT) points to the weak  sanction mechanisms of GATT.    The DIW [German Economic Research Institute], Berlin, is  more  optimistic about the chances of GATT holding its own against  growing protectionism. The HWWA [Hamburg Economic Research  Institute] fears that the new WTO will be overstrained by the  comprehensive inclusion of global environmental issues.    The results of the Uruguay Round should be urgently  consolidated and expanded. Industry is willing to support the  government with all its strength. The Uruguay Round topics that  are still open should be settled as soon as possible by means of  further negotiations, and the work to establish a functioning  WTO should be tackled. This demand is made by the employers'  associations of the United States, Japan, and the European Union  with a common appeal addressed to the GATT ministers' conference  in Marrakesh.    Everything should be done to ratify the new GATT agreements  by the end of 1994 so that they can be implemented at the  beginning of 1995. UNICE [Union of EC Industries], Kaidaren,  the U.S. Chambers of Commerce, the U.S. Council for  International Business, and the National Association of  Manufacturers welcome the fact that great progress has been made  in the field of agriculture and with the full inclusion of  services, of intellectual property, and of direct investments in  the GATT discipline.    The employers assume that further abolition of customs  duties  and trade obstacles will lead to a strong expansion of world  trade. In addition, discrimination and protectionism will be  prevented by stricter rules. Finally, with the WTO, an  organization is established that can, in the future, contribute  effectively to stabilizing world trade and to settling conflicts  that have developed. Violations of the spirit and letter of  free world trade are made considerably more difficult.</p>

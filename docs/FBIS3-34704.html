[passage omitted]    The Tzomet faction is demanding that the prime minister make  it clear whether Zvili's remarks were made with Rabin's  knowledge. Tzomet said Rabin had made a commitment that a  Palestinian state would not be established, and that not all of  the Golan would be handed back. Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan  said that if Zvili's remarks were correct, then the State of  Israel's days were numbered, and the countdown had started.    Likud Bureau chairman, Knesset Member 'Uzi Landau, said  after  two years of misleading the public and deception, Nisim Zvili  had finally spoken the truth on the prime minister's secret  intentions. The Likud demanded that Rabin immediately submit to  the Knesset the agreements formulated with Jordan and the draft  accords with the Syrians.    The head of the Golan settlements committee, Eli Malka, said  Zvili's remarks were a scandal and deceive the public. If the  Labor Party had decided to hand over the Golan, what was the  purpose of negotiations? And, if that was the Labor Party's  position, he demanded an immediate referendum.    On another matter, Absorption Minister Ya'ir Tzaban told the  Hashomer Hatza'ir council that residents of Netzarim in the Gaza  Strip are making it difficult for the Army to carry out its  duties, and their behavior requires a sharp reaction. The  residents are demanding security for places that should never  have been set up, but refuse to rent empty buildings.    Foreign Minister Peres said one should ask out loud what is  the point of keeping Netzarim where there are only 28 families  and a company of soldiers had to defend them. The chairman of  Netzarim's secretariat, Shlomo Kostina, said Peres' remarks  disclosed his intentions regarding settlement in the Golan, the  Jordan Valley, and Judaea and Samaria. He invited Peres to  visit Netzarim now and in 10 years time.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / IMF and Algeria to resume debt talks Officials of the International Monetary Fund arrive in Algiers tomorrow for negotiations with the Algerian government after what has amounted to an 18-month freeze. However, political instability will make it difficult for Algiers to reach an agreement with the IMF and its leading creditors on the country's Dollars 26bn foreign debt. As soon as he was appointed prime minister three months ago, Mr Redha Malek made public his wish to reach agreement with the IMF and Algeria's leading foreign creditors. Servicing the debt will cost Dollars 9.4bn this year, absorbing 83 per cent of exports of goods and services. Loosening the noose of debt repayments is thus key to increasing economic activity which depends on the imports of raw materials and semi-processed goods. Any agreement with the IMF depends on the ability of Algerian leaders to implement bold domestic reforms. A reform package was launched in 1989 which opened up the country to foreign investment, abolished state monopoly of foreign trade and devalued the dinar. However, Mr Malek's immediate predecessor, Mr Belaid Abdessalam, put these reforms into reverse gear, thus compounding the country's economic woes. Economy minister Mourad Benachenhou was reported by the Algerian Press Service yesterday as saying he favoured a rescheduling of the country's foreign debt, although he said all options 'remain open'.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / EU to be pressed on procurements The government plans to urge the European Commission to play an increased role in monitoring the Pounds 500bn-a-year European public procurement market in an attempt to reduce alleged malpractice by other member states. The move is intended to address concerns that British companies may be losing out in Europe because of abuses of the European Union's public procurement directive, which is intended to open all but the smallest public contracts to European-wide competition. The directive, introduced at the beginning of last year, is a central element in the EU's single-market programme. The public procurement market accounts for about 15 per cent of EU gross domestic product. Mr Neil Hamilton, the trade minister with responsibility for internal market issues, said many UK companies were making the most of opportunities which the single market had brought and were winning new business in Europe. But, he said: 'It is important that where the single market is not delivering those opportunities, we should take action to put things right.' He was unveiling the final report of the Department of Trade and Industry's year-long public procurement review, conducted with the help of members of the Confederation of British Industry and trade organisations. It showed there had been no significant change in cross-border purchasing patterns. It also found some systematic abuses of the system by purchasers in other member states which were likely to put British companies at a disadvantage. These include abuse of the so-called 'accelerated procedure' for fast-track contracts, and the use of procedures for selecting bidders in a way that disadvantages foreign or non-traditional suppliers. DTI officials said individual complaints were few. Of about 220 replies to the department's questionnaire, only eight of substance remained, excluding companies which did not want to pursue their complaint. A 19-point action plan includes recommendations that alleged malpractice be taken up immediately at a high level within the commission, which is urged to monitor the market more closely. UK officials said more needed to be done to advertise public contracts and awards properly in the EU Official Journal.</p>

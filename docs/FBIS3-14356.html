Answering reporters' questions after this session, [Syrian]  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' stressed that the Arab boycott  of Israel was not included on the agenda of the Arab League  Council's session. He added that the Council reviewed the  report of the Damascus-based central Arab Boycott Office.

He noted that this issue was decided at the  Council's economic committee.    Asked about Syria's position on the issue of amending the  Arab League Charter, the foreign minister said this issue was  postponed until there is a sound and healthy Arab situation so  the amendment can be made on sound basis.

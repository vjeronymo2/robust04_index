			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie scores strongest daily gain this year - Market Report Highly positive developments, in terms of economic and corporate recovery as well as inflation and interest rate prospects, yesterday inspired the strongest session recorded this year on the UK stock market. The FT-SE 100 Index broke through an important chart point to close 60.1 higher on the day at 3,157.5 as investors moved in ahead of publication of the views on inflation expressed in the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin, which was released just before the equity market closed. Firmness in the US dollar, overnight strength on Wall Street and reports from Tokyo that the US-Japan trade talks will reopen next month set the stage for a strong opening in London. Lingering concerns over base rate prospects were further calmed by a further round of benign operations in the London money market by the Bank of England. Share prices, encouraged both by demand from stock index futures and strong gains in UK government bonds, had already achieved most of their gains before the Bank Bulletin was released, but closed very near to the best of the day. Trading reports from British Petroleum and National Westminster Bank, both exceeding market expectations, underscored perceptions that share prices are now driven by prospects for higher company profits and dividend payouts, as well as by belief that inflation will remain under con-trol in the UK. The market was very confident at the close, although Wall Street disappointed with a virtually unchanged Dow Industrial Average. Equity chart specialists, pointing out that the Footsie had broken through an important testing level around 3,140, prophesied that the market could soon test the 3,200 level and then perhaps the 3,500 mark, still seen as the high end of analysts' forecasts for the year. The September contract on the Footsie touched 3,188 in late trading. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 32 points at 3,673.4, although the focus of the day was on the blue chip international stocks. Trading volume increased sharply towards the end of the session and Seaq volume finally totalled 810.3m shares, compared with 544.7m on Monday, when retail, or customer, business in equities was worth Pounds 1.22bn. The strongest performances came among the dollar-orientated issues, with Glaxo and Shell Transport to the fore as the results from BP and National Westminster set the stage for an improving scenario. The banking sector was in strong form, with the merchant banks and integrated securities trading houses in demand as investors weighed the implications for profit and loss accounts of the resurgence of confidence in global markets. Consumer and retail stocks, including the leading UK high street traders, also advanced as the market took the view that higher base rates will probably be delayed until later in the year. There were some warning voices, however, pointing out that rises in domestic interest rates have only been postponed, and that strong corporate profits are likely to increase inflationary pressure. A more considered response to the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin is more likely to come today after strategists at the leading securities houses have had time to examine the Bank's comments on inflation more thoroughly. Traders admitted that some leading houses had moved too strongly on to the bear tack on Friday afternoon, when the Bank's actions in the London money markets raised the alarm on base rate prospects. This meant that the sudden recovery in confidence brought a hurried scramble to buy stock which, with the stock index futures supplying extra pressure, inevitably drove share prices ahead very strongly.</p>

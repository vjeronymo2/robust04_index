			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Maxwell warns on MCC result MAXWELL Communication Corporation, the media conglomerate founded by the flamboyant newspaper publisher, Mr Robert Maxwell, yesterday issued a profits warning to investors. The warning, which was included in a shareholders' circular on the sale of Pergamon Press, the scientific publishing company, comes at an eventful time even by the standards of the ebullient Mr Maxwell. Last week the controversial publisher launched a lavish marketing campaign for the forthcoming Pounds 500m stock market flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers - of which he is chairman. Last month he announced he was relinquishing the role of chairman of MCC to concentrate on the relaunch of the New York Daily News, the ailing US tabloid newspaper which he rescued earlier this year. MCC has warned investors that profits for the last financial year to March 31 would be lower than in the previous year when it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 172.3m on turnover of Pounds 1.24bn. The group attributed the fall in profits to its unexpectedly slow progress in making disposals. MCC has been trying to reduce its debt through the disposal programme. This has been hindered by the impact of the US and UK economic recessions on the international publishing industry. MCC had originally hoped to reduce its debt by Dollars 750m (Pounds 441m) by the end of the last financial year. However, it said the 'present economic climate' was 'not conducive to significant disposals of media businesses'. It added that it had refused to make disposals at 'other than satisfactory prices'. The group recently succeeded in selling Pergamon - the heart of Mr Maxwell's original business which is based in the grounds of his Oxford home - to Elsevier, the Dutch publishing group, for Pounds 446m. However, that sale came too late to affect its 1990-91 results and will be included in MCC's interim results. MCC said it was 'confident of a strong profit performance' from its companies in the current financial year and expressed its 'confidence' about the future. It said it intended to complete further disposals 'at satisfactory prices' to cut its debt 'as soon as possible'. Mr Maxwell will step down as MCC chairman after the Mirror Group flotation.</p>

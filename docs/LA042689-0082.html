			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> GAY COUPLES POLICY BACKED  </P> <P> San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos said he will support a newly introduced domestic  partners proposal that would provide gay and lesbian couples with some of the  benefits that married couples receive. "I look forward to signing" the  proposal, Agnos said during a press conference called by Supervisor Harry Britt  to introduce the measure. Among other things, the proposal would require the  city to provide partners of gay and lesbian city employees with the same health  insurance and other benefits that opposite-sex spouses receive. Britt said he  was assured of support from the majority of supervisors and expects a vote on  the measure in May. In 1982, Britt proposed similar measure that was passed by  the board of supervisors, but was vetoed by then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein.  </P></p>

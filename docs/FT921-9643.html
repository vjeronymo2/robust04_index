			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates soften RATES eased in the money markets yesterday as traders got excited about possible a cut in UK rates this week. However, most economists said sterling's position within the exchange rate mechanism precluded a cut being announced with Friday's retail price index, as rumoured. 'Sterling is still the weakest and, bearing in mind the Bundesbank is unlikely to cut rates,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist with Yamaichi International, 'that closes the window of opportunity for a UK rate cut.' Mr McKinnon suggested that, as a result, Chancellor Norman Lamont might offer more generous terms in his budget. Short-term money was fairly cheap, with everything up to one year at 10 1/2 per cent or below. The key three-month interbank rate was the highest at 10 9/16 - 7/16 per cent. The March short sterling contract jumped early in the day to 89.77, from Friday's close of 89.66, and remained there. This suggested the market was expecting an interest rate of 10.23 per cent. Economists have not discounted an interest rate cut before the summer. The main impetus to the current rate cut rumour appeared to be the Bank of England's early action in taking out its forecast Pounds 1.45bn shortage. All but Pounds 142m was eliminated with cheaper band three and four bills - at interest rates of between 10 3/32 and 10 1/16 per cent - and a Pounds 1.215bn resale agreement at 10 7/16 per cent which falls due on March 2. A Bank official warned against reading too much into the small amount done at the cheaper rate, or the early action. The bulk of the shortage was due to treasury bills and maturing assistance. Overnight rates bounced around, falling to 9 per cent, then rising to 12 and ending the day at a more normal 10 7/16 - 5/16 per cent. German call rates were slightly firmer yesterday, at 9.55/65 per cent, compared with Friday's 9.55/60 per cent. The market expected the Bundesbank to keep liquidity tight in this week's round of securities repurchase agreements. A DM30.6bn repo falls due on Wednesday. In the US, the Federal Reserve gave a clear signal that it would not ease rates during the day, with a drain on reserves at 3 7/8 per cent. However, a cut some time soon is not being discounted by economists, who point out that there are no inflationary constraints.</p>

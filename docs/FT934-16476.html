			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Daimler's new gloss Given some of the hype which has gone with privatisations in the UK, it is perhaps churlish to jib at the hoop-la which accompanied Daimler Benz's New York listing. Yet the US placing is of primarily symbolic significance. Only a small percentage of Daimler's stock is being sold and much of that to retail investors - presumably in the hope that it will not find its way back across the Atlantic on the next departing Concorde. That hardly provides a market broad and deep enough to raise substantial new capital; Daimler will need to work hard expanding the current New York base if it is to garner significant funds there. Perhaps that is not the point. There have long been hints that Deutsche Bank is keen to reduce its stake and it may thus be significant that some of its shares are on offer. That is a direct pressure on Daimler's management, since its new shareholders may not be as tolerant of flabby performance as a long-term German partner. It is also an indirect squeeze since the US accounting practices which Daimler has had to follow show just how deep a hole the company is in. Ironically, that shock may actually help Daimler's board market an aggressive retrenchment programme to the company's managers and workforce. Further cutbacks seem inevitable given the car and truck division's bloated cost base and the less than scintillating performance of the businesses acquired in the drive to diversify. Whether the company is moving fast enough in that direction is, however, a moot point. More radical surgery may be needed if US investors are to help fund a future rights issue at anything like the current price - especially when one notes that US carmakers sell at almost a third the rating of sky-high Daimler.</p>

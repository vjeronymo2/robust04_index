			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Almaty 9 June TASS--A regular plenary session of the  parliament of Kazakhstan began here on Thursday [9 June] with a  speech by President Nursultan Nazarbayev.    Prior to the session, the president had addressed the  parliament in a message, advocating an acceleration of  market-oriented reforms and suggesting a wide package of  measures to take the country's economy out of the crisis.    The message was officially referred to the parliament  secretariat on Thursday morning. In the afternoon the message  is expected to be presented to the deputies for study and  discussion.    According to competent sources, the message makes a  political  evaluation of the internal situation in the country and  Kazakhstan's foreign-policy stand, and the reform process, and  analyses the activities of state power bodies to implement the  strategic policy of building a democratic state with a market  economy.    At the same time the message defines key orientations of  state policy consistently to carry out reforms in all spheres of  economic and social life, strengthen Kazakhstan's statehood and  the socio-political unity of the peoples inhabiting it.    The message formulates clearly political and economic goals  and sets appropriate tasks to power and administration bodies  for a subsequent period.    The presidential message is manifestly aimed at  consolidating  all branches of state power and all forces of society and at  mustering the efforts of all political parties, movements and  associations and all robust potential of the state with a view  to taking the country out of the deep crisis, deepening reforms,  contributing towards democracy and strengthening the Republic's  sovereignty.</p>

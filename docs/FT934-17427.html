			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Russia, US in debt deal: Swift action on foreign aid to show support for Yeltsin RUSSIA yesterday agreed on terms for rescheduling Dollars 1.1bn of debt repayments to the US, as the Senate passed a bill paving the way for Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) of aid to Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union. The Senate voted overwhelmingly in favour of a Dollars 13bn foreign aid bill and sent the legislation to President Bill Clinton for signature. Within the Dollars 2.5bn total allotted to the countries of the former Soviet union, Dollars 300m was specifically earmarked for Ukraine. Congress also renewed conditions it wants Russia to fulfil before its share of the aid is released. The principal condition which Russia has not yet met is the withdrawal of its troops from Latvia and Estonia. The bill gives the president the right, however, to waive this condition if he determines it is in the US national interest. Congress has hurried to complete its work on the aid bill in an effort to demonstrate US support for President Boris Yeltsin in the power struggle in Moscow. 'It is in our best interest to put our faith and hope in democracy in Russia,' said Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate subcommittee handling foreign aid money. 'I think that the United States and the free world ought to hang in there with a person that is clearly the most committed to democracy and market reform of all the people now operating in Russia,' added Mr Clinton. Aid to Russia and other countries will, however, be cut by the amount of parking fines left unpaid by their diplomats in Washington. Complex manoeuvring to find room for the aid package within the tight constraints of the US budget meant that the bill needed to be signed into law by midnight last night, when the US fiscal year ended. Meanwhile, Mr Clinton extended new trading privileges to Russia by adding it to the list of countries benefitting from the Generalised System of Preferences, while Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, signed an agreement rescheduling Russia's bilateral debt with the US. The agreement follows a similar bilateral arrangement between Russia and Germany covering Dollars 5bn in repayments. Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister, said Russia would pay close to Dollars 1bn to its creditors in the Paris Club of lender governments in the next week, adding that Russia would also need to reschedule its Dollars 18bn of debt service falling due next year. Other elements of the foreign aid bill include authorisation for the White House to lift restrictions on the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, and to write off debts owed by low income countries. It provides Dollars 1.02bn for the International Development Association, the World Bank unit which provides low interest rate loans to the very poorest countries - less than the Dollars 1.25bn a year which the US had pledged for the next three years. As expected, the bill includes no money at all for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Peter Norman adds from Washington: Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank president, said the bank was 'frustrated' in its lending efforts by constitutional problems in Russia. He said some credits approved by the bank's executive board had not been activated. These included financial assistance for privatisation and a social safety net in Russia.</p>

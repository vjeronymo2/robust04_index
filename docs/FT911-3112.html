			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Arts: Today's Television BBC Bristol begins a new season of its ever-interesting 10 x 10 series of short films by first-time directors with a work called 'The Fall' (10.20 BBC2). If this doesn't make you cry nothing will. The Intermezzo from 'Cavalleria Rusticana' can, on its own, reduce some to tears and when used as the central theme in a ballet about Celeste Dandeker, a dancer who was permanently paralysed by an accident on stage, it is enough to make you howl. It is quite something to convey as much as this little film does about dance, and unfairness, and the human spirit, all in 10 minutes. Channel 4's Short Stories (8.30) investigates the group of people who listen to and join in Clive Bull's late night phone-in show on London's LBC Radio. A new series of Your Life In Their Hands (9.30 BBC2) begins with a look at spiritual healing. Derek Jarman's homosexual film Sebastiane (11.35) in the 'Banned' season on C4 might have seemed more accessible to ordinary viewers if the dialogue was not in Latin. (English subtitles).</p>

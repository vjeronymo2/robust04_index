			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Conference of Building Codes and Standards (NCSBCS), under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract with the Department, sent a team to inspect manufactured homes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Andrew. Their report, dated September 25,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 (Rev. October 1, 1992), evaluated anchoring systems used in Florida and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Louisiana. The team found that virtually all manufactured homes they saw in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida had been anchored, but anchors had failed in most destroyed homes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the systems that failed were anchors embedded only two feet into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the soil, which were pulled out of the ground by the force of the storm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other systems that failed included short anchors embedded in concrete or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driven into the coral. In Louisiana, most manufactured homes the team saw had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no anchoring systems at all, or only had two or three anchors on each side;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than one-half the number generally specified by manufacturers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions for hurricane zones. Also, where anchors were installed, most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had been installed incorrectly; often embedded only partially in the ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with 12 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; or more protruding above finished grade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the majority of anchoring system failures appeared to result from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improper installation, the NCSBCS Team observed several cases where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holding capacity of anchors appeared to have been reduced because of water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saturated soil. In order to determine the adequacy of anchoring systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed in soil that might be exposed to heavy rainfall and hurricane force  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> winds, further investigating and testing of anchors will be conducted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous failures reported after Hurricanes Andrew and Hugo and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous wind storms support the Department's concerns over anchoring systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for manufactured housing that are inadequate to resist probable high wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forces. In addition, as the NIST Report indicated: ``[i]f superstructure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failures had not occurred [in Hurricane Andrew], the number of anchor system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failures might well have been greater &blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some field and laboratory testing of commercially available ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anchor and steel strapping systems has been conducted under a HUD contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Wiss, Janney, &amp; Elstner, Inc. (See WJE Report No. 901798, July 26, 1991,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD USER_HUD&hyph;0005823). The initial test results indicate that anchors have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a significantly lower load resistance capacity than even the levels required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the current standard. Resistance or capacity would be even lower if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anchors are not installed in accordance with anchor manufacturer's and home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's installation instructions or under saturated soil conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has also been conducting laboratory tests to evaluate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance of manufactured home support and anchoring systems to lateral wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and seismic forces. After the results of the laboratory data have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated and compared to the field data, the Department may propose changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to lower allowable anchor system resistance values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the interim, the Department cautions home and anchor manufacturers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installers, retailers, insurance companies, lenders, and State and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government agencies that anchoring should be rated for specific soil, loading,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and installation conditions for which the anchor is acceptable. Failure to do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so may result in anchoring and tiedown systems which have inadequate ultimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity to resist probable design wind forces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Analysis of Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Characterization of Commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received 1,116 comments in response to the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the notice extending the comment period. Although approximately 235 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these comments are included in file of the Rules Docket Clerk as being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received under the extended deadline, many of these were delayed in receipt in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Rules Docket Clerk office because they were sent first to other offices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The great majority of the comments were duplicative or identical form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letters (of the 1,116 total comments, only 75 to 100 included distinctive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments). The commenters generally can be characterized as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _ Businesses (including retailers, manufacturers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suppliers, finance companies, park owners, etc.)_704 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Industry groups (including State and national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations)_24 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Members of Congress (including original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correspondence and transmittals of constituent letters)_245 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Other governmental agencies and representatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Federal, State, and local agencies or representatives)_27 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Members of the National Manufactured Home Advisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council (individually)_15 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Individuals (including consumers, engineers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other experts, salespersons, etc., in individual capacities)_80 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Private standards groups_6 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Consumer groups_2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Tenants groups_1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Insurance industry_3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _National Commission on Manufactured Housing_1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _DAPIA (Design Approval Primary Inspection Agency)_2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Correspondence forwarded from White House_2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Law firms_3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Other national associations_1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many of the comments received by the Department and addressed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following discussion were common to numerous commenters. Other less universal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments addressed in the discussion may be referenced by number in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parentheses following a statement. These numbers correspond to the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given the comment in the file maintained by the Rules Docket Clerk. Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filed as received in response to the original comment period are referenced as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers 1&hyph;882 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 817 was inadvertently skipped in the numbering sequence),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while those in response to the extended comment period are referenced as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ^235 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments, Generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters acknowledged the need to update the Department's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for manufactured housing. One commenter (77) welcomed the better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publicity and reputation the industry would enjoy as a result of updated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. However, many of these commenters also stated opposition to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific standards proposed by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> About two dozen commenters, including consumer and insurance industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups, standards organizations, government agencies, and engineers, generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported the basic standard proposed (e.g., 17, 55, 76, 137, 145, 150, 197,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 633, 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 204 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 207 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), although several of these commenters also expressed concern about specific cost items. Supporting comments emphasized the importance of affordable, safe housing, rather than merely affordable housing (17), and characterized ASCE 7&hyph;88 as the only consensus wind standard in the Country (76, and others).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Procedural Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The 30-day comment period allowed in the proposed rule did not permit sufficient consideration of the rule and development of public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments. In addition, the justification for the shortened effective date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed rule had indicated would apply to the final rule was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justified by the need to implement regulatory changes before the 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hurricane season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Because of the numerous requests for longer response periods from both the public and members of Congress, and because it was apparent that a rule could not be in place in time for the 1993 hurricane season, the Department has allowed additional time for public comments and implementation of the final rule. The proposed rule was published on April 14, 1993, and the comment period was extended to July 9, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the Department's desire to consider the full extent of public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response on this rule, the Department has continued to receive comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regularly while the final rule and regulatory impact analysis were being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared and has continued to log and review those comments. Therefore, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect, the comment period for this rule has been approximately 5 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To alleviate the concerns relating to the industry's need for ample time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to redesign homes and retool manufacturing facilities, the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided to extend the effective date originally proposed for this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the rule provides for an effective date of, at least, 180 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from today's date of publication. Thus, the concerns of the commenters in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regards have been addressed by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

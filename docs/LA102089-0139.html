			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CORONA DEL MAR HOLDS ON TO DEFEAT SADDLEBACK, 17-14  </P> <P> Corona del Mar High School beat Saddleback, 17-14, in a Sea View League game  Thursday at Newport Harbor High, and all it took was an interception returned  for touchdown and a long field goal on a windy night.  </P> <P> Get the feeling this wasn't easy?  </P> <P> The difference in the game was Jerrott Willard, Corona del Mar's  linebacker/running back/kicker, who kicked a 39-yard field goal with 54 seconds  left in the third quarter. The field goal came after an eight-play Corona del  Mar drive had stalled at the Saddleback 22. Willard, who has kicked a 44-yarder  this season, had this one clear the crossbar with a lot to spare.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar scored first on Brian Lucas' two-yard run in the second quarter  which capped a 60-yard drive. Willard ran twice for 39 yards in the drive.  </P> <P> The Sea Kings (5-2, 1-1) scored midway through the second quarter when  defensive back Mark Perlmutter intercepted Saddleback quarterback Paul Delgado  at the Corona del Mar 27 and returned the ball 73 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Saddleback finally mounted a drive late in the first half. Delgado, who  completed five passes for 62 yards on the drive, was the main weapon as the  Roadrunners (3-4, 1-1) drove from their 20. The score came when Delgado, his  team on the Corona del Mar 19, threw a pass to Tony Colthirst, who managed to  get into the end zone despite going up against seven defenders.  </P> <P> But Saddleback's offense had trouble starting in the second half, and when  Willard kicked his field goal, it appeared that Corona del Mar had a safe 17-14  lead with 54 seconds to play in the third quarter.  </P> <P> But, again, Saddleback drove 80 yards and scored, this time on Delgado's  five-yard pass to Robert Reyes, who made an exceptional leaping catch.  </P> <P> On its next drive, Saddleback would get as far as the Corona del Mar 30, but  Delgado overthrew a receiver and was intercepted by George Dickson. On  Saddleback's last drive, Delgado, who completed 18 of 33 passes for 190 yards,  drove his team to its 42 before being intercepted by Weston Johnson.  </P></p>

And everybody can buy them, no matter whether  he is a foreigner or a Macedonian." In a lecture at the  Austrian Economic Chamber, Jane Miljovski, privatization  minister of the Yugoslav successor republic Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], was looking for  helpers on the difficult path into an economic future.    Currently, Macedonia is suffering from the UN sanctions  against what remains of Yugoslavia and from the crumbling of  Yugoslavia as a whole: In the past, 70 percent of Macedonian  exports went to the other Yugoslav republics, 60 percent of that  to Serbia; now deliveries to Serbia are prohibited by the UN  sanctions.    Goods that are exported elsewhere can be brought to their  destination only with great difficulties: The roads lead  through the rump Yugoslavia, which is closed to transit, or  though Greece, which has closed its borders to its small  neighbor. With this, Athens wants to force Macedonia to change  the name of its state.  <H5>  Privatization Has Started </H5>   Miljovski explains that the new privatization law has been  in  force just for three months and has not yet had a great effect.  About 1,400 companies are to be transferred from "social" to  private ownership. Generally, a buyer for 51 percent of the  companies searched first. With this it is intended to make sure  that the company is taken over by a responsible owner and is  managed with an orientation toward profits and that there are no  speculations.    In Skopje, it is known that the domestic savings assets  cover  only about 10 percent of the value of the companies. Therefore,  the state wants to lend the owner 41 percent of the company's  value for five years, if the new owner fulfills two conditions:  He must create jobs and pay taxes.    Skopje is also aware of the fact that foreign investors are  not particularly lining up to buy, because the infrastructure --  high rents, bad telephone lines, a lack of electricity, to give  just a few examples -- is still a few steps away from European  standards even though improvements are underway.    Foreign trading partners also complain that Slovenia can  export self-imported goods to Macedonia practically without  customs duties -- in contrast to that, the other countries have  to overcome very high customs barriers. Miljovski explains that  this is due to the UN request not to erect any trade barriers  for the ex-Yugoslav area during the search for peace. The  discrepancy will certainly be abolished soon, Miljvoski says.</p>

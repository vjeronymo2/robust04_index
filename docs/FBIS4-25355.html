			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Jiang Zemin at the Central Military </F> Commission's rank-conferring ceremony in Beijing on 8 June]    [Text] Comrades: A Central Military Commission [CMC]  decree has just been announced to confer a new military rank on  Xu Huizi and 18 other comrades, promoting them to the rank of  general. On behalf of the party Central Committee, State  Council, and CMC I would like to warmly congratulate the  comrades who have been promoted to the rank of general.    The promotion of these comrades to the rank of general once  again demonstrates the great importance placed by the party and  state on army building, and reflects the CMC's great trust and  deep concern. It is hoped the comrades who have been promoted in  rank will highly cherish the great honor bestowed upon them by  the party and people, recognize the heavy responsibility they  are shouldering, do honor to their mission, justify the great  trust placed in them, learn modestly, work hard, and make new  contributions to strengthening our army's revolutionization,  modernization, and regularization.    Since the 14th National CPC Congress, the CMC has  strengthened strategic guidance over national defense and army  building; vigorously promoted our army's fine tradition; further  intensified efforts to build up leadership bodies and cadre  ranks; and carried out a variety of tasks related to military  and political affairs, logistics, defense-related scientific  research, equipment upgrading, and the buildup of reserve forces  under the guiding principles of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas  for army building during the new period. It has brought about  new improvements in the army's rallying power and combat  effectiveness, made substantial progress in army building, and  successfully completed the various tasks assigned by the party  and state.    Our country's socialist modernization drive is currently in  a  crucial period. Seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, open  wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain  stability is in the general interest of party-wide work.  Realizing and maintaining this general interest is inevitably  required for upholding the party's basic line, with the goal of  ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of our  national economy, as well as the all-around advancement and  ultimate success of the cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The entire party and army, as well as people  across the country, should conscientiously safeguard, defer to,  and promote this general interest. During the entire  modernization process, we must properly handle the relationship  among reform, development, and stability, making every effort to  advance reform and development amid stability and to ensure  long-term social stability through reform and development. A  strong army and strong national defense always provide powerful  support for reform, opening up, and modernization, as well as a  reliable guarantee for consolidating state power, promoting  social stability and economic development, and bringing the  people peace. Comrades throughout the army should fully  recognize the heavy responsibility shouldered by our army, defer  to and serve the general interest of party-wide work in  everything they do, prepare themselves for danger in times of  peace, be always on the alert, make every effort to improve army  building, and make even greater contributions to promoting  reform and development, safeguarding the motherland's security  and unity, and maintaining social stability and unity.    Senior cadres in our army are the backbone of military  administration. The party Central Committee and CMC's strategic  intentions should first be carried out through senior cadres.  Now the party Central Committee has laid down its major  policies and principles, and the CMC has provided clear-cut work  guidance, the important thing is to carry them out. Leading  cadres at all levels must earnestly practice what they advocate.  More important, senior cadres should pay close attention to  political studies; heighten the concept of party spirit;  resolutely follow the party's instructions; steadfastly  implement the party's line, principles, and policies; firmly  follow the party Central Committee and CMC's command; faithfully  and assiduously work for the party and people with a keen sense  of dedication and responsibility; and splendidly accomplish the  chief mission assigned to them by history.    As early as when the entire party shifted the focus of its  work to socialist modernization, Comrade Deng Xiaoping noted  explicitly: "The entire party must learn anew." He said: "Our  party, CPC members, and the Chinese people should always learn  in the face of an endless stream of new problems." Because of  the swift progress in our national construction and army  building, new contradictions, problems, expertise, and  experiences have come to the fore in an endless stream, and we  should doubly stress learning, investigation, and study. With a  clear theoretical understanding and a firm theoretical basis, we  can implement the party's line, principles, and policies more  conscientiously. For senior army cadres to intensify their  learning and studies is not only important for their own  progress and improvement but also for long-term army building.  Keeping reality in mind, senior cadres throughout the army must  conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as his ideas for  army building during the new period. They should gain a  profound understanding of the quintessence of emancipating the  mind and seeking truth from facts; work hard to study and master  the scientific world outlook and methodology on dialectical and  historical materialism that pervade Comrade Xiaoping's works;  and strive to inherit and improve upon Mao Zedong's military  thought. They should pay attention to acquiring modern  scientific and technological know-how, study strategies and  tactics for waging a people's war in a high-technology setting,  and master the skills of commanding modern warfare. Through  learning, they should improve their theoretical knowledge of  Marxism, strengthen their political conviction in socialism,  conscientiously remold their world outlook, actively improve  their leadership style and methods, and continue to improve  their leadership standards and commanding skills. In short,  every senior cadre should learn, and learn anew, in real earnest.    We should take the lead in promoting an arduous pioneering  spirit and the fine work style of maintaining close ties with  the masses. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a  completely new cause that has never been tried before. To put  the state and army's great pioneering work into practice, it is  imperative that we carry forward the tradition of Red Army  veterans, promote the "five types of revolutionary spirit"  [revolutionary and death-defying spirit; spirit of observing  strict discipline and sacrificing oneself; spirit of  selflessness and placing other people's interests above one's  own; spirit of defeating all enemies and overcoming all  difficulties; and spirit of scoring victory by maintaining  revolutionary optimism and surmounting all difficulties -- from  speech by Deng Xiaoping at a CPC Central Committee work  conference on 25 December 1980] initiated by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping, always maintain our flesh-and-blood ties with people,  and make concerted efforts to keep advancing our cause. Senior  cadres throughout the army must always serve the people  wholeheartedly, earnestly work for people's interests, wage  arduous struggles, honestly perform their official duties, and  take a modest, prudent, and realistic approach. They must  project this good image when they appear before the broad ranks  of cadres and fighters, and when they conduct themselves in  society. This is a question of great importance to troop morale  and the army's high prestige. They should keep in mind our  army's character and goal at all times, not pursue personal fame  and wealth, give no thought to personal gain or loss, and devote  all their energy and attention to the party and army's cause.  They should exercise their power correctly, readily accept  supervision by party organizations and people, closely guard  against the corrosion of debauchery, prevent the practice of  trading power for money, and always maintain the sterling  qualities of CPC members and revolutionary armymen. They should  heed cadres and fighters' voices, keep people's well-being in  mind despite their high positions, think of ways to solve the  practical problems of grass-roots units, and stay in touch with  people at all times. They should go deep into the realities of  life, go down to grass-roots units, throw themselves into  practical work, and guard against empty talk and formalism.  Through the exemplary conduct of senior cadres, we should carry  forward and improve upon our party and army's fine tradition and  work style in the new situation. In building up leadership  bodies, we should earnestly groom and select prominent young  cadres who are both professionally competent and politically  reliable, advance the cause of introducing younger leadership  bodies, and place old, middle-aged, and young people in  leadership positions in a step-by-step manner to facilitate the  maturity of an endless stream of new people. This is an urgent  task in army building. Senior cadres should bear the solemn  responsibility for grooming and selecting prominent young  cadres. The cadres we select must be true communists, show a  spirit of dedication to the cause of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, and be able to inherit the heroic  spirit of veteran comrades in following the direction of  revolutionary struggle. We should carry out education in this  respect, impart our experiences, and help and set an example for  new hands so that there will be no lack of successors to our  cause, and so that our party and army's fine tradition will be  passed from generation to generation.    We should administer the army strictly. This is an  important thought consistently emphasized by Comrades Mao Zedong  and Deng Xiaoping. Strict military administration is not only  an important principle governing army building but also an  inevitable path for strengthening all facets of army building.  Only strictness can guarantee discipline, orderliness, unity,  and combat effectiveness. This people's army of ours has always  been known for its close-knit organization and strict  discipline. This is an important cause of our army's strong  rallying power and combat effectiveness. To administer the army  strictly, we should, first and foremost, adopt a strict approach  toward senior cadres. Senior cadres should serve as models in  following commands, in strictly observing discipline, and in  rigorously enforcing rules and regulations. They should  implement the policy decisions, decrees, and directives of the  party Central Committee and CMC to the letter in order to ensure  that government and military decrees will be relayed to relevant  units without obstruction. They should enforce military  discipline strictly, mete out rewards and punishment strictly  and impartially, administer troops rigorously, and earnestly set  standards for troop behavior in accordance with rules and  regulations. They should improve troop education and training  while bearing in mind the need for a high degree of difficulty,  rigorousness, and actual combat. They should strengthen all  aspects of army building at the grass-roots level and earnestly  lay a solid foundation for troops in accordance with the demands  of the "Program for Army Building at the Grass-Roots Level."  They should make unremitting efforts to improve the army's work  style and tighten troop discipline, strengthen regular  ideological and administrative work, devote great efforts to  improving the commanding skills of grass-roots cadres, and  enhance unity between officers and men. They should further  improve "double-support" work [support the army and give  preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary armymen  and martyrs, support the government and cherish the people],  actively launch activities to promote socialist spiritual  civilization through joint army-civilian efforts, and enhance  the army's unity with the government and people. Our army must  maintain a good image in all sectors of society as reflected by  its observance of disciplinary rules and laws, neat appearance,  and strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions. It should  become an awe-inspiring and culturally advanced army which  enjoys the people's love and esteem. Through rigorous training,  strict administration, and in-depth and meticulous ideological  and political work, we should maintain the high degree of  stability and unified centralism in the army; truly achieve  political soundness, military proficiency, a fine work style,  strict discipline, and effective logistics support; and  constantly improve combat effectiveness.    Comrades: At present, the overall situation in our country  is very good as far as reform, opening up, and modernization are  concerned. We are full of confidence. At the same time, we  should be aware that we will face a considerable number of new  contradictions and problems in the course of progress, and we  cannot afford to slacken our efforts in the slightest degree.  We must redouble our efforts to convert the policy decisions of  the party Central Committee and CMC into conscientious actions  by officers and men throughout the army. The party and people  have assigned the important task of commanding troops to our  senior cadres at this historical moment. I believe that you  will surely be able to shoulder this heavy historical  responsibility; strive to make the country strong; keep blazing  new trails and forging ahead; build the people's army under the  party's absolute leadership into an even better one; and  unflinchingly achieve the grand goal set by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping of building a strong, modern, and regular revolutionary  army.</p>

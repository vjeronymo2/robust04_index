			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAITING FOR THE QUAKE;  </P> <P> NEWPORT-INGLEWOOD FAULT;  </P> <P> GEOLOGISTS PLOT A SCENARIO FOR A 7.0 MAGNITUDE QUAKE  </P> <P> This map and the one on the following two pages are from earthquake scenarios  drawn up by the state Division of Mines and Geology. The first, prepared in  1988, shows in general terms what might occur in various areas if there was a  7.0-magnitude quake in the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone in Los Angeles and  Orange counties. The second, drawn up in 1982, examines the possible impact of  an 8.3-magnitude earthquake on the San Andreas Fault near Tejon. The maps are  hypothetical and are not intended to predict that such earthquakes will  actually occur. It is highly unlikely that a big earthquake, when it does come  in Southern California, will conform to either of these specific scenarios.  Even if it did, there would probably be variations from the intensities  portrayed in these maps.  </P> <P> Still, the scenarios are useful for assessing the possible impact of a major  temblor. Authors of the Newport-Inglewood Fault scenario describe their work as  "a possible worst case for emergency planning" and, in discussing their  purpose, remark, "Hopefully, increased awareness of specific damage effects  will stimulate regional planning programs to cope with this eventuality."  </P> <P> In both scenarios, the authors were modest in assessing the reliability of  their maps showing shaking intensities for specific neighborhoods expected from  such temblors. A prominently displayed warning in each scenario booklets  declares: "An earthquake of significantly different magnitude on this or any  one of many other faults in the planning area will result in a markedly  different pattern of damage."  </P> <P> The Newport-Inglewood scenario shows that a 7.0-magnitude earthquake centered  within the Los Angeles-Orange County metropolitan area would be more  destructive than an 8.3-magnitude earthquake centered on the San Andreas 40 or  more miles away. The only areas excepted from the worst impact would be the  Palos Verdes peninsula, the Santa Monica Mountains and portions of the Verdugo  Hills and the San Gabriel Mountains. These areas would experience shaking  levels slightly lower than in flatter areas.  </P> <P> Compared to the San Andreas, much less is known about the intervals between  major earthquakes on the Newport-Inglewood Fault. The lead author of the  Newport-Inglewood earthquake scenario, Tousson R. Toppozada, acknowledges that  scientific convenience, rather than hard information about the likelihood of a  big earthquake, was responsible for choosing that fault for the 1988 scenario.  </P> <P> "We already had a scenario for the San Andreas Fault, and we were looking for a  fault that was more urban," Toppozada said. "The Newport-Inglewood Fault is the  largest in the Los Angeles area. There are others, the Santa  Monica-Hollywood-Raymond Hill fault systems, that are active, and we have no  special knowledge that would bring us to fear an imminent quake on the  Inglewood-Newport. But it has given us a 6 1/4 in the past, and none of the  others have given us a 6 yet."  </P> <P> At least, Toppozada added, the scientists at the Division of Mines and Geology  felt that "this (Newport-Inglewood) scenario would give the sort of impacts  that would occur in the downtown (Los Angeles) area from whichever source a  major earthquake on a local fault would come."  </P> <P> Legend for the Newport-Inglewood, showing four levels of intensity, slightest  first.  </P> <P> Areas in white -- Little or no structural damage to buildings of good design,  considerable damage to poorly built or badly designed buildings. Considerable  fall of plaster and window breakage.  </P> <P> Areas in light gray -- Considerable structural damage in ordinary substantial  brick buildings, partial collapse of wooden houses.  </P> <P> Areas in medium gray -- More serious damage; fall of walls, chimneys,  monuments, also factory stacks and towers.  </P> <P> Areas in dark gray -- Most serious damage; considerable damage even in masonry  structures built especially to withstand quakes. Shift of frame buildings off  foundations. Occasional breakage of underground pipes.  </P> <P> Liquefaction zones:  </P> <P> Soil is subject to liquefaction. Under intense shaking, it becomes like gelatin  or quicksand, often resulting in collapse of structures above or breakage of  underground pipes.  </P> <P> Source: U.S. Geological Survey  </P></p>

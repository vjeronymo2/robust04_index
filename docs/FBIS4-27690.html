			<p>BFN     [Text] The Vietnam Consumers Association has conducted a  poll with 200 households in Hanoi and 400 households in Ho Chi  Minh City on the prospects of goods consumption and on the types  of products that buyers like most. The results indicate that  homemade goods now account for half of the volume of sales on  the local market, imported goods for 12 percent, and American  goods for 10 percent. A breakdown of each type of consumer good  indicates that Japanese-made motorcycles and cars account for 94  percent. Small-sized Japanese-made machinery and equipment also  account for as much as 60 percent. The consumption ratio of  Vietnamese-made foodstuffs is 72 percent and Japanese-made  foodstuffs 8 percent. The consumption ratio of Vietnamese-made  beer and cigarettes accounts for 79 percent. As for  Chinese-made fabrics, children's toys, and generators, they  account for nearly 90 percent of the volume of sales on the  local market.</p>

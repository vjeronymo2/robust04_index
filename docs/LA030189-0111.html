			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Blue Cross of California: The Woodland Hills-based health insurer reported a  1988 loss of $9.1 million, considerbly less than the $56-million loss it  reported a year ago. For the fourth quarter, Blue Cross posted a $15.9-million  profit, compared to $41.9 million in the 1987 period, which included an  extraordinary gain from the sale of a building. Leonard D. Schaeffer, president  and chief executive, hailed the results as a turnaround, which he attributed to  "increasing sales, improving customer service and reducing staffing,  administrative expenses and claims processing time."  </P></p>

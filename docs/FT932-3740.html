			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: BA proposes changes to boardroom election process BRITISH Airways is proposing to change its articles of association to require its senior executives to seek periodic re-election by shareholders. In the past, under previous chairman Lord King, BA's chairman, chief executive and one other executive director did not need to be re-elected. The change, which will be put to shareholders at BA's annual meeting next month, will be seen as another attempt by the company's new management under chairman Sir Colin Marshall to improve the board's accountability. BA has also increased the number and scope of its non-executive directors in a bid to comply with best practice following criticism in the wake of the Virgin 'dirty tricks' allegations. The proposals are revealed in BA's annual report, delivered to shareholders yesterday. The report confirmed the company spent Pounds 3m in legal fees connected to the January settlement of libel litigation with Virgin and Mr Richard Branson. BA said a litigation provision of Pounds 22m, carried forward from previous years, would be retained. The annual report also showed Lord King received no performance bonus last year, and saw his salary and emoluments fall from Pounds 669,350 to Pounds 478,790 in the 11 months before his resignation in February. Sir Colin Marshall received emoluments of Pounds 86,691 in the period February 5 to March 31.</p>

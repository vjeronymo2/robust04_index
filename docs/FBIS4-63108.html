			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Conclusion of Delamuraz' Visit to </F> Moscow"]    [Text] Moscow, 13 May -- The chief of the [Swiss]  Department of Public Economy, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, reported  that, during his talks in Moscow, he encountered a high degree  of realism, determination, and willingness for reform.  Concerning the financial problems of Swiss companies, a  solution is to be achieved before the end of the summer.    Delamuraz continued his talks with the Russian leadership on  Friday [13 May]. As he pointed out during a brief news  conference at the Swiss Embassy, he met with a high degree of  mutual trust, remarkable openness, and particularly clear  concepts. His talks were never characterized by naivete or  uncertainty, Delamuraz stated. He is convinced of the  willingness of the Russian Government to continue the reforms.  The Russian side was aware of the numerous existing problems,  it wants to tackle them, and showed no signs of discouragement.    On Friday Delamuraz held talks with, among others, Deputy  Prime Minister Chubays, who is responsible for privatization,  central bank leader Gerachenko, and Duma chairman Rybkin.  During his meeting with Chubays, Delamuraz was assured that the  work that has been commenced will be completed successfully.  The head of the Department for Public Economy had the  impression that the Russians know that important decisions still  have to be made. Delamuraz inquired about the possibilities and  conditions of foreign participation in the privatization and  stated that Switzerland believes that access for interested  foreign companies should be facilitated.    The head of the economic delegation that accompanied  Delamuraz to Moscow, Andres Leuenberger, stated that he has the  feeling that privatization has now become irreversible.  However, he does not believe that there will be a boom of Swiss  investments in Russia in the near future.    The specific issues that Delamuraz discussed with the  Russian  leadership included unsettled claims by Swiss suppliers and  Yeltsin's decree which canceled a decision by the government  last November and which limited the activities of Western banks  to business with so-called nonresidents. A total of 83 Swiss  companies have reported claims vis-a-vis the former Soviet Union  that are not covered by the export risk guarantee. The  unsettled sums involve a total of approximately 320 million  Swiss franks. However, it can be assumed that the real claims  are even higher because not all Swiss companies have contacted  the Swiss Embassy in Moscow.    According to Delamuraz, progress has been achieved  concerning  a solution to this -- old -- problem. He was assured by the  Russian side that the issue will be tackled before the end of  the year. A decision on the bank decree is expected by June.</p>

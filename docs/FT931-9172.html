			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Asbestos removal 'risky and a waste of money' RIPPING asbestos out of schools and other public buildings is usually a waste of money and can increase the risk to the public, a leading specialist on asbestos-related disease warned yesterday. Professor Julian Peto of the Institute of Cancer Research in London said that asbestos exposure constituted a minor risk to the general public. He said: 'The last 20 years have witnessed an extraordinary shift, from neglect of a major industrial hazard to irrational exaggeration of a negligible environmental pollutant.' Prof Peto's comments will encourage those public health officials who maintain that the best course of action - when asbestos is discovered in a building or public place - is to paint over it and leave well alone. Removing the material can liberate needle-shaped asbestos particles that cause cancer if they get into the lungs. The Health and Safety Executive - the public body responsible for protecting workers from asbestos exposure - welcomed Prof Peto's remarks. 'We agree with him,' said Dr Trevor Ogden of the executive. 'Asbestos materials that are sound, undamaged and not releasing dust should not be disturbed.' About 9,000 cases a year of asbestos removal are notified to the executive ranging in scale from removing lagging from a pipe to dismantling a large factory. The Asbestos Removal Contractors' Association said 200 to 300 companies work actively to remove the material in the UK, although 1,000 are licensed to do so. 'I'm not going to argue with Julian Peto,' said a representative of the contractors' association. 'There's no legislation which would force a building owner to have the asbestos removed.' There is no accurate estimate of total UK spending on asbestos removal, although it probably exceeds Pounds 100m a year. Even a single case - such as stripping the material from Linlithgow Academy near Edinburgh - can cost more than Pounds 5m. Asbestos is responsible for more occupational cancers than any other agent - almost 1,000 deaths from mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the lungs) and more than 2,000 deaths from lung cancer each year in the UK.</p>

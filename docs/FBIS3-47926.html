Sionil] </F>   [Text] The Philippines' foreign debt stock hit $34.1  billion as of end-September 1993, up by more than 10 percent  from $30.9 billion in 1992.    Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) [Central Bank of the  Philippines] Governor Gabriel Singson assured, however, that the  $3.2 billion expansion of government's foreign liabilities  should cause no alarm because of the improvement in the  country's "ability to pay."    The bigger debt stock was caused by the continued  appreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, in  which the bulk of the country's foreign indebtedness is  denominated.    The debt pile-up was also brought about by the additional  availments of loans from multilateral creditors.    "Some critics are quick to point out that the foreign debt  has continued to expand. Indeed, it has grown... but the  country's ability to pay has been more than enhanced," Singson  told members of the Philippine Association of Finance Companies,  Inc.    To prove his point, Singson cited the country's lower debt  service ratio or debt service payments as a proportion of  exports of goods and services as below the 19 percent compared  to a high of more than 20 percent the previous years.    He pointed out this debt service ratio was "well within  internationally accepted norms" as pointed by the World Bank.    In fact, the country's debt service ratio is significantly  "better" than the ratios of Latin American and the neighboring  countries such as Argentina at 35 percent, Brazil at 24 percent,  Indonesia at 32 percent, and Mexico at 44 percent.    Also, in his speech, Singson reiterated plans to bring down  further the level of reserve requirements on bank's deposits and  deposit liabilities.    He pointed out that the "progressive easing of reserve  requirements augured well for the financial market."</p>

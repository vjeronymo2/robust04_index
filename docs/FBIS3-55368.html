			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Energy Minister Algimantas </F> Stasiukynas by Terese Smaroviene; place and date not given: "A  New Dilemma: Liepaja or Butinge?" --first two paragraphs are  TIESA introduction]    [Text] During the meeting of the three Baltic prime  ministers on Friday [17 December] in Vilnius, Lithuanian Prime  Minister A. Slezevicius and his Latvian counterpart V. Birkavs  signed a protocol of intentions on the construction of an oil  terminal and an oil pipeline in Liepaja, and on the delivery of  oil products to the refinery in Mazeikiai, which has already  evoked a reaction. The positive implementation of these  intentions, most probably, does not satisfy the opposition.  This project was criticized on the radio by A. Vaisnoras,  member of the Seimas [parliament] Environmental Protection  Committee.    TIESA's correspondent Terese Smaroviene has spoken with  Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas about a new turn in the  story of the oil terminal.    [Smaroviene] Mister Minister, will we really discard the  Butinge option if we reach an agreement with the Latvians on the  construction of a joint oil terminal at the former military port  of Liepaja?    [Stasiukynas] This will probably be the case. If we reach a  final agreement on the construction of the terminal in Liepaja,  it would be unwise to build an identical object in Butinge. We  do not need two terminals.    [Smaroviene] When will the community be able to learn which  option has been chosen?    [Stasiukynas] By 15 January of next year. The protocol of  intentions states that Lithuania and Latvia agree to consider  the issue of the construction of a joint export-import  enterprise. The responsible executor of the project in  Lithuania is the Energy Ministry, and its responsible manager --  B. Vainora, deputy energy minister and managing director of the  "Nafta" refinery in Mazeikiai.    In Latvia, this project will be reviewed by its Energy  Ministry and the government. The latter will have to assign to  the joint enterprise port facilities situated in the area of the  Liepaja port, and the land necessary for the construction of the  terminal and the pipeline to Mazeikiai. As I have mentioned,  everything must be coordinated by 15 January. If the  preliminary documents are not ready, or if we fail to reach an  agreement by that date, the work in Butinge will continue.    [Smaroviene] Suppose, we choose the Liepaja option -- the  conditions satisfy Lithuania, and the guarantees are firm. How  will the stock holding be divided?    [Stasiukynas] This issue is included in the protocol of  intentions. Lithuania would have a 51-percent share, while  Latvia would have 49 percent.    [Smaroviene] Which option -- Butinge or Liepaja -- is  cheaper?    [Stasiukynas] Undoubtedly, the construction of the terminal  in Liepaja is less expensive for us. It would cost $50 million  less than the Butinge terminal, because we would not have to  build facilities in the sea -- they already exist. Thus, the  terminal itself would be installed much faster. We must build a  floating platform nine kilometers off the coast in Butinge,  while in Liepaja everything is ready. The only thing that  remains there is to clean the port area that has been neglected  for many years. That would cost about $1 million.    [Smaroviene] How would you comment on current talks that a  terminal in Liepaja will allegedly tie us to Russia?    [Stasiukynas] Liepaja is at the Baltic Sea rather than on  the  border with Russia. Tankers can sail to the port from any  country. By the way, Latvia's proposal is assessed quite  differently abroad. Recently, I met with the representatives of  the EC and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  in London, who think that the bank's financing for this  Lithuanian-Latvian project is guaranteed. In their opinion,  this will be the first European object in the Baltic states.    [Smaroviene] In your opinion, why did the Latvians propose  the Liepaja port as the site for the terminal so unexpectedly?  Why were there no such proposals before the beginning of the  work in Butinge?    [Stasiukynas] Our neighbors must have thought that we would  not build this terminal. There probably would not have been any  proposal, if the competition for the Butinge project had not  begun. When it became clear that Lithuania is determined to have  its own oil terminal, the Latvians proposed their option which  we are considering very cautiously and thoroughly.    [Smaroviene] We, the Lithuanians, do not seem very serious.  At one time, we discuss the issue of Ventspils, while later we  become tempted by our neighbors' new proposal, despite having  begun a project of our own facility....    [Stasiukynas] Ventspils is a past stage that had many  negative points, while Liepaja is a new and clean port. Why  should we not take advantage of it if this is beneficial?    [Smaroviene] You have mentioned the guarantees that the  Latvian Government is granting to our state in the construction  of the oil terminal and the maintenance of the Liepaja port.    [Stasiukynas] The construction of such an important joint  venture requires the guarantees that the tax system and other  conditions will not change. A country in which that enterprise  is located can invent various obstacles. However, these issues  are solvable. There is an international legal practice. The  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has pledged to  send its consultants who will draft such an international  agreement.    [Smaroviene] Thank you for the interview. We will be looking  forward to 15 January 1994.</p>

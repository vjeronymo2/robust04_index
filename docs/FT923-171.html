			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Three bankers brought into Thai cabinet A GENERAL and three bankers who did not stand in this month's Thai general election have been included in the country's new cabinet, formed yesterday after more than two weeks of negotiation in the five-party coalition. General Vichit Sukmak will have to quit the army in order to take up his cabinet post as defence minister. He is seen as a protege of General Prem Tinsulanonda, the former prime minister who played a key role behind the scenes in reducing the power of the group of commanders who staged last year's coup and attracted mass protests this year. Of the three bankers Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, president of Siam Commercial Bank, becomes finance minister. Mr Amnuay Viravan, chairman of the elected board of Bangkok Bank, the country's largest, becomes deputy prime minister, as does Mr Supachai Panitchpakdi, president of the Thai Military Bank. Together, they signal the government's commitment to cautious fiscal and monetary policy. This has been seen as the foundation of Thailand's economic stability and as helping to maintain one of the fastest growth rates in the world despite periodic political problems and corruption. Some commentators suggested that the appointment of the three could lead to a clash of superstars who do not always agree about how the economy should be handled. But Mr Chuan Leekphai, the new prime minister, yesterday said it would be healthy for ministers to have differing views so that they could counter-check each other. Mr Chuan held out against a controversial bid by his Democrat party's secretary general, Major General Sanan Kachornprasart, to be appointed defence minister. Maj Gen Sanan, who left the army after a failed coup attempt in 1977, and the current military commanders are said not to be on good terms. Mr Sanan will not now enjoy the promotion to full general that is normally granted to defence ministers. He has been given the industry portfolio. Trouble also threatened when General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, former army chief and now leader of the New Aspiration party, sought to strengthen his own clout by proposing a fourth non-elected economist to the cabinet. This would have deprived one of his MPs of a cabinet seat, and he had to back down. The leader of the third largest party of the coalition, Major General Chamlong Srimuang, declined a cabinet seat although other members of his party are included. Mr Chamlong, a former governor of Bangkok, led the anti-military protest in May, at one stage going on hunger strike. His more radical approach caused a rift between his party and the Democrats, which is said to have contributed to his decision not to join the cabinet.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with B.J. Habibie, Indonesian state minister for </F> research and technology, by BUSINESS TIMES correspondent Yang  Razali Kassim in Jakarta; -- date not given]    [Text] BT [BUSINESS TIMES]: Your close relationship  with President Suharto is no secret. Has he ever discussed with  you privately the future of the Indonesian leadership and the  question of succession?    DR HABIBIE: No. Because President Suharto has  always said that he doesn't want to groom a putra mahkota (crown  prince). He knows exactly the mechanism and the rules of the  game of Pancasila democracy.    He always says it is the privilege of the People's  Consultative Assembly (MPR) to first decide and discuss, to  express the vision of the nation and, based on that, elect one  of the people of the Republic of Indonesia who can meet the  requirements to be given the mandate to implement the vision of  the nation.    Q: There is a view that it is critical for Indonesia,  during this transition, to settle the question of succession.  Pak Harto [Mr. Suharto], having served very long and having  done what is perceived as a good job, needs to have clear  successor to sustain the good work.    A: You are right that Pak Harto is very, very  credible, based on the fact that he has been always at the  forefront for the last 27 years -- 32 years, if he finishes his  present term as President and Mandatory. Based on his  performance, theoretically and practically, he is the most  credible man. In the interest of the nation, we have to listen  to his opinion because he is a national as well as an  international leader.    Now, because of that, if you ask me who will decide the  successor to Mr Suharto, the answer is clear: the elected  representatives of the people of the Republic of Indonesia who  sit in the People's Consultative Assembly in 1998. They have to  do the job.    Q: In the event that Pak Harto decides to retire  halfway through his term, what do you think will happen to the  presidency?    A: Knowing Pak Harto, and having assisted him the  last 20 years, knowing his performance and his character, and  his leadership, I know he will never stop something before his  term ends. Never.    Pak Harto is a pejuang, a fighter. He has said: "I'm born  and I grow up as a fighter. My mentality is this: as long as  the people, my beloved people of the Republic of Indonesia ask  me to do a job. in what condition ever I will be, I will accept  the instruction and the will of the people to implement the job,  in whatever condition." So that's why there is no reason for him  to stop halfway, unless it is the will of Allah.    Q: And what if Allah wills that the President stop  during his term?    A: Then, according to the Undang-Undang Dasar  (Constitution), the Vice-President will take over. I'm sure the  whole Cabinet and the whole armed forces and all the political  parties will take care that this nation will keep its unity and  keep the nation going, until the election comes.    Q: There is an impression that you are being prepared  to be a future president. What is your reaction to this?    A: The first question is: prepared by whom?    Q: By President Suharto?/    A: No, Pak Harto is one vote. You should  understand the mechanism of our democracy. I give that comment  not as a politician but as a man who has survived among the  politicians and because I am trying to understand the truth  about politics. I have become a philosopher (laughter), because  I am older now.    Q: Are you ready to be the next Mandatory  (President)?    A: Me? That question may be put equally to  anybody. Are you ready? Anybody must be ready. But the  question is: what will be the result of the musyawarah mufakat  (consultation and consensus) of the People's Consultative  Assembly then? Because they are the only ones who have been  elected by the people to talk, to elect on behalf of the people,  a man to become the Mandatory of this nation. I don't know.  But this question is for anybody in the Republic.    Q: Whose advice do you listen to most?    A: I receive much advice but I have to decide for  myself. I was already warned by Mr Suharto in 1974. He told  me: "You should be aware that one day you will know so many  people, but you are alone." He warned me: "You have to watch."  At that time, I did not understand.    I believe that if you are the leader of a nation, you must  be  the leader also of those people who don't like you. If you are  a leader only for the people who like you, then you are only a  leader among friends. Now I understand Suharto.    Before the election for the Vice-Presidency in 1993, I was  interviewed by TEMPO magazine. I told TEMPO that my master was  Professor Suharto. Because I learned from him. After that I  met President Suharto and said: "I apologise for calling you my  professor, my teacher, my guru."    Pak Harto told me: "I am not your guru. I, Suharto, am the  helper of your guru. Your guru is your own mind." Then he told  me: "According to Javanese philosophy, knowing you because I  have been watching you, your bathin (spirit) is very strong." I  think not. But he told me so.  Q: If you were given the chance to be President, would  you continue the economic reform policies that have made  Indonesia successful in turning around the once-battered economy  to become what it is now?    A: The answer is that anybody who will be elected  later to become the successor has to continue the policy of  national development growth. Anybody. The elected  representatives of the People's Assembly will take care -- must  take care -- that the national development growth is sustained.  It's the only way to bring the nation to the same level as the  advanced economies.    Q: So if it were you, you would continue the economic  reforms?    A: Not (just) me, I say anybody. I don't want to  be the reference point. Anybody must do that. And the whole  system in Indonesia is built around it.    Q: Why do we continue to hear domestic criticism of  the aerospace industry and of your approach to economic  development, or what is called "Habibienomics"?    A: Such criticism comes from people who have  mixed feelings and political interests. I give you an example.  Our CN235 [aircraft] hit a mountain two years ago. At that  time, there was a lot of speculation that I was to be the next  vice-president. As it happened, it went on for almost three  months -- people were criticising me daily. Daily. Saying bad  things and so on.    But later, when the black box came out, everything proved  that I was right. I told them that it was human error. There  was even an article from a lady, a professor in Bandung, who  wrote an analysis that Habibie was a man against human rights,  the rights of women. Terrible. All so emotional. Everybody.    And now, what happened? Look at the Superpuma [helicopter]  accident in Malaysia. Look, at the reactions of the Malaysian  Defence Minister, the air force commander, the prime minister  and the mass media -- all very fair. They did not criticise as  the Indonesians did. You know why? Because the Malaysians were  more objective and were not politically involved.    All those reactions here (in Indonesia) were politically  engineered to portray the bad idea that maybe Habibie was  ambitious and wanted to become vice-president and so on. There  were a lot of people who don't like that scenario.    Q: Political engineering?    A: I think so. In this case, political  engineering -- making use of the fact that our society is  heterogeneous. By the way, the majority of the people in the  Republic of Indonesia, 99 per cent, are really not involved in  political engineering for self (-serving) purposes. Why do I  say so? Because daily, I get a lot of compliments from people.    Q: What does President Suharto say about these  criticisms against you?    A: You know what he told me? He told me: "Don't  listen to them. If you listen to crazy people and you get  crazy, it's your own mistake." You can quote this. "You just  do what you think is the best for your people, for your country.  Then you can face God because you have done it to the best of  your ability." That's the advice from President Suharto.    Q: What is "Habibienomics"?    A: There is no Habibienomics, there's no  Wijoyonomics (after Professor Wijoyo Nitisastro, who played a  major part in early Indonesian pro-market economic policy). But  if there is such a thing as Habibienomics, it is because there  was Wijoyonomics.    In the first 25 years, we were not in a position yet to take  care of human resource development. So, what I'm doing now is  only possible because my colleague, Pak Wijoyo, has done it (his  job of laying the basis for economic growth). And don't forget  that Pak Wijoyo was active in the Cabinet in the first three  five-year plans -- Repelita 1, 2 and 3. Okay? And Habibie has  been active in the Cabinet since the second Repelita till now --  2, 3, 4, 5, 6.    So that means whatever he has done. I was a part of the  team. I was already doing it. There's only one difference: I  am 10 years, maybe 12 years, younger. So nobody can say:  "Habibie has done nothing in the 25 years." I was active. I  was responsible for what has been done.    I was lucky. I was then 37. So now, at 57, I have the  experience of four Repelitas. So, it is wrong to say that  Habibie was excluded, not involved in the decisionmaking of the  last 25 years. It's not true that only Prof Wijoyo was involved.    Q: Why then is Habibienomics made an issue by your  critics?    A: Political engineering -- to create political  issues; sensationalism, misinformation, distortion of  information, whatever. But I see no problem. If there is a  "nomics", then I would say it's a Suhartonomics, or  "Mandatory-nomics". Because he is the one who started it --  from Repelita 1 to now, Repelita 6. What I'm doing today is a  part of the evolution of national development of Indonesia.    Q: Some outside Indonesia, including in Singapore,  wonder whether you are a nationalist and therefore more  protectionist, not supportive of economic reforms?    A: Oh yes, I will find that not only in  Singapore, but here in Indonesia too (laughter). Because they  want me to open up everything so that everybody can sell and  kill my airplane manufacture. I said no.</p>

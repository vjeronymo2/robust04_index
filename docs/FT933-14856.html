			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Alcoa drops 21% as aluminium prices decline ALUMINUM Company of America, the world's biggest aluminium producer, has reported a 21 per cent drop in second-quarter net income before special charges. The figures come against a backdrop of high world aluminium stocks and low prices, due to a a large increase of imports to the West from the former Soviet Union. At the end of last month, Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of Alcoa, announced that the company was cutting its annual primary production in the US by almost 25 per cent, and laying off 750 people. The second-quarter figures, released on Friday, showed earnings of Dollars 44.7m, or 51 cents a share, before Dollars 9.4m of net unfavourable adjustments. Sales and operating revenues were little changed at Dollars 2.4bn. The adjustments included a special charge of Dollars 23.8m after tax for job cuts; a charge of Dollars 11.9m for a new three-year labour agreement; and a Dollars 26.3m Australian tax credit. In the second quarter of last year the company reported earnings of Dollars 56.5m, or 65 cents a share, be-fore charges of Dollars 104.7m. The company said prices on most products had declined from the same quarter of last year. Revenues were level, in spite of a 5 per cent decline in aluminium shipments, because of increased sales in non-aluminium products. For the first six months of the year Alcoa reported net income of Dollars 72.3m, or 82 cents a share, before adjustments, compared to Dollars 111.6m, or Dollars 1.29 a share, on the same basis in 1992.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Losses extended towards the close of dealing - Market report What had begun as a gloomy session in the UK stock market turned distinctly more sinister yesterday afternoon when markets across Europe reacted strongly to US data suggesting accelerated economic recovery. A Pounds 250m sell programme from a leading US investment bank fell on a market where trading books have been mostly squared off ahead of tonight's close to trading for the third quarter of the year. Marketmaking firms, which were still tidying up after selling programmes earlier in the week, hastily cut share quotations yesterday afternoon but were believed to have suffered heavy losses none the less. The FT-SE 100 Index was around 24 points down in mid-afternoon and quickly plunged through the 3,000 mark as Wall Street reacted to news of a revised gain of 4.1 per cent in US second-quarter GDP and a 9.7 per cent leap in August new home sales. The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a fall of 22 points in UK trading hours and weakness in Federal bonds fuelled worries over prospects for rate tightening in the US. At the close, the FT-SE 100-share Index was 46.2 off at 2,992.5, having steadied after touching 2,991.6. With only one more trading day left, the Footsie index is showing a small loss over the 1994 third quarter. Brokerage sources believe that some fund managers are improving the appearance of portfolios by selling equities this week, even though returns on cash are not attractive. The stock market was under pressure from the opening as it faced weakness from other European bourses and a batch of developments in the domestic utility sector. British Gas weakened after the much-heralded early morning meeting with institutional investors in the City of London failed to inspire support. Confirmation of the UK government's intentions to sell its 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen helped the sector, since the investment funds will hasten to increase weightings; but the prospect of a further, and substantial, cash drain was not helpful for the equity market as a whole. The sudden renewal of the bear rush badly caught out marketmakers who had bought stock during the upswing of the previous session. Yesterday's sell programme was believed to have been taken aboard by the US bank on Wednesday when the Footsie was some 40 points higher than at last night's close. Weakness across the range of equities was also reflected in a fall of 29.8 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which closed at 3,504. But overall, trading volume was not high. The day's Seaq total of 586.5m shares compared with 577.5m in the previous session. Retail business was worth Pounds 1.57bn on Wednesday, a hopeful return to the higher end of this year's daily averages and therefore a sign of a healthier market. Strategists sounded unsure of the significance of the renewed shakeout in equities. On the one hand, it is clear technical factors surrounding the end of the quarter were affecting markets yesterday; but on the other, some analysts expressed concern over the strong data on the US economy. These statistics revived fears that the Federal Reserve may feel forced to act on US interest rates, and this tended to counter-balance yesterday's decision by the Bundesbank to leave key rates unchanged. The UK is regarded as the European market most likely to be immediately affected if US rates rise. Next week brings a full calendar of US economic statistics, including construction spending and factory orders and - most importantly - the latest payroll and unemployment figures. Arriving in the wake of yesterday's strong GDP and housing numbers, these statistics are likely to unsettle equity and bond markets.</p>

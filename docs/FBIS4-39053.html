			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1700 GMT on 4 June 1994 broadcasts  the "Novosti" newscast with correspondent Sergey Medvedev  introducing an interview recorded today with Russian Deputy  Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray. Medvedev questions Shakhray on  Moscow's relations with the regions, particularly Tatarstan and  Chechnya.    Commenting on the significance of Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Tatarstan earlier this week, Shakhray says: "The Russian  president's visit to Tatarstan was not only to solve economic  problems but also to check the way in which the treaty on the  delimitation of competences and authorities was being  implemented. In essence it was a demonstration of the fact that  the method developed for tackling regional conflicts has  importance outside Russia as well, because this visit took place  against the background of the crisis between Kiev and  Simferopol, the Crimean problem."    He continues: "I personally believe that taking account of  Ukraine's specific features, of the fact that it is a unitary  state, the method that was used to tackle that regional crisis  is suitable for the Ukrainian situation. It is suitable for the  Dniester Republic, and for Karabakh, but it is most clearly  suitable for tackling the Crimean problem.    "Three years ago, relations between Moscow and Kazan were  almost identical to those that have developed between Kiev and  Simferopol. There were shows of force; there were decisions by  the Supreme Soviets annulling each other's resolutions; there  was a decision by the Constitutional Court; and there was a  referendum. We had enough self-possession and commonsense to  avoid a scenario involving force, and to find a proper and  civilized scheme for solving the problem. One was found, taking  account of reciprocal interests, involving compromise, talks,  and the delimitation of authorities."    Asked about relations between Moscow and Chechnya, Shakhray  says that politicians both in Russia and in Chechnya are now  looking for a way out of difficult economic situations: "I  would say there are two points that one ought to concentrate on.  They are the coordinated fight against crime and the tackling  of economic problems. This is the way toward a general easing  of the situation and toward a draft treaty on the division of  competences and powers."    Medvedev then asks Shakhray whether Ruslan Khasbulatov could  come back to Russian politics as a deputy from Chechnya.  Shakhray says that at the moment there is a conflict between  Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev and Ruslan Khasbulatov.  Shakhray continues: "I have to think of a situation whereby  Khasbulatov and Dudayev reach agreement between themselves. In  essence, they can agree that Dudayev concludes an economic  agreement or a treaty with Russia and holds elections to the  Federation Council. If Khasbulatov stands as a candidate for  these elections -- although he might discard politics altogether  -- but if he stands as a candidate one might suppose that he can  be elected during the elections. Then the republic will remain  under Dudayev's leadership. Khasbulatov will then move from the  republic to the Federation Council. This is not science  fiction, this is a political combination, a political option  that politicians both in Groznyy and in Moscow have to think  about."</p>

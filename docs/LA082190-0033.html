			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> LAWYER ADMITS EVIDENCE LINKS CLIENT TO KILLING  </P> <P> In an unusual legal maneuver designed to protect his client from the death  penalty, a defense attorney conceded Monday that evidence implicates the  defendant in the slaying of an 8-year-old Northridge boy.  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Duane Dammeyer has asked Ventura County Superior Court  Judge Steven Perren to exclude Gregory Scott Smith from the death penalty in  the killing of Paul Bailly, whose bound and burned body was found in a field  near Simi Valley on March 23.  </P> <P> According to California law, the death penalty applies only when a murder takes  place in the course of a separate felony.  </P> <P> Dammeyer filed a motion Aug. 6 to have the death penalty provision removed from  the criminal complaint upon which Smith's trial is to be based. He argued that  evidence from a June 4 preliminary hearing shows that Smith abducted Paul with  the intent to kill him, thereby making the crime a single felony.  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris filed a reply Aug. 17, saying that the  kidnaping and the slaying were separate acts. It argues that Smith kidnaped the  boy to punish him for complaining to school officials. The school had fired  Smith from his job as a day-care aide in the latchkey program partly because  Paul complained that Smith was picking on him, authorities said.  </P> <P> Smith then killed Paul to get revenge against Darby Avenue School, according to  Kossoris' brief.  </P> <P> Dammeyer is scheduled to argue the motion before Perren on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Paul Bailly disappeared March 23 after his mother dropped him off at the  day-care program at Darby Avenue School in Canoga Park. Paul's body was found  several hours later in a field in the Santa Susana Knolls area in Simi Valley.  Prosecutors have alleged that Smith abducted Paul, gagged him with duct tape  and strangled him, then set fire to his body.  </P> <P> "There's no evidence of an intent to kidnap, separate and apart from the intent  to kill," Dammeyer said. "The law requires a separate intent to kidnap, an  independent purpose apart from just taking a person to a secluded area to kill  them."  </P> <P> Admitting that the evidence implicates Smith will not prevent his attorneys  from trying to convince a jury that he is innocent, prosecutors predicted.  Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said that Dammeyer's motion creates  "rather unusual circumstances," forcing Smith's attorneys to admit that  evidence points to their client. But McGee said the jury will be unaware of the  argument over the death penalty.  </P></p>

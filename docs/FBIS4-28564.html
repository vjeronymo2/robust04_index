			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  reconfirmed Friday that Japan, the U.S. and South Korea should  maintain close contact in tackling the crisis over North Korea's  alleged nuclear program, Foreign Ministry officials said.    U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter  Tarnoff, in separate meetings with Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa and Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda, also shared  the view with Japan that China's role is important in solving  the problem, according to the officials.    During a 15-minute meeting, Tarnoff and Kakizawa agreed on  the need to seek China's agreement to solve the issue  diplomatically, they said.    In a subsequent meeting, Tarnoff and Fukuda agreed to  continue to work toward a peaceful solution while seeking  international coordination.    They reaffirmed an accord reached among Tokyo, Seoul and  Washington last weekend that the U.N. Security Council should  "urgently" consider action against North Korea for its refusal  to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  they said.    Tarnoff told Fukuda that the visit to North Korea by former  U.S. President Jimmy Carter is in response to an invitation by  Pyongyang and that he will be making the trip as a private  citizen.    He did not say whether the U.S. Government is asking Carter  to deliver a message to Pyongyang, they said.    Tarnoff arrived in Japan on Thursday for talks with Japanese  officials on political and security matters. He is to leave  Tokyo for Seoul on Friday evening.    In the nearly two-hours of talks followed by a luncheon  meeting, Tarnoff and Fukuda discussed a wide range of  international topics, including Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, China  and Haiti, the officials said.    While pointing out that it is too early to predict  Washington's future relations with China after extending the  most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status, Tarnoff said the U.S.  wants to promote ties with China.    He voiced U.S. support for Japan's stance in seeking  normalization of ties with Russia based on the Tokyo declaration  adopted when Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited Japan last  October, they said.    Turning to Vietnam, Fukuda welcomed the improvement of ties  between Washington and Hanoi.</p>

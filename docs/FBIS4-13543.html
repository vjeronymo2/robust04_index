			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattibuted commentary] </F>   [Text] According to dispatches, the Muslim populated city  of Gorazde located in East Bosnia has been completely overrun by  the Serbs. Gorazde, which, along with the cities of Sarajevo,  Maglaj, Srebrenica, Bihac and Zepa, was declared by the UN  Security Council as a safe area in 1992, has come under the  aggressor Serbs' occupation. This tragedy has occurred at a  time when the world community had earlier repeatedly expressed  its anger and indignation over the continuing crimes of the Serb  militiamen against the Muslim populated city's women and  children.    Gorazde has fallen because international community lacked  the  necessary will for severely dealing with the Serbs. This lack  of firm will on the part of the world community against the  Serbs has so emboldened them in perpetuating their crimes that  even their supporters were compelled, under the pressure of the  world public opinion, to adopt a propaganda gesture against the  Serbs. In this gesture the supporters sounded a warning to the  Serbs not to take advantage being shown by the international  community. The Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, has warned the  Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde. The warning comes at a time  when the United Nations, yesterday, made an official  announcement on occupation of Gorazde by the Serb militiamen.  The Russian president has made these comments under the  conditions when his country, as the Serbs' historic ally, has  not spared any help to Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs in the  course of the civil war for fighting against the Muslims. The  tone of the Russian president is such that the Serbs themselves  know better than anyone else about the unreal nature such  utterances. This is because in the absence of the Serbs'  confidence about Russian backing, the aggressors would not have  pursued their crimes.    Another point observable in this political game played in  Gorazde relates to the West's connivance in the face of the  Serbs' crimes and its consent to the fall of the city.    Now the world community is faced with this question as to  why  the NATO did not adopt, in case of Gorazde, the same attitude  which it had followed against the Serbs in pulling their heavy  weapons away from the vicinity of Sarajevo last February. The  NATO warning to the Serbs was so serious that they not only  pulled back their heavy weapons from Sarajevo but also signed an  agreement with the Muslims last March to allow freedom of  movement in that city.    Political observers have analyzed the fall of Gorazde and  lack of a serious reaction to it by the West and NATO in this  manner. Occupation of the Muslim populated city of Gorazde,  which is located in eastern Bosnia along the frontier with  Serbia, will give the Bosnian Serbs the chance to have control  over East Bosnia and eventually to merge with Serbia. In other  words, the West, by consenting to the collapse of Gorazde, is  trying to somehow resolve the Bosnian problem.</p>

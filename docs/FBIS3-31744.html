			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dan Andronic item: "Virgil Magureanu Replaces the SRI </F> Heads in Valcea, Braila, and Galati"]    [Text] Virgil Magureanu, director of the Romanian  Intelligence Service [SRI], visited the counties of Dolj and  Gorj a few days ago to replace the chiefs of the SRI in those  counties. The tour is continuing.    Virgil Magureanu yesterday replaced the SRI director in  Valcea, the official reason being the inefficient use of state  funds. Sources close to the SRI leadership have informed us that  in the coming days Virgil Magureanu will visit the counties of  Braila and Galati for the same purpose: to replace the chiefs  of the SRI in these two counties.    It is worth mentioning that the five chiefs of SRI branches  are joined by a further two such chiefs, who were replaced in  the counties of Neamt and Vaslui a few weeks ago.</p>

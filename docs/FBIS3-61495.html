The model included functions  describing the distribution of assimilated substances in the  plant organs and the consumption rates of these substances due  to respiration. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were  limiting factors in the model. Six climate-change scenarios were  tested: global warmings and coolings of 1 and 2.5 degrees  Celsius combined with no change, a 5 percent decrease, or a 10  percent decrease in precipitation. Results were obtained for 18  economic regions of the former USSR based on the average  conditions in each. Warming by 1 degree substantially improved  yields in the Northwest and Eastern Siberian economic regions,  the Baltic countries, and Belarus, while cooling by 1 degree  decreased yields everywhere except Central Asia and Kazakhstan.  All the climate-change scenarios reduced yields in the  Volga-Vyatsk, Volga, North Caucasus, and Western Siberia  economic regions of Russia and in Moldova, Ukraine, and the  Transcaucasus. Temperature changes of plus or minus 2.5 degrees  combined with decreased precipitation made practically all areas  of the former USSR unsuitable for grain production.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Naha, Jan. 7 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) will help enact political reform bills  during the current extraordinary Diet session which is to close  on January 29, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said Friday [7  January].    Mori, speaking at a lecture session in Naha, Okinawa  Prefecture, said, "The party wants to finalize deliberations in  the current Diet session after the government-proposed bills are  revised to bring them nearer to the LDP-proposed ones."    He said the LDP will start compiling its own compromise plan  on the bills early next week.    He cited three major modifications to be made to the  government bills -- changes to the ratio of House of  Representatives seats to be determined by direct and  proportional election, to the controls on political funding of  individual politicians, and to the electoral district basis for  the proportional representation.    The government and the ruling coalition parties have sought  274 single-seat districts and 226 seats chosen by proportional  representation.    The LDP wanted a combination of 300 single-seat  constituencies and 171 proportional representation. It also  favored seats votes in the proportional representation counted  on a prefectural basis.    Buth the LDP-sponsored political reform bills were voted  down  in the House of Representatives in November.    The ruling coalition has vowed to complete debate on  political reform in the House of Councillors special committee  by January 14 even if the LDP boycotts the session.    The government reform package cleared the lower house in  mid-November but deliberations in the upper house stalled for  over a month through late December due partly to the LDP's  refusal to attend reform panel sessions.</p>

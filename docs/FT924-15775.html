			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Foster's price hits the lees SHARES in Foster's Brewing Group fell 12 cents to a seven-year low of ADollars 1.16 in Sydney yesterday, just 6 cents above the striking price for the group's ADollars 1bn (Dollars 713.2m) rights issue. Foster's Brewing rights, which allow purchasers to buy one Foster's share at ADollars 1.10, closed at 7.5 cents each after the first day of trading, compared with a forecast range of between 10 and 12 cents. Brokers said the market was nervous about the success of the issue because of the failure last week of a fully-underwritten ADollars 1.2bn rights issue by Westpac Banking Corporation, which was 72 per cent undersubscribed. The weakness of the market was underlined on Wednesday when Industrial Equity (IEL), part of the Adsteam group, said it had called off a proposed ADollars 2bn flotation of its Woolworths retailing subsidiary. Foster's is guaranteed a return of ADollars 1bn from its rights issue, which is fully underwritten by Potter Warburg, the Australian investment bank, and supported by Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP), Foster's main shareholder. However, a substantial shortfall in subscriptions could make it more difficult for other companies to find underwriting support for future capital raisings. Foster's, the world's fourth-largest brewing group, announced the issue two weeks ago when it revealed a net loss of ADollars 950m for the 12 months to the end of June. The issue is designed to repair the group's balance sheet after hefty write-offs against property, rural and financial assets, including a ADollars 1.3bn write-off in 1991-92. BHP recently took a 32 per cent shareholding in Foster's by buying most of the stock held by International Brewing Holdings, a private company controlled by Mr John Elliott, a former chairman and chief executive of Foster's.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Airline merger hopes dashed by rift over US link: European carriers call off talks on alliance One of the most ambitious European mergers ever attempted collapsed yesterday after KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines failed to agree on a common US airline partner. The four medium-sized carriers said in a joint statement that they had decided to abandon their seven months' negotiations because of 'fundamentally different views' on a US partnership. Swissair blamed KLM for the collapse of the proposed Alcazar alliance, which had been intended to create a fourth airline force in Europe to compete against the big three carriers: British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France. The collapse of the Alcazar project is likely to hasten the consolidation of the European industry around the strongest groups, such as BA and Lufthansa, which have already set up global alliances. Mr Otto Loepfe, Swissair's chief executive, said the three other partners had favoured Delta Air Lines, in which Swissair holds a 5 per cent cross-equity stake, but KLM ultimately decided to stand by Northwest Airlines, in which it holds a 20 per cent stake. Mr Loepfe said the four airlines had started negotiations with the assumption Delta would be the US partner. But KLM said that although it wanted to agree a deal, it had concluded that the merger should go ahead only if Northwest and not Delta was chosen. The negotiations were described by financial advisers as the most ambitious attempt to date to form a European cross-border merger, since it involved six listed companies and six governments (including the three Scandinavian companies and governments involved in SAS). Although the four airlines managed to reach broad agreement on several complex issues - including the valuation of the proposed joint airline's assets, the location of its headquarters and joint management structure - the talks remained blocked on the US partnership issue. Failure of the talks has now left the four airlines with the dilemma of how to secure their longer-term future in the increasingly competitive and rapidly consolidating airline industry. All four sought to put on a brave face yesterday. KLM, which failed in earlier partnership attempts with Sabena of Belgium and BA, said it had no plans for the moment to resume merger talks with BA or to seek a separate deal with SAS. SAS said it had not dropped the idea of an alliance with one or more European airlines, but Mr Tage Andersen, the Danish chairman of the SAS board, said the airline would stand alone for a period to consider its options: 'This is not a catastrophe.' Swissair also said it would seek other alliances. Mr Hennes Goetz, the airline's chairman, recently said if Alcazar flopped, the only option left for Swissair would be to join forces with Lufthansa, Air France or BA. Austrian Airlines, the smallest of the four, said it would be considering co-operation with Swissair and Lufthansa, which said this year that it was interested in establishing closer ties.

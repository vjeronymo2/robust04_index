			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 11 Feb (AFP) -- Friday night, violent  incidents occurred near the U.S. Interests Section in Havana  when an undetermined number of persons tried to enter the office  but Cuban policemen prevented them from doing so. Apparently  nobody was injured, according to eyewitnesses.    The incidents involved several hundred people and some 10  people were arrested. Shortly before midnight, the situation in  the area was calm.    A large number of people, dressed in civilian clothes and  wielding nightsticks, presumably members of the so-called "rapid  response brigades," a semi-official action group, could be seen  in the area.    At the time, there were no diplomatic officials at the U.S.  Interests Section and the "Marines" were making regular patrols  of the place.    The incidents that arose at the end of the afternoon had  been  preceded by minor episodes of violence early Friday morning when  the Cuban police closed a street adjacent to the U.S. diplomatic  office to traffic because of the unusually large number of  people present there.    The situation around the building throughout Friday,  however,  appeared to be normal. Apparently the incidents were started by  a false rumor that quickly spread throughout Havana that the  U.S. Interests Section, acting out of character, would give an  immigrant visa to all Cuban citizens who requested it.    A spokesman for the U.S. diplomatic office told AFP that the  rumor was "absolutely false," and assumed this was part of a  "provocation" resulting from a "hostile offensive." The  spokesman said that no Cuban citizen had been able to enter the  diplomatic building.</p>

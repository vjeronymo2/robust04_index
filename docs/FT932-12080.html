			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Buckingham Palace to open doors to paying visitors BUCKINGHAM Palace is to be opened to the public for the first time this summer, prompted by royal glasnost and financial prudence. Fees paid by visitors will help to pay for the restoration of Windsor Castle after the fire last November. The palace will open from the second week of August for about two months, with an adult entrance fee of Pounds 8, Pounds 5.50 for people over 60 and Pounds 4 for those under 17. Over the next five years, the revenues, plus a new Pounds 3 entrance charge for Windsor, will pay for 70 per cent of the estimated Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m repair bill for fire damage at Windsor, Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, said yesterday. The rest will be paid by the state. Visitors to Buckingham Palace will be able to see 17 state rooms, gardens and the west elevation. They will not be allowed into the private quarters of the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh or Prince Edward, or into working offices. The palace would not speculate on how many visitors it expected. Some 40,000 people already visit the palace each year by personal invitation of the Queen. But if the final bill for the restoration of Windsor totals Pounds 40m, the equivalent of 3.5m adult visitors will be required to cover the monarchy's 70 per cent share. The public opening of the palace - first built in 1677 - will be a short-lived affair. The gates will probably be closed again by the end of 1997, when the restoration of Windsor should be complete. A palace spokesman said the entrance fees were arrived at after considering charges at 'similar types of attraction'. Two of the Queen's private residences - Buckingham Palace is owned by the nation - are already open for limited periods of the year. Sandringham charges Pounds 3 for adults, Pounds 2 for children; Balmoral is cheaper, at Pounds 1.75 for adults and free for children. The palace, however, is priced above competing London attractions, which admittedly lack its exclusiveness. Adults pay Pounds 7.40 at Madame Tussaud's waxwork museum (owned, like the Financial Times, by Pearson), Pounds 6 for the London Dungeon, and Pounds 4.50 for the Natural History Museum. But the White House is open year round at no charge, and imperial residences in Japan, such as Kyoto Imperial Palace and three other imperial villas, are open year round (except weekends and public holidays). They make no charge, but visitors must carry their passports. Around Europe several other official royal residences are already open. In Madrid, the Palacio Real - about Pta600 (Pounds 3) - is open all year, as is the Netherlands' Royal Palace in Amsterdam, and the small Palais du Prince - about FFr50 (Pounds 6) - in Monaco.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on 19 Mar interview with Song Yong-tae, vice </F> minister of the National Unification Board, NUB, and head of the  ROK delegation to the North-South working-level contacts, by an  unidentified reporter--place not given]    [Text] Song Yong-tae, NUB vice minister and senior  delegate of the South side to North-South working-level contact,  on 19 March stressed that "the three-point demands presented by  the South side during the recent contact, including the  discontinuation of slander and defamation of the person in the  highest authority in the ROK, were the expression of a resolute  position showing that the South side's perseverance with unjust  demands that the North side put forward during the past contacts  has reached its limit."    Vice Minister Song said that as long as North Korea fails to  show its clear attitude toward our three-point demands, the  South side will not go to dialogue.    [Reporter] What were the results of today's talks?    [Song Yong-tae] In a keynote speech, our side expressed  regret for the fact that North Korea refused to allow the  inspection of the radiochemical laboratory, which has been  suspected of being a nuclear reprocessing facility, not keeping  its pledge made with the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA], and that the international situation surrounding the  North Korean nuclear issue has reached a serious phase.    To this, the North Korean side again raised its four-point  demands, and even demanded that our side clearly express its  attitude regarding these demands. Moreover, the North Korean  side demanded that we admit the fact that we used the  working-level contact for rupturing North Korea-U.S. talks and  that we apologize for this. Besides, the North side said that  it regards as grave the the South side's act of leading  North-South relations to a phase of confrontation, and  unhesitatingly made radical remarks that it is ready to respond  to dialogue with dialogue and to war with war.    Our side strongly called on the North side to take practical  steps to respond to our three-point demands, including immediate  discontinuation of slander and defamation of our side's person  in highest authority, in order to smoothly realize the exchange  of special envoys and to improve North-South relations.    A very vehement debate took place between us in the contact  over our side's three-point demands and the North side's  four-point demands, and the talk was finally ruptured.  Moreover, the North side refused to agree on the date of next  contact, and simply walked out of the room without shaking hands  with us.    [Reporter] Do you think that the exchange of the special  envoy is completely nullified?    [Song] There is no change in our basic position that we  resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. We will keep the  door open for dialogue. However, we will come to the table of  dialogue with firm principles and with a dignified attitude, not  in haste. We will watch the special meeting of the IAEA Board  of Governors. We believe that our efforts for the international  cooperative system are more important than ever before.    [Reporter] What are the countermeasures of the government at  present?    [Song] The government is reviewing all possible, many-sided  measures to cope with all predictable situations.    [Reporter] We heard that the North side made remarks about  war and so forth during the talks.    [Song] When the issue of international sanctions was put  forward, the North side unhesitatingly made such provocative and  radical remarks as "Seoul is not far from here," "Seoul will  become a sea of fire," and so forth. We need to prepare  ourselves for any situation that may possibly occur before us in  the future.    [Reporter] What was the North side's reaction to the  proposal for designating the date of next contact?    [Song] The North side claimed that if their demands are not  met, the talks are unnecessary.    [Reporter] Would the view that the talks will not be held  for a considerable period of time be right?    [Song] As the situation changes every day, we will watch the  developments for the time being.    [Reporter] What do you think the true intention of the North  side in rupturing the talks is?    [Song] It is not appropriate for me, a delegate to the  talks, to comment on this. What I can say at this point is that  when the nuclear inspection is incomplete, the North side seems  to barely expect that a third round of North Korea-U.S. talks  will be held, and that under the situation in which the  effectiveness of its nuclear card, which is related to the  survival of its system, is being gradually weakened, North Korea  is trying to prevent such a situation.</p>

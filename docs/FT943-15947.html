			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / US opens up energy contracts The US energy department yesterday unveiled plans to put out to competition a cluster of contracts worth up to Dollars 27bn at its nuclear and other sites in a radical change from its previous business practice. It is also seeking to renegotiate a further Dollars 13.5bn of existing contracts to secure better value for money. The department is the federal government's biggest civilian user of contractors, employing companies or universities to run its national laboratories, undertake research and - until the cold war ended - design and produce nuclear weapons. Now it is more concerned with cleaning up the environment at its nuclear bomb-making plants. However, under practices that go back to the Manhattan Project, which built the first US atomic weapon, site contracts were rarely competed for. In the few cases where competition occurred, the existing contractor was usually selected. In the past, management and operating contracts were awarded at nuclear sites covering every aspect of their running. Now, smaller management contracts will be awarded at some sites, with as many tasks as possible monitored for performance, and use made of subcontractors. Much work was previously awarded on a cost-reimbursement basis, whereby the contractor presented the government with a bill on completion. In future, the department will seek to award more work on a fixed price basis. 'In some cases cost-reimbursement is just like handing a contractor a blank cheque,' a department official said. In the first test of the new policy, the department will issue a proposal for a new-style management contract at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons complex in Colorado later this month. The plant is currently managed by EG&amp;G, a Massachusetts-based scientific and technical services company, under a Dollars 6.4bn five-year contract. Other areas where competition is planned, as management contracts totalling Dollars 27bn expire over the next 2-3 years, include the Nevada nuclear test site and the Idaho national engineering laboratory. 'Most of our contractors are fully supportive of our reform goals,' Mrs Hazel O'Leary, the energy secretary, said. However, she warned that where renegotiation of contracts did not produce satisfactory results, the department would not hesitate to put orders out to competition. In environmental clean-ups the spectre of competition has produced offers from contractors to cut costs by 15-20 per cent, officials said.</p>

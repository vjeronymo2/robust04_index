			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : LOSTBOYS FINDING THEIR HEAVY-METAL NICHE  </P> <P> How do you remold a generic Valley-metal band into a rough, tough posse of  Hollywood rockers? Like, say, convert Odin -- the youthful band that Bill  Gazzarri kept calling a "foxy bunch of guys" in the film 'Decline of Western  Civilization Part II: The Metal Years" -- into the bikeresque Lostboys, who  headlined the Roxy on Friday?  </P> <P> You could decorate the mike stands with plants, place lighted candles by the  drum kit, plaster the clothing with drawings of Jesus and talk a lot about "the  streets" between songs.  </P> <P> You also could have lead singer Randy O learn his moves by watching Guns N'  Roses videos and write choruses that go something like this: "Lonely, lonely,  lonely, lonely. . . ." You could also have the band be managed by street-smart  mogul Vicky Hamilton, who helped launch GN'R, Poison and Faster Pussycat.  </P> <P> And it almost works. The Lostboys' bottom-heavy hard-rock tunes don't have the  vocal hooks or monster riffs of a Guns N' Roses, but the band is well rehearsed  and appears ready to spend the next year opening arena shows for Kix or  whatever. With the right video, these guys could be as big as -- and probably  about as interesting -- as, say Warrant. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

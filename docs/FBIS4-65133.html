			<p>BFN     [Text] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special  coordinator on the Cyprus issue; Gustave Feissel, the UN  secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus;  and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay Ulucevic today met in  Vienna to discuss the situation after the deadlock in the talks  on the confidence-building measures. The latest effort is  taking place just a few days before the UN secretary general  submits his report to the Security Council.    The negotiations will continue tomorrow. Two representatives  of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas are also participating in  the meeting. It is felt that there is no chance for the talks  to succeed because the Turkish side insists on maintaining its  intransigent position. The Security Council is committed to  studying alternate ways of promoting the Cyprus issue if it is  ascertained that the UN secretary general's current effort has  failed.    The Cypriot Government has said it does not expect anything  from this meeting, because it does not believe that Turkish  intransigence will bend. In Athens, the Greek Foreign Ministry  spokesman said the meeting shows that the international  community recognizes the need for making efforts toward the  Turkish side. The spokesman stressed that the Greek Government  hopes the UN secretary general's report will condemn Turkish  intransigence.</p>

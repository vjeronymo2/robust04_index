			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya </F> by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- live  or recorded]    [Excerpts] Interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya has  returned from Tunisia, where he took part in the OAU meeting of  heads of state and government. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Concerning the authorities that you  met--these included the Rwandan authorities. Does meeting the  Rwandan Government authorities mean recognition by Burundi?    [Ntibantunganya] Burundi is trying to find ways to bring the  warring parties together because we know that the two sides are  fighting. What we want is for the two sides to understand one  another. We also asked for a meeting with the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF], but a meeting was not possible. What we want is to  listen to all sides, and then to try to discover what can help  them understand one another, in order to end the war. No one  can support massacres.    The second thing is that if the war in Rwanda continues, it  could adversely affect our region. No leader in our region can  overlook this. At the meeting of the heads of state of our  region we invited all the parties, the RPF and the Rwandan  Government, in order to listen to them. Even at the OAU level,  there are heads of state who expressed the wish to come so that  we could listen to them, but that wish was not realized.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Cragnotti in food industry deal Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the controversial financier who last week was severely censured by the Ontario authorities for share trading misdemeanours, has bounced back with a complex food industry deal in his native Italy. Shortly after being released from house arrest by Italian magistrates investigating alleged political corruption, Mr Cragnotti has sealed a multi-billion lire accord to join forces with a little-known agricultural co-operative. Mr Cragnotti, a former executive of the troubled Ferruzzi group who set up his own investment bank, has become the white knight in a complex deal linked with Italy's privatisation programme. Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital Investment, his banking group, is linking with the Fisvi farm co-operative from Apulia to create one of Italy's biggest milk and dairy products groups. Mr Cragnotti has invested heavily in dairy products as part of a strategy to create a big foods business by accumulating small acquisitions. The latest deal involves pooling his two regional dairy products companies with part of the food interests of the former state-controlled SME group, bought by Fisvi earlier this year. Fisvi entered the privatisation process after the IRI state holding company, which controlled SME, failed to find a buyer for the latter's Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica canned vegetables, edible oils and milk subsidiary. While IRI quickly sold SME's Italgel frozen foods operation to Nestle, it proved impossible to find a buyer willing to meet its tough conditions for CBD. After a second round of tenders, Fisvi emerged as the surprise candidate in September. However, it had difficulty raising the acquisition price, in spite of having agreed to sell-on CBD's edible oil business to Unilever. Cragnotti &amp; Partners will now buy 10 per cent of Fisvi. The two will then set up a joint venture, 51 per cent controlled by Fisvi, in which the latter will pool its controlling stake in CBD and the bank will contribute its dairy products interests.</p>

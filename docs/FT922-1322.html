			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Imports continue strong rise but exports up 4% THE sharp declines last month in Britain's visible trade and provisional current-account deficits represent more a return to normality than any significant improvement in the nation's trade performance. While exports rose 4 per cent in May to an all-time high of Pounds 9.17bn and last month's seasonally adjusted visible trade deficit, at Pounds 845m, was the lowest monthly total so far this year, imports have continued to advance strongly. Moreover, at Pounds 1.19bn, the latest monthly visible trade deficit less oil and the so-called erratic items such as aircraft, ships, North Sea installations and precious stones, was consistent with that measure of the deficit for most months since the middle of last year. The Central Statistical Office and the Treasury consider that the measure gives a reasonable guide to underlying trade performance. The good news in the latest trade figures is that export growth is broadly based. Taking the figures for volume exports, Britain exported more of every type of product except certain consumer goods in the three months to the end of May compared with the three months to the end of February. Altogether, volume exports rose by 2.5 per cent between the two periods and were up 5 per cent in the three months to the end of May compared with the comparable three months last year. The bad news is that imports grew more strongly, with growth in volume terms of 4 per cent in the latest three months compared with the three months to the end of February and an increase of 7.5 per cent compared with the three months to end-May last year. Those figures give a better guide to the trend of Britain's imports than the 1.5 per cent drop in the value of imports to Pounds 10bn last month from April's Pounds 10.18bn. Excluding erratic items, the latest trade returns show that volume exports of manufactured goods rose by 2.5 per cent in the latest three months compared with the previous three months. Volume imports of manufactured goods, including finished manufactures, increased by 4.5 per cent in the same period. A notable feature was an 18 per cent jump in the volume imports of cars in the latest three months while car exports in volume terms increased by only 1 per cent compared with the three months to the end of February. It is too early to judge whether the latest figures point to a serious reversal of the recent revival of UK car exports.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- CURRENT ACCOUNT (Pounds bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                            Visible Trade Balance                                  Less oil              Current               and                      Invisibles              Balance    Total    erratics  Exports  Imports   Balance  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990          -16.1    -18.6     -21.0      102.0    120.7     +2.5 1991           -5.2    -10.1     -13.4      103.7    113.8     +4.9 Qtr 1          -2.4     -3.0      -3.6       24.9     28.0     +0.6 Qtr 2          -0.3     -2.2      -2.9       26.0     28.2     +1.9 Qtr 3          -1.1     -2.3      -3.5       26.4     28.8     +1.3 Qtr 4          -1.4     -2.6      -3.5       26.3     28.9     +1.1 Dec            -0.3     -0.7      -1.0        9.0      9.7     +0.4  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Qtr 1          -2.6     -3.1      -3.6       26.2     29.3     +0.4 Jan            -1.0     -1.2      -1.3        8.3      9.4     +0.1 Feb            -0.9     -1.0      -1.1        9.0     10.0     +0.1 Mar            -0.7     -0.9      -1.1        8.9      9.8     +0.1 Apr            -1.2     -1.4      -1.4        8.8     10.2     +0.2 May            -0.6     -0.8      -1.2        9.2     10.0     +0.2  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Invisibles for April and May 1992 are projections.

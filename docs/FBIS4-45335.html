			<p>BFN     [Text] A press-conference on drug smuggling issues has been  held at the Internal Affairs Ministry. It was attended by  Giorgio Giacomelli, the UN deputy secretary general and  executive director of the UN's fund for drug abuse. His visit  to Kazakhstan could be explained by a tendency for establishing  relations between Kazakhstan's drug dealers and that of the CIS  and foreign countries. Last year 197 foreigners were detained  for illegal drug dealing in Kazakhstan. Internal Affairs  Minister Vladimir Shumov said that Kazakhstan has the material  that is needed for illegal production of hashish type drugs. We  are worried about the substantial increase in influx of Opium  type drugs to Kazakhstan from Russia, Ukraine, Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The fact that two-thirds of drug  addicts are young people in their 20's is also of great concern.  This is the reason why we decided to take tougher steps in  combatting it.    Giacomelli noted that it is impossible to combat drug  smuggling single-handed. Therefore, the United Nations puts  forward its own comprehensive program aimed at stopping drug  trafficking. The United Nations' goal is to join the efforts of  different countries in addressing these problems. Conditions  should be created that will make drug cultivation unprofitable.  With this aim in mind relevant international trade legislation  has to be adopted. Touching upon the subject of UN assistance to  Kazakhstan, Giacomelli said that this will depend on a number of  things. The United Nations intends to grant Kazakhstan $0.5  million under this program.</p>

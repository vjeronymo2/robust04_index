			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KTTV TO BE MOVED TO MOVIE STUDIO AS PART OF $200-MILLION PROJECT  </P> <P> Fox Inc. announced plans Monday to move the company's KTTV television station  operation from Hollywood to the historic 20th Century Fox studio in Century  City as part of a $200-million renovation and expansion of the property, which  had previously been targeted for condominium development.  </P> <P> The turnabout reflects an effort to build a state-of-the art film and  television production company in one place, Fox Chairman Barry Diller said in a  telephone interview.  </P> <P> It also is a major departure from previous plans for the 54-acre studio, whose  standing movie sets can be seen from its entrance at Motor Avenue and Pico  Boulevard, just west of Avenue of the Stars.  </P> <P> In 1981, Fox, under different ownership, agreed to a city zoning plan that  would have permitted the development of 2,200 condominium units. The studio  would have been razed and production moved elsewhere, probably outside Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The studio and its parent company, Fox Inc., are owned by publishing baron  Rupert Murdoch, whose company, News Corp. Ltd., bought Fox in 1985.  </P> <P> Diller said dismantling the studio would be a shortsighted decision, one  reflecting a narrow, old-fashioned view of film-making as a process involving  "four covered walls in a thing called a sound stage." Technological  advancements, particularly in editing and sound, call for consolidating the  television and movie functions on one site, he said.  </P> <P> To build the facility that Diller envisions, Fox proposes the addition of  800,000 square feet of production, stage and office facilities to the 1.1  million square feet already there. Diller said the new construction would be  "low-rise and low-density in character."  </P> <P> A Los Angeles zoning change would be necessary, but Diller predicted that city  officials and the studio's neighbors would find the studio expansion "eminently  more desired" than condominiums. "I can't conceive of it the other way around.  I'd be surprised that anyone would say there would be a desire for more  Westside housing."  </P> <P> City officials and vocal area homeowner organizations are likely, however, to  view the switch in plans with skepticism.  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents the Century City area, said Monday  that the plan outlined by Diller was "worth considering. But it's worth  considering with a critical eye."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said 20th Century Fox "is a major factor in what makes L.A. the  entertainment capital of the world. . . . We'd like them to stay. But it has to  be on terms acceptable to the city and to their neighbors."  </P> <P> In 1981, Yaroslavsky backed the condominium plan as a good way to break up the  sprawl of Century City with less-dense residential uses, as did local residents  who were suffering from traffic congestion. (Century City itself was developed  in the 1960s on what had been the studio back lot.)  </P> <P> Initial reaction from homeowner groups was mixed Monday, in part because of a  lack of detailed information.  </P> <P> "I think there will be a great deal of neighborhood opposition," said Dick  Harmetz, a former board member of the Tract 7260 Assn., a nearby homeowners  group.  </P> <P> Others in his association who had participated in a preliminary meeting with  Fox, however, were more upbeat about the prospects.  </P> <P> "I think a low-rise studio complex is a lot better than high-rise  condominiums," if the traffic impact is as Fox states it, said John French,  founding president of the Tract 7260 group.  </P> <P> Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood, said, "The answer from our  community will be a resounding 'No way!' "  </P> <P> Century City development over the past decade, she said, was predicated on  eventually replacing the Fox studio with condominiums, which generate less  traffic than commercial developments.  </P> <P> "The last thing we need is another office building," Lake said.  </P> <P> According to a Fox study, the condominium development would have generated  about 16,000 daily automobile trips, while the expanded studio will generate  14,800 trips. Relocating the television station adds 210 to the studio work  force, which is now about 1,800.  </P> <P> Diller said that relocation of the studio outside the city remains a  possibility if the renovation plans are thwarted.  </P> <P> "We have concluded . . . that we will be able to remain at this location only  if our current facilities may be rehabilitated and new facilities constructed  to provide the flexibility necessary to remain competitive," he said.  </P> <P> Not going forward with the condominium development means shelving a  controversial plan to extend Century Park West from Olympic Boulevard to Pico  Boulevard, Diller said.  </P></p>

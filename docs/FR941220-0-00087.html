			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to making enforcement more consistent across these programs, the Department's directed investigations of possible violations of certified H&hyph;1B labor condition applications would enhance compliance under the program and better assure protection of U.S. and foreign workers. Such protection is consistent with a general Congressional principle in enacting immigration laws_to provide for the admission of foreign workers under terms and conditions of employment that do not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(5)(A), 1182(m)(2)(A)(ii), 1182(n)(1)(A), and 1188(a)(1)(B); see also 20 CFR 655.0(a)(3). It is not consistent with that principle for the Department to be required to ignore_after approval of an LCA_information or evidence on possible H&hyph;1B violations received other than through a complaint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fifty-three commenters addressed this proposal_43 opposing and 10 advocating. Those opposing suggest that the statute does not allow this proposal and that to permit directed investigations would be too disruptive, intrusive, and problematic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is keenly aware of the regulated community's concern and has carefully considered the views expressed by commenters. However, in light of the statutory language and purpose, the legislative history, the Department's experience in the program, and the Department's intentions as to the limited use of directed investigations, the Department has determined to promulgate the directed investigation proposal in this Final Rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Proposed Provisions Adopted With Modification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Short-term placement of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at worksites outside the location(s) listed on the LCA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (See &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .735.) Until the NPRM, the Department had indicated that job contractors would be treated like any other employer under the H&hyph;1B program. After obtaining considerable programmatic experience regarding the operations and effects of job contractors using H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants, the Department proposed to clarify how LCA's should be completed by job contractors, and proposed to amend the regulations to create certain additional standards for such employers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, as part of the proposal to develop special procedures for job contractors, the Department defined the term ``job contractor'' and the proposed requirements to be met, including the general requirement to assure that the information to be provided on the LCA in Item 7 (occupational information) must pertain to the location(s) (city and State) of any and all worksite entities. The Department further proposed that a job contractor filing an LCA must indicate thereon the place of employment at which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant will actually work (and for which the prevailing wage must be determined) as opposed to the employer's headquarters or office location if such location is different from the place of employment. The Department also proposed that, if the contractor wishes to relocate the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant to work at any location not listed on a certified LCA, an appropriate LCA shall be filed and certified (and the appropriate prevailing wage determined) before any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant may be employed at that location. The NPRM addressed other job contractor matters, such as the contractor's actual wage obligation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 264 comments received in response to the NPRM, 171 commented on the job contractor proposal and 153 (nearly 90%) opposed it_128 of those 153 coming from business commenters. The negative comments related to the concept as a whole or related to a part of it such as the nationwide actual wage, worksite posting, and place of employment designation on the labor condition application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Senator Alan K. Simpson expressed concern for the employer's ability to find workers to fill real health care needs, especially in the physical therapist occupation. Other commenters expressed concern that the proposed rule would impose special hardships on job contractors, would be onerous, and would be discriminatory. Several commenters suggested that the Department consider a time test methodology, rather than a ``job contractor'' concept, in identifying the responsibilities of an employer who places H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at worksites owned or controlled by entities other than the employer. Suggestions for the duration of temporary placement ranged from 30 days to 180 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the comments received in response to the January 13, 1992 Interim Final Rule, concerning the worksite movement of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants, 13 commenters (11 of which were businesses) expressed the view that the initial LCA filing should be sufficient when an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is transferred between temporary worksites such as branch offices or customer offices. These comments advanced the position that an employer should be able to move H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants to worksites where it is anticipated that the tour of duty will be of a short or temporary nature. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has considered carefully the comments concerning the job contractor concept as proposed and has decided_at this time_not to establish special procedures applicable only to those businesses operating as job contractors. At present, based on the overwhelming weight of the comments and the Department's experience in the program, the Final Rule contains a modification of the proposed rule, to implement a ``time test'' for short-term assignments of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants to worksite(s) outside the area(s) of employment covered by already-certified LCA's whether the new worksite is another establishment of the employer or is the worksite of another entity ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> customer of a job contractor providing H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants or services provided by H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at the customer's location). The Final Rule is both less burdensome for employers and more protective of workers than was the provision as proposed in the NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that it is common practice for employers_not only job contractors, but also other employers which operate in more than one place of employment within the United States_to move H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants from one place of employment (worksite) to another for short periods of time in response to demands of business. The Final Rule takes into consideration the practical and real world experience of short-term placement of employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

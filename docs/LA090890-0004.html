			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARE YOU LISTENING, MR. PRESIDENT?;  </P> <P> BUSH NEEDS TO PICK A NEW CHIEF FOR NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH  </P> <P> At a time when our nation faces its most formidable health challenges, the  National Institutes of Health -- the premier U.S. biomedical research facility  -- lacks a leader. The directorship, once considered among the most prestigious  scientific jobs in the world, has been vacant for more than a year. Even more  distressing: No prospect is in sight.  </P> <P> It seems the Bush Administration can't even give the job away. It has bumbled  the job search so badly since a Ronald Reagan appointee, Dr. James Wyngaarden,  left in July, 1989, that most candidates now see the directorship as too  political -- a tool of the White House. Early on, some candidates were asked  their views on abortion, the so-called litmus test. Considering the subject had  little to do with running the NIH, candidates understandably were upset.  William H. Danforth, chancellor of Washington University -- whose brother,  John, is Missouri's Republican senator -- angrily withdrew his name after such  a query.  </P> <P> Although the Administration now insists it has dropped the litmus test, the  resentment lingers. The scientific community widely opposes the  Administration's continued ban on federal funding for research using fetal  tissue. Bush has shown little initiative in other health areas as well. The  Food &amp; Drug Administration, for example, has no leader despite the pressing  need to expedite its drug-approval process to make experimental drugs available  to critically ill cancer and AIDS patients.  </P> <P> Nine Democratic members of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee,  which has jurisdiction over NIH, recently urged Bush to fill the NIH position.  "The National Institutes of Health are too important to the health of the  nation to permit the position of director to be trivialized by the political  manipulations that have characterized the selection process up to this point,"  their letter said. "We urge you to end the current disarray and petty  machinations . . . . "  </P> <P> Are you listening, Mr. President?  </P></p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Flotation pays off as Allders leaps to Pounds 25.4m The benefit of last year's flotation was seen in the fourfold increase in profits at Allders, the department store and tax and duty free retail group. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 6.36m to Pounds 25.4m during the year to September 30. The previous period covered 53 weeks. Operating profits rose by almost 17 per cent from Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 25.1m on sales of Pounds 732.9m (Pounds 685.5m). Mr Harvey Lipsith, chief executive, said the group was continuing to show healthy growth. Trading in the 12 department stores since the financial year-end was 6 per cent higher than last year 'and the early indications are very encouraging for Christmas'. Mr Lipsith welcomed the Budget increases on drink and tobacco duties: 'Let's have more of it, please - we celebrate when the duty goes up.' Operating profits at the department stores rose from Pounds 12m to Pounds 13.1m on sales of Pounds 296.8m (Pounds 286.6m). Trading was erratic, the group said, but there was good response to promotions. A Pounds 1.4m rates refund offset profits lost while the Croydon flagship store was being refurbished. Allders International, the duty free division, lifted operating profits from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 13.5m, while sales rose from Pounds 399m to Pounds 436.2m. Europe contributed Pounds 12m (Pounds 8.8m), while the North American side fell Pounds 1.3m into the red (Pounds 1.4m profit), hit by the costs of closing in San Francisco. Interest payments fell from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 1.2m, and would have been Pounds 400,000 lower if the flotation had taken place at the start of the financial year. The group ended the year with effectively zero gearing. Fully diluted pro forma earnings per share before exceptionals were 17.4p (13.9p), while basic earnings were 20.6p (4.3p). The board is proposing a final dividend of 4.5p, giving a total for the year of 6.7p compared with a pro forma 6.1p. COMMENT Encouraging signs in the approach to Christmas and a Budget targeting drink and tobacco put smiles on the faces of Allders' management yesterday. Once the figures - not as clearly presented as they could have been - are untangled, the underlying trends appear favourable. The department stores are benefiting from the bias towards consumer durables; the Croydon store has yet to show its full potential; and further stores are being added to the newer Allders at Home concept. Forecasting profits from the duty free side is more difficult. The group, which will be glad to see the back of the troublesome San Francisco contract, is making the business more international and is trying to reduce its dependency on drinks and tobacco sales. Profits of Pounds 26.5m this year give a multiple of 12.6, which looks fair value.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Geest shares slide on loss warning - Outbreak of black sigatoka disease hits Costa Rican production Geest shares fell sharply yesterday after it warned that an attack of a fungal disease on its banana plantations in Costa Rica would push it into the red for 1993. The company will incur an exceptional charge of Pounds 8.9m to cover the costs of fighting the disease. The shares closed at 276p, down 87p on the day. Mr David Sugden, chief executive of the fresh produce and prepared food group, said the company had had to cut down almost 30 per cent of the stems on its 3,000 hectares of plantation after an outbreak of black sigatoka disease. Its Costa Rican production, normally 7.5m to 8m boxes of bananas a year, was between 2.5m and 3m boxes down. The news took the market by surprise. Sigatoka is a routine hazard for banana growers in Latin America and is normally controlled by spraying. However, Mr Sugden said that the weather patterns in the rainy season at the end of last year had led to a loss of control over the disease in Costa Rica. In addition, delays in changing the European banana imports regime hit banana prices in the second half of last year. The quota of so-called dollar bananas, grown in Latin America more cheaply than in the West Indies, was set at 1m tonnes for the final five months of the year. The resulting oversupply to Europe had 'severely depressed returns to our producing partners in the Windward Islands,' said Geest, the sole exporter and shipper of Windward Island bananas. Geest will also make a further Pounds 2.5m exceptional charge for rationalisation of its UK fresh produce wholesale business. Last year Geest's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 20.4m on turnover of Pounds 625m. Bananas account for about a third of group turnover. Analysts, who were expecting profits of about Pounds 10m, now expect a loss of about Pounds 5m or 9p a share. Geest intends to maintain its dividend at 8.1p. Mr Sugden said that in the past three years the company had invested Pounds 120m on its strategy of becoming a big European supplier of both dollar and West Indian bananas. He criticised the European Union's offer during the Gatt negotiations last month to lift the quota for dollar bananas by a further 100,000 tonnes this year, and a further 100,000 tonnes next year. 'The political decision to increase the dollar quota has done the market no favours,' he said yesterday. In Dublin, Fyffes, the other main banana distributor in the UK market, said that it 'has to date noticed no changes in trading conditions or price levels' resulting from new quota offers made in the final stages of the Gatt negotiations. Fyffes also said that black sigatoka disease had not had any effect on the company, which over the past three years has been building up supplies from Guatemala and Honduras. Unlike Geest, Fyffes has no plantations of its own in central America, buying instead from independent producers on contract. See Lex</p>

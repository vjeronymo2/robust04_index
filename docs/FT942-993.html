			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Economy to grow 'steadily' to 1996 Steady economic growth in the next few years, driven by stronger commercial investment, is envisaged by Cambridge Econometrics, an economic consultancy, in its latest set of forecasts issued today, Peter Marsh writes. Consumer spending will remain restrained partly because of the tax rises announced last year. Export growth will be fairly high as a result of general economic expansion across much of the developed world. Cambridge Econometrics expects gross domestic product to increase 2.8 per cent this year, stabilising at 2.5 per cent in 1995 and 1996. Investment growth will average 4 per cent a year between this year and 1996, while consumer spending will slow by the end of this year as the tax increases bite. The consultancy says inflationary pressures will increase as the economy expands, with the retail prices index increasing to 4.4 per cent next year after 2.9 per cent this year.

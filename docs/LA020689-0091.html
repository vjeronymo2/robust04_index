			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'SIR JAMES';  </P> <P> MOLEST SUSPECT SAYS HE'S MISUNDERSTOOD, BUT PROSECUTORS INSIST HE'S A CON MAN  </P> <P> There is a picture of James Allen Hydrick sitting at the base of the Great  Pyramid of Giza, feet crossed in the lotus position, eyes raised toward the  heavens, a white cotton kaffiyeh headdress shielding his face from the sun.  </P> <P> As Hydrick tells it, the hurricane-force winds that he summoned through  meditation suddenly began whipping through the Western Desert. It was, he says,  quite an impressive show for the Egyptian dignitaries who had gathered to watch  this young American demonstrate his psychic powers.  </P> <P> He prizes the picture, one of the many faces of James Allen Hydrick.  </P> <P> In one series of photos, Hydrick, his tattooed arms set off by a jet black  martial arts outfit and white headband, smashing through six slabs of concrete  with a bare fist at Venice Beach. A crowd of spectators is shown cheering, and  Hydrick responds with a muscular arm raised in triumph.  </P> <P> These are the images that James Allen Hydrick wants the world to see: of  achievement, of success, of a man who has earned the adoration and respect of  others.  </P> <P> But Huntington Beach police see a different person in the 29-year-old karate  expert currently held in a high-security area of the Orange County Jail. What  they see is a master manipulator, a fast-talking con artist who finally ran  afoul of the law one too many times.  </P> <P> Between last June and September, police say, while Hydrick was living in a  small apartment in downtown Huntington Beach just a few blocks from the ocean,  he befriended a group of young boys who were awed by his tales of psychic  tricks and martial arts demonstrations. Then, according to police, Hydrick  lured them to his apartment, where he molested them in exchange for food, drugs  and cigarettes.  </P> <P> Hydrick now faces 13 counts of felonychild molestation, one misdemeanor child  molestation charge and one count of failing to register as a sex offender.  Authorities have declined to identify the exact number of alleged victims.  Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Koski said the sex offender status stemmed from a  1978 incident in Santa Monica in which Hydrick was convicted of oral  copulation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Plea Yet  </P> <P> Hydrick has yet to enter a plea because his arraignment has been postponed at  least three times, in part because of the controversy that surrounds the man  who calls himself "Sir James" and claims to have escaped from no fewer than 148  jails and institutions across the United States. When he has appeared in court,  it has been amid uncommonly tight security.  </P> <P> Hydrick is scheduled for arraignment again today in West Orange County  Municipal Court in Westminster.  </P> <P> Hydrick's notoriety stems from his self-professed ability to slip out of  handcuffs and bust out of the strongest prisons, his undisputed expertise in  karate and tae kwon do, and a bizarre tale about how he was transported back to  California after being arrested in Georgia and extradited.  </P> <P> According to law enforcement officials, private security guards who had been  driving Hydrick back to California became unnerved when they suspected that  Hydrick was using supernatural powers to rock the van. In Johnson County, Ark.,  where Hydrick was dropped off with local authorities, the security guards  warned county jailers not to look Hydrick in the eye for fear he might cast a  spell.  </P> <P> By the time Hydrick arrived in Orange County earlier this month, local  officials already knew of his reputation and his love of publicity. Jail guards  joked about Hydrick levitating himself out of the downtown Santa Ana facility  to freedom, about the prisoner giving "the evil eye" to guards.  </P> <P> Pamela Boyd, the Orange County public defender who represents Hydrick, finds  her client in a precarious position because of the publicity and stories about  supernatural powers and multiple escapes.  </P> <P> "Rumors are abounding about what he is capable of, and I want to stop the  circus atmosphere every time he comes to court," Boyd said. "This guy does have  an ability to slip out of his cuffs . . . (but) I don't have any personal  knowledge of him putting hexes on anyone."  </P> <P> Neither prosecutor Koski nor Huntington Beach police would elaborate on the  case against Hydrick, but they did say they consider him an escape risk because  of his past. Koski said it had been confirmed that Hydrick escaped from at  least three jails in Utah, Georgia and South Carolina.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Says He's Perplexed  </P> <P> In a recent telephone interview, Hydrick said he is innocent and is perplexed  about why the young men he had befriended in Huntington Beach had turned on  him.  </P> <P> "In my heart I don't think I did wrong," he said. "I didn't hurt anybody. I  like kids. I wouldn't ever hurt them."  </P> <P> Speaking in a soft accent that told of his rural Deep South upbringing, Hydrick  denied that he had ever presented himself as someone gifted with supernatural  powers, but affirmed that he had escaped from countless jails, allegedly after  being mistreated.  </P> <P> "If they treat me like an animal, I act like an animal, and I get out," he  said. "(But) I'm no more psychic than you are. I don't know where that started.  My promotions are breaking bricks with my hands, that's all. If I have  supernatural powers -- and sometimes I can do funny things with my mind -- I  don't know it." Hydrick said he was appearing in promotions for a local  sportswear company, breaking bricks and concrete with his hands, when he began  teaching a group of Huntington Beach teen-agers the martial arts.  </P> <P> "But I never hurt anyone," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Claims of Escape  </P> <P> In a cover story on Hydrick that appeared in the November issue of Inside  Kung-Fu magazine, a martial arts trade journal, Hydrick made his claim to have  escaped from 148 jails and other institutions. It was in that story that he was  credited with whipping up an 80-m.p.h. wind for the Egyptian officials.  </P> <P> Hydrick said he was in Egypt on a promotional tour, but like so many things  about this man, even that seems in dispute. His adoptive mother told The Times  that the 1981 trip was not a promotional tour but rather a simple vacation, and  that there was no demonstration before local Egyptian dignitaries. She said she  knew nothing about her son making the winds howl in the desert.  </P> <P> "I don't know why he'd say that," she said.  </P> <P> One story that Hydrick likes to tell, but that could not be confirmed, centered  on his claim that about 10 years ago he spent a year wandering the Savannah  River in Georgia with a Tibetan monk learning kung fu and other martial arts  disciplines.  </P> <P> What is clear, however, is that he did learn martial arts from someone -- and  excelled at it. Last year he set an unofficial world record by breaking 89  inches of concrete at a tournament in Long Beach, according to Inside Kung-Fu.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Martial Arts Expert  </P> <P> His expertise at martial arts and his alleged psychic ability, moreover, have  been the subject of at least three syndicated television talk shows.  Ironically, it was his last television appearance, on the nationally televised  "Sally Jessy Raphael" show on Nov. 29, that led to his arrest. An off-duty  Huntington Beach police officer saw him on the show and tracked him down to  Georgia, where he was in custody on an unrelated charge.  </P> <P> If Hydrick presents a complex picture in public, his family and friends say  that beneath all the bravado is a troubled young man who has been in and out of  jails since he was a teen-ager.  </P> <P> "Most of what Allen does are just tricks," said his sister, Deborah Olmstead,  speaking from New Ellington, S.C.  </P> <P> And all the talk about psychic powers and putting hexes on people? "That's just  Allen talking big again, trying to get attention," she said.  </P> <P> Olmstead said she believes her brother's problems stem from a desire "to be  somebody. Even now he feels like he is a nobody. He wants so much to call my  daddy up say, 'Hey, aren't you proud of me?' "  </P> <P> Olmstead and her brother, Billy Hydrick of Gloverville, S.C., said that they  know of at least six different times that Hydrick escaped from local jails in  South Carolina and Georgia, but that the escapes were not the result of him  smashing through bars or putting hexes on guards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Walked Out the Door  </P> <P> "One time a deputy went to answer the phone and Allen just walked out the  door," his brother said. "That was about all there was to it."  </P> <P> In Aiken County, S.C., Sheriff Carroll Heath described Hydrick as a perennial  problem who "has made a right good pest of himself."  </P> <P> "I'm no psychologist, but let's face it, everybody likes to be liked," Heath  said. "Problem with James, he didn't attract too much attention from the adult  population but the kids idolized him. He'd lay that Rambo stuff in their heads.  He'd tell everyone that he had a chauffeur and a limo down around Atlanta,  about how famous he was, that kind of stuff."  </P> <P> Several years ago, Heath said, Hydrick escaped from the Aiken County Jail by  kicking out some concrete blocks and slithering through a hole, along with two  other inmates.  </P> <P> "You don't need to be psychic to do that," he said. "But he did have some  martial arts training. One time he kicked the whole top of a steel door down  with his feet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Troubled Childhood  </P> <P> Janice Shrock Smith, a 60-year-old Salt Lake City woman who adopted Hydrick  when he was almost 22, said the seeds of her son's problems were sown in a  troubled childhood in which he was abused and abandoned. She said she adopted  Hydrick because "I thought I could help him."  </P> <P> The Hydrick children were taken from their parents when they were toddlers and  placed in a succession of foster homes and institutions. By his own count,  Hydrick was moved among at least seven different foster homes.  </P> <P> "He was an abused baby," Smith said. "It's not his fault. It's bravisimo that  comes through and they don't understand their actions."  </P> <P> Smith, who is convinced that Hydrick is psychic, said her adopted son was  always drawn to teen-agers because he empathized with them, seeing a little of  himself in the troubled youngsters who would watch him break bricks and perform  other martial arts feats on the beaches of California.  </P> <P> "He is like a Pied Piper," she said. "He is not a child molester. He can't  stand to see parents abusing kids. He feels for kids who are having problems  with their parents. He is tremendously naive when it comes to kids. He forms an  attachment, a protective attachment to them. He feels for kids who are having  problems."  </P> <P> To Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Bill Peterson, the Hydrick case is a simple one  of child molestation that should not be made "larger than life."  </P> <P> "The charges speak for themselves," Peterson said, saying he could not comment  on details of the case. "He is very manipulative. This gentleman appears to  like publicity. He is a showman."  </P></p>

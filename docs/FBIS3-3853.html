According to the party's declaration issued yesterday, its  objectives are to support the unification of China, promote  sincere interaction between the mainland and Taiwan as well as  uphold the prosperity of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.    At the party's inaugural ceremony yesterday, chairman  Lawrence Yum Sinling said people could not label the party as  pro-Taiwan.    "We have just started up. I think people should see what we  are doing before labelling us," he said.    Although about 10 of the party's members were graduates from  universities in Taiwan, it did not mean the party was  pro-Taiwan, he said. The members were Chinese and had lived and  grown up in Hong Kong.    The party's vice-chairman, Willy Ng Wai-cho, said the party  had 82 members. Nine of them were municipal council and  district board members, including Chiang Sai-cheong, Shung  King-fai and Christopher Chu Cho-yan.    Mr Yum said the party would communicate with other liberal  camps because it demanded that councillors of all levels be  elected by universal suffrage as soon as possible to ensure a  high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong.    Mr Ng said that, like the democratic flagship the United  Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK), the party wanted to have 30  directly elected seats in the Legislative Council returned in  the 1995 election.    He said about 10 members of the new party were also members  of the UDHK and a few were members of Meeting Point or the  Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood.    The party would accept members who belonged to other  parties.    Mr Ng, who is also a member of the UDHK, said he had decided  to run in the district board elections in September as a  candidate of the new party. He said he had informed the UDHK of  his decision.    He did not want to withdraw from the UDHK but he would  respect its decision if the party would not allow a candidate  running for elections to belong to more than one party.    Mr Ng said 13 other members of the new alliance had informed  the party that they would be interested in running in the  district board elections.    The party would need further discussion to decide how many  candidates to field in the election, he said.    Mr Yum said the party had raised about $100,000 mainly from  friends.    When asked whether the party would accept financial support  from pro-Taiwan organisations, Mr Yum said it would accept  anybody's contributions as long as they were unconditional.</p>

He stressed that France, which was still dealing with Chad  and African countries with a colonialist mentality, has not  given up its desires in the African continent. France's  dealings with Chad have always been within this framework. It  was France that conspired against the Frolinat revolution. It  toppled the former president Felix Malloum, conspired against  Goukouni Oueddei and overthrew him, and is now conspiring  against President Idriss Deby because it does not want this  brotherly country to ever enjoy stability so that France can  continue serving its interests in dominating and colonializing  Chad.    The JANA African affairs editor said: We are confident that  the Chadian people, who suffered from French colonialism's  calamities and persistent conspiracies to hinder the  establishment of stability and security in Chad, are well aware  of what France is contriving against them and will not give  colonialism the opportunity to come back to the region again.</p>

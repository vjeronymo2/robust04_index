			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Ford to take full ownership of Hertz and raise payout Ford Motor, the US vehicle manufacturer, announced yesterday that it is to take full ownership of its subsidiary Hertz, the world's largest car rental company, by buying out Sweden's Volvo and the company's management, which together own 46 per cent. Ford also confirmed it was selling its troubled California savings and loans, First Nationwide Bank, for Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 745m) to Dallas-based First Madison Bank. The carmaker also announced a 12.5 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend - the first change since it cut the payout in April 1991. Ford recently increased its stake in Hertz from 49 per cent to 54 per cent through the purchase of a 5 per cent stake held by Germany's Commerzbank. It will now pay Dollars 145m to Volvo for its 26 per cent stake, consisting of common and preferred stock, and will buy out the management's 20 per cent holding for an undisclosed sum. Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said the deal was part of its strategy of sharpening its business focus. It would also improve the company's net debt figure. Ford said it regarded rentals as a core part of its car business. The deal ensured excellent exposure for its products. About 70 per cent of Hertz's vehicle purchases in the US come from Ford, while the US carmaker supplies a third of its European fleet. Last year Hertz had net income of Dollars 53m on turnover of Dollars 2.85bn. Ford added that First Nationwide was being sold at a small premium above tangible book value. Ford would take a Dollars 440m charge against first-quarter earnings, mainly to reflect non-recovery of goodwill, as well as reserves for losses on retained assets. Ford bought First Nationwide in 1985 for around Dollars 500m and rapidly ran into property loan problems. Ford's quarterly dividend was raised from 40 cents to 45 cents from June 1 and the company also declared a two-for-one stock split. The three Detroit carmakers all cut their dividends in early 1991 in the midst of recession. Chrysler was the first to announce a raise - of one third - unveiled in December, but GM has yet to move.</p>

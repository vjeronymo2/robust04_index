			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Small companies The London equity market's recent slavishness in following Wall Street has at least one curious gap. The Nasdaq composite index of US small companies rose by 57 per cent last year, more than twice the gain among leading stocks. By contrast, Hoare Govett's index of UK small companies recorded a total return of 18.5 per cent, slightly underperforming both the FT-SE and All-Share indices. The index, which measures the bottom 10 per cent of the market by capitalisation, has now underperformed for three successive years, a unique sequence in its 35-year history. Granted, the record books are unlikely to note that only the FT-SE's late upward dash kept the trend intact. It is perhaps also significant that a healthy chunk of the Nasdaq index's outperformance took place in the few December days after US authorities cut the discount rate to 3.5 per cent. But the question remains why UK small companies should have been relatively lacklustre. The delay in UK economic recovery was mainly to blame, not least because for some constituents of the index it spelt doom. By the end of the third quarter 35 companies had gone bust out of the 1227 in the index; the full-year figure will probably be nearer 50. If the recessionary cycle of the early 1980s is repeated, that figure will be worse again this year. All the same, the economy in the US proved equally sluggish. Investors there, it seems, had sufficient confidence to start discounting recovery rather earlier and to stick with small companies for longer. Given the widespread acceptance that recovery in the UK will appear at some point this year and accelerate in 1993, it is logical to suggest that small companies will quickly restore their reputation for outperformance. They have higher financial gearing than in 1982, so those which survive and prosper might hit the rights issue trail. But if profits in the sector are forging ahead, that should present only a minor inconvenience.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Ruling today on BCCI pay-off SIR DONALD NICHOLLS, the vice-chancellor, will rule in the High Court today on whether the Pounds 930m settlement negotiated by liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International can go ahead. Touche Ross, the liquidator, is asking Sir Donald to give the go-ahead for the deal to be offered to creditors. The deal, which is estimated to give creditors a return of 30 per cent to 40 per cent, involves the injection of about Pounds 930m by the Abu Dhabi authorities - the bank's majority shareholders. Abu Dhabi yesterday said it had lowered the level of acceptances necessary for the scheme to go ahead from Dollars 7bn of creditors to Dollars 4.75bn. The creditors are likely to seek international government help to make good their losses if the judgment today goes against them. The package also needs approval from courts in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands at hearings later this month. FT law reports, Page 14</p>

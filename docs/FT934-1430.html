			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: When shoppers feel the pinch - Bethan Hutton looks at the highs and lows of store credit offers With seven shopping days before Christmas, and only slightly longer to the winter sales, the bank balances and credit card limits of dedicated shoppers are feeling the strain already. As a result, customers may eye with special interest those signs proclaiming: 'Open an account - spend Pounds 500 today]' or 'Buy now, pay July.' Store credit offers abound - but are they worth it? Retail credit falls into two main categories: store cards and loans. Store cards are essentially in-house credit cards - you receive a monthly statement and either pay the balance in full, avoiding interest charges, or pay part and incur interest - but there are a few differences from cards issued by banks and building societies. First, no retailer has yet dared to charge an annual fee for its card, although most credit cards these days cost around Pounds 10 a year. But store cards make up for this by charging generally higher rates of interest. So, if you always pay the balance in full, store cards are free to use. If, however, you have a choice between using an ordinary credit card and a store card, and you think you will not be able to pay in full first time, you could be better off using the credit card - check the comparative interest rates. Barclaycard charges 1.585 per cent a month but Burton's store card charges at least 2 per cent. Retailers also offer card-holders various incentives to stay loyal and continue shopping in their outlets. New card-holders get 'welcome' offers, such as a package of vouchers or 10 per cent off the first purchase with it. Card-holders may also be invited to late-night shopping evenings and sale previews, or get extra discounts at certain times. Such offers are obviously designed to encourage more spending, but they can be valuable if used intelligently. Customers at two large retail chains, Marks and Spencer and the John Lewis Partnership, have another reason for applying for a store card: neither accepts credit cards, although John Lewis does now accept Switch debit cards. Some shops offer two types of card: option and budget. Option cards are similar to credit cards; with budget cards, you agree to a certain monthly payment and your credit limit is a multiple of that. If budget cards are used as intended, you almost always pay interest, so they can be an expensive way to shop. Non-card credit offers by shops take several forms. Some are standard personal loans: you borrow a certain amount at a fixed interest rate and agree to pay it back over a period of months or years. These compare directly to bank or building society loans, and you should shop around to get the best deal before signing up for a shop's in-house offer. More attractive are the 0 per cent finance and 'buy now, pay in July' type of deals. It is difficult to find any objection to interest-free credit offers (so long as the product to which they are attached is priced competitively), but buy now, pay later schemes can have hidden drawbacks. Basically, you pay a deposit and then nothing more until the balance is due several months later. But you often have to fill out a credit agreement form so that, if you do not pay the balance, monthly amounts become due and interest is racked up at quite a steep rate. Make a note in your diary of when the payment is due - you might not get a reminder. These are some of the main store card groups (cards may bear the name of any shop in the group): Burton Group: (includes Debenhams, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Top Shop, Top Man, Principles, Champion Sport). Charges 2 per cent monthly (APR 26.8) for direct debits, 2.2 per cent (APR 29.8). Extra 10 per cent off for all or part of sale period.

Harrods/House of Fraser: 2.2 per cent, APR 29.8. Late opening nights for account-holders, gift vouchers if you spend a certain amount, and an extra 10 per cent off on the first day or first Saturday of the sale. John Lewis: Lowest interest rate of all the storecards: 1.5 per cent a month, APR 19.5. No special privileges for account-holders. M&amp;S: 1.7 per cent (APR 22.4) if you pay by direct debit, 1.9 per cent (APR 25.3) otherwise. Card-holder evenings; free magazine (normally Pounds 1). No extra discounts.

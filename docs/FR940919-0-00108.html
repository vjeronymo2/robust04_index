			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Current Management Practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Waste generators and TSDFs report that most of the soils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated with D018&hyph;D043 newly identified organic TC wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are currently landfilled without prior treatment. Incineration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the commercial off-site treatment technology reportedly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for these wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other than incineration for treating organic TC-contaminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soil, EPA has no information on the commercial off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of other treatment technologies (e.g., low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature thermal desorption, bioremediation, solvent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraction). Although several commenters to the ANPRM mentioned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bioremediation as an alternative to incineration for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of TC-contaminated soils, no commenter provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility specific information on commercially available off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment capacity for this technology. The lack of off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial capacity for technologies other than incineration was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirmed by responses to EPA's request for voluntary information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from vendors of innovative technologies provided in the Vendor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information System for Innovative Treatment Technologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VISITT). At the time of the proposed rule, EPA had received no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information that special-handling problems may limit the quantity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of hazardous soil that currently can be treated by incineration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and EPA requested information on special-handling concerns with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managing these wastes. No comments were received on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, EPA has concluded that the quantity of hazardous soil that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be treated by incineration will not be limited by special-handling problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 3. Available Capacity and Capacity Implications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> a. Hazardous Soil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA is requiring that hazardous soil be treated prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> land disposal. EPA has determined that available destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., incineration) and immobilization (e.g., stabilization)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity exists. Some additional capacity also exists from many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the technologies in the extraction family (e.g., soil washing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical extraction). However, some of the capacity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraction technologies currently used to decontaminate soils,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as soil washing, may not have received requisite permits by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effective date of this rule, although EPA is exploring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various opportunities for these technologies to become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational in an expedited manner. (Please contact the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate EPA regional office or the state hazardous waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.) Thus, EPA anticipates that the off-site commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity available to treat hazardous soils at the time this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becomes effective will be limited to incineration and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stabilization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that innovative technologies are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to treat hazardous soil. Performance of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies also may be the basis for treatability variances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to &sect;268.44(h). EPA requested comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicality and current availability of these technologies. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received comments that the proposed soil standards cannot be met  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by bioremediation, but may be met by innovative technologies such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as thermal desorption and soil vapor extraction. However, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not receive any comments on the current availability of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies. Thus, EPA has concluded that the off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment capacity for hazardous soils will initially be limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to incineration and stabilization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also solicited comments on the need for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity variance and on estimates of available treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity. One commenter opposed the proposed capacity variance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for soils and said that EPA should_at the very least_require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of ``hot spots.'' Several commenters supported the two-year national capacity variance. However, EPA has determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a national capacity variance is unnecessary for hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> b. Hazardous Debris  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA estimates that approximately 34,000 tons of debris  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated with newly identified organic TC wastes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently land disposed and require off-site commercial treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity. The capacity analysis conducted for debris  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated with Phase II wastes indicates that sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity exists to treat debris contaminated with organics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, EPA is not granting a national capacity variance for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous debris contaminated with organic TC wastes and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed organic wastes covered in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> XV. State Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State. Following authorization, EPA retains enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and requirements for authorization are found in 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 271.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (HSWA), a State with final authorization administered its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous waste program in lieu of EPA administering the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program in that State. The Federal requirements no longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any facilities that the State was authorized to permit. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take effect in an authorized State until the State adopted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements as State law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, under RCRA section 3006(g) (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new requirements and prohibitions imposed by HSWA take effect in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized States at the same time that they take effect in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonauthorized States. EPA is directed to carry out these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and prohibitions in authorized States, including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorization to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State law to retain final authorization, HSWA is implemented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federally in authorized States in the interim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

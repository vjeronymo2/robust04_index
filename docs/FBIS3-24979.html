(PANA)--The 59th ordinary  session of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Council of  Ministers ended in Addis Ababa on Friday [4 February], with the  approval of a 59.66- million-dollar programme budget for the  biennium 1994/96 for the continental body.    The biennial budget, the first of its kind since the  creation  of the OAU in 1963, reflects the priorities of the organisation  at a time when it is being called upon to shoulder more  responsibilities, especially in the area of conflict resolution  in the continent.    The meeting, which began on Monday, also adopted a number of  resolutions on political and economic matters affecting some of  the organisation's 52 member-states.    The ministers deplored the fact that conflicts now persist  in  Africa and hailed the establishment of a mechanism for conflict  resolution, which they said was "a step that would enable Africa  to take control of its own problems, to which it should find  solutions without foreign interference."    On South Africa, the council appealed to each member state  to  send at least two observers to reinforce the OAU mission in  South Africa to monitor the all-race elections scheduled to take  place as from 26 April. It also urged the contries to  contribute to the special fund to assist the liberation  movements in the elections.    On Burundi, the council endorsed the establishment of an OAU  mission in Bujumbura to promote dialogue and national  reconciliation following the violence and kilings prevalent in  the country since the failed coup of October 1993. It appealed  to the people of Burundi and all the political parties to  cooperate with the OAU mission, whose aim is purely to help the  people of Burundi regain peace, confidence, and security.    On the situation in Angola, where renewed fighting erupted  after the 1992 election won by the MPLA [Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola] government, the council said it  "strongly condemns UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] for the escalation of military action  and for its persistent occuptation of towns, villages, and small  areas, which have undermined the peace process."    It urged leaders of the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola (UNITA) to negotiate seriously at the  current talks in Lusaka and reach an agreement with the Angolan  Government so that a durable cease-fire accord could be signed.    The council also appealed to member states and the  international community to give full political, diplomatic, and  material support to the MPLA government so as to enable it to  restore peace.    The council adopted a resolution on Somalia where American  troops serving with the United Nations peacekeeping are to  withdraw by the end of March. It called on the United Nations  to work in close coordination with the OAU and the Ethiopian  president to facilitate political reconciliation and  implementation of all agreements reached by all the Somalian  factions.    The council observed that "restoration of peace in Somalia  remains essentially the responsibility of Somalis and that the  internatimnal community can only help them in the realisation of  that objective."</p>

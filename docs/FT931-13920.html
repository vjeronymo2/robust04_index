			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Insolvency law seen as 'bayoneting wounded' BRITAIN'S largest insolvency practitioners yesterday called for urgent changes to the law on insolvency in order to save thousands of companies from failing. The insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, wants reforms of the 1986 Insolvency Act to foster a 'rescue culture' to remove the stigma of insolvency. Mr Chris Hughes, head of the insolvency arm, formerly called Cork Gully, said in its annual review: 'The existing law in too many cases still amounts to a prescription to bayonet the wounded.' He also called for tougher action against rogue directors and said only two cases had led to successful prosecutions for wrongful trading since 1986. 'Some of the worst examples of bad corporate governance are going unpunished,' he said. Mr Hughes said the 1986 act was intended to foster a rescue culture, but it had not lived up to expectations or led to an increase in the number of businesses rehabilitated. The firm estimated that less than 1 per cent of all companies in some form of insolvency were using a procedure such as administration that might lead to their rescue. It projected that without any change there would be about 80,000 failures in 1993, unchanged on last year's total. 'A significant number could have been handled in a better way and have survived,' Mr Hughes said. He called for the introduction of a Companies' Charter which would help to prevent worthwhile businesses collapsing and reduce bureaucracy associated with existing procedures. He said company voluntary arrangements should be amended to enable companies to achieve a court-ordered 'stay of execution' from dis-affected creditors to give management time to propose a rescue plan. He said administration orders, introduced in 1986, were normally considered 'receivership by another name'. They were seen as too tortuous and expensive, and there were few success stories where they had worked effectively. The calls echo appeals made for more than two years by the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, the main trade body, which have gone largely unheeded by the Department of Trade and Industry. The DTI said yesterday that ministers kept legislation under review but had no plans to introduce new insolvency laws. The department said it would be examining company voluntary arrangements as part of a scrutiny of company law announced last November. Observer, Page 19</p>

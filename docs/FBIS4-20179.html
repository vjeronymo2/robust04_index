			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Ertugrul Ozkok: "Help Me Resolve the Cyprus </F> Problem"--punctuation as published]    [Text] Prime Minister Ciller will deliver a very important  speech during the meeting the True Path Party [TPP]  parliamentary group will hold tomorrow. During the speech, she  will detail for the first time her clear and resolute approach  to a solution of the Cyprus problem.    Some 48 hours before her historic speech to the TPP  parliamentary group, Ciller made a statement that may have a  bearing on the meeting the parliament will hold on the Cyprus  problem. Ciller expressed her views as directly as possible:  "Several circles are making charges about the Cyprus problem.  However, that is a wrong approach."    She then continued with her important remarks.  <H5>  Heroic Statements </H5>   "We have had to deal with that problem for 20 years. It has  confronted us as an obstacle everywhere and at every  opportunity. Turkey is the country that has suffered most from  the state of no solution."    Ciller said that she is determined to solve the problem. In  fact, she said so in a very clear way: "I am determined to move  toward a solution. I shall outline all that when I address the  parliament on Tuesday."    In her following statement, Ciller seemed to declare war on  everyone who has obstructed a solution to the problem. She  said: "I have studied past developments. Someone always did  something to obstruct a solution to the problem when a  settlement was close. Claims are being made that I promised  Clinton that I would make a concession. I have not bargained  with Clinton on anything. I have not made a concession in  return for an economic aid package."    Ciller made a prediction on the parliament's meeting  tomorrow. She said: "I am aware that they [the deputies] will  make heroic speeches tomorrow. However, I am determined this  time."    What does the Foreign Ministry contemplate on the matter?  Ciller said that she had a telephone conversation with Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin yesterday morning. The parliament's  meeting tomorrow was the only subject they discussed.  <H5>  The Foreign Ministry Convinced Me </H5>   What is Hikmet Cetin's opinion on the matter? Prime Minister  Ciller said: "I explained all that to Hikmet Cetin in the  morning. He maintained similar views. In fact, the Foreign  Ministry has convinced me. I held talks with Ambassador Inal  Batu in New York and Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir in Washington.  That is how I made up my mind. On no other matter have I  agreed with the Foreign Ministry as much as I have agreed with  it on this problem."    Ciller appealed to the people for a solution to the Cyprus  problem. She also gave a guarantee. She said: "Come, let us  resolve that problem. Let us remove the great obstacle against  Turkey. Turkey is the country that stands to gain most from the  solution to that problem. The solution of the Cyprus problem is  in the interest of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots. As the  prime minister, I promise that I will safeguard the rights of  the Turkish Cypriots."    Concluding, Ciller reiterated: "We are closer to a solution  than we have ever been before. It will be a pity if we waste  that opportunity and fail to resolve the problem. In view of  that, I appeal for the support of the people and the parliament."    Ciller is the fifth prime minister I have talked with on the  Cyprus problem since I have been a journalist. It was the first  time I observed a Turkish prime minister maintain such a  determined approach on the Cyprus problem.    Former President Turgut Ozal expressed similar views in the  past. However, his comments were made off the record. His views  on the solution of the Cyprus problem were almost similar. He  stressed that there was a good opportunity for the settlement of  the problem after the Gulf War.  <H5>  The No-Solution Lobby </H5>   However, Ozal was confronted with a very strong opposition.  Everyone is aware of the existence of an "antisolution" lobby in  Turkey. In view of that, I believe that Ciller's speech will be  confronted with a strong resistance in the parliament tomorrow.    However, the initiation for a realistic and calm process to  achieve a solution to the Cyprus problem will be useful. It is  common knowledge that Turkey is frequently confronted with that  problem. So, Turkey has to make a realistic assessment of  several of its problems. The Cyprus problem has become a  serious factor that obstructs Turkey's important foreign  relations and its effort to integrate with Europe.    Meanwhile, the effects of the developments in southeastern  Turkey on the significant economic crisis in the country must  not be underestimated.    Bringing all this to light may be embarrassing to many  officials. We may even say that we are prepared to give up many  things just for the sake of maintaining these problems.  <H5>  I Support Ciller </H5>   However, we are living in a realistic world. We have  observed the effects of the economic crisis on our daily lives.  Many of us may not be able to visualize the cost we may have to  pay in the near future. Nevertheless, the social wounds and  problems that will be created when thousands of people lose  their jobs have to be considered beforehand. In view of that, I  support Prime Minister Ciller's determination to solve the  Cyprus problem. Although I have criticized her on many other  issues, I wish to clearly stress that I agree with her on that  problem.</p>

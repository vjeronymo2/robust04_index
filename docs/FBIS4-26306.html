			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Vice Foreign Affairs  Minister Chen Hsi-fan said on Monday (920 June] that the  government has informed Washington about its intention to change  the name of its representative office in the United States, but  that the U.S. side so far has not replied concretely to Taipei's  proposal.    Chen made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan joint committee  meeting when Democratic Progressive Party legislator Hsu [words  indistinct] questioned him on the designation of the office --  currently the Coordination Council for North American Affairs,  or CCNAA -- while they were discussing Taiwan's plans to sign a  copyright agreement with the United States through the office.  Chen said the government has proposed that the name of the  office be changed to the "Taipei Representative Office," but Hsu  said "Taiwan Representative Office" would be a more appropriate  name.    Citing Taiwan's representative offices in Japan and Britain,  both of which use "Taipei Representative Office," Chen said it  would be easier to obtain U.S. approval to use "Taipei  Representative Office" because of the lack of formal relations  between the two countries. As Taipei is the capital of the  Republic of China [ROC], it is logical to use "Taipei" to  designate the nation's representative offices overseas, Chen  noted.</p>

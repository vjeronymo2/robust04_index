			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Celso Pinto from Sao Paulo] </F>   [Text] Brazil currently has a record level of foreign  reserves and one of the most generous trade surpluses in the  world. This solid foreign trade front faces, however, two  problems that might complicate the situation.    Nearly two-thirds of foreign exchange reserves today consist  of short-term commercial loans that are renewable every six  months. Furthermore, there has been a heavy rush to collect  export revenues in advance and to delay import-related debts.  This has resulted in a significant gap between accounts  concerning actual shipments of merchandise and financial  accounts.    The actual foreign trade balance should stand at $4.9  billion  by the end of May. Foreign trade balance figures, however, are  expected to reach $13 billion. The $8.1 billion difference  comprises commercial loans to finance imports and export  revenues collected in advance.    In other words, because there has been such a major increase  in this financing, the figures include a great deal of exports  that will not bring revenues in the next few months and imports  that will have to be paid for later. As it is unlikely that  commercial loans will continue to grow at the same pace as they  have since the last quarter of 1993, the reserves will drop even  if the level of the trade balance is maintained, which is  unlikely if a fixed exchange rate is established upon the  implementation of the real in July.    All these figures and analyses were supplied by economist  Fernando Montero of the MB Associates consulting firm. His  conclusion is not catastrophic, but it serves as a warning.    Irrespective of the political situation, foreign currency  reserves will decelerate during the second half of 1994 because  of the financial advances already reflected in the trade  balance. Montero estimates that reserves currently stand at $40  billion -- an all time record.    The other possible conclusion is more delicate. If Montero's  figures are correct, short-term commercial loans today total $27  billion; that is, they account for two-thirds of the foreign  currency reserves. These loans are renewable every six months  and are obviously sensitive to the degree to which the country  is trustworthy. If the presidential succession raises serious  distrust regarding the debt issue, these loans could rapidly  decline as happened in the past.    Montero notes that the latest report released by the Central  Bank (BC) on short-term commercial debt is dated March 1992.  This report officially estimates that the short-term commercial  debt would total $15.7 billion by December 1992. According to  BC figures, short-term loans increased by $5.4 billion in 1992.    This figure is quite close to Montero's estimate of $5.2  billion for 1992. Comparing the trade balance figure with the  total amount of foreign currency used in foreign trade  operations, the difference should account for foreign financing  of foreign trade.    These short-term commercial loans have increased  substantially since 1991, but the largest increases began in  October 1993. Exporters have good reasons for wanting to  collect their revenues in advance, while importers seek to  finance their costs.    Montero cites three of these reasons: First, the sudden  increase in real domestic interest rates. This has made it very  advantageous to transform dollars into cruzeiros and to invest  them on the financial market. More recently, another reason is  the fear of a delay in correcting the exchange rate if, as  expected, the government decides to fix the exchange rate for  three or four months after the implementation of the real, or  for as long as there is residual inflation.    The third reason suggested by Montero is the restriction  imposed last year on foreign investment in fixed-term  certificates in Brazil through the so-called Annex 4. As a  result of this, banks have had greater levels of funds available  to finance foreign trade. Moreover, it is obvious that the  international banks had the funds available and were interested  in granting commercial loans to Brazil. This can be explained  by the large profitability and guarantees offered by these loans.    Montero's figures show there has been an increase of nearly  $16 billion in the volume of short-term commercial loans since  the end of 1991. This explains roughly two-thirds of the  increase in foreign reserves during that same period. Montero  believes the net balance of financial investment within the  framework of the exchange operations market has been relatively  small since 1991: $200 million in 1992; $1.3 billion last year;  and $600 million from January to May. This falls short of  explaining the sudden increase in foreign reserves, even if we  consider financial investments and the trade balance separately.    The difference between the overall commercial exchange  operations and the effective trade balance (shipments) totalled  $4.1 billion in 1991; $5.2 billion in 1992; and a surprisingly  high $8.1 billion from January to May of this year.    It is very probable that the enormous volume of export  revenues collected in advance will begin to decrease as of July.  Changes in the amount and type of commercial loans to be  granted will depend on several factors.    Before the debt crisis, the volume of short-term commercial  loans totalled nearly $15 billion. By the time the creditor  banks' obligation to maintain these credit lines ended as a  result of the old "Project 3," which was part of the  negotiations held with the banks, this volume had decreased by a  little more than 50 percent.    The recovery of the country's credibility in the  international financial community and the extremely high  profitability of these operations since then has prompted the  international banks to resume granting short-term commercial  loans. These loans will continue to be granted for as long as  the international financial market trusts Brazil. The fact that  they are renewable after an extremely short term, however, makes  the situation rather vulnerable to substantial changes in the  market evaluation of the risks involved in investing in Brazil.</p>

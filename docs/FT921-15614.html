			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iraq-UN talks depress oil price OIL PRICES tumbled yesterday to the lowest levels since the end of the Gulf war last February as traders reacted to the prospect of the return of Iraqi oil to the market. The price of North Sea Brent crude for February delivery fell Dollars 1.12 1/2 to Dollars 17.05 a barrel. An Iraqi delegation met officials from the United Nations yesterday in Vienna for the first of two days of talks on a resumption of Iraqi exports, which up to now has been blocked by a UN embargo. The talks, which have been described as 'constructive' by a UN official, are seeking a compromise under which Iraq could export Dollars 1.6bn-worth of oil to raise cash for humanitarian purposes. On Monday President George Bush was rumoured to have relaxed conditions attached to the sale. The possibility of an Iraqi return to the international market has further depressed an already weak market. Prices have declined by almost Dollars 6 a barrel in the past six weeks as winter weather in the west has remained unusually mild. Gas oil, the traditional European heating oil, slipped by Dollars 10 a tonne yesterday to Dollars 156 a tonne. Companies and consumers had built stocks in anticipation of a harsh winter and a rapid decline in deliveries from the former Soviet Union, neither of which materialised. The collapse in oil prices has prompted calls from some smaller producers in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for an emergency meeting to cut production. Opec members have been producing flat-out to compensate for the absence of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. In an interview with a government newspaper yesterday, Mr Osama al-Hiti, Iraq's oil minister, accused Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of flooding the market to keep prices low 'in service to the US economy'.</p>

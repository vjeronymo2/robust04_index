			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By guest reporter Hua Juxian and staff reporter Jing Wei: </F> "Agriculture Grows in Ethnic Areas"]    [Text] China's five provincial-level minority nationality  autonomous regions (the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, the  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous  Region, the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous Region) cover 44 percent of China's total territory.  In addition, Qinghai, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces are also  inhabited by a large number of ethnic groups.    Following on the heels of a sustained growth in agricultural  production since 1992, the eight provinces and autonomous  regions reaped another good harvest in 1993.  <H5>  Achievements </H5>   The Tibet Autonomous Region, located on the "Roof of the  World", registered a bumper harvest for the sixth successive  year. The region's total grain output last year hit a historic  high of 620,000 tons, quadrupling the figure for 1952 following  the peaceful liberation of Tibet.    In 1993, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recorded its  15th successive bumper harvest. The region's total grain output  equalled the 1992 level of 7.02 million tons, even though the  acreage planted to grain was reduced by more than 60,000  hectares. The output of cotton reached 750,000 tons, up 7  percent over 1992, while grape output rose to 270,000 tons, up  20 percent.    In the not too distant past, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous  Region needed to ship in 1 million tons of grain from other  parts of the country annually. However, over the past five  years, strengthened capital construction enabled local  agricultural production to experience an average annual growth  of 12 percent, thus ensuring self-sufficiency for the region's  grain consumption. In 1993, the region reaped a total grain  output of 11 million tons, a record high.    The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's grain output reached  2.03  million tons in 1993, an increase of 9.3 percent over 1992.    Guizhou Province notched an all-round increase in  agricultural production in 1993, with total grain output hitting  8.65 million tons, up 11.89 percent over 1992. The province  also achieved great progress in the production of cured tobacco,  sugarcane, tea, meat, eggs and milk.    Qinghai, which is located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is  home to a large number of ethnic groups, including Mongolian,  Tibetan, Hui and Kazakh nationalities. The province is also one  of China's major animal husbandry bases. In 1993, despite heavy  snowstorms which killed 13.4 million head of livestock, the  province, thanks to the timely action of the local-government  and masses, still set new records in the rate of slaughtered  domestic animals, the rate of domestic animals sold as  commodities and the output of meat, milk and hides. This  indicates that the province has already extricated itself from  the plight of relying on the heavens for animal husbandry  production.    Summer grain output in Guangxi jumped by 6.1 percent and  the region's total agricultural output value for last year rose  by 9.4 percent, mirroring simultaneous increases in the  production of grain and cash crops.    The development of agriculture and animal husbandry in  ethnic  regions has resulted in remarkable increases in the incomes of  local farmers and herdsmen. The 1993 per-capita income for  rural and pastoral residents in Xinjiang averaged 780 yuan, up  5.4 percent over 1992; per-capita income for rural residents in  Guangxi reached 860 yuan, showing a growth rate equaling the  nation's average; per- capita income for rural and pastoral  residents in Tibet averaged 515 yuan, up 5.1 percent over 1992;  and the 1992 per-capita income for poverty-stricken mountainous  areas in south Ningxia registered a 200 percent increase over  1982.  <H5>  Reasons for Development </H5>   The successive years of bumper harvests in China's ethnic  areas should be attributed to local government concerted efforts  to place priority on agriculture and animal husbandry and their  introduction of a series of effective measures.    Increased capital input. Yunnan Province, where a  large number of China's minority nationalities live in compact  communities, has for many years led the country in agricultural  capital inputs. In 1992, funds invested in agriculture reached  2.64 billion yuan, or 21.7 percent of the province's total  annual expenditures. In 1993, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region  allocated 21 million yuan to the project to realign the Yellow  River irrigation network. Over the past five years, the Inner  Mongolian Autonomous Region has invested 2.04 billion yuan in  capital construction for agriculture and animal husbandry, an  increase of 81.4 percent over the previous five-year period.    Expanding capital construction. Over the past  three years, Guizhou as transformed 80,000 hectares of low and  medium-yield land, and set up a group of forestry centers and  animal husbandry bases which have provided strong support for  the all-round development of agriculture. Last year, completion  of the first phase of the comprehensive development project on  the Great Bend of the Yellow River helped to increase local  irrigated areas in Ningxia by 5,000 hectares and improved over  70,000 hectares of irrigated land. Inner Mongolia has achieved  remarkable progress in establishing grazing lands and commodity  grain bases. And, by the end of 1993, the region had completed  the construction of 247 agricultural development projects and  commodity grain bases. Over the past two years, the Tibet  Autonomous Region has transformed 3,200 hectares of low and  medium-yield land, afforested 1,000 hectares, and expanded and  improved more than 4,000 hectares of irrigated land in the  Painbo and Namling agricultural development areas.    Popularizing science and technology. As part of  an effort to transform traditional farming into a modern  agriculture, local governments in minority regions have offered  practical technical education to local farmers and herdsmen.  The effort has helped train a large number of qualified  agrotechnicians and establish a widespread science and  technology promotion network in each locality. Beginning in  1992, some 500,000 farmers in Guangxi studied from one to two  applied technologies each year, with 5,000 being selected for  further education. While establishing a four- layer technology  promotion network covering the region and all counties,  townships and villages, Ningxia provided 650,000 farmers with  training, helping them master two to three applied technologies.  Xinjiang has also recorded remarkable progress in training  agrotechnicians and, by the end of 1992, some 14,000 farmers and  herdsmen had been awarded certificates as agrotechnicians. They  have played an important role in the application and  popularization of advanced techniques.    Since 1988, in accordance with conditions, Tibet, a vast  sparsely populated and undeveloped area, has devoted great  effort to promote the Harvest Program which stresses the use of  various agricultural technologies for yielding bumper harvests.  By the end of 1993, some 682 projects covering 4.8 million  hectares had been established according to plan. In addition,  scientific and technological demonstration and popularization  plans had been implemented in over half of the region's  counties. These counties, which embrace all the ecological  areas in the region, make up two-thirds of the region's  agricultural and combined agricultural and pastoral counties and  cover more than 80 percent of the region's total cultivated  land. They have experienced the most rapid agricultural  development and the largest percentage increase in grain  production.</p>

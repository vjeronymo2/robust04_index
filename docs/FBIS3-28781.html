"I don't  consider measures to that point (are necessary) yet," Hosokawa  told reporters before leaving for summit talks in the United  States.    While signaling that the North Korean nuclear crisis will  figure high on the agenda in Friday's talks with U.S. President  Bill Clinton in Washington, Hosokawa reiterated that Tokyo  counts on Chinese cooperation in efforts to convince Pyongyang  to reach a compromise.    "We are joining forces with the United Nations and the  permanent members (of the UN Security Council), and would also  like to enlist China's cooperation," he said. He said he  conveyed this request to Chinese President Jiang Zemin during  the summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Seattle in November.    Asked for comment on Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa's  remarks alleging North Korea has already been armed with nuclear  weapons, Hosokawa said this does not reflect the government's  stance. "We don't have such reports on hand," he said.    Earlier in the day, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura also said Japan is not considering economic sanctions  against North Korea. "We are not in a situation to do so," the  top government spokesman said at a news conference.    Takemura said Tokyo will continue its diplomatic efforts to  help the negotiations go smoothly.    The YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported Thursday that Japan, the United  States and South Korea have agreed that UN economic sanctions  would be inevitable if Pyongyang continues to block  international inspections of its nuclear facilities. The daily  reported that the three countries reached the accord in early  February at a trilateral working-level meeting in New York.    It also said Tokyo will start preparing for sanctions, such  as limiting trade with Pyongyang and halting currency  remittances by North Korean residents of Japan.    Talks between North Korea and the International Atomic  Energy  Agency (IAEA), the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog,  have been stalemated over Pyongyang's rejection of iaea special  inspections. The IAEA is expected to refer the matter to the UN  Security Council later this month.    Japan's exports to North Korea amounted to some 28.2 billion  yen in 1992 and imports from that country totaled 32.6 billion  yen, according to Japanese Government figures.</p>

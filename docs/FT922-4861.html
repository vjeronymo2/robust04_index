			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Bonn seeks big savings in state health costs THE German government is planning to save DM11bn (Pounds 3.7bn) a year in the state-subsidised health care system, at the expense of patients, doctors, and the drug industry. The state subsidy has risen from DM5.5bn in 1991 to Dm10bn in the current year. The German drugs market is the world's third largest after the US and Japan, worth about Pounds 6.4bn a year, according to Glaxo, the UK group. Under the plan, patients will pay much more for medicines; pharmaceutical prices will be cut by 5 per cent from next January - based on prices frozen at the level of May 1, 1992; basic daily contributions for hospital care will rise from DM10 to DM11; and the quantity of medicines doctors may prescribe will be curbed. Another proposal in the package, agreed by all three parties in the government coalition yesterday, would limit the number of doctors eligible to join state-funded health schemes. The plan immediately ran into strong criticism from doctors and the opposition Social Democrats. Mr Klaus Kirschner, the latters' health spokesman, said patients were again being asked to pay for failed health service reforms introduced in 1988. He said the increased prescription charges (requiring patients to pay 10 per cent of the cost of each medicine, from a minimum charge of DM3 to a maximum DM10) was a 'flagrant breach of faith' by the coalition partners. Most pharmaceuticals companies said they were waiting for full details of the proposals to be published. They expect a reference pricing system for asthma and ulcer drugs to be introduced imminently. The scheme would fix drug prices, and if companies want to charge more, the difference would be paid by the patient. Astra of Sweden and Glaxo of the UK are most likely to be affected. The pharmaceutical companies are being asked to contribute a 'solidarity payment' by accepting the 5 per cent price cut until the end of 1994. The total package is intended to save DM8bn on the side of the pharmaceutical industry, the doctors and hospitals, with a DM3bn contribution from patients in the form of increased payments. Charges will be lower in east Germany than in the wealthy west.</p>

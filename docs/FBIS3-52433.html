These regimes had either not repaid their debts  to Iraq prior to the 30-state aggression or haveseized this  money along with interest.    A responsible source at the Finance Ministry told this to  INA  last night, pointing out that the amounts some regimes owe Iraq  are broken down as follows: [figures given are in millions of  dollars]    Country       Loan       Oil         Profits     Iraqi        Total                debts      exports     held at     banking      amounts due                                       Arab        system                                       firms       deposits   1.

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei climbs to year's high on economic hopes THE NIKKEI average closed at the year's high after senior Liberal Democratic party members called for a stimulus package larger than last August's emergency measures, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 205.07 at 18,173.37, helped by a rise in the futures market. The index fell to the day's low of 17,953.45 in the morning and hit the day's peak of 18,242.70 just before the close. Volume was almost unchanged at 350m shares, against 345m, and advancing stocks led losers by 757 to 257, with 137 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks climbed 20.94 to 1,365.65, reflecting broad-based buying, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 3.72 at 1,094.42. Institutional investors bought large-capital shares which had lost ground on profit-taking on Tuesday. Traders said the yen's rise against the dollar had also encouraged buying in shipbuilding issues, steels and power utilities. An improvement in the futures market also brought in arbitrage buying, while individual investors traded speculative stocks. Nippon Steel was the day's most active issue, rising Y7 to Y320, while Tokyo Electric Power moved ahead Y70 to Y2,800. Reports that leading brokers will see better profits for the current year to March, boosted by the recent market rally, left securities houses up 4.3 per cent on the day. Nomura Securities was the second most active stock, appreciating Y90 to Y1,740, while Nikko Securities advanced Y76 to Y790 and Wako Securities Y54 to Y494. Telecom-related issues continued to rise on strength in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which finished Y10,000 higher at Y812,000. Nippon Comsys, a telecom engineering company, was Y36 stronger at Y913. Fujisawa Pharmaceutical gained Y27 at Y958 on buying by short term speculators. The stock has risen by 21 per cent since the start of the month on an approval recommendation for its immuno-suppressant drug by a Health Ministry committee. Sugar refiners were firmer on a rise in domestic and overseas sugar futures markets following reports of damaged crops in Cuba, the world's largest sugar exporter. Mitsui Sugar put on Y4 at Y432 and Nippon Beet Sugar Y6 at Y548. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 127.40 to 19,119.83 in volume of 46.3m shares. Roundup MARKETS IN the region were generally stronger, while Hong Kong remained resilient. HONG KONG recovered most of the day's losses after shedding some 219 points initially as investors reacted to comments from Beijing, further attacking the democratic reform proposals of Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor. The Hang Seng index finished a net 21.71 down at 5,958.33 in turnover of HKDollars 4.1bn. Some observers commented that certain proposals put forward by the Chinese authorities were not as worrying as had been expected. Jardine Matheson group subsidiaries began to report, with Jardine International Motor Holdings showing a sharp rise in earnings, although the latter slipped 25 cents to HKDollars 6.55. AUSTRALIA ended at a nine-month high as investors remained optimistic that there would be a cut in interest rates. The All Ordinaries index added 16.3 at 1,675.6, its best close since June 4 last year. Volume came to 238.1m shares worth ADollars 499.6m, with rises exceeding falls by five-to-three. Among the banks, Commonwealth rose 7 cents to ADollars 7.95, NAB moved forward 17 cents to ADollars 8.78 and ANZ climbed 10 cents to ADollars 3.44. NEW ZEALAND continued to feature Telecom, which closed at another record high, up a cent at NZDollars 2.86, as the NZSE-40 index advanced 5.79 to 1,590.48 in turnover of NZDollars 30m. SEOUL more than regained Tuesday's losses, responding to an improvement in relations between North and South Korea. The composite index rebounded 25.18 to 663.05, while volume was 37.35m shares valued at Won483.2bn. SINGAPORE was stronger but lost some of its gain late in the session on profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrial index put on 13.28 at 1,662.63 in volume of 127m shares.</p>

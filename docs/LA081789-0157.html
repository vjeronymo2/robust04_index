			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: WHERE IT'S CHRISTMAS EVERY DAY  </P> <P> Just when I thought it was safe to leave the house again, some nuts in West  Germany want to observe Christmas twice a year.  </P> <P> You can almost guess where they're coming from. They're all members of a Father  Christmas Union who say they can't make a living "coming to town" only once a  year. They marched on Hamburg recently, demanding that a second Christmas be  celebrated July 24 so they can earn more money.  </P> <P> As I told my son when he won a pool at the office by picking more Academy Award  winners than anyone else, "Don't get your hopes up, kid, it's seasonal work."  </P> <P> I know people out there who at this moment have their Christmas cards bought,  gifts squirreled away, and fruitcakes soaking up booze faster than George  Hamilton soaks up the sun. I am happy to say I don't know them well. Maybe some  people can get their acts together in seven months, but I'm on a different  timetable.  </P> <P> From Dec. 26 to Jan. 15, I buy at half-price my wrapping paper, ribbon and  Christmas cards to store away in a "safe" place where I will never find them  again.  </P> <P> Beginning Jan. 20 through Feb. 1, I return Christmas gifts to stores whose  salespeople acknowledge only that it is their box but have never seen the  merchandise in their entire 30 years at the store.  </P> <P> March 3 through the 25th, I take down the last of the Christmas decorations  outside. From April through May, I accept catalogue merchandise on back order  and that I no longer need, having replaced them with other gifts following Dec.  23 panic. I bundle up and return merchandise to catalogue companies for credit.  </P> <P> May 25 to June 15 is major decisions time. Do I toss out fruitcakes I received  as gifts or use them to build a gazebo? Do I toss out Christmas cards or save  them until someone comes up with an idea of what to do with them? Do I freeze  the remaining candy I got for Christmas or polish off the two pieces left and  pitch the box?  </P> <P> June 23: Make final payments on charges for Christmas purchases.  </P> <P> June 24: Turn on television and see Santa Claus ho ho-ing there are only 30  days left before July Christmas.  </P> <P> June 24: Check warranty on TV set to see if it is covered for owner's foot  accidentally kicking in the screen.  </P> <P> The idea of two Christmases will never fly. If it had a chance, merchants would  have put a second one into motion years ago. Proponents seem to have forgotten  we need permission from a higher authority. After all, whose birthday is it,  anyway?  </P></p>

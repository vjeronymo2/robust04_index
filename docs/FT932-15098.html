			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Arts: Order and chaos in Arcadia - Theatre With the possible exception of Michael Frayn, Tom Stoppard has long been the wittiest of contemporary British playwrights and one of the longest running. His Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead opened at the National Theatre over 25 years ago and has been an international success ever since. Of the British dramatists who came to the fore in the early 1960s, only Harold Pinter has kept up with him in terms of reputation. Stoppard can cope with a complex brief, like the moral philosophy in Jumpers, which was reviewed in the Sunday Times not only by the theatre critic but also by the philosopher A J Ayer. It has been said that he regards writing a play as an examination: 'He spends ages on research, does all the necessary cramming, reads all the relevant books, and then gestates the results. Once he's passed the exam - with the public and the critics - he forgets all about it and moves on to the next subject.' In Arcadia, his subject is higher mathematics, not forgetting his work on physics in Hapgood. The production, directed by Trevor Nunn, is faultless. The lighting by Paul Pyant is immaculate. There is nothing much wrong with the acting, but I wish I could say more for the play. Stoppard has always written about the contradictions and apparent similarities between order and chaos. Here he takes on too much, some of which is not remotely theatrical. There is the love life of Lord Byron and landscape gardening. The presentation of non-linear mathematics will seem self-evident to anyone who tries, however distantly, to follow economics. Others will find it distracting in a play that wanders between the early 19th century and the present. Nothing is proved; not much happens. Kenneth Tynan suggested a rule about Stoppard is that 'the shorter the play, the harder it is to summarise the plot without sounding unhinged'. Arcadia defies the Tynan dictum. It runs for over three hours, yet the plot is unclear. No-one knows who made love to whom, nor is there any reason to care. Byron never appears. Instead there is a minor poet called Chater who does not look or sound like a poet at all. There is also a landscape architect named Noakes who, played by Sidney Livingstone, might develop into an interesting character if allowed to do so. Stoppard cuts him off. That is the 19th century bit. The modern bit is - to use a Stoppard word - no less a travesty. There is a don called Bernard Nightingale (played by Bill Nighy) who no more resembles a scholar than Chater resembles a poet. The name, so similar to that of the chief theatre critic of The Times, may be a private joke by Stoppard. It is not very funny. Bernard Nightingale is one of the weakest parts. Benedict Nightingale would have written the lines much better. There is also Felicity Kendal who is a very good actress. She plays an author who has written about Byron. Why she is so cold to those about her is left, like so much else, uncertain. Possibly this is the cooling theory of the universe. The paradox is that some of the lines and situations are very good, but none of them comes from Stoppard's erudition. Most belong to Ms Kendal, such as her response to the gardener advising her to advertise for a hermit to put in his hermitage in the newspaper: 'But surely a hermit who takes a newspaper ..?' This is the Stoppard of old, and there is not enough of it. Still, do not be deterred. Here we have the National Theatre trying to be witty and serious at the same time and an audience willing it to succeed. It's a near miss. Tynan would have cut it. He wrote that 10 days before first night Jumpers was running close to four hours. Told by Lawrence Olivier that Stoppard would object, Tynan as dramaturge imposed the cuts unilaterally: no-one demurred and it became a much better play. Lyttelton Theatre.

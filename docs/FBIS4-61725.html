			<p>BFN     [Text] In Sevastopol, veterans are celebrating the 50th  anniversary of the city's liberation on 9 May 1944. The streets  and squares of this hero city have not seen for a long time such  an enormous mass of people as that which gathered this morning.  It was exactly half a century ago that the city was liberated  from the fascists. Over 1,000 war veterans arrived for the  celebrations. They laid flowers and wreaths at the fraternal  graves and observed a minute of silence in honor of the dead.    At a requiem rally held on Nakhimov Square by the memorial  to  the heroic defenders of the city, greetings telegrams from the  presidents of Ukraine and Russia were read.    The gathering greeted Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and  Sevastopol City Chairman Viktor Semenov.</p>

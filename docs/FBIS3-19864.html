			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Jean-Louis Dutaret, president of </F> Sofirad, by Anne Brucy and Roland Mihail; from the "Radio-Com"  program -- live]    [Excerpts] [Brucy] Sunday [20 March] will be World  Francophone Day. Today we have the opportunity to assess  France's external audiovisual action and the activities of  Sofirad [Broadcasting Holding Company] with its new president  Jean-Louis Dutaret, who was appointed in January. The issue of  France's foreign audiovisual policy is a complicated one even if  it is not a new one for you, since you were an international  lawyer before becoming adviser to Communications Minister Alain  Carignon. Sofirad is a holding company managing the  government's shares in some 20 companies, among them radio and  television stations. To name a few, for instance: Canal France  International [CFI], a program data bank broadcast throughout  the world by satellite; TV-5 Europe, a French-language  television channel; Canal Horizons, a network of pay TV  channels; Afrique No. 1; Radio Monte Carlo Middle East; and  Radio Monte Carlo for radios [as heard]. [passage omitted]    We will now turn our attention toward external audiovisual  policy. As we said earlier, you are managing the state's  interests in several television channels, and you are talking of  CFI as the spearhead. Will the strengthening of CFI run against  the interests of others such as the French-language channel TV-5?    [Dutaret] I can only express my personal feeling. I am not  here to represent the government.    [Brucy] However, you are representing Sofirad. You are the  president of Sofirad.    [Dutaret] Sofirad is an extraordinary tool not known to the  public. Thanks to Sofirad there is worldwide coverage -- I will  answer your question concerning CFI very soon -- I would like to  recall that 33 million people throughout the world listen to  three Sofirad radio stations, 33 million -- as against 11  million for RFI [Radio France International]. I will not  compare costs since I do not want to be nasty. However, it must  be said, we hear a great deal about RFI and we never hear  anything about Sofirad, with 33 million listeners. Thanks to  Sofirad France is behind the BBC and the Voice of America and  ahead of the Voice of Germany [as heard]. This must be said.  CFI is a great tool enabling all African national television  channels to exist. If CFI did not offer programs -- I say offer  -- to most African television channels and to many other  television channels, these countries would not have television  channels worthy of the name, and if there are television  channels worthy of the name it is thanks to French products  which are distributed by CFI. TV-5 too...    [Brucy, interrupting] It is very similar.    [Dutaret] Not at all. TV-5 is a French-language channel with  60 percent French programs, but with Canadian, Belgian, and  Swiss programs too. It is a genuine French-language channel. I  believe France must have what is called in our jargon sovereign  action. It is normal for France to broadcast the image of  France. This image of France is best broadcast through CFI.    [Mihail] The image or the voice of France? Or, even  possibly, the voice of the French Government?    [Dutaret] No, but why not the voice of France? We are the  only ones to be ashamed of that. There is the Voice of America,  the Voice of Germany [as heard]. Why can't we speak of the  Voice of France? We are neither living in a Cold War situation  nor in a colonial situation. There is no shame in wanting to  broadcast the voice and the image of France.    [Brucy] Speaking of voice, you mentioned RFI earlier. It  must be said that this station does not belong to the Sofirad  network. Do you believe that there is a situation of wasteful  competition and that RFI and the radio activities of Sofirad  should be better coordinated?    [Dutaret] Yes, yes. The mission of Sofirad is not to  broadcast worldwide. It mainly broadcasts to Maghreb countries,  to West Africa, and to the Middle East in local languages.    [Mihail] Precisely, what is the best choice? To target the  whole world to reach, for instance, farmers in Malaysia or  shepherds in Afghanistan who might not even possess a radio set,  or to concentrate on mainly French-speaking zones such as  Africa, the Maghreb, or Latin America?    [Dutaret] The mission of Sofirad is to expand and to target  traditional zones of French influence. I never believed that a  Thai farmer would suddenly tune in to RFI at 1500 to listen to a  program in Thai while he can receive 50 Thai stations.    [Brucy] So what should be done?    [Dutaret] RFI should broadcast in French. People listen to  RFI to hear French.    [Brucy] Therefore no more RFI programs in foreign languages?    [Dutaret] If you want, but mostly in French. Listeners tune  in to hear French.    [Mihail] How should this issue be coordinated? Do you see a  role for France Television, together with Sofirad, to play an  additional role so as to rationalize the activities of all  existing bodies on this issue? There are six ministries  concerned.    [Dutaret] France Television is already playing a role in  Sofirad since one of its main announcers has been a member of  the Sofirad board since last Monday.    [Brucy] He is Jean-Marie Cavada, he should be named.    [Dutaret] Therefore France Television is represented on the  board. I do not believe anything more is necessary. If you  consider the case of CFI, it must sell French programs, all of  them, programs from public and private channels. One channel  cannot be given preferential treatment.    [Mihail] A last question: don't you think it rather  unhealthy  to be both president of Sofirad and at the same time personal  adviser to Communications Minister Carignon? Don't you believe  that this represents the voice of France too?    [Dutaret] Do I look unhealthy? No, I am simply Alain  Carignon's friendly adviser. This enables me to be very busy,  to get up very early, as early as you do yourself, Roland.    [Brucy] Jean-Louis Dutaret, thank you.</p>

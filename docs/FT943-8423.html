			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Pifco considers enfranchising A shares in expansion plans Pifco Holdings, the household appliances manufacturer, yesterday indicated the possible enfranchisement of its 6.92m A shares with the resultant loss of family control, in place since the company's creation at the turn of the century. The move was announced as the Manchester-based company reported increased pre-tax profits, earnings per share and dividend for the year to end-April. The shares rose 10p to 358p. Mr Michael Webber, chairman and a relative of the company's founder, said the A shares, at present entitled to one quarter of a vote, would be enfranchised at the same time as a rights issue to fund an acquisition. He said yesterday that the company was continuing its search for expansion in mainland Europe and that an acquisition was 'in the works'. The company was in discussion with a number of European-based groups. The company, best known for its Russell Hobbs, Carmen and Tower household products, lifted profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 2.65m (Pounds 2.2m) on turnover marginally lower at Pounds 36.8m (Pounds 37.4m). Operating margins rose from 5.5 per cent to 6.8 per cent. Earnings per share were 20 per cent higher at 15.4p (12.8p). The dividend is raised by 9 per cent to 4.5p (4.13p), with a recommended final of 2.6p, increasing cover from 3.1 to 3.4 times. Mr Webber said that the improvement reflected increased efficiency and profitability at the Russell Hobbs Tower division and general cost control throughout the group. He added, however, that the brands had experienced a mixed year. Tower showed 'some good recovery from a small base' while Russell Hobbs had a 'bad first quarter but a better second' and the improvement had continued into 1994-95. Overall group sales for the first quarter of the current year showed an encouraging improvement, Mr Webber said, and the forward order book reflected a better trend. He warned, however, that as the group sought increased volume margins may come under pressure but he expected 'profits to increase as a result of the more focused approach to the market place'.</p>

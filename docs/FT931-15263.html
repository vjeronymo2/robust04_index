			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / W German growth rate falls to 0.8% WEST Germany's growth rate is continuing to fall rapidly after hitting a 10-year low in 1992, according to the Bonn economics ministry. Figures released yesterday by the federal statistics offices showed gross national product rose only 0.8 per cent last year, after a 3.6 per cent increase in 1991. This was the worst result since 1982, when the economy shrank by more than 1 per cent. A senior finance ministry official said negative growth this year could no longer be ruled out, while the economics ministry said the faster slowdown in the final quarter of 1992 would be a 'burden' on future prospects. Despite forecasts of up to 1 per cent contraction this year, the government remains confident the economy does not face a period of extended recession. Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the finance ministry, said yesterday he did not expect a 'cumulative decline.' Conditions for recovery were good, he claimed: the banks were strong, and in contrast to other industrial economies, savings and investment were high and the infrastructure was intact, he told a financiers' meeting. Mr Wolfgang Strohm, a senior government statistician, said the economy probably contracted 'modestly' in the last quarter of 1992. Full details will not be available until March. However, further evidence emerged yesterday from two of Germany's strongest regional economies to show that industrial conditions are worsening dramatically. Manufacturing output in Bavaria during November was 7.8 per cent down on the same month in 1991, while production in Hesse fell 5.9 per cent. The first figures combining western and eastern growth statistics since unification in 1990 showed pan-German GNP rose 1.3 per cent last year. Gross domestic product, which excludes overseas earnings, increased 1.9 per cent to a total value of DM3,004bn (Pounds 1,236bn) of which the lame-duck eastern economy contributed just DM232bn. GDP in the west rose 1.5 per cent and 6.1 per cent in the east. But as the economics ministry pointed out, there is still no sign of a self-sustaining recovery in the former GDR, home to 20 per cent of the German population. Although average wages there now stand at 63 per cent of western rates, productivity is less than 40 per cent of levels in the west. East German engineering and metal workers were yesterday offered a 9 per cent pay increase for this year in the first round of talks aimed at slowing wage escalation. Employers claimed they could no longer afford a previously agreed 26 per cent rise, and want to renegotiate a deal under which eastern workers have been promised pay parity with their western counterparts by 1994.</p>

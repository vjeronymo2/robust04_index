			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Call to scrap eight councils EIGHT councils in Derbyshire should be abolished by 1995-96, the Local Government Commission for England said yesterday. The commission suggested in Alfreton that the current county council and nine district councils should be replaced by two councils - one for the city of Derby and the other for the rest of Derbyshire - with administrative savings estimated at Pounds 16m a year, or 9 per cent of the average council tax bill. The commission is examining ways of replacing the two-tier system of local government with unitary authorities. It has made recommendations for reorganisation in the Isle of Wight and Cleveland-Durham. Reorganisation in Derbyshire has a particular significance because the Labour-controlled county council was a political bete noire of the Thatcher government. Under the proposals, the authorities in Amber Valley, Bolsover, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Derbyshire Dales, High Peak, Erewash and South Derbyshire would cease to exist. Derby City Council would retain its current boundaries. Although the proposals had been widely predicted, there were protests from authorities with an uncertain future. Derbyshire Dales said: 'The worst possible scenario for all the people of Derbyshire.' South Derbyshire said: 'People in South Derbyshire will not stand by to watch their district fall into oblivion.' The commission will now test Derbyshire public opinion, 'to tailor local government to the wishes of the people,' said Sir John Banham, chairman of the commission. It will present its final recommendation to the Department of Environment in September.</p>

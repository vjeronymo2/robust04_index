Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ohio added paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) to establish recordkeeping requirements for those persons using or applying cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt during the period from May 15 through September 15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA proposed disapproval because these recordkeeping requirements are inadequate in that they do not apply to the appropriate SIP period of April 15 through October 15. Although in its State regulations, Ohio currently has an exemption period of September 15 through May 15, USEPA disapproved that extended exemption period when it was submitted as a SIP revision. 54 FR 1934. The applicable SIP exemption period is October 15 through April 15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current USEPA approved regulations, the use or application of cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt during October 15 through April 15 is exempt from limitations. Thus, the recordkeeping requirements are necessary for the remaining period: April 15 through October 15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OEPA's July 31, 1989 Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The recordkeeping requirements and the September 15 through May 15 exemption period are considered adequate in light of the USEPA Region VI's proposed approval of the Texas regulation which had a September 15 through April 15 exemption period in a much warmer spring-fall period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) only deals with recordkeeping requirements and not when cutback asphalt is allowed to be used. Ohio's Federally approved SIP does not allow cutback asphalt to be used from April 15 through October 15. Unless and until the exemption period is changed (in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(3)), the recording requirements must reflect the SIP requirements. Therefore, Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) should be finally disapproved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Cutback and Emulsified Asphalt-Rule 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(3)(e)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This paragraph states that the control requirements of (N)(1) and (N)(2) shall not apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the use or application by hand of any cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt for patching or crack sealing, provided the maximum daily usage is less than one thousand gallons  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> for any work crew.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA proposed to disapprove this exemption (without the underlined words) on March 6, 1985 (and finally disapproved this exemption on January 18, 1989 (54 FR 1934)), and proposed to disapprove the rule as revised in the May 30, 1989  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This exemption is supported by a November 3, 1982, letter from the Ohio Department of Transportation which states that ``Our attempts at using emulsified asphalt as crack sealers have not generally been satisfactory.'' The County Engineers Association of Ohio, in a June 22, 1982, letter, requested OEPA to ``Permit use of cutback asphalt for patching up to a usage not to exceed 2,000 gallons per day at any time of the year''. The County Engineers stated that this requested change ``would improve the efficiency and economy of road paving and maintenance work.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The language added to the end of (N)(3)(e) clarifies the exemption. However, this clarifying language could result in substantially increased VOC emissions because it clarifies that the one thousand gallons per day refers to each work crew. Therefore, this clarifying language, and the supporting documentation, does not change USEPA's position on this exemption, for which an adequate basis has not been provided. USEPA informed OEPA of this in its September 17, 1985, comment letter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

Ohio's record in the conversion to acceptable emulsified asphalts is above the median level of the 35 regulated States. This exemption is certainly minor when considering this fact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ohio's ratio of emulsified to cutback asphalt used in 1987 is not a valid basis for exempting the hand application of cutback asphalt. This exemption is inconsistent with USEPA guidance and its previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of RACT. Ohio has not adequately demonstrated that this revised language causes this exemption to constitute RACT and it has provided no data on the amount of additional cutback asphalt that is used in the ozone season as a result of the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This paragraph establishes a limitation of 4.8 lbs VOC/gallon of coating, excluding water, for a heat resistant, anti-corrosion coating applied to the interior of a motor vehicle directly above the catalytic converter. This revision was proposed for disapproval because it is a relaxation of approved VOC emission limits in Ohio's ozone SIP and Ohio has not made a demonstration that this relaxation will not interfere with attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. Furthermore, the July 29, 1983, memorandum titled ``Source Specific SIP Revisions'' by Sheldon Meyers, former Director of Air Quality Planning and Standards, addresses the issue of VOC SIP relaxations. This memorandum states that approval of such a relaxation would require a data base and modeling demonstration consistent with that applied in extension areas. The sources subject to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relaxation are located in Lordstown and Dayton, Ohio. There have not been any revised attainment demonstrations, consistent with those done for extension areas, submitted for these areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

USEPA is asked to accept such commitment on the part of OEPA. Region VI has accepted such commitment for a future SIP impact assessment at 54 FR 23672 on June 2, 1989 (regarding Vulcan Materials Company, Geismar Chemicals Plant).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This requested rule relaxation is being reproposed in a separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice which deals with corrections to Ohio's VOC rules (as required by the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990). The reason for this reproposal is that the revelant policy has changed with the Amended Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

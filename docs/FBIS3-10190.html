The branch will be 360 km long, stretching between Rio de  Janeiro and Belo Horizonte. The pipeline's construction and the  supply of steel pipes will cost $44 million.    According to the state-owned petroleum enterprise Petrobras  [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], the gas pipeline, whose  construction will take 14 months and will mobilize about 1,000  technicians and workers, will allow during its initial phase the  transport of 640,000 cubic meters of natural gas per day, and  1.7 million cubic meters by the turn of this century.    According to the bilateral agreements, as of 1997 Bolivia  will supply to Brazil about 8 million cubic meters of natural  gas from Bolivian gas reserves. It is necessary, however, to  build a 2,333 km pipeline to carry the gas from the Bolivian  town of Rio Grande to the city of Campinas in Sao Paulo State.    Brazil will build a domestic network to distribute the gas  in  those states that are interested in purchasing it, such as Rio  de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul.</p>

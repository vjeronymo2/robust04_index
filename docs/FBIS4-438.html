			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] About 250 Belgian citizens left  Kigali for Nairobi in Kenya today on board Hercules C-130  aircraft of the Belgian Air Force. So the operation to evacuate  Belgians from Rwanda -- there are about 1,500 of them -- really  has started, although fighting continues in the capital of  Rwanda between the regular army and the troops of the Rwandan  Patriotic Front. Francois Riquemont, our special correspondent  in Rwanda, has just arrived in Kigali, and here are his first  impressions:    [Begin recording] [Riquemont] The first Belgian refugees  left  Kigali Airport early this afternoon for Nairobi. There must be  about 250 of them who have already left Rwanda. In general the  people arriving here are very calm, even if they have been  through a lot in the last few days in the town. They are calm,  and everything is going peacefully and without panic. People  are saying that as soon as the French paratroops and then the  Belgians arrived they felt much safer, even if many of them were  threatened and had to take refuge in somewhat safer places  before leaving for the airport in convoy.    [Unidentified correspondent] So how are the convoys going?    [Riquemont] It is known that the Belgians have in a way been  caught in a trap. They were unable to leave by road, since the  Belgian convoy was forced to turn back, and the Belgians in the  convoys of foreigners were made to get out of the cars and they  were stopped from getting through. So in the end convoys were  arranged under very strong escort. There have been no incidents  with these Belgian convoys, except for one, where there were  serious threats, and stones were thrown, but nothing very  serious. I must also tell you that the people we have spoken to  here are worried about leaving, and also worried about the  Rwandans they know and about the future, what they expect their  future to be.    [Correspondent] Do you have any idea about the scale of the  fighting that has and is taking place in Kigali?    [Riquemont] There is total anarchy in the town. We haven't  been able to get into the town ourselves, but we have had many  very reliable and consistent accounts. There is anarchy. There  is still serious fighting, even if it is sporadic, between the  Rwandan Army, the regular army, especially the Presidential  Guard, and the rebels, or former rebels, of the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF]. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] On the subject of the RPF troops, is it just  rumor that they are close to the capital, Kigali, or is this  well grounded information?    [Riquemont] They are close to Kigali. We don't know how far.  From what we have been told, they are waiting before entering  the town. [end recording]    That was Francois Riquemont, with whom we spoke by telephone  just before this program.</p>

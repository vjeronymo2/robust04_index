Presidential designate (vice  president) Walter Lopez, a former general, said in statements to  the newspaper LA TRIBUNA: "There will be no exceptions because  it will be compulsory."    On Thursday, the Armed Forces announced a mixed commission  will be created with the government to propose law reforms which  allow the implementation of "a constitutional and educational  military service." The announcement was made by Armed Forces  Chief General Luis Alonso Discua following a meeting with Reina.    Reina, who replaced former President Rafael Leonardo  Callejas  on 27 January, promised "a military service that was  educational" and voluntary, instead of the habitual "hunt"  conducted in public places for poor, young men who are taken to  the Army barracks. Nevertheless, the new president apparently  failed to obtain the powerful Honduran military forces' support.    Bertha Oliva, coordinator of a movement against  conscription,  said Reina's promise "is another lie from politicians who say  one thing during their political campaign but do another once  they achieve power." The leader said that members of her  committee will organize a hunger strike in front of where the  mixed commission will meet to discuss the alleged reforms to the  military service law.</p>

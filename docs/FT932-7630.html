			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Letter: Dissatisfied with BR's reaction to complaint Sir, The contents of the article 'Citizen's Charter cuts BR payouts' (May 17) did not surprise me. I took a journey by train from Euston to Chester, via Crewe, in September last year. The InterCity was late, the connection was not held despite being shown in the InterCity timetable and I, with about six others, was left stranded. The station manager had no authority to do other than (very politely) explain the BR structure and authority levels, to advise who we could complain to, and when the next train left for Chester. A further hour's delay would have invalidated my appointment and so I took a taxi. I wrote to Chris Green, managing director of InterCity, and was rapidly passed down to a customer relations officer in Birmingham who quoted internal procedures and regulations to me to prove that he could only take responsibility for the InterCity delay. I guess that if you chop your organisation into enough bits and force your customer to deal with each, he gets fed up and goes away. I did and have not travelled by rail since. BR's best solution would have been to give the station staff at Crewe the authority to put us into a taxi, with profuse apologies. The next best would have been for Mr Green to apologise and offer some compensation which had a greater value to me than cost to BR - upgrade to first class on my next journey or provide a discount voucher. The worst was the course of action BR took, which demonstrated that top management delegates customer service and satisfaction as low down the organisation as possible. When I phoned the clerk concerned he was surprised I could contact him and then quoted more regulations at me. As your article on on Charterline confirms (Management: 'Manning the hot lines', May 19), dissatisfied clients tell many friends and are very costly.

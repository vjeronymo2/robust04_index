			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / The GATT Agreement: No 'slam dunk' shot for Gatt in Congress President Bill Clinton has officially informed Congress of his intention to sign a Uruguay Round package, but he repeated past vows not to 'enter any agreement unless I am satisfied that US interests are protected'. While praising the overall package, he said negotiations would continue to work on 'a few areas of significance that we were unable to resolve at this time'. This includes financial services, audio-visual trade and market access. 'Some commitments were contingent on receiving satisfactory commitments from other countries,' he said in a speech on Wedenesday night. 'We will continue to work to ensure that the best possible agreement.' Gatt - not to mention the newly named World Trade Organisation - is as obscure as ever to most Americans; it is not likely to inspire the level of passion achieved in the battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Congressional approval of the trade deal could be many months off, and might even slip into 1995. Mr Clinton has 90 days in which to sign approval of the package, then a further 90 legislative days before sending the implementing legislation to Congress, already facing a packed agenda next year. The long delay will allow both pro- and anti-Gatt forces, still trying to disentangle the detail of the deal, plenty of time to muster arguments and lobby congressmen. Most of the business community in Washington yesterday was reacting positively to the agreement. The chemical industry, however bemoaned the failure of many countries to agree to tariff cuts. 'Our support for tariff reductions down to the 5-6 per cent range was conditioned upon obtaining major country coverage in the round and the elimination of non-tariff measures,' it said. 'If the developing countries aren't on board, then the US must reserve the right to make adjustments to its offer. . . to keep pressure on the developing countries to participate. 'We've been told this is possible, and urge it as a strategy of last resort.' Other industries have not achieved their objectives. However, it is by no means clear they will strongly oppose it. The main opposition that is surfacing is built around the core of populists which fought the North American Free Trade Agreement. The followers of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, may join in, but the trade unions may split, depending on the gains achieved by their industries. Congressman Jim Kolbe of Arizona, one of the cannier leaders of the Nafta fight, believes it will not be 'a slam dunk', or easy shot, to get Gatt approved by Congress. Mr Kolbe was disappointed that the Japanese held firm against reducing their tariffs on copper, a major commodity in the state. But he will still support the deal. 'The issues in the Nafta were clear cut,' he said. 'This will be much cloudier. There will be an attempt to pick off individual members by different interest groups. 'Some agriculture people will oppose it and we could lose the pharmaceuticals.' The environmentalists, who are beginning to appear to be solidly against the pact, have exhausted their influence in the Nafta battle. Mr Abraham Katz, a former US ambassador to the OECD and president of the US Council for International Business, says the members of his groups - multinationals and service providers - will support the pact. It is inevitable industry will be less united on Gatt than on Nafta, because many had aims diametrically opposed. Exporters wanted the US dumping laws weakened; domestic industry wanted them preserved. 'Every one of these issues was a matter of balancing,' Mr Katz said.</p>

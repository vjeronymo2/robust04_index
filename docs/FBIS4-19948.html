			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with People's Party Secretary General Francisco </F> Alvarez Cascos by Victorino Ruiz de Azua in Madrid on 14 April]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ruiz de Azua] Corruption is  returning. Why now?    [Alvarez Cascos] It has not ceased to be present since the  Socialist government with its parliamentary hegemony approved an  anything-goes attitude and this was made clear with the Rumasa  scandal. To try now to distinguish the Roldan affair or the  Rubio affair from Filesa, Juan Guerra, or the reprivatization of  Rumasa seems to me a mistake. They are manifestations of the  same phenomenon, of the climate of impunity with which the  Socialists have tainted the political atmosphere.    [Ruiz de Azua] And it suits you people very well....    [Alvarez Cascos] It is very bad news for everybody. [There  is] an atmosphere of unscrupulousness in the government's  practice, and the feeling [exists] that it could generally harm  the system's institutional prestige and affect us all. It  grieves us, and it worries us increasingly, that Felipe  Gonzalez's style of government has encouraged this. This is  much more important than analyzing the consequences which could  indirectly help the People's Party in its prospects.    [Ruiz de Azua] Do you have the impression that the  government is cornered and is responding with difficulty?    [Alvarez Cascos] It does not wish to respond; there is a  clear lack of political will. It is very unlikely that a spirit  of regeneration capable of tackling the problem will emerge now  from the same people who created the causes and were conducive  to the breeding ground. The creator of a problem can never be  the one who provides the solution, through lack of legitimacy  and even of sincerity. In the first place, Gonzalez denied  everything, and less than a year ago described Jose Maria  Aznar's accusations as nonsense, and then concocted the line on  ethics and the democratic impetus. Now he is aware that he is a  prisoner of his actions and cannot lead the struggle against  corruption.    [Ruiz de Azua] However, the government attorney's office and  the Taxation Agency are investigating. There has been a  response.    [Alvarez Cascos] The investigation has no credibility. Why  only in the case of Mariano Rubio and not in all the others? It  is simply advisable now, for image reasons, to pretend that  steps are being taken in the wake of public indignation.    [Ruiz de Azua] When the People's Party calls on the prime  minister to accept his responsibility, to what exactly is it  referring?    [Alvarez Cascos] Gonzalez heads a collective government body  which makes the decisions; he is not the apex of a presidential  system whose responsibilities can be transferred to another,  successive level. He is as responsible as the collective body's  other members for the government actions and conduct. The great  lie is to claim infallibility for oneself and dissociate oneself  from collective responsibility in order to attribute it to the  ministers. He has no right to call the ministers to account  before the public; rather, he has a duty to account to the  public for the actions of the ministers.    [Ruiz de Azua] Are you going to call him to account in the  State of the Nation debate?    [Alvarez Cascos] We should not anticipate events or reverse  the parliamentary order. In the first place, it is up to  Gonzalez to explain the situation and its alternatives.  Depending on that, the People's Party, as the leading  opposition party, and Aznar, as its leader, will set out what  they deem to be their duty.    [Ruiz de Azua] A year ago, you said: "Corruption can be  ended in 24 hours." Apart from demanding heads, what can be  done in opposition?    [Alvarez Cascos] That sentence can be repeated. Gonzalez  has contributed to this situation because he has dissociated  himself from all responsibility and allowed his government and  party colleagues to act under the cloak of impunity, taking it  for granted that to be a Socialist was a guarantee of ethics.  These are demonstrable assertions. Here there has been a  systematic and constant reduction of the objective checks and  balances to prevent, correct, and prosecute irregular conduct.  With the pretext of efficiency, ministers have been given  greater discretionary powers to handle greater budgetary  resources. In practice, the State Auditor General's Office  neither oversees nor inspects anything. Gonzalez and the PSOE  [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] recently rejected People's  Party proposals to restore objectivity and oversight to  government decisions. They want no checks; they wish to  continue to operate arbitrarily. They wished to presume that a  Socialist's hands were those of a saint, and now it is clear  that they are as human as anybody's. Some people have already  used this for their own advantage.    [Ruiz de Azua] The Socialists won the election thanks to the  promise of the democratic impetus to bring openness to public  life. What has become of it?    [Alvarez Cascos] The Socialists won the last election thanks  to the last great operation staged by Gonzalez to nationalize  the truth staged by Gonzalez. The supreme expression of the  attempt to control everything is the intention to nationalize  the truth through control of the public radio and television  systems. Gonzalez's success was the great national deception by  virtue of which he was able at the last minute to turn round a  situation which was becoming irreversible; the country's ills  would come from the opposition, which was going to lower  pensions, cut unemployment benefit, and increase unemployment,  while from him would come a social pact, full employment, and  the guarantee of social stability. But, in less than a year,  Gonzalez's stock has fallen considerably, his word is now  virtually worthless, and his lies today are patent. There  remains only an unconditional redoubt of supporters capable of  following him in his lies.    [Ruiz de Azua] I was asking you about the democratic  impetus.    [Alvarez Cascos] It has a great deal to do with this. We  are the first people not to believe in the sincerity of those  announcements, but we have acted in good faith, sat down at the  table, and now we have exhausted the possibilities of reaching  an agreement because society needs a regeneration of its  institutions. Eventually we ran up against the wall of the  obvious fact that the line was for everything to change so that  nothing would change. Everything was reduced to a mere exercise  of staying in power. Gonzalez is now a caricature of a leader  seeking legitimacy of tenure. He undoubtedly has legitimacy of  origin in the votes and support of CiU [Convergence and Union]  and the Basque Nationalist Party, but a democratic politician  legitimates himself every day by tackling citizens' problems.  He has lost that legitimacy. His only effort is that directed  at clinging to power.    [Ruiz de Azua] But the democratic impetus should have  contributed something against corruption. Why has this not been  possible?    [Alvarez Cascos] This has already become apparent. When we  try to take a step forward in the functioning of the committees  of enquiry in the Congress of Deputies, the Socialists, who  hitherto had the guillotine of the majority to constrict these  committees, wish to add another -- their coinciding with the  judicial investigations. If we approved the PSOE's proposal,  the Roldan committee would have to cease operating right now.  Is that what society expects of those who proclaim the  democratic impetus?    [Ruiz de Azua] It is striking how little you people have  said about the PSOE congress.    [Alvarez Cascos] That is normal; we have referred only to  matters which are of general interest. For instance, the  worsening of the internal discord affects the government's  stability and its ability to act. We do not involve ourselves  with the internal confrontation.    [Ruiz de Azua] Do you have the impression that the  Socialist congress opens up prospects for repairing the internal  split?    [Alvarez Cascos] On the contrary, we are confronted with a  process of a breakup of cohesion which may be dressed up as an  ideological or power struggle but is a result of the widespread  realization of failure. Today the PSOE is creating increasing  disappointment. The disputes are a result of the feeling of  failure and, at the same time, boost the strategy of defeat.    [Ruiz de Azua] While the government maintains that there is  an economic recovery, you deny it. Can't you even agree on the  objective economic facts?    [Alvarez Cascos] It seems to me that there is very little  argument among the public about the fact that we are in the  worst economic crisis since the restoration of democracy. We  should not fall into traps. Gonzalez used to tell Adolfo Suarez  he was incompatible with democracy because he was leading the  country to 2 million unemployed: He cannot tell the country now  not to scourge itself because it is reaching 4 million  unemployed.    [Ruiz de Azua] But are we or are we not emerging from the  crisis?    [Alvarez Cascos] The question is whether we live off other  countries' inertia or also make our own contribution. There are  positive signs abroad which will reach here, but the domestic  economic policy is a deadweight. The public deficit was  recognized long ago as the cancer of the Spanish economy, which  has placed it at the head of the crisis in Europe. Well then,  1993 is the year of the largest budget overshoots in the  Socialist governments' memory.    [Ruiz de Azua] Your analysis is rather gloomy. Are you not  afraid that such a negative view will end up harming the  opposition as well?    [Alvarez Cascos] The worst thing that can be done to a  country is to deceive it. As long as society is told that the  government is doing everything possible and society resigns  itself to living with the situation, nobody will take the  necessary steps to emerge from the crisis. That is the People's  Party's great responsibility -- to shake off any complex and  tell the truth. That will be our legitimacy when we call for  efforts or sacrifices.    [Ruiz de Azua] If you win the European elections and deprive  the PSOE of its absolute majority in Andalusia, could there not  be instability in the government?    [Alvarez Cascos] If we won, it would be the greatest support  for the strategy which we have developed and our final  confirmation as the winning party. On the government's  stability, the question must be put to Jordi Pujol. Gonzalez  governs every day on the time which Pujol gives him. How long  will CiU endure the erosion? You must ask the CiU.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Arts: It is flair, not formula, that counts - Television Back you come after a few weeks absence and still they are running around in circles shrieking 'Look out] Here comes the information superhighway] Don't panic] Don't panic] The information superhighway is coming to your television]' As with religion and politics, the more excited the devotees become, and the more often their claims are repeated, the greater the suspicion that they are talking nonsense. With communications technology these bouts of hysteria crop up regularly. Fifteen years ago the techno freaks were rushing around shouting 'Look out] Here comes convergence] Don't panic] Don't panic]' Organisers of day conferences made lots of money, and miles of column inches were devoted to the idea of all the mass media melting into one. Of course it did not happen. Telephones and cinema and television and publishing did not converge to any significant degree: how many ordinary people (not working in mass communications) do you know who use the telephone to download information onto their television screens? When did you last buy a shirt via teleshopping? Yes, you can see Hollywood movies on your television, but then you always could. When lectured on the revolution about to happen on your television screen by a man with five ballpoints in his breast pocket, the acronym to remember is 'Gigo': garbage in, garbage out. What matters to most of us is not the way in which facts or entertainment reach us, but the quality of the content. It would be nice if the instruction book (it has to be a book, obviously) could be written in English rather than translated from the Japanese by a wild eyed teenage virtual-reality freak in an anorak, but that aside we really do not care much whether we use DAT or laser disc, cable or satellite. And yet the BBC has just sent out a glossy silver leaflet announcing the BBC Networking Club, and the first line of type on the front page (naturally they would not use anything but the 600-year-old medium of print to get this across) says 'Nowadays it's not who you contact, but how you contact them]' That is the sort of fatuous assertion that makes you despair of what was, until quite recently, a great organisation concerned almost exclusively with producing radio and television programmes, many of them outstanding. Inside the leaflet, among promises of a 'guided tour of Cyber Town' and instructions on how to 'configure your WWW browser' is the suggestion that, with this new network, known as Auntie (quite a good undergraduate joke in the 1960s) you will be able, for instance, to 'find out more about your favourite BBC tv and radio programmes'. Those who have tried using the existing on-screen text services to check a late programme change, and waited endlessly while the 'page' numbers click round, only to find that the schedule has not, anyway, been updated, will have their own views on that. Presumably the launch of the Auntie club is prompted by the fashionable notion that the BBC, instead of just going on making excellent programmes, should become (West Coast accent, please) a 'vertically integrated global media conglomerate', or some such thing. Yet the BBC's greatest strength has always been in giving free rein to individual flair and talent, not in serving some pre-ordained formula. One of the best series now on screen is Billy Connolly's World Tour Of Scotland, a programme unlike any I have seen before. Connolly toured tiny venues in some of the remotest parts of Scotland, and programme makers Willy Smax and Bill Tennant have combined clips from his stand-up routines there with bits of travelogue - often strikingly sentimental, but proudly so, not apologetically - to create a form of fond autobiography which is strongly flavoured, vivid, and enormously appealing. If you want to know what it means to be Scottish this series is far more powerful than anything emerging from The Tales Of Para Handy which works to a depressingly familiar formula: start with a book and choose for the lead someone who is already highly successful in some other series, in this instance Gregor Fisher, aka Rab C Nesbitt. Why choose Kriss Akabusi to introduce the happy-clappy programme Summer Sunday on BBC1? Up to now he has been known not for his religious faith but for his sprinting . . . but also for wilder enthusiasm than anyone else in the British athletics team. And there is the clue. We now have yet another series presented with the formula that used to be reserved for teenybopper pop shows, all squeaky hysteria, windmilling arms, and screams of 'Hallo Scarborough]' The best programmes rely not upon some wild-eyed concept of advanced technology, nor upon slavish adherence to a formula, but upon the unique vision of a talented individual. It is true of Desmond Morris's The Human Animal which, tonight, considers human living quarters, having looked last week at the way that the hunting instinct remains with us in modern urban surroundings. Morris's theories may not all prove correct in the long run, but he thinks interestingly and argues persuasively about what makes human beings behave the way they do. Far from adding to the programmes, the occasional rinky-dink electronic tricks actually detract. Michael Moore's TV Nation on BBC2 on Fridays is another series which has value solely because of the idiosyncratic approach of its presenter. Moore is the American who made the in-your-face documentary Roger And Me, about the catastrophic effect on Flint, Michigan, of the closure of the town's car factory. Now he is making a whole series which holds your attention - and entertains, even when matters are pretty serious - by continuing to be equally bull headed. Last week he blithely investigated what influence in US government you or a lobbyist can buy for Dollars 5,000; the contrast between President Clinton's description of the town where he was born and other people's descriptions of the town where he grew up; and the reasons why North Dakota is the least visited state of the union. Asked why anyone should visit, the governor says 'You can still get lost here'. It is the content that counts. Even if the information superhighway does come crashing into our sitting rooms in time to be a boon to our grandchildren, it will still be the content that counts. Nowadays, as throughout history, it is not how you contact people that matters but what they have to say.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Beijing is planning to set up a newspaper in Hong  Kong as pressure mounts on the territory's media to tone down  criticism of its future landlord.    The Hong Kong Special Region Daily will be published under  the direct control of the Chinese Communist Party after 1997.    The move would contravene repeated assurances by Beijing  that  the party would be barred from operating in the territory after  the handover. In addition, a privately funded pro-China  newspaper, the Mirror Daily, will be set up in 1996.    The two papers are expected to serve as models for what  Beijing considers appropriate interpretation of Hong Kong press  freedom without undermining socialism on the mainland.  According to the China watching monthly Open Magazine [KAI  FANG], the Hong Kong Special Region Daily will "completely  reflect Beijing's point of view".    It said the move was part of overall plans to restrict press  freedom in the territory after 1997 out of fears that excessive  criticism of Beijing could topple the communist government. Top  media cadres from the mainland would be selected to serve as  senior editors at the paper.    Sources said that reporters for the new paper were already  being trained during short stays at pro-China newspapers in Hong  Kong. A senior deputy editor at Ta Kung Pao, Lu Fuwei, who is  in poor health, is expected to be replaced by a top mainland  cadre who would double as the new paper's preparatory head in  Hong Kong, the sources said.    While at least five pro-Beijing papers already exist in Hong  Kong, Beijing has become concerned about growing signs of  independence, reflected in the strong reaction to the 12-year  sentence handed down to the Ming Pao journalist Xi Yang.    Even Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, which have direct links to  the Communist Party's propaganda department in Beijing, printed  editorials critical of the sentence.    A prominent local pro-China figure, Xu Simin [publisher of  the journal CHING PAO], said his new paper, the Mirror Daily,  would be "patriotic and outspoken".</p>

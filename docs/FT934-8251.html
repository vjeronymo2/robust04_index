			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (11): Market relatively buoyant despite abundance of supply - Property / The number of projects currently under way and falling rental prices are seen as good news by economic promoters THE amount of office space in Barcelona has more than doubled since the start of the Olympic building programme, and rental prices have tumbled from a maximum of Pta 3,500 a square metre to between Pta 2,000 and Pta 2,500. 'It has been excellent,' said Manuel Ludevid, director of economic promotion at the city council. 'If our companies do not go bankrupt - and the signs are that they are not going bankrupt - we have a product which is twice as good, better quality and cheaper.' The market changed rapidly from one where there was a marked shortage of supply to one where large buildings have been left empty, most notably the MAFRE tower, one of the two skyscrapers in the Olympic village, owned by the Spanish insurance company. Also reaching completion is the huge L'Illa complex on Diagonal, which includes 115,752 sq m of office space, and retail premises which have already been taken by Marks and Spencer and Benetton, among others. More than 20 major projects are currently under development, covering a total of 1,000 hectares, according to the city council. Lluis Armet, the deputy mayor, cites the proximity of all these projects to the city centre as a reason for the relative buoyancy of the market under such a weight of supply. He also points to the involvement of insurance companies in several of the developments - for example, Winterthur in the case of L'Illa - as a sign that they attract 'investors who think in terms of long-term opportunities'. As part of the first sector to be affected in the construction cycle, Josep Maria Gordi, a Barcelona-based architect, has seen a steep drop in demand for new building designs in the past two years. This has only recently begun to show signs of recovering, but given the one constant factor - there is still a shortage of land which can be built on - he does not expect prices to fall much further.</p>

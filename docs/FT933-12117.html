			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / On the verge of a nervous breakdown: German banks are to publish provisions German banks are about to lift the veil of secrecy which covers their true financial performance - not fully, but enough to give new insight into their underlying financial strength amid Germany's worst recession since the second world war. When the banks report their interim figures over the next few weeks - beginning with Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank this week - they will publish details of their provisions against bad and doubtful debts for the first time. Hitherto, German banks have had the appearance of being highly resilient to the downturn. The larger banks reported record profits last year and the figures released for the first three, four and in some cases five months of the current year have shown that the profits increase is continuing - mainly because of strong gains on the banks' own account trading activity. This apparent immunity has been one factor behind sharp rises in the share prices of German banks this year. The highest gain came from Commerzbank, Germany's third largest bank, where the share price has risen 32 per cent since the beginning of the year; Dresdner Bank has risen 22 per cent; and Deutsche Bank by 13 per cent. This compares with a rise of 18 per cent in the DAX index of 30 leading shares. In the first five months of the year, Commerzbank's total operating profits increased 15 per cent. There was a similar percentage rise in the profits of Dresdner Bank in the first four months. But these figures conceal the true picture. The reason is that the total operating profits published by the German banks do not take any account of mounting credit risks in the deteriorating German economy. They comprise net profits from lending business, lumped together with fee income and profits from own-account trading in the securities and currency markets. Provisions against doubtful debts, together with actual write-offs against bad debts, are not included. Under the terms of the European Bank Accounts Directive - which must be adopted for the 1993 full-year accounts - banks are obliged to be more forthcoming. The German banking sector has decided to jump the gun and make the most important change required by the directive at the half-year stage. The banks have made no secret of the fact that the recession has hit credit quality very hard - particularly among the medium-company sector, the so-called Mittelstand. This is hardly surprising, given the sharp rise in corporate insolvencies - up more than 27 per cent in the manufacturing sector last year and a further 20 per cent in the early months of 1993 - and the troubles being experienced by companies in such sectors as machine-tools and suppliers to the car industry. Up until now, banks have only provided a figure for gross provision charges. Thus, Deutsche Bank let it be known that its total provision charge for 1992 was DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn). The figure for net provisions which subsequently appeared in the bank's profit and loss account was DM1.85bn. These figures are large and impressive but somewhat meaningless as the bank  -in common with the rest of its peer-group - did not give a full breakdown of the make-up of the fig-ures. There was no clue as to the level of provisions against corporate debts alone. The net figure is calculated after various undisclosed items have been written back - for example releases from no-longer needed provisions on country debt or on the value of security portfolios. The changes will unscramble some of the ambiguity surrounding the figures and will enable analysts to do more than just guess at banks' underlying profitability. Mr Ian McEwen, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, predicts a degree of 'public relations manoeuvring' in the interim reports as the banks take advantage of remaining opportunities to fudge the true picture. But, says Mr McEwen, 'it will become very clear that German banks are not immune to the German recession'.</p>

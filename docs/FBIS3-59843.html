			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Secrets of Privileges Crisis Between </F> President and Vice President"]    [Text] Sanaa--While Yemen's Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, general secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party,  continued his seclusion in the economic capital Aden, leaders of  the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Grouping for Reform  hastened to contain the legal and constitutional crisis among  the three sharers of power--a crisis that threatens to produce a  constitutional vacuum resulting from al-Bid's seclusion and the  solidarity of the members of the Socialist Party's political  bureau with him. In practice, this means not reaching an  agreement about the proposed changes to the constitution, as the  process of amending the constitution requires the agreement of  three-fourths of the members of the House of Representatives, a  number available only by a political agreement among the three  political parties sharing power.    It appears that the Yemeni leadership, with its three  parties, has moved quickly. Time, too, may have moved quickly.  On 14 October, the authority of the Presidential Council that  has led Yemen since the declaration of unity expires. If there  is no agreement on the proposed constitutional changes,  parliament will find itself forced to elect a new Presidential  Council; and even this new council is not an object of  agreement. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, for example, has stated that he is  unwilling for his membership on it to be renewed, thus reviving  speculations about possible alternatives the Socialist Party  might propose instead of its general secretary. The name of  Salih Muhammad, the party's assistant general secretary, has  been mentioned in this regard, or political bureau member Dr.  Yasin Sa'id Nu'man for membership in the new council, on  condition that one of them would become vice chairman of the  presidential body. Sources in the People's Congress, which is  headed by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, say that attempts at  mediation, both domestic and Arab, have taken place during the  last two months, since the vice president's return from a  European and American tour, with the goal of persuading him to  return to the capital, Sanaa, and end his seclusion. These  mediations reached a dead end; nevertheless, the attempts were  repeated and are still continuing. It should be mentioned in  this regard that a parliamentary delegation headed by Shaykh  'Abdallah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar has offered to go to Aden to talk  with Salim al-Bid and reach a formula for a new Presidential  Council with al-Bid as a member to be formed before 14 October.    It is difficult to predict Yemen's future legal and  constitutional situation unless one goes back to the real  reasons behind the sudden decision to seclude himself that  al-Bid made without informing anyone, even the members of the  Socialist Party's political bureau. They were surprised by his  seclusion, but understood his statements and objections to the  constitutional changes after they met with him in Aden during  September; this despite the fact that before al-Bid's return  from the United States the political bureau itself had agreed to  the proposed constitutional changes and had participated with  representatives of the two other parties--Reform and People's  Congress--in approving them.    Was al-Bid not informed of what his party's representatives  had approved? In fact, the vice president was apprised of  everything that took place in the meetings of the three-party  committee that discussed and approved the constitutional  changes. Salim Salih Muhammad, the number-two man in the party,  has stated that he informed 'Ali Salim al-Bid of all the  developments as they occurred.  <H5>  Seclusion </H5>   What happened?    The way in which al-Bid returned to Yemen drew attention. He  refused to board the presidential plane reserved for the  president and the five Presidential Council members, preferring  to board a plane belonging to Alyemda, the southern airline. He  took off on 19 August, went to Aden, instead of Sanaa, and  refused to meet with any official in the country; neither did he  deliver any statement to the information media. Finally, at the  end of August, he came out with a fiery speech before the  leaders of the Labor Confederation and defined his position on  the constitutional changes. It came as a shock to all parties  sharing in the government, including the leaders of the  Socialist Party. Al-Bid insisted on the need to hold a popular  referendum on the changes, although there is no constitutional  provision to that effect. For the first time since unification  he referred to "balance of interests," although he did not  define exactly what he meant by the term. He used astonishing  expressions, such as "rejecting incorporation and annexation."  Many interpreted the expression as an implied rejection of one  provision of the constitutional changes: namely, that only the  president should be elected, while the vice president's name  would be announced without their necessarily being on one slate.  Al-Bid leveled strong criticisms of state and government  policies such as weak security measures, failure to arrest the  perpetrators of attempted political assassinations, and  suspicions of administrative and financial corruption in the  government apparatus.    What many considered to be the time bombs in al-Bid's speech  in fact reflected but one side of the reasons for al-Bid's  opposition to the constitutional changes. Leaders of the  People's Congress say that the vice president is trying to  obtain the best privileges in the proposed constitutional  changes--such as election of the president and vice president  from one slate, with the vice president having the right to  succeed the president for the remainder of his term of office in  case of the latter's death or resignation.    Sources in the Socialist Party say that a two-party  agreement  on constitutional changes was concluded one week before the  elections. The most important point was agreement to change the  form of the presidency from a five-member Presidential Council  elected by the House of Representatives to a president and vice  president only. The two would be chosen by direct popular  election from a single slate after the House of Representatives  had pronounced on their integrity. Socialist sources say that  the People's Congress tried to change this provision while 'Ali  Salim al-Bid was traveling outside the country.    The problem in Yemen now is that the complications  surrounding the constitutional changes--complications that  threaten to cause a political and constitutional vacuum if 14  October passes without an agreement--come at a time when many  were expecting that the Socialist Party and the People's  Congress would merge and that their parliamentary  representatives would form a single bloc. The current  disagreements have given impetus to the antimerger wing of the  Socialist Party. Leadership sources in the party say that the  party's general convention this December will not discuss on its  agenda the issue of merging into the People's Congress, which  means that the proposal no longer has any meaning at the present  time.  <H5>  Army Merger </H5>   Another aspect of the complications is that the ongoing  disagreements have derailed strategic decisions that were  supposed to have reached the stage of practical implementation.  Perhaps the most important of these was the decision to merge  the armed forces, the military police, and the people's security  forces, in addition to the forces of central police and  security. Many fear that the suspension of unifying the army is  the prelude to an unknown and perhaps frightening alternative.  The recent resignation of the chief of staff revealed political  forces that do not want the armed forces to merge, perhaps so  that they can preserve the privileges they used to obtain before  unification.    In any case, many in Yemen predict that the efforts of the  speaker of parliament, Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, will succeed  in persuading the vice president to end his seclusion, return to  Sanaa, and agree to a formula acceptable to the three parties  for constitutional changes before 14 October, which coincides  with the 30th anniversary of the revolution against British  imperialism in the south. On the 18th of the same month, Yemen  is to receive French President Mitterrand. It would be  unthinkable for these occasions to take place with the vice  president absent. Meanwhile, many in the Arab world and Europe  are speaking with wonder about the democratic experiment in  united Yemen.</p>

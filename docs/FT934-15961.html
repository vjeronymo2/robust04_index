			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Trebruk buys Polish paper group TREBRUK, a Swedish paper producer, yesterday took over Poland's heavily indebted Kostrzyn pulp and paper manufacturer for 800,000 zlotys (Dollars 40). The Swedish group will take over a 180bn zloty debt which is to be repaid in annual tranches over the the next three years. It has promised to invest Dollars 55m in the plant. Last summer, a number of local creditors agreed to waive Kostrzyn 275bn zlotys worth of debts to make the sale possible. Trebruk's investment funding for Kostrzyn is to come from a Dollars 32m loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) of which at least Dollars 7m will be syndicated to Polish and foreign commercial banks. Schroders, which advised the Polish government on the privatisation of the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, has established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland.</p>

A Central News Unit report  from Beirut cites the Hizballah secretary general, who said  yesterday that in continuation of its policies in the Middle  East the U.S. Government thinks only of the interests of the  regime occupying Jerusalem and how to meet that regime's demands.    Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah described the visit by a delegation  of  U.S. Congressmen to Lebanon as an insult to the Lebanese people.  The Hizballah secretary general said: The United States  attaches importance only to the fate of a few soldiers of the  occupying army who disappeared during an attack on Lebanese  territory, while it pays no attention to the fate of hundreds of  Lebanese who are living under the most difficult of conditions  in Zionist prisons.</p>

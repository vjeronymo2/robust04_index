			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Travel agents 'under threat' A draft European Union directive to regulate distance selling could put 20 per cent of travel companies out of business within six months, the Association of British Travel Agents says. The directive is designed to regulate the purchase of goods and service by mail order, telephone, electronic mail, television and other technologies. Abta said that changes to an earlier draft of the directive meant that travel agents would no longer be regarded as direct suppliers of holidays. Customers who used a travel agent to arrange holidays with tour operators would be deemed to have concluded a distance selling contract with the operator. Abta said 90 per cent of holidays sold in the UK would be affected by the directive. The directive also says that providers of goods and services through distance selling cannot demand payment until after delivery of the product or performance of the service. Abta said: 'The travel industry relies for its very existence on planning ahead and taking pre-payments from the consumer. Suppliers require pre-payment from travel companies and the restriction on a company's cashflow caused by an inability to require payment from a consumer would put a vast number of companies out of business. 'The result may be that only a few large companies would survive. The association estimates that this requirement may put of of business as much as 20 per cent of its membership within six months and would anticipate that similar effects will be felt within the rest of the European Community.'</p>

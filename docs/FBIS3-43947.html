			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN    PAC Gains Township Youth Support -- "Coinciding with the  announcement of the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] decision to  suspend the armed struggle has been the disclosure by a Sunday  newspaper of an election poll in which the ANC [African National  Congress] would get 64.4 percent of the vote to the PAC's 1.7  percent, with half of the ANC's Black supporters listing the PAC  as their second choice," notes the page 6 editorial in  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 17 January. The PAC has  gained the image, "particularly among radicalised township  youth, as hard-nosed, more extreme and more aggressive than the  ANC in recent times, particularly with its One settler, one  bullet slogan. Abandoning attacks on White farmers and other  civilian targets may make the PAC look like any other former  liberation organisation."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   IFP Backing 'Lagging By Miles' -- Referring to Zulu King  Zwelithini's meeting with President de Klerk, Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 19 January in a page 12 editorial says:  "What is not clear is how far the king's concern with the Zulu  monarchy and the 'kingdom of kwaZulu' reflects historical  tradition as opposed to ambition and political affiliation  (although he would deny the latter). By saying this we do not  wish to pooh-pooh a lineage of kings which has stamped itself  indelibly on our history, nor do we doubt that  self-determination and the question of a double ballot are  crucially important to many people." "Unfortunately the king  resorted to a threat of resistance and indulged in rhetoric  which is simply not supported by fact. Opinion polls suggest  that backing for the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] (and  maintaining kwaZulu) is lagging by miles. They fail to  substantiate the king's assertion that 'expunging the very name  of my kingdom from the Constitution...has sent shock waves  throughout the psyche of every one of our Zulu subjects'." THE  STAR is glad discussions will continue, "but they need to be  less emotively based."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Inkatha, White Right Avoid Feasible Settlement -- "There are  good grounds for believing that neither Inkatha nor the white  right wing is seriously seeking a feasible settlement," states a  page 6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 19  January. "A pattern is becoming apparent that, as soon as  concessions are made, new demands arise. Nevertheless, the NP  [National Party], the ANC and others involve in the next phase  of talks with the Freedom Alliance, starting today, must not  allow their scepticism to detract from good faith negotiations."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   De Klerk 'Forced To Show Sympathy' for Zulu Constituency --  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 19 January in a page 6  editorial comments on the meeting between Zulu King Zwelithini  and State President de Klerk in Pretoria, saying Zwelithini "is  being manipulated by the politicians to do things that are  unbecoming to a monarch." "For Chief Buthelezi this was a  shrewd political move, made even more impressive by the concern  expressed at acts of intimidation and the wanton killing of  people. It was astute of him to play the role of loyal subject  for the support he got was impressive even if it was mainly  bused in. Buthelezi knows President de Klerk and the Government  are forced to show sympathy to his and King Zwelithini's  constituency. The bland political outcome, notwithstanding, the  symbolism of having such a meeting at the very heart of  Government had enormous impact."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   PAC Suspends Armed Struggle -- "The PAC's decision to  suspend  the armed struggle has been made dangerously late but is still  very welcome," says a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans on 17 January. The organization has in the past  renounced the struggle, and yet violence continued. "This has  been evidence of scandalous opportunism," because while PAC  leaders were in the mainstream of negotiations and were signing  peace agreements, its armed wing, the Azanian People's  Liberation Army, (APLA) continued its terror. The PAC on  occasions tried to distance itself by claiming it was not really  in control of its armed wing. "We accept that foreign  governments have played a significant role in bringing the PAC  to its senses." Big Western countries have for a long time been  active behind the scenes. When African countries made the PAC  realize that "its game was over," it had no choice but to  suspend the armed struggle. "The PAC says the message on the  ending of the struggle must be communicated to its people at  ground level. This organization has to prove that it does have  control over APLA. It will, therefore, have to play a credible  role to help solve the problem it created." If not, the country  will have to deal with violent elements which believe they can  destabilize the country. The right wing, with its constant  threats of a civil war, has to also realize this. "A continuing  armed struggle will make everyone in the country a loser, while  negotiations offer the country a second chance."</p>

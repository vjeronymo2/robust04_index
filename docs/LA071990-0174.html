			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAX JACOBSON: HEAVY ON THE FRENCH, HOLD THE SALT  </P> <P> At Napoleon, a new French restaurant in Dana Point, the maitre d's name is  Alfred Bonaparte. That is what I call a tough act to follow.  </P> <P> Bonaparte is a colorful fellow who loves to bend your ear about the many places  he has lived, but he is not actually related to the late emperor. He's not even  French; he comes from Goa, a former Portuguese colony on India's western coast.  As for the family name, it's one his father patriotically took after serving in  the French army.  </P> <P> The restaurant's owner is French, though. Jean-Paul Gourgues was reared in  Bordeaux and operated a restaurant in Montreal for some years. I'd guess he  originally planned to limit his menu at Napoleon to traditional French cuisine  but some good instinct told him to add a spate of spa and bistro dishes to  reach a broader clientele.  </P> <P> It's not going to be easy. Dana Point, brimming though it is with young  professionals and urban escapees, is still a beachfront community where most of  the restaurants are not far from the water. A formal, landlocked French dining  room like this one is just not what most people expect in these parts.  </P> <P> Well, they've got one now. When he took over the premises formerly known as  JJ's Bistro, Gourgues totally renovated the place in French style. It's now a  regal blue room full of mirrors and chandeliers where you sit on faux  provincial chairs with round turquoise cushions and wicker backs.  </P> <P> Gourgues keeps candles flickering to maintain an early 19th-Century mood  (though the music is often anachronistic: sometimes Debussy, sometimes '30s  swing) and has added framed prints of the emperor himself along with several  scenes of battles royal. It's exactly the sort of room you'd expect to find in  a medium-size French city, the kind of place you'd visit after a leisurely  drive through the French countryside.  </P> <P> Sit in one of the dark, romantic corner tables or, if possible, in the  so-called gazebo room -- really a boxed-in little room for romantic trysts --  and follow two simple rules: Ask that dishes be slightly undercooked and tell  them to go easy on the salt (chef Gilberto Mercado, formerly of Perino's in Los  Angeles, salts to excess when left to his own devices). Do this and you may eat  very well here.  </P> <P> The hors d'oeuvres don't show a lot of originality but most are solidly  prepared. The escargots de Bourgogne are particularly delightful, one of the  best versions I've had in a long time. Mercado prepares them in a tarragon  butter sauce and serves them in braised mushroom caps. I also liked the pate  maison, a grainy country-style pate served with a large heap of aspic and some  crunchy little cornichon pickles.  </P> <P> The oysters made me feel cheated, though. As I bit into one of my huitres  sautees au fenouil -- oysters supposedly sauteed in fennel butter -- I  discovered they had been breaded and deep fried. That rendered them ludicrously  heavy for the thick cream sauce, virtually inedible.  </P> <P> Soups and salads are not a strong point here (the vichyssoise, made in advance,  was so salty that neither I nor anyone else at the table would eat it) but  there are a few bright spots. Soupe a l'oignon gratinee was served in a lovely  porcelain terrine with a perfect crown of melted Gruyere cheese; the stock  tasted rich and beefy. Salads have a tendency to be on the sweet side -- the  spinach salad would have been fine with just a bit less sugar -- but the potent  Caesar is well mixed and very heavy on the anchovies.  </P> <P> There is quite a large selection of fresh fish and meat entrees; make sure to  ask what is fresh that day. Langoustines Imperatrice, made with imported  scampi, unquestionably is the restaurant's star dish. Like tiny slim-line  lobsters, the scampi float in a subtle beurre blanc, melt in the mouth like  butter and have a lingering taste of delicious sweetness. Poached salmon, from  the menu category entitled "Les Dietetiques," was nearly as pleasing and as  light as a feather. The salmon came soft and flaky, attractively accompanied  with steamed asparagus, endive and Mercado's signature broiled tomato with  spiced bread crumbs.  </P> <P> Be sure that things are to be cooked as the menu leads you to believe. Another  spa dish, paillarde de poulet, was supposed to be chicken breast poached with  fresh herbs. What came from the kitchen was a butterflied chicken breast  grilled nearly to death. In general go with the simple dishes here: filet  mignon, grilled Dover sole, perhaps a rack of lamb. The sauce bigarade on the  orange duck was sweet enough to pour on ice cream and the ponderous cream sauce  on a dish called pheasant grand veneur seemed as thick as vanilla pudding.  </P> <P> The lunch time bistro menu lists many simple dishes, straightforward and  enticing. Mousse de truite Perigueux is trout mousse in a Madeira truffle  sauce. In feuillete d'oeufs mollets, poached eggs are served in little pastry  shells. Omelet Brayaude is like a potato frittata with a twist, the addition of  ham and chopped walnut.  </P> <P> Gourgues personally prepares the crepes Suzette and cherries jubilee at the  table, swirling them in a flaming pan. I'd stick to simpler desserts, though: a  creamy homemade cheesecake, or an artistic fresh fruit salad with several kinds  of berries.  </P> <P> Oh, and don't try getting funny with the maitre d'. No, Napoleons are not on  the dessert menu.  </P> <P> Napoleon is moderately expensive. Lunch items are $6 to $12.50. At dinner, hors  d'oeuvres, soups and salads are $2.75 to $6.75. Main dishes are $12.50 to  $18.50. Sunday brunch is $14.50.  </P> <P> NAPOLEON  </P> <P> 24501 Del Prado Ave., Dana Point  </P> <P> (714) 240-7944  </P> <P> Open for lunch Tuesday through Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., for dinner  Tuesday through Saturday from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m., and for brunch Sunday from  10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Closed Monday.  </P> <P> American Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted.  </P></p>

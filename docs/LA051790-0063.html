			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> A GRAND GROUP AT GRAND AVENUE BAR  </P> <P> Organizing a new, big jazz orchestra has to rank right up there with tilting  with windmills. Yet, for the last five years, two brothers -- bassist John and  saxophonist Jeff Clayton -- and drummer Jeff Hamilton have been doggedly  spending most of their free time planning, rehearsing, underwriting and  recording a no- holds-barred, 18-piece ensemble.  </P> <P> Monday night, the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra performed at the Biltmore  Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar &amp; Grill, clearly demonstrating that all the work  and effort has not been in vain. The Clayton-Hamilton ensemble provides  persuasive evidence that big-band jazz is still a powerful vehicle for creative  expression.  </P> <P> The opening set was a well-programmed collection of works, most of them  arranged by John Clayton, ranging from Basie-like blues and Ellington pastels  to a richly harmonized ensemble sound that is the group's identifying  characteristic. The best example was a sumptuous Clayton chart for Johnny  Mandel's "Melt Away" that showcased Jeff Clayton's alto leading a gorgeously  textured sax section.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the reality of current music business economics probably won't  allow much more than occasional appearances by the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz  Orchestra. Too bad. It's one of the brightest new jazz sounds of the decade.  DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

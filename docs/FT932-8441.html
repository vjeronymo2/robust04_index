			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Manufacturing output shows large increase MANUFACTURING output has recorded its largest quarterly rise for more than four years, confirming that the recovery is building up strength. In the January-March period production was a seasonally adjusted 2 per cent higher than in the previous quarter and 2.1 per cent up on the corresponding period a year ago, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. The increase in output has been especially strong among computer makers, engineering companies and producers of metals and minerals products. The last time manufacturers chalked up a bigger increase in output on a three-monthly basis was November 1988. In volume terms manufacturing production in the first quarter was the highest quarterly figure since the last three months of 1990, when the recession was just getting under way. The figure for the latest quarter is still, however, 6 per cent below the record volume registered in the second quarter of 1990, when factory output hit a record. Manufacturing output in March fell by a slight 0.3 per compared with February. The CSO said much of this was because sugar production in the earlier month was artificially boosted by the bumper harvest last autumn. Taking into account the energy and water sectors, total industrial output from all production industries was 0.3 per cent up in the first quarter compared with the previous three months. It was 1.6 per cent higher than the equivalent period last year. The relatively small increase for all production industries - accounting for about a third of gross domestic product - was mainly attributed to lower output by the energy and water sectors, which fell 4.2 per cent between the last three months of last year and the latest quarter. In the first quarter metals production was up 6.6 per cent compared with the last three months of last year, with minerals and related products showing a 5.1 per cent rise. The engineering sector, which has been particularly affected by the recession, showed a healthy 2.7 per cent rise while chemicals production increased 1.2 per cent. Chemicals output - relatively strong during the downturn - has been pushed down lower in recent months as a result of slacker demand for pharmaceuticals.</p>

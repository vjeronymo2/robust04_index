			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Ostrovskaya: "Barge Reprocesses Nuclear </F> Waste"]    [Text] Vladivostok -- The scandalously notorious liquid  radioactive waste formed during the process of breaking up  Pacific Fleet submarines will be reprocessed using a mobile  floating complex of the barge type. This decision was made by  the Russian-Japanese commission working in Vladivostok and  Maritime Kray, which for 18 months has been closely involved in  looking for ways to resolve the problems of the fleet's liquid  radioactive waste.    IZVESTIYA has already reported (11 May 1994) that two  options  were examined at previous stages of the commission's work.  Apart from the barge, the possibility of constructing a  shore-based reprocessing complex was also entertained. But  independent experts from the British consulting firm Crown  Enterprises have calculated that the "floating" option is both  cheaper and more practical. It is well known that a number of  bases on the coast of Maritime Kray are associated with the  so-called waste disposal ship division of the Pacific Fleet. It  is these ships which the barge will "service."    Another reason why the floating complex was chosen to  recycle  liquid radioactive waste was the clear displeasure of the  inhabitants of the city of Bolshoy Kamen, where the main base  for breaking up nuclear submarines is located -- the "Zvezda"  defense plant. This was the planned site of the shore-based  complex. For the same reason of local discontent the tanker  TNT-5 with hundreds of cubic meters of liquid radioactive waste  on board was relocated at the end of May from Bolshoy Kamen to  Pavlovskogo Bay, where it stands to this day.    The skill with which military men have been able to move  around a ship that was written off long ago and is overloaded  with a politically dangerous cargo is amazing. After all, back  in spring Maritime Kray Administration announced there was a  danger of the old tanker sinking spontaneously and liquid  radioactive waste discharging accidentally into the bay.    Now however, after another stage of work by the  Russian-Japanese commission, Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the  kray committee for natural resources, announced that this  notorious liquid radioactive waste is a very insignificant part  of the radiation danger that actually exists on the kray's  territory at the present time. And in announcing this, he cited  the existing ban on shipping solid radioactive waste out of  Maritime Kray via the Trans-Siberian Railroad.    Nevertheless, despite all this, environmentally concerned  Japan is still prepared to donate some of the money earmarked by  its government for Russian disarmament to the plan for  constructing a complex to process liquid radioactive waste. The  commission calculates that three-four weeks will be spent  finalizing the documentation and conditions of tender -- an  international auction-cum-investors' meeting which will specify  a firm that is capable of implementing the plan to construct the  floating complex at a realistically low price and taking into  account all Russian and international environmental safety  requirements.    Applications to participate in the tender have already been  received from 20 firms and companies, mainly from Japan and the  United States. Not one of these firms is Russian, unfortunately.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Radio News"] </F>   [Text] Today's morning newspaper TRABAJADORES published an  editorial on page two under the title, "The Elimination of  Subsidies to Workers Cafeterias." We offer a synopsis of the  text:    The revolutionary government's agreement, which states that  workers' cafeterias will cover costs with their own income, will  become effective 1 July. The deadline may be extended until 31  August, based on exceptions for justifiable cases, to guarantee  better implementation of the measure.    The newspaper TRABAJADORES also stated in today's edition  that it is therefore necessary to consider this measure closely  linked with the efforts exerted [as heard] so that no cafeteria  closes, which would be a severe blow to the workers and  revolutionaries, wherever it occurs. Quite the contrary, the  goal is to make the measure, in an effort to improve the  product's quality, into a challenge -- even motivation -- during  these difficult conditions in which a salary proves insufficient  to fulfill this need.    The newspaper then says the main idea on which to  concentrate  is that the government's measure strives to make cafeterias  feasible -- that is, self-sufficient. Those that produce a  profit will be able to use it to improve their own product.    The TRABAJADORES editorial added: Another essential view is  that once we know how much a cafeteria costs, we must struggle  so its feasibility is the result of an improved product rather  than a mechanical increase in prices.    The TRABAJADORES editorial concluded: To fulfill this  measure, which affects us so directly, in an exemplary way, will  prove the steadfastness with which the Cuban labor movement  endorses the policy we have outlined, including the  participation of all workers, and which our government now  implements to overcome the crisis and come out well ahead,  stronger, and victorious.</p>

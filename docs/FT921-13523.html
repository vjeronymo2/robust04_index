			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Butter mountain in Moscow: A look at the west's humanitarian aid on its murky passage to former Soviet shelves LOCKED up in Moscow's Warehouse No. 9 last week were 59 tonnes of European Community butter. The 25kg blocks are the first instalment of an EC food aid programme to help Moscow and St Petersburg through a winter of harsh economic reforms, but there was already too much butter in the shops because aid is so far proving as out of step with supply and demand as ever the centrally-planned economy was. In Moscow, an old man, challenged by angry people in a bakery queue for buying four loaves of bread, replied that he was going to be eating bread and butter for the entire week. In other republics, such as Ukraine, food supplies are plentiful but medicine is in short supply (a third of patients in the former Soviet Union are getting inadequate medical treatment because of a shortage of drugs). As more than 50 foreign ministers assemble in Washington tomorrow to consider co-ordinating humanitarian aid to the former Soviet Union, they will be trying to answer two questions: what sort of aid is required, and how can it be protected from theft, corruption, and poor distribution? The first question is already partly answered by the conference's list of areas where aid is needed: fuel, food, medicine, housing and technical assistance - including ways of bolstering the commonwealth's capacity to meet its needs in future (for instance in cutting energy waste, estimated at a third of current consumption). The trickiest question, however, is to do with where the aid should end up. Mr Michael Emerson, head of the EC mission in Moscow, admits that the emphasis on Moscow and St Petersburg was partly political. 'If there is social unrest in Moscow and St Petersburg, that is a big problem. If it is in smaller areas, that is not such a threat to the government,' he said in an interview. But conscious that shortages in cities such as Perm in the Urals may be even worse than in Moscow, he expressed hope that the conference would enable other countries to plug gaps elsewhere. Mr Emerson also put his finger on the fact that only a minority of the population needs aid, with the rest able to cope despite considerable hardship: the question is ensuring it gets to the right people. Another problem - which the conference may help tackle but which must be resolved primarily by the former Soviet republics - is the disappearance of even a minimum of co-ordinating authority for aid distribution. Since the union collapsed Ecu1.75bn (Pounds 1.25bn) of EC credits and credit guarantees are lying idle because the republics have no mechanism for sharing it out. The answer to the second question - how to stop the losses - is that observers believe a certain amount of aid is bound to go missing while the corrupt old system is being dismantled. But ways of minimising those losses are already being tried out. Hired to monitor the fate of EC food aid in Moscow alone, Mr Manfred Schneider uses statistical sampling methods to check for losses between the warehouse and the state shops where the butter, and subsequent deliveries of meat and milk powder, are to be sold. The proceeds of the sales are to go into special bank accounts to support the needy. 'We are not in a position to post a guard next to every carcass of meat, nor would we want to,' says Mr Schneider. His first conclusions are encouraging: he is satisfied that none of the butter has gone missing in the week since it was moved to the store rooms of 23 shops in the north and west of Moscow. Mr Schneider's other task is to identify and prevent bottlenecks which may appear in future as aid volumes grow from their present 'test' levels. One such potential bottleneck was identified when it was discovered that the 59 tonnes of EC butter could not be delivered to shops already saturated with older butter imported from other sources. The butter is being held back until there is demand for it. Mr Schneider is also exploring whether aid can help develop market mechanisms, such as pricing which responds to supply and demand. The biggest losses appear to be hitting small parcels sent by well-meaning individuals in the west. They are more difficult to monitor than bulk deliveries by known senders, with some parcels arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport addressed simply to 'The Mayor of Moscow, Russia'. What is the logic for aid at all if the distribution system is still as poor and leaky as it was last year? The difference is that aid this year coincides with reforms already under way - for instance to privatise the distribution and trade networks as well as agriculture - by a government seen by many in the west as meaning business. 'This system is going to waste a good part of this (aid) but this is a mistake which one would allow the country to make because it is part of a process,' explained one western diplomat. 'One would trust the leadership's good intentions and its capacity to correct the mistakes in the course of reforms.'</p>

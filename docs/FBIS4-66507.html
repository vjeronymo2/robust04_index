			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mohamed Lamine: "Blida: Terrorism in Daily </F> Life"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] For two days Blida has been under the total  "supervision" of security forces that laid siege to the city in  order to thwart terrorist designs. Checks and "roundups" have  become more frequent, and residents have the impression that the  state is trying to regain control.    Is Blida a unique city in Algeria? Here is a city, formerly  known for its tolerance, which is a victim of intolerance and  fundamentalism. Here is a city that was one of the beacons of  nationalism and today is home to certain huge fortunes that have  become the main sources financing terrorism.    To walk around Blida today is to be plunged into a  nightmare.  The "city of the roses" is no longer what it once was. Anguish  and fear can be read on people's faces. For the past several  months in this city, terrorists have been imposing their law as  nowhere else, taking advantage of a certain passivity on the  part of residents, even of complicity by some of them. "Habitual  criminals," in the expression used by someone who knows the life  of the city well, have decided that women must wear the veil so  the women of Blida, with some rare exceptions, obey. It is true  that they merely wear a scarf over their heads without adding  the other "ingredients" that would make "Islamic women" of them.    This is not the first time Blida has succumbed to the  fundamentalists' blackmail.    For the past month and a half, the city has been without  newspapers because a letter sent from heaven only knows where  forbade tobacconists from selling newspapers. These tobacconists  have not even tried to fight back and obeyed this "order" with  extraordinary ease.    The Moorish baths are, for the most part, closed to women  because, in the name of Islam, certain individuals decided that  they do not have the right to use them.    Nor have women's hairdressers escaped this exaggerated  machismo on the part of the fundamentalists. All of them closed  then suddenly reopened, letting people wonder about the  fundamentalists' sudden "change of heart."    In Blida meat costs 350 Algerian dinars [DA] whereas  everywhere [else] the armed groups have tried to impose a price  of DA150 Algerian, unsuccessfully, it needs to be mentioned. Is  this because certain wholesale meat dealers in the area, people  wondered, supply funds for terrorism and because the terrorists  thus cannot saw off the branch of the tree on which they are  sitting?    "Blida is on its knees; the city has been taken hostage by  the terrorists," a leading figure in the city told us angrily.  The city is in the grip of criminal groups. These past few  months the presence of security forces was weak. However, Blida  has the reputation of being a garrison city. Has the state  surrendered in the face of the terror imposed by these  adventurers?    Why is there this absence of reaction on the part of the  civilian authorities and the military command in charge of the  area? The latter had every reason to make a show of strength  especially inasmuch as, according to good sources, ambushes were  sprung on military convoys traveling the road between Chrea and  Blida, a road that has come under the absolute control of the  fundamentalists for some time.    Is it because these responsibilities were not assumed in a  normal fashion? According to our sources, certain high-level  officials responsible for running the city do not even live  there and barely spend three days out of seven there.    This slackening off has resulted in grumblings. There has  even been talk of grousing among officers who do not understand  why there is no response when the state has the means to  liquidate the terrorist phenomenon.</p>

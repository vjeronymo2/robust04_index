			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016) and Peng Shujie </F> (1756 2885 2638) ]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng of the  State Council this morning separately attended discussions of  the Henan and Heilongjiang [NPC] delegations at the Great Hall  of the People to hear deputies' opinions and suggestions on the  government work report. He said: Both Henan and Heilongjiang  have scored great achievements in reform and opening up. I hope  all of you will establish confidence, overcome difficulties, and  continue to make use of your assets to further carry out  economic construction.    More than 20 deputies from Henan and Heilongjiang expressed  their views on enlivening large and medium state-owned  enterprises; increasing agricultural investment, conserving  energy, ensuring the smooth implementation of reform measures;  and other issues.    After hearing deputies' opinions and suggestions, Premier Li  Peng spoke on related issues. He said: Since the policy of  reform and opening up was adopted by implementing the household  contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to  output and by developing secondary and tertiary industries,  great changes have taken place in rural areas -- the development  of village and town enterprises is especially notable. We have  been feeding 22 percent of the world's population with only 7  percent of the world's cultivated land -- this is a remarkable  achievement. Currently, we have abundant grain in stock, but we  must not be slack for a moment in grain production.    Li Peng said: Now we have many peasant entrepreneurs in  rural  areas. Most of them have practiced strict self-discipline;  worked deligently; continued to improve themselves  ideologically, politically, and vocationally; and enjoyed a good  reputation. However, a small number of them have changed  qualitatively -- some of them even have committed crimes. This  problem is good food for thought. Part of the reason is because  these people's educational level is low. Some people tend to  commit big mistakes after they become rich and powerful if they  are not subject to supervision. Our cadres and governments at  all levels also need to be supervised. Party organizations at  all levels should cherish, help, and educate those who lead  others to become better off in rural areas, and the masses also  should exercise supervision over them. At the same time, these  people, as peasant entrepreneurs, also should continue to  enhance their understanding of the rule of law.    While discussing transforming large and medium state-owned  enterprises' operating mechanisms, Li Peng said: To establish a  modern enterprise system and to solve problems concerning large  and medium state-owned enterprises, we need to transform the  operating mechanisms and must conduct specific analyses taking  the reality and specific problems into consideration so that we  can suit the remedy to the case. One of the very important  factors that decides an enterprise's efficiency is whether its  products are readily marketable.    Li Peng continued: This year so far we have initiated a  number of major economic reform measures, enabling us to take an  important step toward establishing a socialist merket economic  system. These measures will contribute to fair competition;  they not only play a positive role in the current economic  development, but also have far-reaching significance. Problems  of various natures will come up in the course of implementing  these measures. Our attitude is to solve problems as soon as  they come up.    Li Peng stressed: Energy conservation is important work. We  have scored considerable achievements in this area over the last  few years; however, there is still a lot we can do. Energy is  keenly in short supply in China. We have to invest a lot of  money every year in building power plants and coal mines, and,  compared with advanced countries, our energy utilization  efficiency lags far behind. We need to work hard to catch up.</p>

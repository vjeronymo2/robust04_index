			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Mandela calls for action in Natal Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, yesterday called for military action to help resolve the crisis in Natal province, where more than 80 people have died since the weekend in election-related violence. Mr Mandela declined to give details of his proposal for military action, which he discussed yesterday afternoon with President F W de Klerk. Mr Mandela said political measures should be taken but added 'they must be co-ordinated with measures as far as the military situation is concerned.' It appeared last night that the two men had failed to agree on the details of such action. Mr de Klerk said after the meeting that 'contingency plans' had been prepared to increase the security force deployment in Natal. But he said he wanted to meet Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the chief minister of KwaZulu black homeland and leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, as soon as possible to seek a political solution to the crisis. 'The government is prepared, willing and able to ensure that law and order will be effectively maintained. Natal is a very difficult province to police . . . We will be here in greater numbers in the days and weeks to come to deal with the volatile and explosive situation here,' Mr de Klerk said. Military intervention in Natal could dramatically escalate violence in the region, where several thousand KwaZulu civil servants, yesterday marched in protest at the threat of military action. Some 6,000 civil servants marched through the KwaZulu capital Ulundi to demonstrate support for Chief Buthelezi. They were responding to statements from ANC leaders on Wednesday calling on the multiparty Transitional Executive Council to take over the administration of KwaZulu. Mr de Klerk said last night that the TEC did not have the power to remove Chief Buthelezi. The ANC will today hold an anti-Buthelezi civil servants' protest in the Natal town of Empangeni and a large march through Durban. Meanwhile, ANC leader Nelson Mandela invited Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini to meet him at the home of a prominent Natal businessman to discuss the future of KwaZulu. He said the ANC was committed to the idea that 'his majesty takes his legitimate place in the new South Africa as the rightful monarch of the Zulu people.' However, Mr Mandela laid down a condition for the meeting - that it be private - which may be rejected by the king. The two men were to have met last week in Ulundi, but Mr Mandela cancelled the meeting after Chief Buthelezi invited thousands of the king's supporters to attend. ANC officials said they feared for Mr Mandela's safety at the meeting.</p>

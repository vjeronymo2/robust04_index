			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (6): Every walk of life covered by a franchise - United States FROM baseball to burgers, bookkeeping to baby-minding, franchising in the US is big business. Sales of goods and services by the country's 500,000 franchises is expected to reach Dollars 758.5bn this year, or one-third of all retail sales in the US, according to the International Franchise Association (IFA) based in Washington DC. If their sales were translated into national product, US franchises would qualify as the seventh largest economy in the world. More than 7.2m Americans are employed by franchises in over 60 different industries. Between 1987 and 1989 franchises created 400,000 jobs. In comparison, the 500 biggest companies in the US added just 10,000 new jobs over the same period. A new franchise opens every 16 minutes somewhere in the country. Franchising covers virtually every walk of life. The largest and most established franchise operations are the fast-food outlets such as McDonald's, Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken (rechristened 'KFC' to appeal to a younger audience), the petrol service stations, the auto dealers and the soft drink bottling operations, such as those operated for Pepsico. Then there are the non-food specialist retailers such as Body Shop of the UK, the convenience stores, the hotel/motel chains, the hairdressers, and laundry and dry cleaners. Less well-known are the franchise businesses which clean, paint, decorate or carpet homes throughout the US, or the franchised real estate agencies which buy and sell those homes. Cars can be purchased or rented, tuned and washed through franchises, pets can be cared for, and very young children educated and exercised. An especially fast-growing area of franchising is in providing support to businesses and the services industry, such as equipment rental, printing and copying, accounting, recruitment, and credit collection. On a more glamorous level, American football, baseball, ice hockey and basketball teams in the US are all franchises, owned and run by business consortiums or individual multi-millionaires under the watchful eye of the games' ruling bodies. This year two new baseball franchises will be awarded to extend the reach of the country's national game, with Miami the city likely to be first in line to earn the right to host a team. Although several decades old as a business concept in the US, those in franchising are confident that the there is plenty of room left for new growth. Mr John Naisbitt, a business author who recently conducted a study of franchising on behalf of the IFA, predicts that franchising will account for more than half of all retail sales by the end of the 1990's. Mr John Reynolds of the IFA, however, believes that day could come earlier: 'The growth potential is unlimited at this point.' This confidence has not been dented by the recession in the US; if anything, the nature of franchises makes them better equipped to ride out rough economic times, argues the industry. Although not immune to the nationwide decline in consumer confidence and retail spending, the operators of franchises (franchisees) are afforded considerable protection within the franchising system by the franchisor (the originator and owner of the concept), and by consumers' familiarity with the name and product. Advertising and marketing is usually controlled and paid for by the franchisor, enabling franchisees to reap the benefits of a high public profile yet avoid a cost they would normally be unable to afford. Mr Reynolds of the IFA believes many franchisors have responded to the recession by increasing promotional expenditure to help franchisees maintain sales during the economic downturn. There are economies of scale to be enjoyed, such as co-operative purchasing policies which allow franchises to buy raw materials and goods at cheaper prices. There have also been instances of franchisors helping struggling franchisees by cutting their royalty rates (the share of the profits they receive each year). As Mr Arthur Karp, president of The Great American Cookie company, one of the largest US franchisors, says: 'A franchisee is in business for himself, but not by himself.' One positive feature of the US recession has been the number of what are euphemistically called 'displaced executives' entering the franchise business. The economic downturn, and particularly the restructurings of the financial services industry, has put a lot of experienced, high-income executives, armed with significant capital from their redundancy agreements, out on the street in search of work. An increasing number of these executives, especially those with marketing experience, have put their skills to good use in running a franchise operation. Mr Ron Sommers, a franchise development consultant in New Jersey, estimates there has been a 30 per cent increase in the number of displaced executives entering franchising in the past year. This pool of skilled businessmen has helped franchising maintain its steady growth during the recession. In the past year, the area of franchising that has enjoyed the most rapid growth is franchises in the service sector. The rapid expansion in the services industry throughout the US since the mid-1980s is spilling over into franchising, with increasing numbers of services provided by franchise operations. Social changes, in particular the rise in the number of multi-income families, has also had its effect on franchising. Busy working wives and husbands are turning to franchises to do the chores they would normally handle in their own non-working time, such as laundry, household cleaning and decoration, bookkeeping, and child-minding. Although the rate of failure in franchising is remarkably low (a Commerce Department report estimated only 5 per cent of franchises failed but with some failed business bought back by franchisors, the actual number is probably nearer 10 per cent), market oversaturation remains a problem, and one of the primary causes of business failure. A recent example in the US was the explosion in retail franchises selling computer software and hardware, many of which went to the wall in the late 1980s early 1990s as intense competition led to price-cutting, slashed margins and eventually collapse. Competition in other areas, however, continues to lead to innovation. The fast-food business is undoubtedly oversaturated in the US, and a price war among the leading franchise chains has broken out. The franchises are also facing competition from smaller operators, such as the double-drive-ins, the mobile fast-food outlets which set up camp in shopping malls or at sporting locations and sell cheap meals very quickly to the passing public. In an attempt to compete, the big franchises are looking to develop their own versions of double-drive-ins. Mr Greg Reynolds, vice-president at KFC, says his company is testing the concept of mobile KFC outlets. 'We have to be wherever the customer may be whenever he says: 'I'd like something to eat'.' The big franchisors facing oversaturation at home are looking to expand abroad, especially in Mexico, and continental Europe, where the unification of European Community markets in 1992 and the rebuilding of the old Soviet-bloc offer tempting opportunities. It has missed no-one's attention that the single most successful franchise restaurant run by McDonald's is in Moscow.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            US FRANCHISE SALES (DOLLARS BN)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           1989      1990     1991 (est) Product &amp; trade name     484.9     500.7          525.6 Business format          192.9     213.8          232.9 Total franchising        677.9     714.5          758.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: International Franchise Association  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   US FRANCHISE BUSINESSES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             1989        1990     1991 (est) Product &amp; trade name     139,245     135,097       134,279 Business format          353,253     388,118       409,597 Total franchising        492,498     521,215       543,876  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: International Franchise Association  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    US BUSINESS FORMAT FRANCHISE SALES GROWTH BY CATEGORY (DOLLARS BN)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             1989      1990     1991 (est) Restaurants                 70.1      77.8         85.4 Retailing, non-food         26.7      29.2         31.3 Hotel/motels                21.6      23.8         25.9 Business aids/services      16.9      18.6         20.7 Auto/products &amp; services    12.5      13.8         15.4 Convenience stores          14.3      14.3         14.9 Food non-convenience        10.0      11.7         12.1 Auto/truck rental            6.9       7.3          7.7 Construction, DIY            5.8       6.4          7.1 Miscellaneous                2.0       2.3          2.2 Educational products         1.7       2.0          2.2 Rental equipment             0.7       0.7          0.8 Laundry &amp; dry cleaning       0.4       0.4          0.5 Total                      192.9     213.8        232.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: International Franchise Association  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

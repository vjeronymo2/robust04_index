			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1 KILLED, 7 WOUNDED IN MAJOR TURF BATTLE;  </P> <P> GANGS: POLICE SAY THE SITUATION IS 'TERRIBLE.' VIOLENT OUTBREAKS SPANNING TWO  DAYS KEEP NEIGHBORHOODS EAST OF MACARTHUR PARK IN FEAR.  </P> <P> A major turf battle between gangs fighting for control of a neighborhood west  of downtown Los Angeles erupted Thursday afternoon and spilled into Friday,  claiming one life and leaving at least seven injured, including a pregnant  16-year-old who was shot in the abdomen, police said.  </P> <P> One of the men injured Friday was listed in "significantly grave condition" at  the Hospital of the Good Samaritan with multiple gunshot wounds , hospital  officials said.  </P> <P> A second woman who was walking in the area -- described as one of the most  dangerous in the city -- was left paralyzed from the neck down after she was  hit by a stray bullet Thursday afternoon.  </P> <P> The violence was believed to be associated with a dispute between an  established Latino gang -- the 18th Street gang -- and the more recently formed  Crazy Riders gang, which includes large numbers of Central Americans, Los  Angeles Police Detective Andy Cicoria said.  </P> <P> "This has been one of the busiest days of my life," Cicoria said Friday. "It's  terrible to think that this situation is going on in downtown Los Angeles."  </P> <P> "This is really bad, even for this area," Los Angeles Police Detective Terry  Wessel said. "This is a major problem for such a short period." All the  shootings took place within 24 hours in a two-square-mile area east of  drug-ridden MacArthur Park.  </P> <P> The violence culminated Friday afternoon with the wounding of four youths  identified by police as members of the Crazy Riders. The four, along with  another Crazy Rider member, reportedly drove a black Chevrolet south off 3rd  Street onto Witmer Street -- established 18th Street gang territory. Armed with  baseball bats, tire irons and clubs, they turned into the parking lot behind  the L.A. Downtown Swap Meet, where they confronted 18th Street gang members,  Wessel said.  </P> <P> Outnumbered by their rivals, the intruders jumped back into their car, which  stalled when they tried to flee the scene. They were immediately surrounded by  18th Street gang members who began to beat their car with bats and clubs,  Wessel said.  </P> <P> "One of the suspects outside of the car produced a weapon and fired at least  three shots into the car, striking a passenger and the driver," Wessel said.  </P> <P> Managing to start the car, the five youths drove off and continued south for  four blocks to the corner of Witmer and Wilshire Boulevard, where they collided  head-on with another car. The occupants of that car suffered minor facial cuts.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Sgt. Owen McComb arrived at the scene almost immediately.  </P> <P> "I came up as they were getting out and they tried to assault me with a  baseball bat and tire irons," McComb said. "But they didn't have a 9-millimeter  (pistol) and I did. They dropped their bat and tire irons."  </P> <P> He said four of the men in the car had suffered gunshot wounds but a fifth was  not injured. Three of the wounded were taken to County-USC Medical Center and a  fourth to the Hospital of the Good Samaritan.  </P> <P> All of the shootings occurred in traditionally Mexican neighborhoods that have  been giving way in recent years to an influx of Central Americans.  </P> <P> The Crazy Riders gang, which is about 5 years old, has grown to include at  least 150 members, many of them from Central America, police say. By  comparison, the 18th Street gang is at least 40 years old and has about 500  members, police say.  </P> <P> The shooting incidents began at 4:45 p.m. Thursday when 26-year-old Irma  Rodriguez, "walking on the sidewalk and minding her own business, caught a  stray bullet in the neck," Wessel said. That location is in territory where  Crazy Riders graffiti is spray-painted on many walls and buildings.  </P> <P> Rodriguez, although paralyzed, was listed in stable condition Friday at the  County-USC Medical Center. She was shopping with friends when she passed  suspected gang members who were chasing a man several hundred feet away, Wessel  said.  </P> <P> "One of the men pulled a handgun from his waistband and fired a round at the  fleeing man," Wessel said. "The bullet struck this lady in the neck."  </P> <P> Five hours later and half a block away, a 16-year-old girl was sitting on the  front steps of an apartment building on South Westlake Avenue with about half a  dozen gang members. Witnesses said a car carrying four men sprayed bullets at  the apartment before speeding away.  </P> <P> The girl was struck in the stomach and left knee, Wessel said. She was taken by  friends to the Hospital of the Good Samaritan, where she was listed in stable  condition after stomach surgery, a hospital official said. Hospital officials  said they hope that the surgery saved the fetus. "But it's too early to tell,"  nursing supervisor Gayle Lozyk said.  </P> <P> Officials declined to identify the victim because she is a minor.  </P> <P> Roberto Carrasco, 42, manager of the apartment where the 16-year-old was shot,  suffered a minor injury when a stray bullet grazed his wrist.  </P> <P> In what police believe may be a related incident early Friday, an unidentified  16-year-old Latino died a block and a half away in a shooting in which gang  names were exchanged, Wessel said.  </P> <P> About a dozen youths who said they were members of the Crazy Riders stood  around the entrance of the apartment Friday morning where the 16-year-old girl  and Carrasco were shot. Blood still stained the steps leading up to the  2-year-old building that was pockmarked by the stream of bullets fired from the  passing car the night before.  </P> <P> The manager of the apartment said the pregnant girl was a "home girl" who  associated with the Crazy Riders and whose sister lives in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> The Crazy Riders' placa, or logo, is spray painted on the sides of buildings  along a two-block stretch of Westlake between 7th and 9th streets. Some  merchants and apartment managers say they have to paint over the graffiti  almost weekly to keep it from covering their buildings. A few blocks away,  however, the 18th Street placa is dominant.  </P> <P> Residents of the neighborhood and some merchants say they are fed up with the  violence that has become commonplace.  </P> <P> "I'm moving," said a woman who identified herself only as Dee Dee. She said she  was lying in her first-floor apartment when two shots flew over her head  Thursday night from one of the drive-by shootings.  </P> <P> "It doesn't make any sense," she said, her hands trembling as she took a drag  on a cigarette. "They should make them stop hanging out here."  </P> <P> While gang violence has been most prevalent after dark, some residents say they  now fear going out during daylight as well.  </P> <P> "It goes on almost every night, and now this," said Julia Lopez, who arrived in  Los Angeles from Guatemala two years ago with her husband and three children.  "It scares us very much.  </P> <P> "We came to better our lives here, but it looks like this is no way to live  because there are so many cholos (gang members)," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Abidjan, 16 May (AFP) -- The call for a one-week  strike made on 11 May by the Federation of University and High  School Students [FESCI] was observed only by some students today  at the Abidjan campus where most lectures were given but were  poorly attended. FESCI also announced to the media that five of  its leaders, including deputy general secretary Ble Guirao, were  picked up for interrogation yesterday.    Some 200 people picked up for interrogation on 11 May during  and after a demonstration dispersed by the police on the  university campus were released, according to an official source.    Yesterday evening, in a radio and television message, Semi  Bi  Zan, the rector of the university, called on the students "to go  back to class" to avoid "irreversibly jeopardizing their  university education." He stressed that the strike threatened  "the validity of the current academic year" which belatedly  began in February and is supposed to end in mid-August.    The rector called on the students "to foil the attempt of  the  minority who want to paralyze the university" and assured them  that their "protection" would be guaranteed. This morning  several hundred policemen in uniform or plain clothes were on  the Abidjan campus.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Well-informed sources in Washington yesterday said  that the U.S. Government has formulated a plan to revive the  Middle East peace process and resume the Arab-Israeli  negotiations within a few weeks. The entire peace process has  been jeopardized by the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    The sources indicated that this plan is grounded in  providing  protection for the Palestinians of the occupied territories to  entice the Arab sides back into the negotiations in early April.    News reports from Washington said that, with regard to  protection for the Palestinians, the U.S. Government has  formulated proposals on the measures that can be taken and  announced in order to pacify the Palestinians of the occupied  territories. The reports added that it is not unlikely that the  United States will make an effort to persuade Israel to accept a  reduced presence of unarmed international observers in the  occupied territories as part of protection guarantees for the  Palestinians in accordance with the provisions enshrined in the  Declaration of Principles signed by the Palestinian and Israeli  sides.    The U.S. sources asserted that the U.S. plan, which contains  specific proposals, will be the focus of consultations to be  held with the concerned parties within the next few days,  particularly with [Israeli] Prime Minister Rabin, who is  scheduled to visit the United States next week.    The sources noted that an outline of this plan was discussed  by senior officials of the U.S. State Department and a PLO  delegation headed by brother Dr. Nabil Sha'th during the  meetings they held recently.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher yesterday. He also met with the U.S. team assigned  the task of following up on the Middle East peace talks.    The sources pointed out that it is not unlikely that the  consultations held in this regard will be continued with the  concerned parties during a tour of the region by Dennis Ross in  the second half of March. The sources went on to say that  Christopher himself might undertake this mission if he finds  that this is warranted to ensure the reactivation of the peace  process and bring it back on track as soon as possible.</p>

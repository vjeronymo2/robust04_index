			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Yanchenkov: "Parliament Apparatus Ready </F> for Work"]    [Text] That is what Vladimir Podoprigora, leader of the  Russian Federal Assembly apparatus, stated on the eve of the  opening of the first State Duma session.    In contrast to the apparatus of the former Russian Supreme  Soviet, which numbered 1,350 people, he noted, the new  parliament's apparatus will consist of 537 employees. Since the  Russian Federal Assembly consists of two independent chambers  (the Federation Council and the State Duma) there will  correspondingly be two secretariats in the apparatus.    A workable nucleus has been formed. The first experience of  work with the deputies' commissions created by the chambers has  shown that the parliamentary apparatus workers can fully cope  with the set tasks.    The testing which has been carried out on the staffers has  confirmed their high level of professional training. That is  understandable, for 90 percent of the apparatus workers are  employees of the former Supreme Soviet. These people have  resolved and are capable of resolving tasks of any complexity.  What tasks will be set them, and by whom, is another question.    The main task of the Russian parliamentary apparatus is to  ensure the effect work of the deputies, to supply them with the  necessary information in an entirely complete and objective  manner, and to promote the high-quality formulation of the  decisions the deputies will make. And they must do everything  to ensure that they exert no influence in any way on the nature  of the decisions which are made or on their content.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEANING UP THEIR ACT;  </P> <P> SPRAY-PAINT VANDALS SENTENCED TO REMOVE GRAFFITI UNDER NEW COURT POLICY  </P> <P> A 20-year-old gang member, leaning on the back of a graffiti cleanup truck  Thursday, acknowledged that putting gang markings on walls is a lot easier than  taking them off.  </P> <P> "You 'strike up' a wall without really thinking about it. You just do it  because there is nothing better to do," he said of his past work with a can of  spray paint. "When you've got to clean it off, then you know it takes a lot of  work and it costs a lot of money. It makes you think."  </P> <P> He should know. After pleading guilty to misdemeanor vandalism this month after  his arrest for defacing a park wall, he was sentenced to 100 hours of community  service -- cleaning graffiti off public buildings, buses and structures.  </P> <P> The young man's lesson is one that authorities hope to begin teaching more  often.  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials announced Thursday that ordering vandals to "clean up  their own mess" will become a sentencing standard in a new effort to crack down  on the graffiti problem.  </P> <P> "We are going to vigorously prosecute these individuals," City Councilman  Richard Alatorre said during a press conference at a graffiti-marred bus stop  on Kingston Avenue near downtown. "We are going to force the individuals to  clean up their own mess. We have gotten to the point in this city that we are  tired of spending the money" to hire cleaners.  </P> <P> Alatorre said that more than $50 million is spent in California each year to  clean up graffiti.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RTD Spends $8 Million  </P> <P> The Southern California Rapid Transit District spends about $8 million annually  to clean its fleet of 2,400 buses.  </P> <P> Alatorre, flanked by representatives of the RTD, Los Angeles police and the  city attorney's office, said previous efforts to crack down on inner city  graffiti were "haphazard." The new effort will have "all of the components" of  the criminal justice system working together, he said.  </P> <P> The first step, officials agree, is catching more of the vandals.  </P> <P> Authorities said RTD police have created a graffiti task force and Los Angeles  police will also increase efforts to catch vandals. But they declined to reveal  specific methods that will be used.  </P> <P> Bob Ferber, assistant supervisor of the city attorney's gang unit, said his  office will now routinely seek a two-part sentence for individuals convicted of  the misdemeanor.  </P> <P> "We are going to go for as much jail time as we can get. And no matter what we  get, we are going to insist that (the defendants) be forced to clean up the  graffiti," Ferber said.  </P> <P> Jaime R. Corral, presiding judge of the Northeast Juvenile Justice Center, said  several judges have ordered vandals to clean up their own graffiti in the past,  but the new effort will make such orders a matter of policy.  </P> <P> "These kids will be automatically expected to do some graffiti cleanup," he  said. "It will be a deterrent, we hope."  </P> <P> Gene Anderson, the justice center's coordinator of programs for juvenile  offenders, also praised the new effort.  </P> <P> "It gives me another place to put kids where the punishment is more  appropriate," he said.  </P> <P> Civic organizations such as Community Youth Gang Services will supervise the  graffiti cleanups, officials said. Alatorre said the city has set aside  $500,000 to fund the organizations that will handle the supervision.  </P> <P> After Thursday's press conference, a Youth Gang Services team set to work  cleaning graffiti off the walls at the Kingston Avenue bus stop. One member of  the team was the 20-year-old gang member. He declined to give his name. He said  he had been arrested for painting the initials of his gang, Marijuanos Locos  Sur, on a wall in South Los Angeles.  </P> <P> He said it will probably take him three weeks to work off his 100 hours of  community service and added that his graffiti-writing days are over.  </P> <P> "It has gotten me off the walls," he said. "I won't drop out of the gang, no.  But I think I'll leave the graffiti to the younger guys after this."  </P></p>

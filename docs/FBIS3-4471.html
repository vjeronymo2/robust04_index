			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Special article by reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--At  present, there are more than 150,000 foreign-invested  enterprises on the mainland with total contracted investments of  $200 billion and actual investments exceeding $60 billion. The  large gap between the above two amounts is mainly because quite  a few projects are divided into initial and succeeding stages or  scheduled for first, second, and third phases, so that funds are  made available in different lots. There are also some  foreign-invested companies which exist in name only but do  nothing except have their companies registered and false  investment amounts reported. These are virtually "shell  companies." Recently, action has been taken in several mainland  cities to screen and reorganize these "shell companies."    It has been reported that business licenses for 26 false  foreign-invested enterprises have been withdrawn in Wuhan  recently, and a short time ago, licenses of 55 foreign-invested  enterprises with only empty titles were also withdrawn in  Guangzhou. In several cities and towns in Guangdong, many  foreign-invested commercial housing construction projects have  been suspended after starting for a short period owing to the  unavailability of funds, or have gone bankrupt after receiving  deposits from property buyers. These companies are also being  screened now.    Some mainland enterprises wanted to set up joint ventures  with foreign investors and made unilateral concessions in rights  and benefits to them. Taking advantage of their aspirations and  the loopholes in management, some foreign businessmen only  signed contracts with mainland counterparts and provided some of  the equipment as shares on their part, while delaying making  funds available for a long time. As a result, abnormal  phenomena have emerged in which foreign investors made profits,  Chinese partners suffered losses, and enterprises operated in  the red.    A survey conducted by the Beijing Institute of Planning and  Economics pointed out: The increasingly serious problem of  losses in foreign-invested enterprises has aroused attention  from pertinent departments. It has been learned that the  foreign-invested enterprises in Beijing recorded a total deficit  of approximately 660 million yuan in 1992, with 50 percent, and  more than 60 percent in individual trades, of enterprises  suffering losses. Although the accumulated losses showed a  slight decline in the first half of last year, the deficit  amount still increased by 26 percent as compared with the  corresponding period in 1992.    The survey also pointed out: Foreign investors have  transferred profits through various channels, which has given  rise to losses and tax evasion in a number of enterprises. By  and large, foreign investors employed the following four methods  to transfer profits: 1) They set high prices for the equipment  they imported, passed inferior equipment off as superior, took  away part of the profits in advance, and earned money by  magnifying the ratio of investment and returns. For example, a  foreign investor negotiated with several provinces and cities on  the mainland to set up joint ventures for the development of  five similar projects, for which he imported five sets of  equipment at the price of $2.4 million each. In fact, all the  equipment was assemblies of worn parts from abroad with a total  value of less than $900,000. 2) By controlling import and  export channels, they quote high prices for imported materials  while reducing prices for exported goods, and then they transfer  the profits to companies outside the territory. 3) By  employing such means as irrational apportionment of charges,  cost calculation, and so on, they transfer profits, increase  losses, and evade taxes. 4) They avail themselves of the  loopholes in policies to falsely report losses, purposely  delaying the fiscal year showing a surplus, and effecting tax  evasion. For example, a total of 4,838 foreign- invested  enterprises reported losses in Guangdong in 1991, which  accounted for 53 percent of enterprises having submitted their  final settlement, and the amount of their losses totalled 3.66  billion yuan. However, the so-called losing enterprises are  constantly expanding their production scale and increasing their  profits year after year, and have become "enterprises which see  endless deficits but never tumble."    In addition, there are also foreign investors who work hand  in glove with the Chinese personnel to swell their personal  fortunes while causing losses to enterprises. Others take  advantage of the weakness of the Chinese personnel, who lack  accounting and legal knowledge, to control operational and  management power and play tricks in import and export trade, so  that they make profits at the expense of the losses incurred by  enterprises.    A mainland expert maintains that to put an end once and for  all to the loss of national capital in the joint-venture  enterprises, apart from plugging the loopholes in the  regulations on joint ventures, Chinese personnel in joint  ventures must enhance their understanding of cost accounting and  law. This should be taken as an essential qualification to work  in a joint venture.</p>

The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

The new interpretation of the rule allows dealers under certain circumstances to satisfy the Rule G&hyph;15(a)'s requirement that municipal securities customers be provided a ``written'' confirmation by using the Thomson Financial Services, Inc.

The texts of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV, below. MSRB has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSRB's rule change allows the requirement of Rule G&hyph;15(a), that customers be provided ``written'' confirmation at or before the completion of a transaction in municipal securities, to be satisfied by a contract confirmation message (``CCM'') sent through the TFS OASYS Global System. The following conditions must be met before the OASYS Global System may be used: (i) The customer and dealer have both agreed to use the OASYS Global system for purposes of confirmation delivery; (ii) the CCM includes all information required by Rule G&hyph;15(a); and (iii) all other applicable requirements and conditions concerning the OASYS Global system expressed in the Commission's October 8, 1993, no-action letter concerning Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b&hyph;10 must continue to be met. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The no-action letter of October 8, 1993, stated that the Commission staff will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if broker-dealers rely on the OASYS Global system's CCMs to satisfy the requirements of a confirmation of Rule 10b&hyph;10 of the Act provided (i) The CCMs can be printed or downloaded by the participants, (ii) the recipient of a CCM must respond through the system affirming or rejecting the trade, (iii), the CCMs will not be automatically deleted by the system, and (iv) the use of the system by the participants ensures that both parties to the transaction have the capacity to receive the CCMs. Letter from Catherine McGuire, Chief Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, to MariAnne Pisarri, Esq., Pickard and Djinis (October 8, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSRB understands that TFS's OASYS Global system is not a registered securities clearing agency and is not linked with other registered securities clearing agencies for purposes of automated confirmation/acknowledgment required under Rule G&hyph;15(d). Therefore, under these circumstances, use of the OASYS system will not constitute compliance with Rule G&hyph;15(d) regarding automated confirmation/acknowledgement. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> MSRB Rule 15(d)(ii) states, among other things, that no broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer who is or whose clearing agent is a participant in a clearing agency registered with the Commission shall effect a transaction in any municipal security to which a CUSIP number has been assigned on a delivery-versus-payment basis or on a receipt-versus-payment basis for the account of a customer whose clearing agent with respect to such transfer is a participant in such a clearing agency or in a clearing agency interfaced or otherwise linked with such a clearing agency unless the facilities of such clearing agency or the facilities of a clearing agency interfaced or otherwise linked with such a clearing agency are used for the confirmation and acknowledgment of such transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSRB has adopted the rule change pursuant to Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides that MSRB's rules shall: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSRB does not believe that the rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because it will apply equally to all brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers. Moreover, the rule change only applies when dealers and customers agree between themselves to use TFS's OASYS Global system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

MSRB's consideration of the proposed rule change was prompted by an interpretive inquiry from TFS regarding the interpretation of Rule G&hyph;15(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and subparagraph (e)(1) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder because it relates to the interpretation of the meaning of an existing rule. At any time within sixty days of filing of the rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

The advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) considers regulatory approaches that would maintain adequate assurance of steam generator tube integrity while allowing a more appropriate approach to steam generator surveillance and maintenance activities at nuclear power plants. The NRC is issuing this ANPRM to invite comments, advice, and recommendations from interested parties on the proposed steam generator rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The comment period expires December 5, 1994.

Industry actions have been effective in controlling many of the forms of degradation experienced in late 1970s and early 1980s; however, new degradation mechanisms continue to occur. State-of-the-art nondestructive inspection and tube repair methods have improved significantly in recent years. Changes in types of degradation being experienced and improvements in inspection and tube repair technology have made the NRC's existing regulatory requirements and guidance out-of-date and in some cases overly conservative or impractical. In addition, the NRC staff has determined that factors other than the material tube degradation should be considered when assessing tube integrity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The objective of the proposed rule would be to maintain steam generator tube integrity such that there is an extremely low probability of steam generator tube leakage that could result in core damage or otherwise exceed allowable off-site doses while allowing a reasonable approach to steam generator surveillance and maintenance activities (i.e., degradation-specific management). A performance-based rule with quantitative criteria would achieve the desired goals without being prescriptive in nature. A flexible rule would accommodate changes in operating experience and technology while giving incentives for the industry to continue to improve the state-of-the art tube inspection and repair methods. Incorporation of an integrated approach considers the overall factors of safety and risk, including systems and radiological assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff's rulemaking effort would establish a flexible framework that allows steam generator tube integrity to be addressed using a degradation-specific management approach. This approach involves establishing and implementing preventive measures such as inspection, evaluation, and repair criteria that are applicable to distinct steam generator degradation mechanisms, and default criteria for the remaining forms of steam generator tube degradation where experience does not enable a degradation-specific approach. The NRC staff's rulemaking effort would also address issues relevant to containment bypass probability and severe accidents associated with bypass of containment. The NRC staff would consider application of more realistic analytical assumptions, as well as defense-in-depth measures that could be implemented to further ensure safety. The proposed rule would acknowledge new degradation mechanisms and technological advances in inspection techniques to improve characterization of these mechanisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recognizing that the steam generator rule would contain broad criteria while an associated regulatory guide would contain more detailed guidance, a proposed outline of the NRC staff's perception of the necessary elements of a steam generator rule follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=2 --> (a) Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Licensee Surveillance and Maintenance Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=2 --> (i) Preservice and Inservice Inspection Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Water Chemistry Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Tube Integrity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Repair Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Repair Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Nondestructive Examination Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Normal Operating Primary-to-Secondary Leakage Monitoring/Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=2 --> (2) Accident Mitigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=2 --> (i) Accident Condition Primary-to-Secondary Leakage Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Operator Training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

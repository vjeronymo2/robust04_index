			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS' PHILLIPS BADLY BEATEN  </P> <P> Joe Phillips, the Chargers' 6-foot-5, 315-pound starting nose tackle, was  hospitalized after being severely beaten by three men early Wednesday when he  left a Mission Beach restaurant.  </P> <P> Dr. Lee Rice announced through a team spokesman that Phillips suffered a  fractured nose, fractures to the eye orbit, a concussion and multiple bruises  and abrasions. Rice said Phillips will undergo surgery to repair damage to his  nose and eye orbit within the week.  </P> <P> Police had earlier reported that Phillips also had skull fractures and three  broken ribs, but the Charger spokesman said those reports were inaccurate.  </P> <P> It is not known how long Phillips will be hospitalized, but Rice said he is not  expected to return to practice for at least eight weeks. The Chargers placed  Phillips on the reserve non-football injury list and signed safety Michael  Brooks. The club has the option of not paying Phillips, but General Manager  Bobby Beathard said, "The club never considered it. He will be paid.  </P> <P> "My God, it's tragic to have something like this happen," Beathard said. "From  what I've been told, he got the living hell beat out of him."  </P> <P> Phillips, known for his tough-guy image, is considered the Chargers' strongest  player. "Those guys must have been sneaky or tough," defensive line coach  Gunther Cunningham said.  </P> <P> Said Charger defensive lineman Les Miller: "It's a big city, and it can happen  to anybody. What can you say? You feel bad, you feel anger and you feel  helpless. I hope they find out who did it. I know I'd like to find them."  </P> <P> No arrests have been made, but police have interviewed at least three people  who witnessed the incident, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. He declined  comment on whether any suspects have been identified. The witnesses will be  interviewed again today, police said, because of conflicting accounts.  </P> <P> A motive has not been determined, but Phillips was not robbed, Robinson added.  </P> <P> Robinson said Phillips, 27, was being treated in the intensive care unit of  Sharp Memorial Hospital, but a hospital spokeswoman would not release his  condition or even confirm that Phillips was there.  </P> <P> Police said the attack occurred sometime after 1 a.m. when Phillips was walking  to his car after leaving Saska's, a restaurant at 3768 Mission Blvd. A witness  told a Times reporter the incident occured between 2:15 a.m. and 2:30 in  Saska's parking lot, a block north of the restaurant.  </P> <P> Phillips was transported by ambulance to Mission Bay Hospital and later  transferred to Sharp.  </P> <P> Police said Phillips was accompanied by a woman at the time of the attack and  that she was also assaulted. A Mission Bay hospital spokesman said no woman  required medical treatment at the time Phillips was admitted. Police declined  to identify the woman but said she was not Phillips' wife.  </P> <P> The witness, who detailed Wednesday's incident for the Times but asked not to  be identified, said a car pulled up and parked on the street next to where  Phillips and the woman were walking. Several residents said the area has  recently been plagued by crime.  </P> <P> Words were exchanged between Phillips and the assailants, police said, and the  assailants jumped Phillips. The three men, one wearing steel-toed boots, beat  and kicked Phillips repeatedly, Robinson said.  </P> <P> The witness said that Phillips was knocked to the ground and that the woman was  kicked repeatedly by one of the assailants. The witness said Phillips' T-shirt  was ripped from his body.  </P> <P> At that time, the witness said, a second assailant smashed the windows on  Phillips' car with his fist, and a third attacker chased after a man who was  walking toward the scene.  </P> <P> "They weren't big like him," the witness said. "They were small guys."  </P> <P> After the assault, the witness said, the three men got into the car and drove  off. The witness said Phillips got up shortly after and, with assistance from  the woman, was able to walk to the ambulance, which arrived about five minutes  later.  </P> <P> "There was just blood all over his face," the witness said. "It was not a  pretty scene. It was pretty bad. He was pretty shaken up. The girl was really  freaking out. It was gross."  </P> <P> The witness said the woman screamed: "I can't believe you're hitting a girl, I  can't believe you're hitting a girl."  </P> <P> Police and the witness were unclear whether the assailants were armed or if  Phillips was able to fight back.  </P> <P> Tom Saska, a partial owner who of the restaurant who was not there at the time,  said Phillips comes in about once a week. He said a bartender told him Phillips  entered the restaurant after midnight and ordered food.  </P> <P> Saska said Phillips called him from the hospital Wednesday, explained the  incident and asked if Saska knew the assailants or had seen them before. Saska  said he did not.  </P> <P> "He said he got the . . . beat out of him," Saska said. "He sounded pretty  upset. It doesn't make sense. I've worked at Saska's for 17 years, and  nothing's ever happened like that around here."  </P> <P> Phillips talked briefly with police Wednesday and is scheduled to be  interviewed in more detail today.  </P> <P> "We have not completed the investigation," Robinson said.  </P> <P> Phillips spoke with Cunningham and defensive coordinator Ron Lynn. But his  wife, Cynthia, told the media Phillips would be unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Coach Dan Henning told his players of Phillips' situation earlier Wednesday but  said he was sketchy on details.  </P> <P> Phillips, who has been attending law classes at the University of San Diego  while playing football, joined the Chargers as a replacement player during the  players' strike in 1987. He has started 38 of the past 45 games.  </P> <P> "Les (Miller) will be the nose guard on first down, and George Hinkle will be  the starter on third down," Cunningham said. "But Joe was having a great  season; he was playing outstanding football. He's the life of the party  so-to-speak -- that's the part I miss already."  </P> <P> Staff writer T.J.

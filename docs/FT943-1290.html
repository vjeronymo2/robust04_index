			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Sport: Just the ticket, mate - Skiing Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world trip. It would seem natural, we were told, 'for Julie Andrews to suddenly cavort through the wild, flower-strewn hills' at Thredbo, New South Wales. Sadly, during our visit, she appeared to have stayed at home in Gstaad. Still, you can understand the attempts by the resort's marketing department to depict it as something out of the European Alps, in spite of the ubiquitous snow gums and crimson rosellas. It does have a most attractive mountain village and the skiing, on balance, is probably the best in Australia. But it is debatable whether 'hot runs like Cannonball, Funnel Web and Michael's Mistake' have 'world-wide reputations', good as they are, and whether 'every metre is groomed like a Test match wicket'. This kind of hype is encouraged by intense rivalry between Thredbo and its biggest rival, neighbouring Perisher Valley. Until recently, Perisher claimed the highest lift in Australia: the Mt Perisher double chair. Then, Thredbo had it surveyed on the sly and announced that, because the lift did not quite reach the summit, it had the highest - Karel's T-bar, at just under 6,675 ft - by just over one skier's height: 6ft 6 1/2 in. Our last resort in Australia was Perisher's other big rival, Mount Blue Cow. Built only seven years ago, the name is said to be inspired by a cow belonging to a stockman's wife which strayed into the high pastures one autumn and was found frozen to death the following spring. Recently, The Cow, Australia's newest resort, bought one of the oldest - its neighbour, Guthega. It was here that we skied our last trails in Australia, Wombat's Lament and Mother-in-Law, after that we headed for Sydney en route to New Zealand's South Island. 'No dramas, mate,' is a common saying Down Under. But, suddenly, there were. While we were having breakfast overlooking Sydney harbour, our flight to Christchurch was taking off without us. Our tickets were printed last year - and Air New Zealand's schedules had changed so that our flight left at 8am instead of 11.30. At the airport, we were told the next flight would not get us to Christchurch until after midnight. The grim prospect loomed of a 300-mile drive back to Thredbo to ski. 'Do you have a flight going anywhere in New Zealand?' we asked, desperately. There was one to Wellington in half an hour. It was not where we wanted to go, but we grabbed it. As long as we could fly on to Christchurch and reach Mt Hutt before midnight, we would ski that day. By the time we had neared the bottom of the long, winding dirt road to the mountain, it was 9pm. Would the road be open? Would we be able to reach snow? Would there be anyone there? To our relief, the place was humming. Soon Lucy and I were rumbling up the mountain in snow cats for two mile-long descents, our paths lit by powerful arc-lights on the machines. Our record of skiing every day was intact - just.</p>

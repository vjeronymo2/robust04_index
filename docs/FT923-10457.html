			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Print union may test its strength: Casual labour brings the threat of action ST IVES, the second-biggest commercial printer in Britain, is drifting into a dispute with the GPMU, the print union, which may prove an important test of union power in the general printing industry. The issue at St Ives is the use of casual labour. The union objects to the fact that, to cover for peaks in work flow, St Ives is employing a growing number of temporary workers in the unskilled finishing area, where magazines and books are bound and packed. The dozens of temporary workers hired from employment agencies earn Pounds 3 an hour, compared with the hourly rate for full-time workers of Pounds 5.85. The dispute is typical at this point in the business cycle. Business remains too uncertain to increase permanent staffing but surges of work require extra labour. The pattern will be familiar to managers and union officials in many other industries. But, for the printing industry, it may have an additional significance. The breaking of union power in the national newspaper industry in the 1980s did not, on the surface, spread to the general printing industry. Some analysts, however, believe that a combination of labour law reforms, technological change and recession has 'hollowed out' union power in general printing, too, over the past few years. It is true that industrial disputes have been rare in the 1990s, and print managers have generally got what they wanted on flexibility and on changing working practices, especially in machine rooms. Union derecognition has been rare, though. Print workers remain among the best organised and best paid in the country - at St Ives, the average shopfloor worker earns Pounds 25,000, according to the company. The perishability of their product, at least in sectors such as magazines, still gives the unions industrial clout. Moreover, the merger of two leading print unions to form the GPMU may also help in resisting the hostile trends. To date, print managers have not tested the hypothesis that union power has crumbled. BPCC, Britain's biggest printer, did provoke a rash of disputes earlier this year as it attempted to reduce overcapacity. Yet the union claims to have emerged unscathed and, on the crucial issue of casualisation, it says that BPCC agreed to pay temporary workers the same as full-time workers. St Ives, one of the most union-friendly companies in the industry, is run by Mr Bob Gavron, an urbane Labour supporter, and is not cut out to be the News International of the general printing industry. The company said yesterday: 'We don't want to pick a fight with the union, but we need temporary labour because of the nature of the work flow and we don't want to pay more than the market rate for it.' The company adds that it has gone to great lengths to keep its 3,000 full-time staff through the recession, even when there has not been enough work for many of them. Mr Tony Dubbins, leader of GPMU, is not impressed. He believes that St Ives has taken a decision to 'casualise' the finishing area and that, if it succeeds, the rest of the industry will follow. Hence the 1,000 GPMU members who work in the seven St Ives web-offset plants  -printing magazines such as The Economist, Company and New Woman - will next week start to ballot on industrial action. Initially they will be balloted on taking action short of a strike - an overtime ban. If that does not bite, St Ives may face the most serious printing strike for years. Will well paid print workers go on strike in a recession and risk losing their jobs? It is not something St Ives wants to test. But it may be doing so in a few weeks' time.</p>

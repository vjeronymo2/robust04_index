			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Alternative to Treasury needed Sir, I was interested to read that Sir John Banham is advocating the abolition of the Treasury ('Banham calls for Treasury abolition', March 21). When I proposed this desirable change some years ago (including in your Letters page), it was greeted with a certain amount of derision. I was not sure even that Mr Banham (as he was then) was convinced, when I put it to him during a coffee break at one of the Anglo-German Konigswinter conferences in Cambridge some time in the mid to late 1980s. I have not read his book, but I do not think that his proposed institutional arrangements would work. The Treasury should become the Ministry of Economics, and a new financially literate and numerate Ministry of Finance should deal with budgeting and control. With other much-needed tidying up of departments to produce greater focus and co-ordination, there need be no net increase in either departments or staff, and the changes would make co-ordination with other EU states simpler.

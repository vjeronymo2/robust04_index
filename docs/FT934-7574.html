			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Commons to vote soon - Sunday shopping THE BILL to reform the outmoded Sunday shopping laws of England and Wales is likely to be among the first to be introduced and could be one of the most fiercely debated of the session. The first reading is expected within days. The date being tipped for the second reading is November 29, when MPs will vote on the principle of reforming the 1950 Shops Act, and on the controversial issue of whether the Bill provides adequate protection for Sunday workers. A free vote on the three options for reform could be as early as December 8. Following the decision by Keep Sunday Special Campaign and Retailers for Shops Act Reform to combine their two options, the four choices in the draft bill published in July have been reduced to three. They are: Total deregulation. Partial deregulation (proposed by the Shopping Hours Reform Council), with small shops allowed to open at will, but larger shops restricted to six hours. Strict regulation (the KSSC/RSAR option), with large stores allowed to open only on the four Sundays before Christmas, but DIY and garden centres, and some small shops able to open every Sunday. If no option gained an overall majority in December, the Bill would proceed through standing committee and report stages with all options in place, and MPs would get another opportunity to select one option at the third reading, probably in February or March. A group of lawyers involved in litigation on existing Sunday trading law warned recently that some of the changes proposed by lobby groups would create confusion and uncertainty for retailers, shoppers and the courts. They warned that attempts to allow small shops to open for longer than large ones might lead to long disputes about the sizes of shops.</p>

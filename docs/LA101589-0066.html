			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOME: THE CHANGING FACE OF SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD: RESIDENTS STRUGGLE TO PRESERVE SMALL-CITY LIFE STYLE THREATENED  BY HIGH-PRICED HOMES, COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT.  </P> <P> Men were warned to blindfold their women while passing through Santa Monica at  the turn of the century because it was such a tough town. Saloons were  everywhere, and park benches were "strewn with unsavory characters."  </P> <P> According to the history books, a well-to-do citizen led the fight to close  Santa Monica's bars by offering to pay the city what it would lose in licensing  fees. He won the fight, and Santa Monica left its frontier reputation behind.  </P> <P> And today, Santa Monica residents are fighting still, struggling to preserve a  quality of life that is quickly disappearing because of high-priced homes and  commercial development.  </P> <P> Not only are traditional neighborhoods being disrupted by new building and  heavy traffic but new home buyers tilt the city's old economic balance toward  the wealthy.  </P> <P> The 96,000 residents of Santa Monica like the 3-square-mile city just the way  it is, and if it were up to some they would close its gates to protect the  pleasures of small-city life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Once Quiet Community  </P> <P> They enjoy their 15-plus-mile bicycle paths, four-minute emergency response  from police and fire departments, two hospitals, a college, a thriving art  community, a public bus system and a pier with a carousel.  </P> <P> When Roy and Maxine Naylor moved to the Sunset Park area of Santa Monica in the  1950s, Santa Monica was still a quiet ocean-side community.  </P> <P> The Naylors raised four children in a California bungalow they bought for less  than $20,000. Today their children cannot afford to buy a home in the  neighborhood they grew up in, where prices now start at $400,000.  </P> <P> "I wish we'd bought property when it was cheap," Maxine Naylor said. "I'm  amazed at values now."  </P> <P> The Naylors have remodeled their home three times, enclosing a porch and adding  onto the kitchen. Many residents choose to remodel rather than move because of  the familiarity of the neighborhood. "Almost half of the people who moved in  about the same time we did are still here," she said.  </P> <P> Red Erickson has been selling real estate for 26 years from his Montana Avenue  office, and remembers that the now-costly homes of Sunset Park were tract homes  developed on open fields for the Douglas Aircraft workers.  </P> <P> Today, Sunset Park is one of Santa Monica's two solidly residential areas,  albeit the less prestigious community. The prime real estate area is the  exclusive north of Montana section, where former $30,000 homes now sell for an  average of $750,000 and what was once considered high-grade housing at $50,000  now sells for $2 million.  </P> <P> A house on La Mesa Drive, considered the most expensive street in Santa Monica,  recently sold for a record $4 million. This street, where comedian Mel Brooks  and actress wife Anne Bancroft live, recently had a bargain for under $3  million dollars, but that's the lowest-priced home in the area.  </P> <P> Erickson said there are currently 55 houses for sale over the $1 million dollar  level, and they are all north of Montana.  </P> <P> Who's buying these houses?  </P> <P> "My last eight sales have been to developers (who often tear down the existing  and build a new, bigger home for resale) and buyers of Korean, Chinese and  Japanese descent," said John Richards of Jon Douglas Co.  </P> <P> "First-time buyers are priced out of the market, because sellers can't resist  the all-cash deals or the 50% down sale," he said. "Sellers feel secure with  contingency-free offers. Even physical inspections and termite reports are  being waived."  </P> <P> Also driving home prices up is the fact that Santa Monica doesn't have a large  housing stock. Kenyon Webster, principal planner for the city, reported that  "of the 47,000 housing units in the city, only 7,700 are single-family houses.  The remaining 78%, according to a 1980 census, are renter-occupied."  </P> <P> That number is changing monthly, because of the removal of rental units by  building owners fed up with the low return on apartments under the city's  strict rent control laws. Owners are either leaving their units vacant or  giving them to family members. Some are being torn down and rebuilt as  condominiums.  </P> <P> Rent-controlled apartments range from $235 for a one-bedroom unit to $500 for  two bedrooms.  </P> <P> Another prime residential area is north of Wilshire and west of 22nd Street,  where streets have college names and houses sell for $800,000 on Berkeley Hill.  A tear-down will sell for about $600,000, while a livable house can still be  bought for $700,000, Richards said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Condos Next Choice  </P> <P> If a buyer still wants to live north of Wilshire but can't afford a house,  Richards said condos are the next affordable housing.  </P> <P> "But there aren't too many new ones. A single-level, two-bedroom, two-bath  conversion north of Wilshire is selling between $260,000-$275,000. A townhouse  built after 1982 is in the high $300s-low $400s. . . ."  </P> <P> Tom and Caroline Carroll moved to the Sunset Park area a year ago with their  8-year-old son after renting in West Los Angeles. She's a facility planner at  UCLA, and he's the executive director of the new 3rd Street Promenade in Santa  Monica's revitalized downtown area.  </P> <P> They paid in the mid-$300,000 range for a 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom,  one-bath house, managing the down payment by getting relatives together to  invest in the property. According to Tom Carroll, the value of the house has  already gone up, and it has been worth the sacrifice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Back to Downtown  </P> <P> Carroll is a member of the team responsible for bringing people back to Santa  Monica's downtown area. The once-popular outdoor mall fell on hard times and  became a depressed area. Santa Monica's pier, considered the soul of Santa  Monica, is also under development, and blueprints promise a family-oriented  entertainment center.  </P> <P> Beyond these two projects, it's hard to find any consensus regarding the  proposed 8.3 million square feet of commercial development. There are at least  three petitions being circulated to stop growth.  </P> <P> Most people, like Caroline Carroll, want to protect the privileges of living in  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "I don't want to entice anyone to come to Santa Monica," she said. "I want to  keep it the way it is. It feels like a small town. Services are generous, the  air is nice and it's family-oriented."  </P> <P> But development is not the only threat to the way of life in the city,  residents say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crime by Homeless  </P> <P> Santa Monica is drawing homeless people by the thousands. More than 200  residents at a recent gathering blamed the city's generous services for the  influx of the homeless.  </P> <P> The majority of the homeless people are harmless, but crime is increasing by  this group. Recently, two lifeguards were attacked by a homeless man wielding a  corkscrew.  </P> <P> "There were 4,700 citizen-initiated calls in 1989, and 1,120 of those calls  were because of transients," said Sgt. John Miehle of the Santa Monica Police  Department. "We spent 410 hours running down these complaints.  </P> <P> "This year, we had 276 burglaries, and 37% of them were committed by  transients, five of the seven murders were committed by transients on  transients, and eight of the 18 rapes were perpetrated by transients."  </P> <P> The business community, working through the Chamber of Commerce, demanded city  action on the homeless problem.  </P> <P> "The mayor admitted we have a problem, and concrete action like forbidding  panhandling and stepping up security in the parking structures has started,"  said chamber President Duane Nightingale. "We'll always help people -- but we  want them off the streets at night."  </P> <P> In spite of the homeless problem, Nightingale said business is booming, even  though small retailers and workers cannot afford to live in the city.  </P> <P> "It is difficult to lure large businesses to center here," he said. "That was  one of the reasons why my company, GTE, left town."  </P> <P> The business boom, according to Nightingale, is coming from the trend of more  attorneys, doctors, dentists and other health professionals setting up their  offices in the city. The medical field and its associated businesses make up  the No. 1 work population in the city.  </P> <P> Shelly Roth, a chiropractor, and her husband, John Kaufman, commercial real  estate broker, both work in the city. They bought their home in the Ocean Park  area 10 years ago. Their 1,400-square-foot house was recently enlarged to 2,600  square feet. Roth values it at more than $1 million, 10 times the original  purchase price. If they sell, they'll stay in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It's Quieter There'  </P> <P> "When we moved in, John wanted to remodel immediately, but I wanted to move  eventually, if the house became too small for us," Roth said. "Now he wants to  move and I want to stay in the neighborhood. If we move, we want to start from  scratch and remodel a house north of Montana. It's quieter up there and  (there's) less traffic, but the advantage of living here is the young children.  But we haven't decided yet."  </P> <P> Ocean Park has pockets of single-family homes, but according to Erickson, none  has sold for a million dollars. A high-quality duplex on 3rd Street, with a  second-floor view of the ocean sold for $600,000.  </P> <P> In the Main Street area, south to the ocean, there's a low turnover for the  wood-frame houses whose deceiving exteriors conceal modern, artistic interiors.  Many of them are beach house rentals -- bringing in sizable rents, since they  are not under rent control.  </P> <P> Ocean Park still has the last piece of affordable housing in the city,  according to Felicia Allen of Jon Richards Co. She can get you into a  two-bedroom one-bath dwelling for $269,000. It's half of a duplex, and it's the  cheapest property in Santa Monica. For $269,500 you can get a one-bedroom,  one-bath house.  </P> <P> The Ocean Park area has a well-organized neighborhood association, one of three  associations that receive support from the city-sponsored Santa Monica  Neighborhood Support Center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Airport Project Protest  </P> <P> Members are firm about maintaining their neighborhood's quality of life.  Recently, 700 people attended a hearing to protest a development project at the  Santa Monica airport. Traffic and noise were the key issues. City officials  expect marathon meetings as they get closer to making the final decision.  </P> <P> What may be the unifying thread for all Santa Monicans -- politician or  resident -- is the concern for the quality of life.  </P> <P> Stan Scholl, general manager of the city of Santa Monica, considers the city to  be in the environmental vanguard.  </P> <P> "We started a recycling program 11 years ago," he said. "We started the pilot  program for treated storm drain water. We're going to require sampling for  toxic chemicals from 1,118 of our 15,000 businesses."  </P> <P> The city, at no cost to residents, retrofitted one-quarter of the city's  households with water-heater blankets as well as requiring ultra-low-flow  plumbing fixtures. "We also have our own hydroelectric power plant, which  creates less pollution," he said.  </P> <P> As a result of families being priced out of the housing market, the Santa  Monica Malibu school district has suffered from eight years of declining  enrollment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> School Enrollment  </P> <P> To counter the problem, school officials created a plan that allows people  working in the city to enroll their children in the schools if they retained  child care in the city.  </P> <P> Dane Woll, associate general director of the 2,800-member YMCA, and the city's  largest child-care provider, lives in Westchester but sends his daughter Katie  to the Roosevelt School -- north of Montana.  </P> <P> "There are about 300 non-resident kids who are currently in the school system,"  he said.  </P> <P> Santa Monica residents want to protect their small-town life style. As new  resident Caroline Carroll said, "It's the atmosphere -- maybe it's a false  sense -- but it feels real open. It's more than living in a house; we are  living in a neighborhood. I would hate to see it overwhelmed."  </P> <P> AT A GLANCEPopulation  </P> <P> 1989 estimate: 96,428  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: +9.2%  </P> <P> Median age: 36 years  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 71.9%  </P> <P> Latino: 18.2%  </P> <P> Other: 6.5%  </P> <P> Black: 3.4%  </P> <P> Annual income  </P> <P> Per capita: 22,210  </P> <P> Median household: 33,847  </P> <P> Household distribution  </P> <P> Less than $15,000: 21.4%  </P> <P> $15,000 - $30,000: 23.2%  </P> <P> $30,000 - $50,000: 25%  </P> <P> $50,000 - $75,000: 16.3%  </P> <P> $75,000 + : 14.2%  </P></p>

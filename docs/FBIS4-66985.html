			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Taiwan Antinarcotics Police Cast a Wide Net, </F> Opening and Searching Coffins To No Avail, with the Owner of the  Cargo Admitting That Hong Kong Drug Offenders Had Tried To  Persuade Him To Cooperate in Shipping Drugs"]    [Text] When the Taiwan police received intelligence  indicating that a drug-dealing ring had colluded with a Hong  Kong gang of drug dealers, to secretly ship 500 kg of heroin and  guns to Taiwan on the pretext of importing mainland coffins,  they opened and searched at night a container holding 67  coffins, finding that the coffins certainly held no drugs or  guns. The importer of these coffins openly admitted that while  he had been solicited to cooperate in drug smuggling, the plan  had failed because he had not agreed.    A Taiwan police source claims that antinarcotics police and  prosecutors had been investigating this case of drugs concealed  in imported coffins for two months, and that their intelligence  was very accurate. This had included the substance of the plans  and fundraising by the goods owners, and even shadowing and  monitoring of meetings at the Taipei World Trade Hotel by a  Taiwan goods owner, a Mr. Chiang [3068], with Hong Kong and  Singaporean drug dealers. The antinarcotics officers even had  hard information that a goods owner, a Mr. Wang [3769], had used  a certain Miss Chang [1728] to send the money to Hong Kong.    In the operation to shadow the truck carrying the container  the other morning, the antinarcotics officers had acted to catch  the offenders by arranging more than 10 shadowing vehicles on  the highway, discovering that the drug ring had also sent out a  "road-sweeping vehicle." The driver of a porsche running in the  vicinity of the container truck had a long history of drug  dealing, making the antinarcotics officers even more certain of  his involvement.    Who would have guessed that this whole drug shipment  planning  and coordination was a strategic operation by the drug dealing  ring, using a live-troop drill to probe police strength, and to  force the police to expose their shadowing operation. The  Criminal Police Bureau cooperated with the Coastal Defense  Command on 12 March 1994 to seize the container of coffins  suspected of holding 500 kg of heroin smuggled from the mainland  through Hong Kong to Taiwan. They went to Yungk'ang City to  "open the coffins to find the drugs," but after six hours of  intensive searching of 67 coffins, found no drugs. But the  police had information provided by the merchant in charge of the  imported container trade, Chiang X-chen [3068 X 3791], that a  Hong Kong merchant had discussed with him the smuggling of drugs  in coffins and farm products.    Chiang X-chen indicated that while more than six months  before, two Hong Kong traders, a Mr. Huang [7806] and a Mr.  Chang [1728], had repeatedly discussed with him the smuggling of  heroin through an import pipeline of coffins and farm products,  he had not agreed.</p>

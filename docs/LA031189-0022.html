			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TAFT STUDENTS PLAY CATCH UP TO TIE FOR 1ST IN SUPER QUIZ  </P> <P> Defending state champion Taft High School came from behind to tie for first  place in the Super Quiz portion of the California Academic Decathlon on Friday.  </P> <P> Taft finished even with Palo Alto High School, scoring 38 of 45 correct answers  on the oral examination, the only portion of the 10-event academic competition  at Bakersfield College open to the public.  </P> <P> The winner of the overall competition is the team that scores the most points  based on all 10 events. That team will be announced at a luncheon today, when  scores on the nine written portions of the competition will be revealed. The  winner will compete in the national Academic Decathlon in Providence, R.I.,  next month.  </P> <P> "I feel great," Shawn Canter, a Taft senior, said after the big event. "Now  it's time to hit the hotel Jacuzzi."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Knows His Presidents  </P> <P> Canter pulled his team into the first-place tie on the second to last Super  Quiz question. He answered correctly that Richard Nixon was the President who  prompted Congress to restrict certain executive powers. The Super Quiz topic  this year was U.S. Presidents.  </P> <P> "I had a feeling about it," said Canter, a varsity basketball player. "I must  have heard it somewhere and just sort of subconsciously remembered it."  </P> <P> More than 50 Taft parents and Los Angeles school officials cheered wildly after  Canter pulled his team into the tie. Taft won the Los Angeles Unified School  District's Academic Decathlon in November.  </P> <P> "I think the team did fine," said English teacher Arthur Berchin, Taft's  Academic Decathlon coach.  </P> <P> Students from 47 California high schools spent Thursday and Friday competing in  the other nine events by taking written examinations in such subjects as  science, mathematics, fine arts and literature. Taft students said they stayed  up most of Thursday night studying.  </P> <P> "We studied all night because we were nervous," said Taft senior Andy  Rosenthal.  </P> <P> He also brought along a lucky horseshoe that was passed around by team members  during the Super Quiz.  </P> <P> The nine members of each school's academic decathlon team are divided among  students with A, B and C grade averages.  </P> <P> This year, all nine members were allowed to participate. Before, there were six  regular team members and three alternates.  </P> <P> The scores of team members placing last in each grade category will be dropped  from the school's final tally.  </P> <P> Finishing second in the Super Quiz was the Beverly Hills High School team that  represented Los Angeles County. The third-place finisher was Fresno's Roosevelt  High School.  </P> <P> There were no returning members from last year's Taft Academic Decathlon team.  </P> <P> That group won the state championship, but lost narrowly in the national finals  to J. J. Pearce High School of Richardson, Tex.  </P> <P> In 1987, a team from Marshall High School in Silver Lake won both the state and  national Academic Decathlon titles.  </P></p>

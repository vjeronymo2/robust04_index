			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Abu Dhabi may take action against BCC: Dollars 7bn claim would cut pay-outs to other creditors The government of Abu Dhabi is considering suing the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International in an action that, if successful, would substantially reduce pay-outs to the bank's other hundreds of thousands of creditors. It is also preparing legal claims against the network of 20 or more independent intermediary banks through which its Dollars 2.6bn of allegedly misappropriated money was channelled by BCCI. The details emerged as the Department of Private Affairs in Abu Dhabi, majority shareholder in the bank, launched a Dollars 7bn civil action in the local courts against 13 former executives of the bank. Mr David Sandy, a partner with Simmons &amp; Simmons, Abu Dhabi's lawyers in London, said: 'We hope it won't come down to (suing BCCI) but that is one of the options.' He said Abu Dhabi could sue BCCI for Dollars 7bn, which would rank alongside the existing creditors' claims on the bank. It might also have a priority claim for breach of trust for Dollars 1.6bn misappropriated which would rank ahead of other creditors. The claim may occur if Abu Dhabi is unable to agree a new settlement with the liquidators to BCCI to stave off litigation. The previous proposals were rejected by the Luxembourg appeals court earlier this year. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, and Crown Prince Khalifa claim they entrusted Dollars 2.6bn throughout the 1980s to BCCI for a portfolio of investments. They recovered about Dollars 600m, including Dollars 150m left when BCCI was closed by regulators in July 1991. The remainder of yesterday's Dollars 7bn claim represents what its advisers say would have been the value of the portfolio had it been legitimately and conservatively invested. While BCCI provided regular statements suggesting the money was being safely held and appreciating in value, they claim it was being transferred secretly to BCCI subsidiaries around the world to support delinquent loans and bolster losses. Mr Sandy said that a case was being prepared against other banks which would allow disclosure of documents. 'False accounts for a decade', Page 4</p>

He has resigned because he  disagrees with the so-called La Cantuta Law, which has  transferred the trial to a military court.    It has been reported Bustamante confirmed his resignation  when he learned of the sentences requested today for the people  responsible for the disappearance of the students and professor.    Meanwhile, international agencies reported today  Bustamante's  resignation has sparked a new political crisis in the Fujimori  Government, because the La Cantuta case invalidates all the work  Bustamante has carried out to improve Peru's image abroad.    Bustamante is the fourth president of the Council of  Ministers of this term. He is also chairman of the Commission  for the Promotion of Peru's Image Abroad [Comision de Promocion  de la Imagen de Peru en el Extranjero, Promperu] and industry,  tourism, and integration minister.    Bustamante and Economy Minister Jorge Camet have implemented  an aggressive economic policy aimed at reestablishing economic  ties with the developed countries.    At the Industry Ministry it has been reported that  Bustamante  worked until noon today.    The Government Palace has issued no official comment on the  resignation of the Council of Ministers president.</p>

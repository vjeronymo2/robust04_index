			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Court decision today over B&amp;C litigation A HIGH COURT judge is expected to award substantial damages today against Samuel Montagu and Quadrex Holdings in the long-running litigation brought against them by British &amp; Commonwealth, the financial services group that collapsed in June 1990. Mr Justice Gatehouse will make public in the Commercial Court this morning his assessment of damages following hearings which finished in March this year. His ruling follows an earlier judgment in May 1991 in which he determined that both Samuel Montagu and Quadrex were liable to pay damages to B&amp;C. The litigation was triggered by the 1987 takeover of Mercantile House Holdings by British &amp; Commonwealth, the group now in administration. The acquisition relied on an agreement that Quadrex, a Delaware corporation headed by Mr Gary Klesch, would buy Mercantile's wholesale broking division after B&amp;C made a takeover bid. After the acquisition, Quadrex did not have the funds to make the purchase, which led to B&amp;C bringing a claim of damages for breach of contract of Pounds 200m against the abortive sale in 1988. However, the judge ruled in 1991 that Quadrex could collect from B&amp;C Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m to compensate for non-fraudulent misrepresentations during talks on the sale of its wholesale broking division. B&amp;C also claimed against Samuel Montagu, Quadrex's financial advisers, for negligent mis-statements made to the company by its head of corporate finance. Creditors to B&amp;C are unlikely to receive any dividends as a result of the award in the next few months, because the original verdict is still on appeal. Early last year the administrators estimated that creditors to B&amp;C Holdings would eventually receive dividends of 23p in the pound and those to B&amp;C Group Finance 37p before the outcome of the litigation. Those involved in the trial have agreed that any appeals from tomorrow's decision will be heard at the same time as the appeals on the original liability case two years ago. These hearings have been scheduled for January 1995. The costs to B&amp;C alone have been more than Pounds 16m since proceedings began following the acquisition in 1987.</p>

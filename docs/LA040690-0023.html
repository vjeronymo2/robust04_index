			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUIDELINES AWAITED ON INSURANCE PROFITS;  </P> <P> PROP. 103: FOUR MONTHS OF HEARINGS ARE DRAWING TO AN END. UNCERTAINTY OVER  RATES HAS LEFT CONSUMER GROUPS AND COMPANIES TRADING ACRIMONIOUS CHARGES.  </P> <P> More than four months of state Insurance Department hearings into what  constitutes a "fair rate of return" for insurance companies are coming to a  close here this week in an atmosphere of recrimination and uncertainty.  </P> <P> Out of the hearings are expected to come, by the end of the month, a set of  profit guidelines to be recommended by Administrative Hearing Judge William  Fernandez to Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie. Once reviewed and perhaps  changed by Gillespie, these will be issued as standards for state approval of  future auto, homeowners and various other insurance rates in the state.  </P> <P> These standards also would be used for determining what, if any, rate rollbacks  and premium rebates Gillespie may finally order pursuant to provisions of  Proposition 103. The rollbacks have been delayed for 17 months already while  the standards were debated and litigated.  </P> <P> In general, Gillespie and the Insurance Department staff have been suggesting  at the hearings that a fair rate of annual return for the companies should  range, depending on circumstances, from 11.2% to 15%. The companies, by  contrast, have been arguing for a 16% to 21% annual rate of return.  </P> <P> There are a host of subsidiary issues, such as which company expenses, like  political contributions, might be disallowed in making the calculations, and  whether the profits should be in each line of insurance, or averaged out among  all lines each company sells.  </P> <P> The recriminations have come mainly from representatives of consumer  organizations who charge that the hearings have been unbalanced in favor of the  industry. They noted that many of their requests for data on company finances  and sales practices were rejected by the hearing judge.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the uncertainty has come from insurers over what conclusions  Gillespie may reach, and what the consequences of her decisions might be.  </P> <P> There is little doubt that if Gillespie sets profit guidelines far below what  the companies think they should be, the companies will sue to prevent her  standards from taking effect.  </P> <P> In short, the result of these hearings -- which have cost the companies, and  indirectly their California ratepayers, millions of dollars -- may be a new  round of the litigation that has so far stymied all efforts to implement  Proposition 103.  </P> <P> There also are questions of whether the elected insurance commissioner, who  will take office in January, may want to set his own standards, and whether the  work done at the hearings and the conclusions reached by Gillespie will be  discarded.  </P> <P> Asked whether they felt the hearings will prove to have been useful, various  parties were cautious.  </P> <P> Kent Keller, an attorney for Travelers and other companies, said, "I would hope  we're getting near the end" in setting standards for the state's new system of  approving rates. But on the rollbacks, he said, "individual companies that are  ordered to refund millions of dollars probably will go to court."  </P> <P> But Bob Gnaizda of Public Advocates Inc., representing a coalition of minority  and low-income groups, asserted that the hearings will prove to be a waste of  time, unless Gillespie disregards Judge Fernandez's recommendations and strikes  out on her own to develop a more pro-consumer tack than the hearings took.  </P> <P> The consumer groups directly represented -- Latino Issues Forum, Voter Revolt  and the Consumers Union in particular -- are in a sour mood because the  compensation from insurers for consumer attorney expenses that they had been  promised by Gillespie at the start of the hearings has not been forthcoming.  </P> <P> Most of the big companies have refused to pay it, and the issue of financing a  consumer presence at the hearing is being litigated.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, one consumer representative after another rose to support motions  charging that Fernandez had been biased against them and the minority and  low-income groups and asking that evidence and arguments from companies that  had refused to compensate the consumer attorneys for their efforts be ignored  in the conclusions that are reached. Particular anger was expressed that the  judge had refused to admit evidence on "redlining" against minorities.  </P> <P> After the consumer attorneys had spoken, and insurer attorneys had rebutted  them, Fernandez angrily left the bench without his coat, rolled up his shirt  sleeves and, striding to the desks occupied by the consumer representatives,  castigated them.  </P> <P> Pointing out that he is descended from several minority groups himself, the  judge said he could not tolerate such unfair accusations. He said he  sympathizes with the plight of minority members who are charged a great deal  for insurance or unable to buy it. But he said that as a judge he will follow  the law.  </P></p>

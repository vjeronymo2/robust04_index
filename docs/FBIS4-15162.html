			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- As UNIAN has already reported, the president  of Ukraine on 23 February this year signed a directive "On  urgent steps to develop nuclear power engineering and complete  the nuclear fuel cycle in Ukraine." It provides for the  launching of four new reactors, relaunching the second  generating unit at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which  caught fire in 1991, and completing the nuclear fuel cycle. The  directive caused disquiet among Ukraine's Ministry for  Protection of the Population from the Chernobyl Aftermath, the  Health Ministry, the Environmental Protection Ministry, and the  State Committee for Safety Inspection in Atomic Energy, who have  demanded that the directive be canceled and further work be done  on it.    On 5 April, a news conference was held to announce the  institution of a public committee uniting the Ukrainian Supreme  Council's Standing Committee for Matters of the Chernobyl  Accident, the National Commission for the Protection of the  Population against Radiation under the Ukrainian Supreme  Council, Ukraine's Greenpeace, the Green Party of Ukraine, and  the Ukrainian Peace Council. An appeal to Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk was signed, demanding the invalidation of this  directive, which, in the view of lawyers, breaks the law,  violates the human right to ecological, radiation, and nuclear  safety, and does not comply with the International Covenant on  Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.    Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent, Serhyy Kurakin,  representative of the Ukrainian Greens Party, said the priority  development of nuclear power engineering, as recorded in this  directive, would mean greater capital investment in the industry  without yielding the desired result.</p>

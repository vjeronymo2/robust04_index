			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THAT WON'T BE ALL, FOLKS, AS CARTOONS MAKE A COMEBACK;  </P> <P> ANIMATION: THE RECENT BOX-OFFICE SUCCESS OF FULL-LENGTH FEATURES IS CREATING A  NEW BOOM IN THE INDUSTRY THAT MAY RIVAL THE 'GOLDEN AGE' OF THE '30S.  </P> <P> Buoyed by the success of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," "Oliver and Company," "The  Land Before Time" and "The Little Mermaid," animation is enjoying a banner  year:  </P> <P> * "The Little Mermaid," which earned a record-breaking $82 million, won two  Academy Awards -- the first animated feature to receive an Oscar since "Dumbo"  in 1942.  </P> <P> * At least five new animated features are scheduled to be released this year.  </P> <P> * The madcap Roger Rabbit returns to theaters next month in a new short that  will screen with Disney's "Dick Tracy."  </P> <P> * The other Oscar-winning rabbit, Bugs Bunny, will appear in his first  theatrical short in 26 years when "Box Office Bunny" debuts this fall.  </P> <P> * Starting today, the AMC Theatre chain will show a classic Warner Bros. short  before the feature in 1,700 theaters across the country.  </P> <P> The new AMC policy is the latest development in the current animation boom that  threatens to rival the "golden age" of the 1930s. Since 1986, animated films  have grossed more than $400 million domestically, and Fox's "The Simpsons" is  one of the biggest hits of the 1989-90 TV season.  </P> <P> Fifty years ago, when Elmer Fudd first admonished audiences, "Be ve-wy, ve-wy  quiet: I'm hunting wabbits," cartoons were an essential part of a trip to the  movies. AMC is bringing them to the big screen after a long hiatus.  </P> <P> "In 1989, we conducted an extensive research study to see what people felt  would enhance the movie-going experience," said AMC president Ed Durwood at a  press conference in Century City Monday morning. "Of the 70,000 people we  polled, 42% wanted to see a cartoon before the feature -- a higher figure than  for any other possible improvement. We felt this response revealed an on-going  interest in animation and indicated that the success of 'Roger Rabbit' and  other recent animated films do not represent a passing fad."  </P> <P> Patrons at most AMC theaters will see one of 130 shorts chosen from a list the  surviving Warners directors and animators compiled of their best work. The bulk  of the films were made during the late '40s and '50s, when the Warners artists  made some of the fastest, funniest cartoons in the history of the medium. Bugs,  Elmer, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote and the Road  Runner formed a versatile repertory company of comedians that rivaled even  Disney's creations.  </P> <P> For the AMC release, Warner Bros. has struck new 35-millimeter prints,  adjusting the nearly square image so that none of the visuals will be lost in  the contemporary wide-screen format. These cartoons have been popular on  television for decades, but in recent years the networks have excised the  pratfalls and explosions because of their allegedly violent content. The films  will be shown in the theaters "in their classic form, with no editing  whatsoever."  </P> <P> Most film industry observers credit the seven-minute "Tummy Trouble" -- the  first Roger Rabbit short -- with the quick start last summer for Disney's  "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," a movie that went on to gross $130 million. On June  15, Disney will roll Roger out again in "Roller Coaster Rabbit" to see if he  can give "Dick Tracy" a hand.  </P> <P> " 'Honey' was a very strong, successful movie in its own right, but its  entertainment value was enhanced by the cartoon," said Peter Schneider, senior  vice president of feature animation for Walt Disney Pictures. "I don't think  Disney has created a character of the magnitude of Roger in the last 30 years  -- a character who's real in the way Mickey Mouse is real, who jumps off the  screen into people's laps. We're moving ahead with the sequel to 'Roger  Rabbit,' but we've also done the two short cartoons. What better way to keep  the character alive than using him correctly?"  </P> <P> Animation historian John Canemaker, who previewed "Roller Coaster Rabbit" at  Disney's Florida studio, recalled a renowned MGM animator when he described it  as "very funny and very Tex Avery in tone. The pandemonium builds much more  skillfully than it did in 'Tummy Trouble.' "  </P> <P> "Box Office Bunny," the new Bugs Bunny cartoon, is slated to debut this fall.  Directed by former Disney animator Darrell Van Citters, the film is being  animated at Warners' Burbank animation facility. Dan Fellman, senior vice  president/general sales manager at Warner Bros., said the studio has yet to  decide which feature to release with "Box Office Bunny." Fellman also expressed  the hope that the success of the distribution arrangement with AMC will enable  Warners to produce additional new cartoons.  </P> <P> This renewed interest in animated shorts comes 18 years after the last  Hollywood cartoon studio closed. Cartoons had been a feature of motion picture  shows since the days of silent film; from the '30s through the '50s, every  Hollywood studio had either an in-house animation unit or a distribution deal  with an independent cartoon producer.  </P> <P> The 1949 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that forced the studios to discontinue block  booking killed cartoons. Under block booking, a theater owner who wanted a  studio's hit feature also had to take a second feature, a cartoon and -- often  -- a newsreel and live action short. A percentage of the rental fee for the  entire package financed the animation production.  </P> <P> Theater owners refused to pay more than nominal fees for cartoons, and an  animated short couldn't earn back its production costs on its initial release.  As a result, the Hollywood cartoon studios closed their doors during the late  '50s and early '60s. Walter Lantz, who finally stopped production in 1972,  said, "We didn't stop producing cartoons because their popularity died out, it  was because we couldn't afford to make them."  </P> <P> But a good cartoon could be re-released over a period of years and earn a  substantial profit. At the AMC press conference Monday, an audience of adults  and children whooped with laughter at Friz Freleng's 1954 Bugs Bunny-Yosemite  Sam short "Captain Hareblower."  </P> <P> "It's a wonderful feeling to come back into a theater and see one of these  films on a big screen," said Freleng, a five-time Oscar winner who directed 266  Warners cartoons. "Since I left the studio, I've usually seen them by myself on  a little tube; it's nice to know the laughs still come in the places I  intended, 26 years later. I think when theaters stopped showing cartoons, it  left a big hole in the entertainment."  </P></p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Observer: Kohl's belt tightener The great pear, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl is known in impolite Rhineside society, yesterday struck an exemplary blow against inflation and came down heavily on the side of belt-tightening. Starting his Easter hols in Hofgastein, Austria, he has forsworn not just his favourite dish of Saumagen (stuffed stomach), but also pork, dumplings and beer for a whole fortnight. For the first week of his annual fast, he will consume only tea and mineral water. His reward comes in the second week, when he lets his hair down and allows himself milk and two dry rolls a day. The reward for those who have to live with the man, grumpy even when he is well-fed, is the prospect of a slenderised chancellor returning for the spring and summer term ready to get his teeth into an opposition also tenderised by last weekend's elections. The great man can be counted on not to overdo his diet; he needs plenty of weight if he is to throw it around effectively in a tensely combative domestic arena. His starting weight is a state secret, but his trainers claim that last year a similar regime helped him cast off 16 lb of his then 230 lb bulk.</p>

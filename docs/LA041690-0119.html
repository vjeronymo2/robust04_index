			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SDSU'S HANKS TAKES DRAKE JOB  </P> <P> San Diego State assistant basketball coach Maury Hanks resigned today to accept  a similar position at Drake University. Hanks, an Aztecs assistant since 1987,  said the opportunity to work with Drake's new head coach, Rudy Washington, is  too good to pass up.  </P> <P> "You don't get to work with your best friend every day," Hanks said of  Washington, whom he met 10 years ago when Washington was an assistant coach at  USC.  </P> <P> "It was a real hard decision leaving . . . a respected head coach like (San  Diego State's) Jim Brandenburg and a program that next year should have some  success with the players they have returning. But I think it will be a great  opportunity."  </P> <P> Hanks, 27, was an assistant at Clemson for two years before he came to San  Diego State in 1987. Brandenburg said he will start looking for a new assistant  after he has finished recruiting.  </P></p>

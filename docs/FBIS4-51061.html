			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang and Zhou Zongmin: "Prisons Succeed in </F> Reforming Convicts"]    [Text] Good conditions and fair treatment have helped make  China's prison system effective, a Justice Ministry official  said yesterday.    The rate of ex-convicts who commit crimes after their  release  is less than 8 per cent, one of the lowest in the world, said  Wang Mingdi, director of the ministry's reform-through-labour  bureau.    He attributed this success to China's system of reforming  offenders through labour and reeducation.    "We are always trying our best to reform them into  productive  citizens," he said.    In recent years, the government has paroled or reduced terms  for 22 per cent of inmates for good behaviour.    China has 1.25 million prisoners, including 334 from abroad.    Felons that receive terms over 10 years or those unable to  perform manual labour are kept in prisons. The rest are sent to  labour camps.    Wang said prisoners are provided with meals and  accommodation  that cost the government a monthly 60 yuan ($6.90) per person.    For foreigners kept in Chinese jails, the government spends  twice as much, according to statistics from the Shanghai  Municipal Prison.    Those who work receive between 30 yuan ($3.45) and 60 yuan  ($6.9) a month.    "I am content with life here, and the food is sufficient,"  said Cheng Ying, a 21-year-old woman inmate at the Shanghai  Women's Prison.    "All I want now is to better behave myself, and get out of  prison at an earlier date," added Cheng, who was serving a  two-year term for housing prostitution activities.  <H5>  Better Behaviour </H5>   All inmates in China are required to work in prison  factories  or attend labour reform camps.    "Going for work is conducive to preparing them for once they  walk out of here," said Wang.    Prisoners usually work six to eight hours a day except on  weekends and public holidays.    And they are also required to attend study sessions for two  to three hours a day, Wang said.    This includes political and legal education, elementary  schooling and recreational activities.    Libraries, reading rooms, karaoke bars and video rooms have  also been set up for prisoners. Each year 150,000 inmates  receive high school diplomas and 100,000 get technical  certification from labour organizations.    Special groups have even been established to encourage  inmates to play musical instruments, sing and paint.    Inmates from abroad also enjoy such treatment, Wang said.</p>

Speaking to MBC [Malawi Broadcasting Corporation] at Chileka  Airport in Blantyre on their departure for South Africa, the  doctors said they came to Malawi to check the president's  condition since the (?past) treatment. The doctors said they  were greatly impressed due to the president's physical recovery  and that they found him in good condition, which means the  president was in good health and was continuing to make good  progress. They said that this was contrary to the speculations  that were going on in the South African press that the president  was critically ill. They said they were going back to South  Africa very happy and there are no complications and no  infections of any kind with the president's condition.</p>

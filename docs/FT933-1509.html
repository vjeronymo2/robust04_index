			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: US mill plan by Canadian steelmaker A THIRD Canadian steel-maker, Ipsco, has decided to build a mini-mill in the US at a capital cost of CDollars 360m (USDollars 272m). It will have annual capacity of 1m tonnes of light-to-medium plate and hot-rolled coil, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Ipsco, based in Regina, Saskatchewan, is western Canada's principal steelmaker with annual capacity of 804,000 tonnes of speciality products. It earned CDollars 15.5m, or 98 cents a share, in 1992, on sales of nearly CDollars 500m. Co-Steel, of Toronto, has operated a mini-mill in the US for more than 20 years and has teamed-up with Dofasco, Canada's biggest integrated steelmaker, in a new mini-mill now being built in Kentucky. Ipsco has yet to finalise a location for its mill but it may choose Kentucky.</p>

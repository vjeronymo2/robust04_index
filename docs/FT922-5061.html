			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Smaller pay rises 'vital' says Heseltine PAY RESTRAINT is vital if Britain is to maintain its competitive position, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, warned yesterday, Emma Tucker writes. In a speech attacking manufacturing wage rises for running at twice the rate of inflation, Mr Heseltine said lower pay settlements were vital if Britain was to 'build on the increase in competitiveness which we achieved in the 1980s'. He complained that manufacturing earnings were rising by an average of 8 per cent, almost double the inflation rate. 'Compared to the UK's 8 per cent, the increase in earnings in manufacturing in Germany last year was 6 per cent, in Japan 4 per cent and in the US just 3 per cent,' Mr Heseltine said at a London conference of business leaders. The Department of Employment says average earnings for the whole economy are still running at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent even though the level of pay deals has fallen significantly since last year. Economists expect the rate of average earnings to drop over the next few months as the high pay settlements of a year ago - when the inflation rate was above 6 per cent - drop out of the index.</p>

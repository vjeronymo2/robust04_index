			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A healthy premium in stock index futures provided arbitrage opportunities which tended to set the tone for the day's trading, writes Peter John. The FT-SE 100 contract expiring in December moved forward sharply in morning dealing, widening its lead on the underlying cash market to some 26 points. This compared to a current fair value premium estimated at around nine points. The sellers moved in and drove the December contract down towards 3,100 shortly before the official 4.10pm close. However, a last minute scramble sent the contract up to 3,109, a premium of 12 points to cash. The day's economic statistics - MO money supply and purchasing managers figures - appeared to have little effect on the market, which was dominated by technical trading. NatWest Securities and GNI were said to have been keen buyers, but overall volume was thin in comparison with recent levels and turnover failed to reach 12,000 lots by the end of the pit-trading session. Traded options volume was also down from Friday's level, with only 31,215 lots changing hands. Guinness was an active market with 1,895 contracts traded, but the other leaders - National Power, HSBC, British Steel, Eastern, Tesco and BP - were significantly below 1,000 contracts.</p>

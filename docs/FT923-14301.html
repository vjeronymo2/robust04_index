			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet set to reject top pay rises THE government appears set to reject the recommendations of an independent review body that more than 2,000 top public servants should receive a large one-off pay rise to bring their salaries level with those in the private sector, Philip Stephens writes. Senior ministers expect tomorrow's meeting of the cabinet to scale back significantly the increases for senior civil servants, armed forces officers and judges suggested by the Top People's Pay Review Body. Mr John Major is also likely to insist that those pay awards of over 10 per cent which are accepted by the government should be phased in. The board is thought to have recommended increases of more than 25 per cent for some groups of workers to close the gap which has opened up between comparable positions in the private and public sectors since 1986. One cabinet minister this week described increases on that scale as 'totally unacceptable'. The prime minister, who has consistently criticised large pay awards for executives in the private sector, will be told by colleagues that there is no likelihood of an 'exodus' of senior public servants if he rejects large pay awards. Mr Major's colleagues, facing one of the toughest public spending rounds in recent years, will argue that large increases for high-paid public sector workers would send the wrong signal to other groups of employees. They expect the prime minister to agree that any increase this year should be held to 5 per cent.</p>

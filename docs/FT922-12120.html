			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: Regard for finite resources Over the last few days, your newspaper has highlighted the extreme concern of both businessmen and politicians regarding the potential failure of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. At the same time, you have also indicated that the up-coming Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro is not receiving anything like the same concentration of effort and attention from leaders in both these fields (for example, 'Negotiators try to settle differences', April 16). The fact that president Bush has yet to confirm his attendance at the conference is one of the most visible signs of this lack of commitment. It is perhaps unprecedented that two such crucial sets of negotiations should be deadlocked simultaneously, and it strikes me that what is needed in both situations to break the log-jam is some evidence of goodwill from all parties. Nonetheless, I think it is important to focus on the fact that the Uruguay Round appears to be given priority by decision-makers. Does this imply that the goods which people manufacture and trade fundamentally deserve more attention than the finite source whence they came? This idea seems disastrously short-sighted and unsustainable, and I would be interested to know whether any of your readers feel that it can be adequately justified. In this regard, another article ('Boom years predicted for Third World in 1990s', April 16) gives cause for concern, as it makes no mention of the potential environmental impact of the predicted growth. A sustainable future will only become possible when it is accepted that the environment lies at the heart of the economic process, and not at its periphery.

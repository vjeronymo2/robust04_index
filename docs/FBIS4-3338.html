			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Ma Ling (7456 3781): </F> "State Statistical Bureau Spokesman Says First Quarter Sees  Economic Growth at 9 to 10 Percent"]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) -- At a press  conference held here today, Ye Zhen, spokesman for the State  Statistics Bureau, said: The mainland's economic operation in  the first quarter shows that the comprehensive appraisal of the  country's economy has shifted from the "red light" and "yellow  light" situation at the end of last year to the current  situation of "yellow light" and "green light." Economic growth  in the first quarter has reached the expected goal of 9 to 10  percent which was the overall target of macroeconomic regulation  and control.    Giving an account of the first quarter, Ye Zhen pointed out:  GNP for the first quarter totaled 862 billion yuan. Viewed  from the internal economic structure, the excessive increase in  production, construction, and sales has dropped somewhat. Of  this, added value of industry amounted to 533 billion yuan, an  increase of 16 percent over the same period in 1993. Energy  production also increased steadily. Investment by the state  sector in fixed assets totaled 81.5 billion yuan, an increase of  36.2 percent over 1993. The investment set up had the following  three characteristics: First, the growth in local projects  decreased while that of central projects increased rapidly;  second, transportation, post, and telecommunications further  strengthened; and third, the confusion in real estate was  brought under control and the number of housing projects aimed  at improving basic housing conditions increased. The volume of  retail sales in the first quarter totaled 352.2 billion yuan, 3  to 4 percent lower than normal years. The overall market  situation remained steady with some slack. In the first  quarter, average real income of urban and rural inhabitants for  living expenses rose by 9.3 and 13.1 percent respectively over  the same period last year.    Ye Zhen's account of the first quarter continued: First,  exports increased sharply and the exchange rates remained  steady. The volume of exports in the first quarter totaled  $19.1 billion, up 18.2 percent from the corresponding period of  1993; the volume of exports [word as published] reached 29.4  billion yuan, up 18.2 percent, with imports exceeding exports by  $1.3 billion. [figures as published] Second, revenue increased  steadily and expenditure remained normal. Revenue in the first  quarter increased by 21.4 percent and expenditure was up 23.8  percent. Third, the financial situation was stable as was the  withdrawal of currency from circulation. In the first quarter,  the banks granted 35.1 billion yuan in loans and received 207.2  billion yuan in deposits. The currency put into circulation  before the Spring Festival was withdrawn by the end of March.    Meanwhile, Ye Zhen stressed that, viewed from the economic  situation during the first quarter, we still face serious  difficulties and problems and the tasks for the next stage are  extremely arduous. The difficulties and problems include:  First, soaring prices. In the first quarter, the country's  retail prices, mainly of the basic necessities, rose 20.1  percent compared to last year. The highest rates were  registered in Haikou, 34.1 percent; Urumqi, 30.6 percent; and  Nanjing, 30.1 percent. Moreover, prices rose 24 percent in  Beijing, 26.3 percent in Tianjin, 23.3 percent in Shanghai, and  24.3 percent in Guangzhou. Thanks to the measures adopted by  the government at all levels, Ye said, price increases eased  somewhat in March. Second, difficulties in the operation and  production of state enterprises were further aggravated. In the  first quarter, state industry increased by only 2.2 percent over  the same period last year and both the number of losing  enterprises and the amount of their deficits increased. Some  49.6 percent of enterprises suffered losses, with the amount of  deficits totaling 15.7 billion yuan. The main reasons include:  The failure of enterprises to change their mechanisms; hidden  deficits were made public following the reform of the accounting  system; and overall losses did not increase but losses in  certain enterprises increased somewhat following the tax reform  and enterprises which had made small profits in the past turned  into loss-making enterprises. Third, there are still hidden  worries in agricultural production, the gap in incomes between  urban and rural inhabitants further widened, and some households  with low incomes could not make both ends meet.    Ye Zhen said that macroeconomic control and regulation is  now  at a crucial stage and consideration will be given to stable  prices and economic growth in the future.</p>

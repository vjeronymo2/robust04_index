			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> TRUST NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION, BUT IN VOTES  </P> <P> Despite the joy most pro-lifers feel, the Supreme Court's decision on Webster  vs. Reproductive Health Services appears to be based on nothing more solid than  the personal whim of the justices.  </P> <P> Just as Roe vs. Wade was based on the completely arbitrary "trimester"  approach, devised by Justice Blackmun in an attempt to create a synthesis  between medical opinion, law and theology, the court's latest ruling permitting  states to restrict abortions smacks of arbitrariness by failing to include an  unassailable base for the unborn's right to life that would have provided a  standard for the future.  </P> <P> The founders had such a base when they framed the Constitution: "All men are  created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable  rights," among which was the right to life.  </P> <P> The court makes no reference to any such endowed right for the unborn by a  creator, giving a future court the opportunity to decide what it wishes. One  court giveth, one court taketh away.  </P> <P> As former Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes said, "The Constitution is what  the justices say it is," undercutting the foundation of a document that has  served us well for more than 200 years.  </P> <P> While some pro-lifers can today rejoice that the long national abortion  nightmare seems to be ending, they should remember that without a return to law  based on an unchanging principle, abortion could again come back to haunt us  when a future court, or even this court, decides, for whatever reason, to  resurrect Roe vs. Wade.  </P> <P> For now the court has invited states to pass legislation restricting abortion.  And well they might.  </P> <P> Clearly the momentum has shifted as increasing numbers of Americans became  disturbed over unrestricted abortions. As more women testified to post-abortion  syndrome and as Operation Rescue made headlines by blocking entrances to  abortion clinics, the staggering number of abortions performed daily -- 4,000  -- has become, for many Americans, intolerable.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court has let stand a declaration in Missouri law that "the life of  each human being begins at conception." For 16 years, though, the court  concluded arbitrarily that life begins at birth. That decision led to the  deaths of more than 24 million babies and the emotional scarring of millions of  women. Having seized absolute power, the court did not feel the need to say it  is sorry.  </P></p>

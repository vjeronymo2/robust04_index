			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Boothroyd elected Speaker in break with tradition THE House of Commons broke with centuries of tradition yesterday in choosing Miss Betty Boothroyd, the colourful 62-year-old Labour MP for West Bromwich West, as its Speaker. Her victory in the first contested election for the position in more than 40 years makes her the first woman in the six centuries since the post was created to occupy the most powerful - and frequently controversial - job at Westminster. It also marked a break with the more recent postwar tradition that the Speaker is drawn from the governing party in the Commons rather than from the opposition. A deputy speaker since 1987, Miss Boothroyd beat off a challenge from Mr Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland secretary, to win the backing of 372 MPs compared with 238 against, a comfortable majority of 134. In theory, the Speaker's job is simply to preside over Commons proceedings and to maintain order during debates. In practice, the authority to allow or disallow emergency debates, to select the order of speakers and to settle all procedural disputes gives the office unique power. Miss Boothroyd, whose modest background first led her into a career as a professional dancer with the Tiller girls, succeeds Mr Bernard Weatherill as the 155th Speaker. With the job comes a Pounds 65,000-a-year salary, a large house within the precincts of the palace at Westminster, and one of the few state coaches allowed to commoners. Her election was helped by the divided loyalties of Tory MPs, who backed three other potential candidates apart from Mr Brooke. It was assured when Mr John Biffen, a former cabinet minister and leader of the Commons, led more than 70 Tory MPs in support of her. His judgment that Miss Boothroyd had displayed as Deputy Speaker over the past five years the relevant qualities of fairness, tact, humour and respect for the authority of the Commons was widely shared. Mr John Major, who subsequently joined Mr Neil Kinnock in offering warm congratulations to Miss Boothroyd, abstained from voting. Most of his cabinet colleagues supported Mr Brooke.

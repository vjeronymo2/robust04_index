			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Brave investors size up 'the next tiger' - Vietnam could be the Asian opportunity of the 90s THE uncertain allure of Vietnam for foreign investors is aptly summarised in the title of today's conference at the London headquarters of the Confederation of British Industry: 'Vietnam - Asia's next tiger?' There are plenty of reasons for that question mark, including the recent suggestions by the Vietnamese army newspaper that 'imperialist and reactionary circles' are bent on subverting the country and that foreign investment could bring with it espionage and AIDS. Even if potential investors were comforted by the subsequent reassurances of the communist government's economic reformers, they could hardly fail to notice that a hardline army was only one of a multitude of obstacles facing those who seek to do business in Vietnam. Bureaucracy, corruption and smuggling are widespread, and the legal system rudimentary. After decades of war and mismanagement, transport and communications networks are hopelessly inadequate. The more business-minded southern half of the country, to which 80 per cent of foreign investment is directed, has been plagued by electricity shortages. Attempts to improve the infrastructure are severely curtailed by the US embargo dating back to the Vietnam war. The US has blocked multilateral aid from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 'If our economy is to take off we need a lot of co-operation with the international financial institutions and foreign companies,' says Mr Le Bang, a foreign ministry official. 'We need funds and know-how to take off.' As in eastern Europe, even the most enthusiastic foreign investors are hard pressed to find state enterprises which are worth buying; most are unprofitable, over-manned and under-equipped. Two of the three investment funds established by foreign financial institutions have folded, and official figures showing foreign investment approvals of more than Dollars 3bn in the last four years are less impressive when one realises that less than half that amount has actually been invested. Even the expanding oil industry now faces unwelcome concerns about Chinese claims to parts of the South China Sea also claimed by Vietnam and earmarked for exploration. And yet American businessmen - who can visit the country but not strike deals - can barely hide their frustration at their government's embargo; the Thais worry that a dynamic Vietnam of the future will tempt away their investors and undercut their exports; and the few bold British entrepreneurs working in Saigon, the southern capital officially called Ho Chi Minh City, believe their compatriots are missing out on the great Asian opportunity of the 1990s. There are, in other words, as many reasons for optimism in Vietnam as for pessimism. Vietnam has a substantial domestic market of 67m inhabitants, most of them hard-working and literate. It is not uncommon to see the poorest tricycle-taxi drivers reading books or serious newspapers on the streets of Saigon. The lack of infrastructure represents opportunity as well as discomfort for foreign investors. The American embargo is being eased, and could be lifted after the US elections. A list of investment needs drawn up by the United Nations and the Vietnam government identifies nearly Dollars 7bn of projects. Japan and Singapore have lucrative trade relations with Vietnam, while Taiwanese and Hong Kong companies have won the lead in foreign investment, taking stakes in everything from the construction of export processing zones to mushroom-processing factories. Giving a typical example of the potential for business in Vietnam, Mr Raymond Eaton, an Australian who heads the trading company Export Development Trading Corporation, told a seminar in Bangkok this month that Vietnam's average per capita consumption of pharmaceuticals amounted to only a dollar a year, a tenth of the average for the developing world. Given political stability and access to funds, he said, there was virtually no reason 'why Vietnam cannot ultimately achieve the same type of impressive growth results as Thailand and other Asian 'miracle economies''.  ----------------------------------------------------------------        JOINT-VENTURE INVESTMENT IN VIETNAM (Dollars m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Country             Number of       Total       Percentage of                     projects        capital    total investment  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Taiwan                 57            755.4           25.4 Hong Kong              86            462.3           15.5 Holland                 5            258.5            8.7 Britain                 9            189.8            6.3 Australia              17            170.7            5.8 Singapore              37            169.7            5.7 France                 25            167.0            5.6 Japan                  24            159.4            5.4 South Korea            14            126.5            4.3 Canada                  9             95.8            3.2 Malaysia               11             89.7            3.1 Sweden                  5             59.5            2.0 Thailand               20             42.0            1.5 Philippines             6             41.9            1.4 Others                 65            185.5            6.2 Total                 390          2,973.7          100.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Vietnamese Government/EDTC, Bangkok  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

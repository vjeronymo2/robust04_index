			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Primary Constituent Elements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining which areas to designate as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological features that are essential to a species' conservation (50 CFR 424.12(b)). The Service is required to list the known primary constituent elements together with a description of any critical habitat that is proposed. Such physical and biological features (i.e., primary constituent elements) include, but are not limited to, the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Cover or shelter; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring, germination, or seed dispersal; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Generally, habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions of a species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary constituent elements essential to the conservation of the delta smelt are physical habitat, water, river flow, and salinity concentrations required to maintain delta smelt habitat for spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing, and adult migration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary constituent elements are organized by habitat conditions required for each life stage. The specific geographic areas and seasons identified for each habitat condition represent the maximum possible range of each of these conditions. Depending on the water-year type (i.e., wet, above normal, normal, below normal, dry, critically dry), each of the habitat conditions specified below requires fluctuation (within-year and between-year) in the placement of the 2 ppt isohaline (a line drawn to connect all points of equal salinity) around three historical reference points. These three historical reference points are the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, the upstream limit of Suisun Bay at Chipps Island, and in the middle of Suisun Bay at Roe Island. The actual number of days that the 2 ppt isohaline is maintained at the three points varies according to water-year type. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, to maintain habitat conditions necessary to achieve recovery of the delta smelt, the number of days at each reference point must simulate a level of water project development equivalent to that which historically existed in 1968. A 1968 level of development represents a period of time before Delta outflow was affected by the SWP and the delta smelt was abundant. This year (1968) falls within the time period identified by the Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team as having had appropriate hydrologic conditions that would allow recovery of the delta smelt. Additionally, on June 15, 1994, the Regional Director signed an Interagency Statement of Principles among the Service, NMFS, and EPA (Plenert, Fullerton, and Seraydarian,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1994) stating, in part, despite the effects of the water projects that were operating at that time, the Estuary ecosystem and its anadromous and resident fisheries were relatively healthy during the years between 1960 and 1970. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, to maintain suitable habitat conditions for recovery of the delta smelt, the naturally-occurring variability found in healthy estuarine ecosystems must be preserved for the following reasons_(1) temporal and spatial variability of the 2 ppt isohaline will be the most effective deterrent to further invasion of newly introduced species and continued competition by those that are already established, (2) placement of the 2 ppt isohaline in Suisun Bay will produce the high phytoplankton and zooplankton densities that characterize most healthy estuarine ecosystems, and (3) variability is needed to simulate natural processes and historical conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary constituent elements for the delta smelt are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spawning Habitat <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Delta smelt adults seek shallow, fresh or slightly brackish backwater sloughs and edgewaters for spawning. To ensure egg hatching and larval viability, spawning areas also must provide suitable water quality (i.e., low concentrations of pollutants) and substrates for egg attachment (e.g., submerged tree roots and branches and emergent vegetation). Specific areas that have been identified as important delta smelt spawning habitat include Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Prospect, Georgiana, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore sloughs and the Sacramento River in the Delta, and tributaries of northern Suisun Bay. The spawning season varies from year to year and may start as early as December and extend until July. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

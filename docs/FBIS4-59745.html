			<p>BFN     [Text] Ba'labakk, AL-NAHAR--Following a compulsory  suspension lasting 50 days, Al-Fajr Television, the organ of  Hizballah in the Ba'labakk region, violated the Cabinet decision  banning the transmission of political news and programs.    Two violations occurred, on Sunday and Monday at 2015, when  the television broadcast two newscasts. Viewers confirmed that  the casts contained news of the resistance. But the television  did not carry the newscast last night, Tuesday, after REUTER  reported the violations. The newscast was replaced by a film  about the resistance.    This step was taken amid the three-day-old government crisis  caused by the seclusion of Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.    Ghassan Darwish, director of Al-Fajr Television, confirmed  the newscast had resumed but said that the focus was on social,  cultural, economic, and sports news.    The violation in al-Biqa' followed other violations recorded  in Beirut recently. These included the Phalangist Party's Voice  of Lebanon, which carried an economic newscast including  political news, and Hizballah's Al-Manar Television, which  broadcasts political speeches by men of religion. It is known  that Al-Mashriq Television is broadcasting Syrian television's  newscasts while CVN Television broadcasts newscasts by the  London-based Saudi MBC Television.</p>

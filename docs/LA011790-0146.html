			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> OPERA NOT FOR CASINO CROWD  </P> <P> Actor Paul Sorvino is turning again to singing, but the acclaimed opera singer  says he knows better than to try to soothe the savage beast of gamblers with an  aria.  </P> <P> "I think people who are losing $20,000 are not going to want to hear it," he  said.  </P> <P> Instead, Sorvino will be belting out Broadway tunes, a few Neopolitan songs and  some standards this weekend at the Showboat Hotel &amp; Casino.  </P> <P> His singing work in the past has been sporadic. He recorded the cast album to  the Broadway shows "Carmelina" and "The Bakers Wife," 13 years ago and gave a  concert at New York City's Town Hall in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> His acting roles include the bigoted Southern cop in the television mini-series  "Chiefs." He plays gangster Lips Manlis in the Warren Beatty film "Dick Tracy,"  which is due for release in a few months; a Mafia don opposite Robert DeNiro in  Martin Scorcese's "Good Paul Fellas," and a renegade CIA agent in "DMZ."  </P></p>

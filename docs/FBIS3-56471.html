"I may occupy the post of the minister for CIS affairs only  in case it envisages the status of a vice-premier", Shokhin told  TASS on Monday.    He added that the government is currently facing a  complicated situation as it has to combine financial  stabilisation with the policy of promoting production which  needs enormous finances.    The current reorganisation of the government also  complicates  the situation, according to Shokhin.    "The existing situation in the country calls for two  necessary things: a strict definition of concrete measures and  the sharing of roles in the government", he stressed.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Control Directorate of the Administration of </F> the President of the Russian Federation: "Information on the  Results of the Audit of the Financial-Economic Activity of the  Ostankino Russian State Television and Radio Company"]    [Text] [begin boxed item]  <H5>  Scandals: Where Are the Remains of the Ostankino Billions? </H5>   The provocation regarding the "version" of the state coup  had  barely died down when a new stage in the search for enemies  could be heard.    A quite reputable publication--NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA  GAZETA--on whose editorial board there do not seem to be any  provocateurs but with which such respectable politicians as M.  Gorbachev and G. Yavlinskiy are affiliated, published  information on 30 March concerning the results of an audit of  the financial-economic activity of the Ostankino television and  radio company conducted by the Control Directorate of the  Administration of the President of the Russian Federation.    It would seem that the publication of this kind of document  should only be welcomed. However, this publication turned out to  be very peculiar. After making a number of removals from the  text of the document and accompanying its principal propositions  with caustic comments directed at the auditors themselves, as  well as at those "close to the president," NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA  GAZETA accused the Control Directorate of performing some kind  of "sociopolitical order."    The sense of the accusation is extremely simple. According  to  this logic, people are divided into strangers and friends. The  first are members of the nomenklatura and partocrats (V. Bragin,  Yu. Bandura)--they should be the subjects of the most thorough  attention and investigation. The second, the freedom-loving  democrats (Ye. Yakovlev, I. Malashenko, A. Maslyanov, and A.  Razbash, VID and INTERVID members), are untouchable. Any  investigation of their financial-economic activity is assessed  as subversive sociopolitical activity by the enemies of reform  and perestroyka. Briefly, do not touch ours!    This dual morality on the part of the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA  GAZETA publishers becomes obvious when you familiarize yourself  with the original source in its full text, which we suggest that  you do today.    The document we are publishing was sent by the Control  Directorate of the Administration of the President to A.N.  Yakovlev, chairman of the Russian State Television and Radio  Company, "for examination and adoption of appropriate measures"  and, judging by everything, it was not intended for the press by  the auditors. In this connection, the question arises for NOVAYA  YEZNEDNEVNAYA GAZETA:    What place does your publication hold in the "rating of  lies?" [end boxed item]  <H8>  * * * </H8>   In accordance with instructions, a Control Directorate  Commission, with the enlistment of specialists of the Ministry  of Finance of Russia, the State Committee of Taxation of Russia,  the State Committee for Management of State Property of Russia,  the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]] of Russia, and the DNP  [Russian Federation Department of Tax Police], conducted an  audit of the financial-economic activity of the Russian State  Television and Radio Company (RGTRK) Ostankino in  January-February of this year.    In 1993 the Ministry of Finance of Russia financed the  expenditures of the RGTRK Ostankino from the republic budget of  the Russian Federation in the sum of 103.7 billion rubles [R],  of which R82.8 billion, or 80 percent, constituted payment for  services of the Ministry of Communications of Russia, and R20.9  billion was expended on its own needs. At the outset of 1994 the  company's indebtedness to state enterprises that ensure the  dissemination and broadcasting of radio and television programs  was R50.3 billion, and to the Television Technical Center  (TTTs), R1.8 billion. It should be noted that the present  indebtedness to enterprises of the Ministry of Communications  led to severe social tension of these enterprises in labor  collectives and created hotbeds of strikes in many regions of  the country.    At the same time, despite the difficult financial situation,  the leadership of the company and the general economic board of  directors did not undertake the necessary measures to eliminate  deficiencies in the expenditure of budgetary resources, and also  to increase the efficiency of commercial activities. A number of  shortcomings noted in the materials of the audit by the KRU  [Control-Auditing Directorate] of the Ministry of Finance of  Russia for 1992 have not been eliminated to the present time.    Budgetary resources continue to be used for purposes other  than those designated. Of the resources allocated in 1993  specifically designated for payment for technical means of  communication, R2.4 billion was directed at financing the  services of the TTTs, the production of films of the Ekran  association, and also maintenance of buildings and other  administrative expenditures.    As a result of the lack of proper control on the part of the  leadership of the RGTRK Ostankino (former chairman V.I. Bragin),  individual television studios during the past year illegally  allowed an increase in the volume of broadcasting established  for them, which was financed from the republic budget of the  Russian Federation. The Information Television Agency, the  Musical and Entertainment Programs Studio, and the National  Creative Arts Studio exceeded their broadcast time limit. As a  whole, the company groundlessly spent budgetary allocations in  the sum of R3.3 billion on an above-plan volume of broadcasting  of original programs. To this day, the company has not fulfilled  paragraph seven of the Edict of the President of the Russian  Federation of 18 December 1993 No. 2206 "On Urgent Measures of  Support of State Television and Radio Broadcasting" in the part  on submitting proposals to the Government of the Russian  Federation in a month's time on possible reductions in the  volume of television and radiobroadcasting.    The question of payment of costs associated with  broadcasting  programs of the first television channel, the first radio  program, and the Mayak programs to the CIS countries and the  near abroad has not been resolved, and all expenditures to this  day are being paid from the Russian Federation budget. They  amounted to R18.5 billion in 1993. Moreover, at the outset of  this year there is an indebtedness in the sum of R10 billion.    The RGTRK Ostankino is engaged in commercial activity in an  extremely ineffective way, and in a number of cases it is even  conducting it to the detriment of its own interests. Advertising  in television and radio broadcasting, which is one of the main  sources of commercial income of the company, is arranged in a  practically uncontrolled way. It was only in May 1993 that the  main advertising-commercial directorate was established.  However, up to the present time the work associated with  advertising is conducted by different structural subdivisions  independently. The absence of a unified system of accounting and  control does not allow the availability of reliable data on the  resources the company receives from advertising activity. Cases  of advertising time established by contracts being exceeded by  the television company VID, the producer firm Master TV, and  other studios were revealed.    In 1993 cases were allowed in which budgetary allocations  were allotted to subdivisions without taking into account  resources that they received from commercial activity. Thus, the  board of directors of television programs was allocated R38  million at a time when the expenditures of the studio were fully  covered thanks to income received from advertising activity.  Just as heedlessly, R21 million were allocated to Radio  Podmoskovye. A selective audit conducted in five studios  established cases of nonpayment for placed advertising as far  back as 1992 for a total sum of R45 million. In 1993 the  indebtedness amounted to R441 million.    It was only in December 1993 that the leadership of the  company signed orders in which an attempt was made at  systematization, accounting, and regulation of advertising  activity, a statute was approved on the broadcasting advertising  activity of the RGTRK Ostankino and the minimum calculation for  advertising, and periods were established for effective rates.    In 1993 the yield from commercial activity totaled R11.2  billion, although, according to an expert estimate of the  Sociological Center, just for showing advertising RGTRK  Ostankino should have received a profit of no less than R60  billion. This estimate is corroborated by the results of an  audit of activity associated with the purchase of licenses for  the right to show television serials by way of allocation  instead of advertising time.    As was shown by the terms of a contract concluded on 16  February 1993 by I.E. Malashenko, acting chairman of the  company, with the advertising agency (RA) Premyer SV, in  cooperation for the purchase from the WORLD VISION Company of  the rights to show the television serial "Twin Peaks" and the  organization of its showing on the RGTRK Ostankino channel,  RGTRK Ostankino would have been able to receive R1.3 billion. In  the contract, without the appropriate economic calculations,  this agency was granted 120 minutes of advertising time in all  30 episodes of the film, which according to the most minimal  calculations amounts to about R596 million, while the total cost  of renting the film is R159 million. What is more, the RA  Premyer SV was given exclusive right of selection and placement  of advertising in time belonging to the company (180 minutes)  with estimated discounts of 30 percent, as a result of which the  agency envisions additional income in the sum of R273 million.  In 1993, in the course of the implementation of the contract, at  the fault of the RA Premyer SV, 27 minutes of the company's  advertising time was not used, in connection with which it did  not receive a sum of R205 million. However, for shifting the  dates of the showing of the television serial in the period of  the preelection campaign, the Premyer SV advertising agency  suddenly demanded an additional 69 minutes of advertising time,  which could bring it income on the order of R393 million.  Despite the fact that this violation was the result of "force  majeure" circumstances and was associated with the necessity to  implement Edict of the President of the Russian Federation of 29  October 1993 No. 1792, the company unconditionally satisfied the  claims of the agency. In addition, it paid for the services of  the Ministry of Communications of Russia in the amount of R57  million for actually used advertising time.    The contracts of 7 October 1993 were signed on these very  conditions on behalf of the company by V.V. Lazutkin, the deputy  chairman, with the same RA Premyer SV for showing the television  serials "Don Ogast," "Streets of San Francisco," and "Wild  Rose," 225 episodes all told.    Only four television serials out of more than 100 films  acquired by the Cinema Program Studio in 1993 were involved in  the audit, and the loss to the company will total more than  R12.3 billion, which basically goes into the income of the RA  Premyer SV.    With the connivance of the leadership of the RGTRK  Ostankino,  the activity of the commercial enterprises that were established  by subdivisions of the company was allowed to drift. According  to the status at the beginning of 1994, the founders did not  have data available on the number of enterprises and the sums of  payments submitted to their charter fund. Incomes from the  activity of the commercial structures are not coming to the  company.    During the audit of the RGTRK Ostankino, an examination was  made of the television company VID, the Intervid corporation,  the Television Technical Center, the enterprises Vzglyad,  Telechannel 2X2, TV Service, Cooperation, and a number of others  that are directly associated with television and radio  broadcasting and that cooperate with the company.    It has been established that individual enterprises are  indebted to the company for the payment of services, and cases  of nonpayment of taxes were also disclosed. In accordance with  legislation in force, they were charged with additional payments  to the budget for a total sum of R1.1 billion.    The question of the conduct of editing-publishing activity  in  the issuance of a television and radio press product has not  been decided. A dispute of the leadership of the company and the  editorial offices of the newspaper SEM DNEY, and the journals  KRUGOZOR, KOLOBOK, and TELERADIOEFIR that are part of its  structure, has been going on for practically all of 1993 with  the joint-stock company RTV-press.    Court examination of the complaint of V.I. Bragin, former  chairman of RGTRK Ostankino, continued for almost a year. In  addition, the Higher Court of Arbitration handed down several  judicial decisions. At the present time the statement on filing  a protest was recalled from the court by A.N. Yakovlev, acting  chairman of the company. The dispute has remained unsettled,  although the State Committee for Management of State Property of  Russia illegally adopted a directive of 31 December 1992  No.1313-r on the creation of RTV-press in the form of a  joint-stock company of the open type with the right of  subsequent increase of the authorized capital by means of  additional issuances of stock. The State Committee for the  Management of State Property of Russia, not being a founder of  the newspaper SEM DNEY, and the journals KOLOBOK, KRUGOZOR and  TELERADIOEFIR, did not have the right to be in charge of them,  and also to establish, as envisioned by Directive of the  Government of the Russian Federation of 2 December 1993 No.  2171, an enterprise of a mixed form of property. The collectives  of the editorial offices of the indicated publications, awaiting  a final decision, were idle; however, about R110 million of  budget resources were expended on their maintenance.    The printing equipment of the Berthold firm, costing about  DM2 million, was bought in January 1992 for resources allocated  by the Ministry of Finance of Russia at the request of Ye.V.  Yakovlev (former chairman of the company), allegedly to reequip  the television apparatus, was transferred to the TOO [limited  responsibility company] RT-press, and afterwards--to the  joint-stock company RTV-press. From the moment of acquisition,  this equipment has been on the balance sheet of the company, and  the sum of deductions for depreciation totaled R28 million for  1993 alone.    Contractual discipline is at an extremely low level. During  1992-1993 no procedure was established in the company for  concluding contracts, and no record of them was maintained. In  the past year the main personnel directorate of the company  disclosed 115 unregistered contracts; however, it was not until  August 1993 that an order was published on the introduction of a  single register of legal documents. Frequently, contracts in  behalf of the company are signed by managers of its structural  subdivisions who do not have the appropriate authority;  contracts are often drawn up without juridical study, they do  not contain conditions that regulate the responsibility of the  parties and the effective dates, they do not establish the  procedure for their cancellation, and they frequently are of a  declaratory nature.    Up to the present time, the RGTRK Ostankino has not  concluded  a contract between the company and its main partner--the  Television Technical Center. The main editorial board of the  musical broadcasting studio Radio-1 frequently concluded  commercial transactions without their written formulation. On 5  July of last year A.L. Razbash, former director of the creative  arts association Eksperiment, now the deputy chairman of the  company, concluded a contract on behalf of the RGTRK Ostankino  with the television company VID for the production of the  Capital-Show television program "Field of Miracles" in 1993,  without having the power of attorney to do so. According to the  status on 1 February of this year, the television company VID  has an indebtedness to the company of R52 million, and another  R70 million had to be exacted in the form of fines for delayed  payments. This program continues to be shown despite the absence  of a contract and unpaid debts.    It has been established that some contracts not only do not  protect the economic interests of the company but are simply not  profitable for it. Thus, on 7 October 1993 the children and  youth programs studio of the RGTRK Ostankino concluded a  contract with INMAK, a joint-stock company of the closed type,  and the Association of Assistance to the Development of  Children's Television (limited company), for the showing of  advertising subjects of the joint-stock company INMAK. At the  same time, the transfer of monetary resources is supposed to be  made, according to this contract, to the current account of the  association, which is not part of the company's structure.    A contract concluded on 12 July 1993 between the RGTRK  Ostankino (former deputy chairman Yu.N. Bandura) and the firm  Jeronimo LTD concerning cooperation in the purchase of rights to  show film products of Western Europe and the United States, and  also the organization of their showing on company channels,  envisions the payment of income from advertising during the  showing of films to the current accounts of foreign firms.    In accordance with a "Supplement to a Gentleman's Agreement"  drawn up on 24 July 1993 by Yu.N. Bandura, former deputy  chairman of the RGTRK Ostankino, and Mr. I. Amors, president of  the enterprise Ostankino Development, 100 minutes of advertising  time will be transferred from this enterprise to the company at  a price of $3,000. Thus, the enterprise sold the company a  "commodity" that it did not own officially. Nevertheless, on the  instructions of the former leadership of the RGTRK Ostankino  (V.I. Bragin and Yu.N. Bandura), in October 1993 the company  transferred $300,000 to the account of this enterprise.    In 1993 the RGTRK Ostankino (former chairman V.I. Bragin)  concluded a contract with the TOO Kamaka on the rerecording by  the firm of television materials with the subsequent sale of the  right of showing them by commercial television companies. In the  period from July to December of 1993, the TOO Kamaka transferred  to the company 360 cassettes with 432 programs from which 382  were taken from the State Television and Radio Fund. The firm  received R25 million for this work; i.e., resources were spent  on the rerecording of programs already available in the state  fund. To the present time, the company is not receiving income  from this contract.    The RGTRK Ostankino also does not have any kind of profits  from a transaction concluded back in 1992 with the American  corporation U.S.S.U. Arts Group, which was granted the exclusive  right to the use of recordings of productions of classical music  stored in the archives of the State Television and Radio Fund.    On 16 January 1994, the "Aleksandr-Show," or "30 Years Ago"  program, went on the air. Of the R67 million that were spent on  the creation of this program, R40 million were allocated to the  enterprise AMiK by the leadership of the company at the request  of A.L. Razbash, who was at that time director of the  Eksperiment association. The letter reported that the program  will represent a story about television's past and present, but  not the traditional anniversary celebration, and, in addition,  there would be no commercials. But in reality, almost eight  minutes of advertising time was set into the program. Even with  a minimum estimate of the cost of one minute of advertising  amounting to $12,000, this firm should receive an income of  $96,000. But the company incurred only the expenses, inasmuch  as, according to the contract concluded with the AMiK firm in  1993 on behalf of the RGTRK Ostankino by I.M. Podzigun, who was  then the deputy director of the Eksperiment creative arts  association, no stipulation on advertising time for the company  was made.    The reorganization of the Russian television system and the  emergence in this connection of several state and independent  television companies entailed serious problems that required  their resolution on a legislative basis. Thus, the television  companies entered into a competitive battle between themselves  for an expansion of the viewing audience, often not taking the  interests of the viewers into account. For example, the first  channel of RGTRK Ostankino traditionally shows the main part of  "Novosti" at 2100, and the All-Russian State Television and  Radio Company on the second channel starts to show the next of  the "Santa Barbara" series, or the rubric "Detective on  Mondays." But during the Olympic Games in France in 1992 these  companies transmitted the opening and the closing of the games  simultaneously.    The fact that the election blocs were in an unequal position  during the preelection campaign can also be tied to the  reorganization of state television. Thus, the blocs Civic Union  in Behalf of the Stabilization of Justice and Progress, the  Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia, and the Civic Club used more  than 70 minutes of air time each, paying for these services in a  timely way. At the same time, the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord and the Democratic Party of Russia blocs and others have  not yet been able to make payment even for the 14 and 24 minutes  respectively of air time granted them.    Up to the present time, a founders' contract has not been  concluded between the Government of the Russian Federation and  the RGTRK Ostankino that should regulate the mutual relations  between the founder and the company, which is envisioned by the  statute on the Russian State Television and Radio Company  Ostankino approved by Edict of the President of the Russian  Federation 2 April 1992 No. 421 "On Guarantees of Information  Stabilization in the Activity of the Russian State Television  and Radio Company Ostankino." The lack of a unified concept in  the sphere of state television and radiobroadcasting has led to  the direction of activity of the company being basically  determined by the position of its leadership, but often also by  the broadcasting studios themselves.    The former leadership of the RGTRK Ostankino mainly paid  attention in its activity to structural changes, without taking  the necessary measures to reduce losses from the republic  budget. Thus, analysis of the orders adopted in 1993, when V.I.  Bragin was chairman of the company, showed that about 90 percent  of them constituted orders on changing the structure and  personnel lists of the subdivisions. Continuous changes led  mainly to superfluous numbers. Thus, in the television studios  in 1993, given a reduction in the volume of broadcasting in  comparison with 1991 of almost one-third, personnel were cut by  only 17 percent. In addition, the company not only reduced the  volume of broadcasting but also lost program quality.    With the establishment of the RGTRK Ostankino, by Edict of  the President of the Russian Federation of 27 December 1991 No.  331 "On the Television and Radio Company Ostankino," all  associations, enterprises, and organizations that were  liquidated by the All-Union State Television and Radio  Broadcasting Company located on the territory of the Russian  Federation were included in its structure. In the last two  years, with the participation of the former leaders, the company  has been deprived of practically all its buildings, equipment,  and other property, but the main thing is the Television  Technical Center. As a result of the reorganization conducted,  the balance sheet of the RGTRK Ostankino now has only half of  the production area in building 25 on Pyatnitskaya Street.  Because of lack of premises the company was forced to rent an  area in the Television Technical Center in building 12 on  Koroleva Street.    For the purpose of eliminating the noted deficiencies, it is  advisable to send the auditing materials to the leadership of  the RGTRK Ostankino for the adoption of measures.</p>

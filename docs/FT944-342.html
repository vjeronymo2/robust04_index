			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bank of NY cements role in ADR sales Bank of New York is to buy the American Depositary Receipt (ADR) business of Bank of America, in a deal that cements its position as the leading ADR bank in the US. ADRs are baskets of shares of foreign companies denominated in dollars and held on deposit at US banks. They make it easy for foreign companies to sell their stock to US investors. In recent years their popularity has grown, as US investors have bought more foreign shares in an attempt to diversify their portfolios and participate in the rapid growth of many non-US equities markets. Under the agreement, Bank of New York will buy from Bank of America some 90 ADRs of companies from Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and the UK.</p>

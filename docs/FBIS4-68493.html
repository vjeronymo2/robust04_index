			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Mark Viktorov: "Number </F> of Private Property Owners in the Kray Is Increasing"]    [Text] Privatization in Maritime Kray has passed the  1,000 mark: Exactly this number of enterprises, according to the  data of kray statisticians, today moved into private or  joint-stock company ownership. It can thereby be claimed that a  private property market branch of the economy is being actively  formed, although the main part (80 percent) of produced products  still falls to the share of state enterprises.    Destatization is now being accomplished mainly through the  sale of enterprises in competition or auction, and only 12  percent of the enterprises have gone through a full or partial  auction. The largest number of sales (54 percent) belongs to  retail or wholesale trade, and also consumer services for the  population, construction, and public catering. Agriculture has  been affected least of all by privatization in the kray--only  one percent of enterprises have changed ownership in this sector.    Privatization of large and average enterprises is being  implemented by means of auction. Of the three variants of  privileges offered labor collectives, preference is given to the  second variant, which allows the possession of a controlling  package of stocks.    The relatively low value of property of enterprises of  municipal ownership (on average amounting to 590,000 rubles  [R]), and the relatively small-scale investment that is  necessary after their acquisition naturally attract the  attention of commercial structures, which at times results in  severe competition in trades and, accordingly, a high sales rate.    As a result of privatization, R6 billion was received this  year (including resources received in the years 1992-1993), of  which a large part (63 percent) was transferred to the budget of  the territory of Maritime Kray.    Not long ago Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, governor of the kray,  approved a privatization program for 1994. Its main objectives  are expansion of the strata of private property owners as the  main formation of market relations, completion of check  privatization, further auctioning of large and average  enterprises, mainly in the production sphere, and attraction to  it of additional investments. In principle this is supposed to  increase the effectiveness of the kray's economy, create a  competitive environment in the production sphere, and promote  the development of a fund market in the kray.    According to this program it is planned to privatize all  told  more than 500 enterprises and facilities in 1994, of which 82  are federal and 43 kray, and 376 are municipally owned. Total  receipts from privatization should amount to R12.5 billion for  the year, and R7.5 in privatization checks.    In the first half year alone it is planned to offer shares  of  stock of about 200 joint-stock companies at specialized check  auctions. It is planned to offer stock of the joint-stock  company Dalzavod (40,800 units) and Vostokproyektverf (1,800  units) at an interregional all-Russian check auction.    A Maritime Kray central depository system will be put into  operation this year, which will make it possible to speed up  completion of transactions and follow the securities market  outside the exchange. In addition, a scheme will be laid in the  central depository system that will make it possible to rule out  the opportunity for transactions of several stockholders in the  very same securities.    The progress of housing privatization has to be discussed  separately. According to the information of the aforementioned  statisticians, on 1 April 189,000 apartments were privatized in  the kray (8.9852 million square meters of housing), of which  16,531 apartments (770,000 square meters of housing) were  privatized in the first quarter of 1994. Moreover, 15 unoccupied  apartments were sold, including three apartments to  organizations. The total value from the sale of apartments to  private ownership was R60.7 million.    In January-March, according to a directive of the president  of the Russian Federation, servicemen were assigned 27  apartments, which is of course insufficient. All told, from the  moment of the issuance of the president's directive the military  were assigned 99 apartments, which is 7 percent of that planned.</p>

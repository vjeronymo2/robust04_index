			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Opinion" by correspondent Leonid Timofeyev: "Russia </F> Convinced That New Diplomacy Is Only Old Diplomacy That Is Well  and Truly Forgotten"; article is preceded by two quotes  attributed to Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: "CIS and  Baltic Countries Are the Region Where Russia's Paramount Vital  Interests Are Focused. It Is Also From There That the Main  Threats to Those Interests Emanate"; "We Must Not Abandon Those  Regions That Have for Centuries Been Spheres of Russian  Interests. And We Must Not Be Afraid To Say So"]    [Text] Russia's close neighbors were wrong to take offense  at Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's statement to the  effect that the CIS and Baltic countries are the focus of our  vital interests and that the main threats to these interests  emanate from there.    Take Tajikistan at least. The internal conflict and its  proximity to unstable Afghanistan generate a host of problems  for the whole CIS and Russia in particular. Drugs, weapons, the  future of the Russian-speaking population, and the economy cause  Moscow concern. The Russian leadership has not hidden its  commitment to settling the Tajik crisis, as it has repeatedly  stated, by organizing dialogue between the Dushanbe authorities  and the opposition. Admittedly, according to our information,  that country's government is reluctant to enter into contact  with its opponents. And for the moment the Russian Federation's  201st Motorized Rifle Division and Russian border outposts are  forced to maintain the defenses. After all, there are no longer  any guarded borders beyond them.    In the past year alone 350 clashes and attempts at  infiltration have been recorded on the Tajik-Afghan border.  Some 31 service caps have lain on fresh graves.    A similar picture can be painted as far as producing a more  stable internal situation in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan is  concerned. The latter's border with the PRC has been guarded by  everyone. After the latest "demobbing" the Ukrainians and  Belarusians went home. The latest draft in Russia produced a  tremendous shortfall, and the Kazakhs do not have the forces or  the experience to cover many hundreds of kilometers. So the  border has come unlocked, and hordes of people from adjacent  states are crossing it to enter the wide expanses of the CIS.  And not all the "boys" involved have Chinese blouses and  slippers in their rucksacks. It is not only Russia that is the  destination of this stream of people, but also the west of  Europe, including the Baltic countries.    There is another aspect to the border problem. The republics  of the former USSR have become autonomous and sovereign, and no  one is encroaching on their sovereignty. But Ashgabat, Baku,  and Tashkent are using a simplified, problem-free procedure to  issue Iranians and Turks with visas. Are there Islamic  fundamentalists among them? Virtually nothing prevents them  then taking a ticket to Moscow.    Take another of the "hot spots" -- Nagorno-Karabakh, over  which a war is blazing between Azerbaijan and Armenia. What  makes Russia take vigorous action in that region? Economic  interests on the one hand. And the refugees on the other.  Every family must be provided with housing and a means of  existence. We are equally alarmed by the influx of mercenaries  into the conflict zone from Iran, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and even  Russia.    There are irregularities in Russia's relations with Georgia,  Ukraine, Moldova, and the Baltic countries. In some places they  are due to internal conflicts. And in others, like Latvia or  Estonia, the rights of the Russian-speaking population are being  flouted, as even international organizations do not deny.    The Russian diplomatic service says that militarily no one  poses a threat to us. Sooner or later the question of our  troops' withdrawal will also have been resolved. There is no  intention of providing Russia's new borders with technical  reinforcement. And not just because the state cannot  financially stretch to it. The main point is that a security  strip and barbed wire cast doubt on the idea of a single  economic area and economic union. And who, apart from  ourselves, including the Baltic, needs the goods produced at the  former Union departments' enterprises?    It looks as though the interests and threats that Kozyrev  mentioned to his ambassadors are often shared.</p>

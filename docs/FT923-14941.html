			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Mitterrand de Bergerac: James Morgan asks if the French president's visit to Bosnia was really a triumph for German foreign policy - As they say in Europe AMONG THE many events of European nostalgia week was President Mitterrand's visit to Sarajevo on the anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz-Ferdinand. Fortunately he survived it, but in going to the Bosnian capital when he did, he managed to destroy a tradition rather than recall one. It was the German financial daily, Handelsblatt, that hit the nail on the head. 'This demonstrative gesture underlines the fundamental change in a hundred years of French Balkan policy. Mitterrand rebuffed the Serbs whom France has supported for decades.' It concluded that Bonn and Paris now stood shoulder to shoulder on the Yugoslav question. There is a substantial body of feeling in the German financial community, and which is reflected in the editorial politics of Handelsblatt, that holds that Germany has danced to a French tune for far too long. Clearly things have now changed. The view elsewhere was that French foreign policy seemed to be returning to what was hailed universally as panache and audacity. The Dutch paper, De Volkskrant, cried: 'Hero Mitterrand in Sarajevo visit.' In France itself, however, there was self-doubt. Sud-Ouest wrote, 'Everybody, from his soul and his conscience, will admire Francois Mitterrand's gesture, for his 'courage,' as our British neighbours say, with that touch of irony which hints at the Gallic limitations of the enterprise.' The business paper, Tribune de l'Expansion, said: 'There is Cyrano (de Bergerac) in all this. Abroad surprise outweighs admiration. Our European partners can rightly wonder at an initiative taken in a full summit without the slightest concentration.' This is all a far cry from the not so distant past when any French initiative would be greeted with Gaullist slogans about France fulfilling her 'noble, global destiny' (it sounds better in French.) So if Mitterrand was trying to recreate the past the attempt failed and to many it merely provided evidence of how France had changed, not how she had remained faithful to her traditions. To others it seemed a quixotic gesture, almost irrelevant to the dreary world of concentration and harmonisation in which western Europe lives today. Struggling against this windmill was John Major. He gave an interview to Le Monde on the occasion of the Lisbon Summit, British presidency et al, that attracted no interest in Britain but was a rather skilful operation designed to win friends and influence people in France. He at least was not prepared to relinquish the realities of the old Europe and he set about asserting the principles of a Europe of Nations. So there came this passage: 'Look: no nation is more involved in the Community than is France or Germany. Are the French any less French than they were 50 years ago? Certainly not] Are the Germans any less German than 50 years ago? Certainly not]' (My italics). This is taking a taste for tradition too far, I feel. Most Europeans would hope that the Germans had changed a bit since 1942. That, after all, is what the European Com- munity is for. Major also thought the British were just as British as they were then, which may well be true. But by and large his country is not regarded as a lone defender of civilised values these days, last month's images from Sweden of bad English football and worse supporters have helped build up a picture that is somewhat at odds with the traditional English view of themselves. So the headline that appeared in Dagens Nyheter of Stockholm looked strange: 'Major loses battle for Sweden.' In fact it turned out to be the Swedish view of the Lisbon Summit which, apparently, was largely devoted to Swedish membership of the Community and which will not come as soon as many Swedes would like. The lesson from the Rotterdam paper, NRC- Handelsblad, was that the past was past and it is no use repining. An editorial headed 'The strawberry dilemma' began irresistibly: 'Straw- berries, those little kings of summer wrested from the cold earth, are undermining Dutch labour ordinances.' Once upon a time, 18,000 workers were recruited by the employment offices to work as seasonal labourers in the strawberry fields of Limburg. This year 30 turned up. The same crisis has hit the asparagus crop too. The trouble is that the rate for the job in the fields is lower than the current level of unemployment benefit. So now there are thousands of Poles queueing up to do the work and turn their guilders into millions of zloties. But the paper continues, 'Poles are ready to pluck the strawberries and store the asparagus but that cannot happen so long as the Minister of Social Affairs says there are Dutch workers available to do the job.' But they will not do it, so the strawberries rot. The paper concluded there were two solutions, one involved cutting the dole, which was impossible, the other - getting the Poles to do the work. 'But why should the Poles trek to Limburg in grotty buses and pay commission to middle men?' The answer is to grow the strawberries and asparagus on the plains of central Europe instead of in the Netherlands. So this is the future for the new Europe. Politicians and industries can go to the east, but the east must stay firmly where it is. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Observer: Game, set and cash It's obvious when you think about it. Ted Turner wants to buy NBC because otherwise his Turner Broadcasting Systems would look pretty silly in 1996, when Atlanta hosts the next summer Olympics. Turner's cable channels are based in Atlanta, yet would be unable to broadcast the games. But NBC's owner, General Electric, is probably putting the price up each passing day. The rights to broadcast pictures of the games don't come cheap; NBC paid the International Olympic Committee Dollars 456m. And NBC reckons it's already reached half its Dollars 600m target for pre-sold advertising. Coca Cola promises Dollars 62m, General Motors Dollars 50m, and McDonald's Dollars 30m  - and the games are still 19 months away. Turner says he just wants a tiny slice of broadcasting rights. NBC chief Dick Ebersol, who wants to see something up front before striking any such deal, wants to see Turner's cash. Now, if a deal is struck, who might Turner fire first . . .?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, Dec. 17 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  DPRK Foreign Ministry answered a question put by a KCNA reporter  today regarding the rumor now rife in the international  community about the DPRK-U.S. contact made in New York on  December 10.    He said:    A contact between the DPRK and the United States over the  nuclear issue took place in New York on 10 December at the  request of the U.S. side.    As is known, at an earlier contact we had advanced a new  reasonable proposal which could break the present deadlock in  the DPRK-USA talks.    U.S. official figures too took a positive view of it.    At the recent contact, however, the U.S. side came up with a  counter proposal negating ours.    Although the U.S. side described its proposal as  progressive,  there is nothing new in it in actuality. The White House  spokeswoman made this plain when she officially stated that  ``there is no change in the U.S. stand.''    We showed the utmost lenience we could offer at the present  stage, taking into consideration the U.S. side's expression of  its readiness to accept our formula of package solution.  Nevertheless, the United States stubbornly insisted on its  unreasonable stand. Judging from this, we cannot but wonder if  they truly intend to solve the nuclear problem, or seek to  stifle our Republic on the pretext of the nuclear problem,  although they say outwardly they hope for a negotiated solution  of the nuclear problem.    Moreover, we cannot help doubting the United States' will  for  talks because they are deliberately delaying a solution of the  nuclear problem by persistently raising as a precondition for  the third round of the DPRK-USA talks the exchange of special  envoys between the North and the South of Korea, a question  which has nothing to do with the talks.    We made a dramatic offer to accept an inspection of the IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency] necessary for the  continuity of safeguards, an offer commensurate with our special  position in which we temporarily suspended the effectuation of  our withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, out of  our basic stand to solve the nuclear problem fundamentally  through the DPRK-USA talks.    We cannot but be surprised at the fact that the United  States  is laying artificial obstacles again by connecting the exchange  of special envoys between the North and the South, an internal  affair of our nation, with the nuclear issue in a far-fetched  manner at a time when the prospects of a negotiated solution of  the nuclear problem are in sight.    If this resulted from a U.S. policy switchover, we will have  no alternative but to seriously consider our stand toward the  dialogue.    If the United States continue to resort to pressure and  delaying tactics without showing concern for the progress of  the dialogue, it is hard to expect an agreement on the formula  of a package solution even if the third round of talks were  held. Saying its counter proposal is based on an agreement with  its allies, the United States threatened to bring the matter to  the United Nations unless we accept it. We cannot but be on our  guard against this ultimatum-like pressure of the U.S.    In case the last opportunity of a negotiated settlement of  the nuclear issue should be lost because of the unreasonable act  of the United States threatening our existence as today, it  would be the United States that would regret this.    Clear is our position.    It entirely depends on the U.S. attitude whether the third  round of talks are held and the nuclear problem is solved, or  not in the future.</p>

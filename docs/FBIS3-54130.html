In a briefing to military correspondents, Deputy Chief of  Staff Amnon Shahaq said that under the IDF's 1994 work plan, the  IDF will maintain the same level of alertness on the Golan  Heights as it has had for the past few years. The reduction in  the number of Hizballah attacks, Major General Shahaq said, is  linked to the political process, in which Syria is  participating, and there is no doubt that Syria will continue to  use Hizballah according to its political needs, as it has done  in previous years.</p>

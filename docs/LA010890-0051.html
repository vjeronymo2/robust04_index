			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'THE GRANNY' A COMIC PARABLE IN SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Granny is 100 years old -- and still eating after all those years. Interminable  and insatiable, she's a perpetual consumption machine. She'll lick your plate  clean, as well as her own. Within 20 minutes after she retires at night, she's  ready for breakfast. And she never gets fat. Her metabolism is a biological  miracle.  </P> <P> Give her this day her daily bread -- and her daily pasta, popcorn, chocolates,  whatever.  </P> <P> This old lady is the centerpiece of "The Granny" ("La Nonna"), a remarkably  potent comic parable at the Old Globe.  </P> <P> First produced in Buenos Aires in 1977, Roberto M. Cossa's play was, at the  time, a muted howl against the Argentine military dictators. The other  characters' efforts to satisfy Granny invariably fail. While doing her bidding,  they gradually lose their moral compass, but she demands still more. Finally,  one by one, they "disappear."  </P> <P> Yet the Granny is not necessarily synonymous with the Argentine regime of the  time, for she has outlived it. Her story has a number of other possible  interpretations in San Diego in 1990, and it's part of the fun of this play to  apply its symbolism to our own culture.  </P> <P> Let's see now: Granny as the baby boomer generation, 30 years hence. Granny as  a Wall Street buccaneer. Granny as the politicians who ignore the federal  deficit. Granny as anyone who is better at consuming than at creating or  conserving.  </P> <P> You don't have to play this game to enjoy "The Granny," however. Even -- or  especially -- on the most literal level, this is a wickedly funny show. Much of  the comedy is due to the inspired casting of John Fleck as the Granny.  </P> <P> The more adventurous Los Angeles theater audiences know Fleck as a outre  performance artist with an interest in androgyny, a wide vocal range and a  predilection for doing strange things with goldfish. Well, in "The Granny,"  Fleck is in deep drag. He gets to hum snatches of opera in his falsetto, then  drop into his basso register in the play's final scene.  </P> <P> But Fleck isn't just repeating his own act. Twisting his gaze in order to  appraise his chances at grabbing another bite off someone's plate, flicking his  tongue in satisfaction over each morsel, then demanding more with steely  resolve despite whatever chaos is happening around him, his Granny has the  integrity of a precisely sketched cartoon.  </P> <P> Lillian Garrett-Groag's arena staging, in the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre  Stage, doesn't do full justice to Fleck's performance. During a long sequence  near the end of the first act, the spectators in the north and east sections of  the house were roaring with laughter at Fleck's antics, while those of us in  the south and west sections saw nothing but his back.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Fleck is hardly the whole show. La Nonna's grandsons, the  hard-working Carmelo (Patrick Husted) and the indolent Chicho (Marcelo Tubert)  are hilarious as they try to cope with the old woman and the poverty that her  gluttony engenders.  </P> <P> As La Nonna's anxious daughter, Myriam Tubert frets well, to no avail. Rose  Portillo's Maria, Carmelo's wife, worries with a harder edge; as the only  character who isn't related by blood to La Nonna, she has a degree of  objectivity.  </P> <P> Laura P. Vega plays Carmelo's and Maria's daughter, Marta, whose dress for her  job in a "pharmacy" become progressively sluttier as the play continues (Robert  Wojewodski did the costumes). As a hapless neighbor who is roped into matrimony  with La Nonna, Julio Medina is a pitiful emblem of foolish vanity.  </P> <P> Garrett-Groag's ensemble exhibits crackerjack timing. The accents are all over  the map, but it doesn't matter as much in this stylized situation as it would  in a more realistic play. Raul Moncada's translation uses plenty of  contemporary American vernacular, the better to draw the parallels between  there and here.  </P> <P> Robert Brill designed a house in disrepair, which looks as if it may slide off  its foundation at any moment. Around the edges of the stage are fragments of  advertisements, touting the good life that has so conspicuously eluded this  family.  </P> <P>  In Balboa Park, San Diego, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7  p.m. Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. Ends Feb. 18. Tickets:  $17.50-$27.50; (619) 239-2255.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sweden has turned down a United Nations request to  send more troops to Bosnia on the grounds that it presently has  no soldiers trained to carry out the assignment. Sixteen other  countries, including Norway, have also been approached. And, 11  Swedes are receiving intensive training in Serbo-Croatian in  order to serve as interpreters in the Nordic UN battalion in  Bosnia. They are to replace Swedish interpreters of Yugoslavian  origin who, it is feared, run the risk of being considered  biased by Bosnia's ethnic groups on the grounds of their accents  or family names.</p>

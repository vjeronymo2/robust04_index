In Public Law 102&hyph;375, the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1992, Congress specifically identified six primary purposes for the White House Conference on Aging. They are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) To increase public awareness of the interdependence of generations and the essential contributions of older individuals to society for the well-being of all generations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To identify the problems facing older individuals and the commonalities of the problems with problems of younger generations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) To examine the well-being of older individuals, including the impact the wellness of older individuals has on our aging society; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) To develop such specific and comprehensive recommendations for executive and legislative action as may be appropriate for maintaining and improving the well-being of the aging; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) To develop recommendations for the coordination of Federal policy with State and local needs and the implementation of such recommendations; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) To review the status and multigenerational value of recommendations adopted at previous White House Conferences on Aging. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that particular emphasis should be directed to purposes 1 and 5 listed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Guidelines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order for the White House Conference on Aging to consider recognizing a local activity, event or program, it must meet the following basic criteria: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) It must be a policy-oriented event; the focus must be on one or more Federal policy issues affecting the elderly or the near-elderly; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) It must guarantee the participation of older persons; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) It must produce a written report within 30&hyph;45 days summarizing major issues discussed and recommendations proposed that can be utilized by the White House Conference on Aging; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) It must not be a profit-making or fundraising event although it is permissible to charge a fee to recover the costs of the event; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) It must be approved by the Executive Director. If the White House Conference on Aging agrees to recognize the event, an official letter will be provided that could be presented at the activity, event or program. In certain limited instances, the White House Conference on Aging may also be able to participate. A White House Conference on Aging recognition allows the activity, event or program to publicize that it has been recognized by the WHCOA and that it will be listed in the final report of the Conference. However, recognition does not imply that the WHCOA endorses the recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested organizations should respond to the questions set out in the appended form and send the information to the above address as soon as possible. It will be reviewed and a response sent as expeditiously as possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Fernando M.

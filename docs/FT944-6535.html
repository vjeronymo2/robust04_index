			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Field Group advances to Pounds 7.26m at halfway stage Field Group, the carton maker which went public in July last year, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds 7.26m in the 26 weeks to October 2. Compared with the pro forma figure for the previous half year, which assumes that flotation took place at the beginning of that period rather than in July, pre-tax profits rose by 7 per cent from Pounds 6.79m. In a tough market environment of rising raw materials costs and fierce competition in the food and household sector, total sales nudged up 3.5 per cent to Pounds 77.7m (Pounds 75m) and operating profits were up 5 per cent at Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 6.97m). Operating margins were slightly higher at 9.4 per cent, against 9.3 per cent the previous year. Mr Keith Gilchrist, chief executive, said: 'We have tried to maintain the margin rather than go for increased volume.' Field, which has a 14 per cent share of the UK market, saw raw materials prices rise by about 25 per cent. The most difficult sector in which to pass these on to customers was food and household products, where there was tough competition among supermarket retailers. In the international and branded sector, which constitutes 52 per cent of group sales, Field has recently won two important single supply contracts - a five-year deal with United Distillers, worth some Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m a year in sales, and another long-term contract with William Grant &amp; Sons Distillers, worth Pounds 1.5m a year. Helped by a lower tax charge of Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.77m) and a reduced interest bill of Pounds 48,000 (Pounds 176,000), pro forma earnings per share improved by 11 per cent to 9.4p (8.5p). The interim dividend is 2.5p (2.3p). The shares rose 3p to 232p, against a flotation price of 250p.</p>

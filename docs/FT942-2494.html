			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Property: A listed 'planning blot' - Gerald Cadogan views a house, fit for fictional detective Hercule Poirot, which could be an enticing prospect for a fan of 1930s' architecture The new house was a blot on the landscape in 1931, an austere white fortress on a bare Chilterns hillside above Amersham, Buckinghamshire. Inspired by Le Corbusier, the Swiss-born architect, it contradicted the home sweet home notions of Metroland (the suburban development of Middlesex and Bucks along the Metropolitan Railway). The planning authority gave permission 'with extreme reluctance' and the locals called it the 'aeroplane house' because its long slabs of wall, interrupted by steel-framed windows, looked like the wings and struts of a biplane. Now, it is a listed building; indeed, it was a setting for filming Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot television series. The house was called High and Over, after a windy hill on the South Downs in Sussex. A New Zealander, Amyas Connell, designed it for Bernard Ashmole, a friend who then was professor of classical archaeology at University College, London. Christopher Hussey, writing in Country Life, called the building 'the conception of young men'. He went on to acclaim it as 'the home of a 20th century family that loves air and sunlight and open country'. Connell built it with a concrete frame; brick filling rendered with cement and white-washed; and concrete blocks inside. Its utter lack of compromise and clean lines must have reminded Ashmole of ancient Greece, one of his specialities. The two met in Rome when Ashmole was director of the British School and associating with a lively group of artists and archaeologists such as Rex Whistler and Barbara Hepworth (as he tells in his autobiography* which appears on June 22, the centenary of his birth). The son of an estate agent in Ilford, Essex, he was related to the Elias Ashmole whose collection is the basis of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. That background was ideal for a classical art historian, as he became after surviving the first world war with wounds and the Military Cross. In the second war, he volunteered for the RAF and found himself everywhere from Shetland to Sumatra. As Keeper of the British Museum's Greek and Roman department, his greatest feat during the war was to pack up all its classical treasures  - including the Parthenon sculptures - and hide them in an unused tunnel of London's Piccadilly underground line. Years later, he was showing them to John Paul Getty. And how much would they cost? asked the US billionaire. 'Even more than you, Mr Getty, can pay,' came the answer. Water fascinated him. Returning to Oxford as its professor of classical archaeology, he lived first in the Old Mill at Iffley, where he built a water system in the garden with a fountain basin cast by pouring concrete into an upturned umbrella. At High and Over, he put up a water tower to feed the swimming pool which he and the gardener dug out from an old chalk pit. As it did not have planning permission, it was called a pond. The three storey-high house was built as a Y, to fit the contours of the bare hill and 'take utmost advantage of the scanty English sunshine' while having a superb view of the Misbourne valley. It stood dominant on a podium, and the design was a triumphant combination of intelligence and technology. The electric lighting was behind panels of frosted glass set in the ceiling in brass frames - as you might expect on an ocean liner. Upstairs, washbasins were tucked into alcoves - again, like a boat - and the number of cupboards was quite unusual. The front door was chromium-plated steel, as was the stair railing. On the ground floor, one of the three prongs of the Y was the professor's study - art history needs space to spread. Another was the drawing room, and the third the dining room and kitchen. The prongs met in a hexagon, floored in black marble with a fountain, at the heart of the house and overlooked by a round gallery on the first floor landing. Most cunning was the second (top) floor, a flat roof containing the children's play space (with a sand box plus concrete shelters with hooks for hammock and swing) and penthouse nurseries. The Ashmoles lived in High and Over until after the war, and the garden grew. Today, the house is hidden by splendid trees (protected by preservation orders) and it is hard to imagine what a threat it was to Amersham 60 years ago. Beyond the pool, a wood adds to the privacy. But most of its 12 acres was lost to development around 25 years ago and the house was split into two - not vertically but with different wings and floors projecting into each other, like a layer cake. This meant many alterations, which obscure the Bauhaus cleanliness of the original design. Partition walls have been put up and panel lights and shelves covered over or removed. Even the fountain is under a fitted carpet. Today, one part - which includes the hexagonal fountain room and the library  -is for sale, with a guide price of Pounds 229,500, through Amersham agent Peter Robson (0494-724 999). It could be an enticing prospect for a fan of 1930s' architecture. Tear down the new partitions and put back the detailing  -the fountain and shelves and light panels. The result would be an austere and sophisticated urban cottage, true to the vision of Connell and Ashmole. And who knows: perhaps, one day, the two halves could become a whole once again. *Bernard Ashmole, An Autobiography, edited by Donna Kurtz, Oxbow, about Pounds 18.</p>

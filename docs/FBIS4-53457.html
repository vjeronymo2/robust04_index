			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F> program]    [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said that the idea of  universal security [fuhenteki anzenhosho], which is included in  the previous ruling coalition parties' policy agreement, is  generally similar to the collective security [shudanteki  anzenhosho] policy stated in the United Nations Charter. He  said this during a session of the Lower House Budget Committee.    Hidenao Nakagawa, member of the opposition Liberal  Democratic  Party [LDP], raised this issue during the session. He asked  Prime Minister Hata to state the similarities and differences  between the policy agreement's idea of universal security and  the collective security plans stipulated in the UN Charter,  which include provisions for military sanctions. The prime  minister replied that the two are generally similar. Nakagawa  was not convinced and asked the government to indicate its  position in detail.    The collective security policy stipulated in the UN Charter  includes provisions for economic and military sanctions.  However, the United Nations has never used troops to implement  military sanctions. So the Japanese Government has not yet  indicated its opinion as to whether the Japanese Constitution  allows Japan to take part in such UN sanctions. Therefore,  Prime Minister Hata's remarks today are expected to stir  controversy.    Nakagawa also referred to remarks made earlier by Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa. He asked the foreign minister if he  intends to review the government's interpretation of the  Constitution that the collective defense is banned by the  Constitution. The foreign minister replied that he has his own  opinion, but as a member of the cabinet, he will support the  Hata cabinet's policy to maintain the position of the previous  government. He said that he would take back his previous  remarks if they are taken to mean that the government should  review its interpretation of the Constitution because that is  not what he meant.    Since a budget draft had been sent to the Upper House, the  Upper House Budget Committee held an executive council meeting  this evening to discuss the schedule for deliberating a draft  supplementary budget. However, the council failed to reach a  conclusion. The council will meet again tomorrow.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up Thailand The Stock Exchange of Thailand has agreed to lower the entry fee for four new brokerage seats from Bt350m (Dollars 14m) to Bt305m, following vigorous complaints from the market watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Thailand's 37 sub-brokers, writes William Barnes. The revised fees are still much higher than the Bt200m suggested by the Commission, which has the power to insist that the charge be cut again. The Dollars 12m entry fee is one of the most expensive in the world: Tokyo, for example, charges Dollars 9.5m, while Hong Kong and New York extract only a 10th of what Thailand's 40 full members expect to squeeze from newcomers. 'This is only a cosmetic reduction - the fee is still far too much. It makes the members of the exchange look very cynical,' said Mr Korn Chatikavanij, managing director of Jardine Fleming Thanakom Securities, one of the sub-brokers hoping for a seat. Stock exchange officials say the fees are needed to develop the market and are based on the expected growth in the volume of trading over the next five years; critics argue the members are trying to protect their higher commissions. The SET has also signally failed to address the request of Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister, that it comes up with a sensible and explicit policy on admitting new members. The exchange says it will admit only four new members in two months time and merely review the situation every two years. Three sub-brokers are strongly tipped for full memberships: JF Thanakom Securities, Ekachart Finance &amp; Securities, and Nithipat Capital. Taiwan Mr Samuel Shieh, the central bank governor, denied a television report that the central bank had bowed to political pressure and agreed to raise the ceiling for foreign investment in the island's stock market from Dollars 7.5bn to Dollars 20bn. Taiwan raised the ceiling from Dollars 5bn in March. Foreign institutions have been allowed to invest directly in Taiwan since early 1991.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 7 (AFP) -- Dutch Foreign Minister  Peter Kooijmans began a round of discussions here on Monday  looking at China's record on human rights after a wave of  dissident arrests, Dutch sources said. Kooijmans, a professor  of international law, is a former UN investigator on human  rights in China. His first official contacts were with public  prosecutor Zhang Siqing and Zhu Muzhi, chairman of the China  Human Rights Society, the Dutch embassy said. Kooijmans is due  to lunch with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Tuesday, and will  meet Justice Minister Xiao Yang and External Trade Minister Wu  Yi.    His visit came after several dissidents were arrested by  police as part of a massive operation apparently aimed at  intimidating opposition groups. According to informed Dutch  sources, Kooijmans has expressed a wish to visit Wei Jingsheng  -- China's most famous dissident -- during his stay. Wei was  interrogated by police for about 30 hours last week and decided  Sunday to leave Beijing to "rest for a few days", his press  secretary said. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  arrives in Beijing on Friday for talks with Chinese leaders.    Kooijmans' visit will also discuss the planned opening of  air  links between Beijing and Amsterdam. Since 1983 the Dutch  airline KLM has been the only European carrier to fly to Taipei  daily under its own colours. As a result, China, which regards  Taiwan as a renegade province, has refused to grant KLM landing  rights. Other European airlines, like Air France, British  Airways and Lufthansa, opened routes to Taipei last year, but  use subsidiary airlines for these operations.</p>

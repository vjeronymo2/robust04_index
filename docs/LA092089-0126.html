			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO ENFORCEMENT FOR 'ENGLISH' ORDINANCE  </P> <P> A Temple City ordinance requiring that at least 50% of all business signs be in  English was allowed to remain on the books Tuesday to the surprise of two civil  rights groups that had complained that the law was discriminatory.  </P> <P> But the City Council agreed to suspend enforcement of the ordinance -- a  position it has taken since Aug. 1 when a federal judge struck down a similar  ordinance in Pomona.  </P> <P> In a Sept. 6 letter to city officials, the Asian Pacific American Legal Center  and the American Civil Liberties Union asked the council to repeal the  ordinance, said Kathryn Imahara, an attorney for the Asian legal center.  </P> <P> Had Temple City rescinded its ordinance, it would have been the first time a  city in the San Gabriel Valley, which has a growing Asian population,  voluntarily revoked such a law, said ACLU attorney Robin Toma.  </P> <P> Temporary signs that do not use the Roman alphabet will be allowed in Temple  City until an acceptable alternative can be reached with the civil rights  groups.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: BUDGET SERVICES OFFERED IN SCOTLAND AND FRANCE  </P> <P> Special services to help young travelers' budgets will be available in Paris  and Scotland this summer.  </P> <P> Paris' youth information offices, Acceuil Des Jeunes en France (AJF), makes  free on-the-spot reservations for accommodations, books inexpensive  transportation services and finds student restaurants.  </P> <P> During the summer months AJF offers about 11,000 beds at budget rates. About  5,000 are in multishare rooms in youth hotels, and cost between 72 and 90  francs ($12 to $15) per person, breakfast included.  </P> <P> One of the most convenient AJF offices is at Gare Du Nord (North railway  station) inside the new suburban station. During summer months it's open every  day from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.  </P> <P> The Beaubourg office is opposite the Georges Pompidou Centre at 119 Rue St.  Martin. It's open Monday to Saturday, 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Rambuteau is the  closest Metro stop. The Marais office is near the Town Hall at 16 Rue de Pont  Louis-Phillippe. The closest Metro station is Hotel de Ville, open between June  and September, Monday to Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.  </P> <P> If you're near the Latin Quarter, another office is at 139 Blvd. St. Michel,  near the Luxembourg Metro stop. It's open March to October, Monday to Friday,  9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Breakfast Included  </P> <P> In many European countries breakfast is included in overnight stays, even if at  a youth hostel or student hotel. Breakfast usually is bread, jam, possibly some  cheese, and coffee or hot chocolate.  </P> <P> In Scotland, when you stay in a bed and breakfast the breakfasts are usually  substantial. You can expect toast, eggs, bacon, juice and coffee or tea. During  the low-travel seasons many B&amp;Bs are on good-value rates -- 7.50 to 10 ($12  to $16) per person a night.  </P> <P> During the summer, when rates rise and availability is low, other options are  available, such as accommodations and special do-it-yourself tour packages  offered by the Scottish Youth Hostel Assn.  </P> <P> This year SYHA's "Explore Scotland" package offers independent travelers budget  accommodations and transportation.  </P> <P> In the package is a seven-day Citylink bus pass, valid for travel on the  Scottish mainland, plus travel to the Isle of Skye, and vouchers for six nights  of youth hostel accommodations, plus a handbook, a map and a bus timetable, a  discount card for tourist services, and a pass for admission to historic  monuments. The package is available until Sept. 30 for 59.  </P> <P> The "Highland Wayfarer" package offers a 7- or 14-day pass for unlimited rail,  bus and ferry travel, plus seven or 14 vouchers for youth hostel  accommodations.  </P> <P> Round-trip transportation between Glasgow, Aberdeen or Edinburgh and the  travel-pass area also is included. During June, July and August seven-night  packages cost 89, 14-night versions are 134. Rates are slightly lower in spring  and fall.  </P> <P> For more information, contact Breakaway Holidays, Scottish Youth Hostels Assn.

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Brazil cuts import duties Brazil has cut import duties on a wide range of household products following criticism that the government's economic restructuring programme has led to big price rises. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, said lower tariffs would curtail price rises because imports could now compete with locally-made goods. Inflation is thought to have risen this month as companies raise prices following introduction of a new accounting unit, the unit of real value (URV), designed to form the basis of a new currency. Companies also feared a government price freeze as in previous restructuring attempts. The media has highlighted examples of prices doubling, adding to political pressure on Mr Cardoso to act and avert calls for stronger measures, such as the government setting key prices. Products targeted in the duty changes include toiletries, paint and medicines. They are almost all made by companies with near-monopoly or oligopoly control over the local market. Import duties on such goods are cut from 20 per cent to 2 per cent. Meanwhile, Brazil is increasingly optimistic it has persuaded the IMF to grant a standby accord as part of the country's Dollars 52bn (Pounds 35bn) private bank debt rescheduling plan. IMF approval is a prerequisite for the US treasury to issue zero coupon bonds as guarantees for part of the rescheduling. Mr Cardoso is likely to visit Washington for talks with Mr Michael Camdessus, chairman of the IMF, in time for the Fund to issue a letter of intent next week. Brazil's congress has approved, in the first of two scheduled votes, the reduction of the president's term of office from five to four years. The new rule will apply to the country's next president, due to take office next year following elections in October.</p>

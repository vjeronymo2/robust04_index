			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / OECD dusts off image of housework HOUSEWORKERS' unrecorded labours are adding up to 44 per cent to world output, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Unpaid domestic tasks such as cooking, cleaning and changing nappies normally do not count as economically important, on the grounds that no money changes hands. OECD economists say this approach ignores the intrinsic value of domestic activities. They say governments should do more to add up the value of housework. One way of ascribing value to unpaid domestic duties is to calculate the earnings of a typical 'houseworker' if he or she had a job in the orthodox economy.

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Thyssen Stahl to split units in attempt to boost results Thyssen Stahl, Germany's biggest steelmaker, yesterday said it was splitting its long products and wire divisions into smaller companies. It said the aim was to improve their reaction to market forces and start making profits again. The decision follows similar moves by Krupp Hoesch, Germany's second biggest steel producer, which has hived off several divisions into independent subsidiaries, some of which will become joint ventures with Thyssen. Both steelmakers argue that the market behaves differently for many steel products and that separate management is required if these areas are to recover from recent heavy losses. The companies emerging from these changes will also not be subject to Montanmitbestimmung, a form of workers' co-determination in the German coal and steel industry which has made it more difficult for loss-making steel companies to make workers redundant. Thyssen and Krupp Hoesch have said they will begin to reap the benefits of restructuring in their steel divisions this year but both still expect losses. Three new companies dealing in long products will be created with sales of about DM1.5bn (Dollars 970m), around 15 per cent of Thyssen Stahl's 1993 turnover. EWK Edelstahl is the largest of the three with around 2,600 employees. The wire division, Thyssen Draht, with a turnover of around DM300m, will also be split into three companies.</p>

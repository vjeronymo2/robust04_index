			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: The right political correctness Sir, Stuart Bentley ('From sexual simile to sexual crime', September 7), should take pause for thought. For women, the whole problem of 'defining the limits of acceptable behaviour' is that society is dominated by men - who have, until quite recently, always been politically correct in their own eyes simply by virtue of being male. Mr Bentley should try putting himself in our place for a change - for instance at any lecture in any subject traditionally dominated by men - and he might then find that political correctness (from a female point of view) could consist of nothing more alarming than consideration for other people's feelings and point of view before opening his mouth - not always something that is a male strong point] Veronica Stebbing, 22 rue Poliveau, 75005 Paris, France</p>

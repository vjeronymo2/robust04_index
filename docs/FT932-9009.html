			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: For buyers only - Cadogan's Place ACQUIRING Dodington Park in south-west Gloucestershire has been a coup for buying agent Wilson &amp; Wilson (071-727-1977). Working like a management headhunter, it negotiated the sale without any estate agents being involved (saving the vendor a nice sum, too). The grand Palladian property comes with a dower house, two lodges, six cottages and 300 acres of park designed by Capability Brown. The buyer is a private client who will set up a stud to breed horses and working German shepherd dogs. Buying and re-location agents work solely for purchasers. They find, and negotiate for, properties which (like Dodington) are sometimes not intended to be for sale or are not on the public market. They also may offer to manage let buildings on behalf of investment buyers. The aim is to take all the bother out of buying and shield purchasers from being at an amateur's disadvantage in dealing with a vendor's professional estate agent. Savings from negotiating down the price more than cover the buying agent's fee. Other buying agents include Property Vision (071-602-8788) which has a link with Sotheby's; Stacks (0666-860-523), a partnership of 12 covering England and Wales from Cheshire to the Wash; TLC Homesearch (0626-63000), a newly-opened firm in Devon; West Country House Search (0935-812-698) in Sherborne, Dorset; and the buying department of Lane Fox in Banbury, Oxfordshire (0295-273-592). County Homesearch (0872-223-349), with offices covering southern England, Edinburgh, Hong Kong and Provence, has an unusual fee structure: Pounds 300 (including VAT) initially, followed by either 1 per cent of the purchase price or 15 per cent of the negotiated saving between the asking price and the purchase price (whichever is greater). Bedrock International (071-351-2625) has a long computer listing of available houses, plus pictures, to give clients a fuller initial idea of what is available. When it has searched through this and made a short-list, it inspects the properties and goes from there in the usual way. With all estate agents reporting that good houses are scarce on the market, and with some still over-priced, the way is open for buying services to show their worth. Avonmore House, built in 1720 and only 25 miles from Dublin, is set in 150 acres along the river Avonmore in the hunting, shooting and fishing country of Co. Wicklow. Hamilton Osborne King in Dublin (01-760-251) is selling what looks a most comfortable property for horsemen. It has a multitude of bedrooms and baths and a stable yard with 16 loose boxes, all with a guide price of IRPounds 1.75m. For the grand life in France, Philip Hawkes in Paris (1-42 68 11 11) is offering the Chateau de Mareil le Guyon, fully furnished, restored beautifully and just 21 miles west of Paris, for FFr47.5m. Simpler and cheaper, at FFr4.2m, is La Magnanerie de Mousteirol, a pretty farmhouse at Entrecasteaux in Provence, with a swimming pool and passion flowers in the garden. From Hugo Skillington in France (94 43 69 79) or Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in London (071-629-8171). For remoteness, a farmhouse called Brimblecombe in Exmoor national park near West Anstey, Devon, is hard to beat; you need a four-wheel drive vehicle to reach it. This romantic retreat, where you can see badgers on the lawn, has five acres, three bedrooms, a stable, hay barn and two more barns. Price: around Pounds 190,000 from Stags in Dulverton (0398-231-74). Fans of 18th century Gothic architecture will like the grade II-listed Clearwell castle in Gloucestershire's Forest of Dean. Now run as a country house hotel and new on the market, it is rich in battlements and bedrooms (14, all with baths en-suite). Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Hereford (0432-273-087) offers it for around Pounds 750,000.</p>

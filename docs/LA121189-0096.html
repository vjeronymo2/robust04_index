			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW JAPANESE STOCK SCANDAL PROBE STARTS  </P> <P> Major brokerage Daiwa Securities is under investigation by Japan's Finance  Ministry for allegedly violating securities law in what appears to be another  Japanese stock scandal.  </P> <P> When stock recommendations went sour, Daiwa allegedly offered its favored  corporate clients special stock deals that guaranteed illegal profits to make  up for losses.  </P> <P> The Finance Ministry has opened an investigation of Daiwa's alleged loss-free  transactions, which violate Japan's Securities and Exchange Law.  </P> <P> Daiwa officials said today that the company did cover losses of 20 to 30  customers totaling about 10 billion yen ($69.4 million), but these were not  guaranteed loss-free deals.  </P> <P> The officials said Daiwa had not promised any compensation for loss to the  customers but decided to cover some to maintain good relations.  </P> <P> The Daiwa scandal is the latest load of the stock market's dirty laundry the  media have hung out for the public to see.  </P> <P> Last month, police arrested a Nomura Securities employee and a Kawasaki city  employee. The Nomura employee is suspected of selling pre-listed stock to the  Kawasaki official in return for managing a larger share of the city's pension  fund.  </P> <P> But at the top of the list was the Recruit affair, the worst postwar political  scandal. A number of politicians reaped large profits by buying stock in a real  estate unit of Recruit Co. before the shares were listed and then selling the  stock after it started trading on the over-the-counter market.  </P> <P> General elections are expected in February and -- if not hushed up -- the Daiwa  affair may be taken as yet another symbol of Japan's elite doing favors for one  another, with the ruling party looking on benignly, if not actually part of the  process.  </P> <P> "The last thing the Finance Ministry wants in pre-election times, when people  are still goosey about Recruit and minor scandals, is to create more of a stink  than they have to," a veteran analyst said.  </P> <P> Brokers say loss-free trades abound because they are difficult to prove and  because stock regulations in Japan are often loosely enforced.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Part One of two-part report by Colonel Aleksandr Oliynik: </F> "Moscow Military District Receives Troops"]    [Text] Moscow-Voronezh -- There is perhaps no task more  important for the Moscow Military District at present than  receiving troops from the former Soviet republics and elsewhere  and providing them with every facility at their new stationing  places in the center of European Russia. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has  more than once discussed this nationwide problem, which is  relevant to the entire Russian Army. Today we return to this  theme.  <H5>  Trapped by Lack of Funds </H5>   One wall of a room in the district headquarters building is  completely covered by a map of central Russia, where the Moscow  Military District is stationed. Blue flags mark where troops  used to be stationed and red flags indicate units and formations  which have already been withdrawn or will be withdrawn from  abroad by 1995. There are almost twice as many red flags as  blue ones. In short, the introduction of troops has radically  changed the face of the Moscow Military District, which has now  become a border district. The district is changing, its  organizational staff structure is continuing to be improved, and  it is being supplied with the latest weapons and equipment.    Virtually every staff directorate, service, and department  is  engaged in tackling this massive task, which -- owing to a lack  of finances and capering around the already meager military  budget -- is now on the verge of failure. This is the opinion  of Major General Aleksandr Groshev, Moscow Military District  deputy troop commander responsible for construction and the  billeting of troops.    "For four years now troops have been arriving in the  district  from abroad in accordance with a Russian Federation government  decision and a schedule approved by the Defense Ministry,"  Aleksandr Ivanovich said. "During this period we have received  more than 200 formations, units, and institutions totalling more  than 70,000 men. The biggest transfer of troops and equipment  has been to Smolensk, Voronezh, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Tambov  Oblasts and a number of other oblasts. Appropriate agreements  for providing the troops with all the necessary facilities,  building housing, and allocating land as training grounds have  been drawn up with and signed by the heads of their  administrations. They have also been signed by Colonel General  Leontiy Kuznetsov, commander of the Moscow Military District,  and the Russian Federation Defense Ministry is acting as  guarantor. But the majority of these agreements are on the  point of collapse, because no money is now being made available  from the national budget for the construction organizations with  which we have concluded agreements.    "Judge for yourself. This year (units and institutions being  withdrawn are still arriving in large numbers) we planned to  receive 300 billion rubles [R] for this purpose, but in fact  only R60 billion have been allocated. There can be no talk of  speeding ahead, as planned, with commissioning housing and  utilities for the units arriving; the schedule for building  barracks and vehicle depots in Smolensk Oblast and in Boguchar  in Voronezh Oblast has broken down. Essentially, troops are  being greeted by open fields...."    It is true what the people say: Better to see something once  than hear about it 100 times. The things I have seen in  Voronezh and Boguchar really are staggering, because of the  difficult conditions in which officers, ensigns, and their  families are having to start working and living at their new  stations. As a rule, they have been waved off from Germany and  the Baltic countries to the ceremonial beat of kettledrums, but  at home they have met with neglect. At the will of the state,  thousands of military servicemen and their families have  essentially been thrown on their own resources in order to  survive. But one thing at a time.    Even in the square outside Voronezh Station you are struck  by  the large numbers of people in military uniform. Caps with blue  or green bands are glimpsed time and again in the crowd. But  most of the servicemen wear emblems common to all arms.    "Voronezh has possibly not seen such an influx of troops  since the war, when the district headquarters was here," Major  General Vladimir Chuzhikov, head of the Voronezh Garrison, told  me. "People living in the oblast and heads of administration  show them constant attention and help in any way they can.  Nevertheless, more than half of our units have been withdrawn  to empty, unprepared places. Well, you can see for yourself  where we are having to work...."    I am talking to Major General Chuzhikov at headquarters,  where just two offices have been more or less repaired: the  commander's and the duty officer's. This red brick building --  once a convent -- was built at the beginning of the century.  All kinds of institutions were here during the years of Soviet  power! It has not been repaired at all for about 40 years: The  heating and water supply systems are in a dangerous state, the  roof is wrecked, and in some rooms the ceiling has fallen  through.... According to planning estimates, it will cost more  than R6 billion to renovate the building. The capacity of  military construction organizations in the city would allow all  repair work to be carried out in full this year. But there is  no money, alas. Ludicrous though it may sound, the limited  resources only cover 0.5 percent of the work.    The general shows me piles of documents. Material on  receiving corps units (they are scattered over six oblasts),  planning estimates for building barracks, depots for equipment,  and storehouses for food, and agreements concluded with city and  oblast heads of administration....    "All the necessary documents have long been drawn up, but  they are not being implemented," Vladimir Petrovich sadly summed  up. "They are not being implemented because money is not being  made available by the state. The district has given us  everything it possibly can and the oblast has helped out with  resources, but this does not solve the problem."    The conversation in the office of Vasiliy Kovalev, deputy  head of Voronezh Oblast Administration, was also about the main  issue: money to provide facilities for the troops and build  housing for the servicemen. Even now, more than 3,600  apartments are required for officers and warrant officers  discharged from the Army without housing as a result of  personnel cuts. That figure rises to more than 5,000 if you  include all the military servicemen arriving here in need of  housing.    I should point out that, in addition to the considerable  cost  of providing troops with the facilities they need, Voronezh  Oblast is also gaining indisputable benefits. It is planned to  commission several residential buildings erected by military  construction organizations in Voronezh by the end of this year.  It is also planned to build an entire residential district  overlooking the reservoir and, at the same time, lay roads and  heat and water supply networks and build social and cultural  facilities.    In Boguchar, where tank crews are stationed, a Turkish firm  is building a military camp with 1,753 apartments, a school  complete with swimming pool and conservatory, two kindergartens,  a clinic, stores, and so forth.    It must be said that the city and oblast administration and  some commercial structures take an understanding attitude to the  military's needs and help in any way they can. For example,  following a decision by the head of the oblast administration,  the "Shilovo" and "Rechnoye" Boarding Houses are serving as  temporary abodes for officers' families, R6 million have been  allocated from the city budget to repair the corps headquarters,  and land has been set aside without delay for the purpose of  stationing units and establishing training grounds. Viktor  Atlasov, head of the Southeast Railroad Administration, has met  the military halfway in the lease of containers for storing the  personal effects of officers and warrant officers and has  organized an efficient train service to take equipment to where  troops are stationed. But all this has to be paid for nowadays.  How far into debt can you go? For example, the military  department owes more than R65 million for the use of just one  gantry crane at Kantemirovka Station, where tanks and  self-propelled weapons arriving from Germany are being unloaded.    "We cannot solve all these problems without a clear  government program for providing troops with the facilities they  need," Vasiliy Fedorovich Kovalev believes. "The potential of  the city and the oblast is now limited: Market relations are  everywhere. State subsidies are also meager. For example, in  the past the military did not have to pay for land to be used  for military units and training grounds, but now they have to  hand over the money. Considerable amounts of money. For  example, the Defense Ministry must pay R102 billion at 1992  prices for a tank crew training ground near Boguchar. But,  instead of money, the ministry has sent us a letter saying that  payment for the land will be delayed even further...."    It seems that only now are we all, including state  structures, becoming increasingly acutely aware that making cuts  in the Armed Forces and redeploying them on a massive scale is  almost more expensive than it was to maintain the Soviet Army.  According to the most approximate estimates, withdrawing just  one division from Germany and providing it with every facility  in open fields near Boguchar will cost the state R500 billion.  We have already mentioned above how many such units have been  received by the Moscow Military District alone. But who has  counted these costs?    Apart from the purely financial side, there are other ways  of  measuring the loss to the Army and the country as a whole.  While preparations for withdrawing troops are underway (this  period lasts a year or more), officers and warrant officers --  the backbone of the Army -- lose their experience and  professional expertise. How many officers, particularly young  ones, have waved goodbye to the Army forever during this period!    This trend is very characteristic of units being withdrawn  from abroad to new places of service in Russia. Particularly  where, for various reasons, they are not ready to receive the  troops and where because of a chronic lack of funds plans are  being frustrated to build military camps and homes for officers'  families in the "back of beyond" of Voronezh Oblast -- Boguchar  -- to which the withdrawal of the 10th Ural-Lvov Volunteer Tank  Division from Germany is nearing completion. Essentially, the  formation is being stationed in open fields. So why has this  happened? That is what we will discuss in part two.</p>

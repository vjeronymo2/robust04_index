			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by PRESSOVA AGENTSIYA NOVIN correspondent G. </F> Cherniy, special for AKTSENT: "Laxatives for Ukraine"]    [Text] The Ukraine Law "On Making Changes and Addition To  the Ukraine Law `On Liens,'" signed by President of Ukraine L.  Kravchuk on 25 February, went into effect last week. Now the  Ukrainian lien law allows a foreign investor, in the event of  debtor's delinquency or insolvency, to be compensated by real  estate.    At the same time, the latest wording of this law dispelled  the last doubt regarding the supreme executive authorities'  plans for state property and the course of privatization in  Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Lugansk, and Donetsk Oblasts, whose  administrations now have the right to decide on the fate of  mortgage deals. Let us recall: "A state enterprise (as a rule,  already beached--author's note), to which property is attached  with right of full economic maintenance, may on its own mortgage  this property, with the exception of an integrated property  complex, its structural units, buildings, and structures, which  may be mortgaged with permission and on terms approved by the  body authorized to administer corresponding state property."    It this good or bad? It is so good that it frightens me. It  is good because despite completely unfounded resistance on the  part of the parliament, President L. Kravchuk did find a way to  attract large investors to Ukraine. After all, in the sphere of  investment activities Ukraine is hopelessly behind not only  Russia, but also Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other newly  independent states. It may happen that a few years from now  Ukraine will be studying the phenomenon of growth of, for  instance, Kazakhstan, in whose economy about $17 billion in  investment will be attracted this year alone.    Meanwhile, in the opinion of Aleksandr Savchenko, executive  director of a department in the European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development, large Western investors are kept away from  Ukraine by inconsistencies in its foreign policy, domestic  political crisis, and the lack of political will in conducting  economic reforms.    That is why at this point Ukraine is getting either  insignificant investment in quick-return projects (airports,  terminals, oil pipelines, hotels, etc.), or large investment in  which the creditor dictates everything and bureaucrats take  their share in commissions. One does not have to look far to  find examples. The Ministry of Health has been buying laxatives  of the "purgen" type in quantities sufficient to provide relief  for the whole of Europe for a year. While the Ministry of  Agriculture and Food during L. Kravchuk's visit to Washington  bought with seven-year interest-free credit 70,000 tonnes of soy  at a price exceeding the average by $40-50 per tonne. One should  not look a gift horse in the mouth. Especially considering that  if anyone does become constipated, it is bureaucrats on foreign  junkets--not ordinary folk who are undernourished most of the  time these days.    In short, the birth of the lien law in Ukraine is, on one  hand, a joyous event. One the other, it is scary because,  judging by the effectiveness of state regulation, we cannot  expect fast changes in industry, which means we will have to  play a handicapped hand against foreign capital. But this is not  all bad, either: One can avoid compliance even with the  president of Ukraine's edict, but there is no way to dodge the  commonly accepted rules of the market game, which the leadership  of our state fears so much.</p>

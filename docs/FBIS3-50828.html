			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Carlos Tapia, an "expert" on subversive </F> affairs, by Victor Andres Ponce; place and date not given]    [Text] [Ponce] How do you view the subversive phenomenon at  the end of 1993?    [Tapia] It is no secret that the MRTA [Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement] has been defeated and those who are left  of its militants are engaged in abduction and looting. The  truth is that they were defeated late in 1991, when columns  headed by Serpa Cartolini and Sistero Garcia clashed in San  Martin. This confrontation reflected the rapid decay of this  subversive movement.    [Ponce] Are there no more MRTA columns or grassroots groups  in the interior?    [Tapia] The MRTA has been completely annihilated. Most of  the recently repented terrorists belong to this group.    [Ponce] What about the Shining Path [SL]?    [Tapia] The SL has an active column in Huancabamba which is  linked to the Jaen Province in Cajamarca; the column in Mariscal  Luzuriaga Province, Ancash, operates in Huanuco; and there is  another active column in Chalhuanca, Apurimac.    [Ponce] How about Huallaga?    [Tapia] In that zone there must be approximately 500 men of  what they call their main force and their local force. These  individuals are fulling engaged in drug trafficking. The  Huallaga SL regional committee broke away from the SL leadership  in February 1990, when [Abimael] Guzman was still free. Imagine  now that their leader is behind bars. It is more than likely  that the remaining SL members throughout the country receive no  economic aid from this zone.    [Ponce] How about Lima?    [Tapia] The SL has four very important armed detachments  deployed in various parts of the city. One of them recently  held up a bank branch in El Agustino.    [Ponce] Now that Guzman is in prison and they do not have  the  economic support from the Alto Huallaga drug trafficking, has  the SL managed to organize another political-military unit?    [Tapia] The most difficult time for the SL seems to have  been  between September and December 1992, after Guzman was arrested.  The SL Central Committee held its first meeting in February  1993 and managed to get reorganized in May.    [Ponce] Was this under the leadership of Oscar Ramirez  Durand  (Feliciano)?    [Tapia] Yes, it is unlikely that their hierarchy has varied,  more so because Feliciano has been the third or fourth most  important member since 1980. Oscar Ramirez Durand participated  in the Chuschi School, in the 1988 Congress, and was elected to  the Central Committee.    [Ponce] Are there any signs of a reaction by the SL to  Guzman's request for a peace agreement?    [Tapia] Fujimori read the letter before the United Nations  on  1 October, an important day for the SL because it is the  anniversary of the Chinese revolution. On 7 October, the SL  Central Committee issued a communique reporting a government  trick. Following these developments important changes took  place at the SL grassroots level, although they were not  consistent -- one must bear in mind the hold up in El Agustino.  The best evidence of these changes is the pronouncement of the  Canto Grande inmates in favor of the agreement. These sectors  accept a single leader and talk about a change of times for the  SL. The SL representatives abroad also reveal a change of  stance...    [Ponce] But Arce Borja and Olaechea have emphatically  reported this trick...    [Tapia] Their pronouncement is unimportant. It should be  recalled that neither of them belonged to the SL Central  Committee. The most authorized voices abroad are the relatives  of Augusta La Torre, Guzman's late wife. These relatives, who  are in Stockholm or Switzerland, have stated that one SL period  has ended and a new period has started. But it should be noted  that there is a sector that has still not clearly stated its  position.    [Ponce] Why do you maintain that negotiations between the  government and Guzman continue?    [Tapia] The negotiations started last February and are about  to end. What other explanation is there for transferring Martha  Huatay from Yanamayo or for summoning Osman Morote.  Negotiations cannot be based on Guzman's imprisonment terms  because this is handled by the International Red Cross...    [Ponce] What other things do you think are being negotiated.  What is Guzman's plan?    [Tapia] What do they mean when they say that a new phase is  beginning in the party? I always remember him saying: "We were  never defeated by the police, why should we be defeated in war."  And, precisely, before starting its war, the SL was a political  organization that controlled all sorts of social sectors in  Ayacucho, including universities, neighborhood associations,  peasants federations, and the Chamber of Commerce. An  alternative with this background, that engaged in war, may  emerge to...    [Ponce] To become an electoral alternative?    [Tapia] I do not think that is feasible because the SL  continues to be a totalitarian alternative. If SL militants  give up war, they will not do so out of political conviction,  but rather because of their submission to the leadership of  "their president." If they were to decide to become an electoral  alternative, that would mean Guzman would cease to be their  leader. Yet it is quite likely he will continue to lead his  party from prison. Nobody can imagine Abimael speaking over  television and trying to convince electors. He has always done  politics as he is doing now in his cell: Imprisoned, watching  television, with a communication channel carrying his message to  the militants.    [Ponce] Are you telling me the SL will become a striking  force [fuerza de choque] within labor unions and social groups...    [Tapia] That is so.    [Ponce] But what evidence is there that the SL's new phase  is  heading in that direction?    [Tapia] The SL's new language in the neighborhoods is  against  actions to obtain electoral gains, against traditional political  parties, in favor of the peoples' claims, and is antirevisionist  (against the legal leftist sector in the neighborhoods)...    [Ponce] Does this new language follows Guzman's orders from  prison?    [Tapia] Obviously. We will, therefore, face a striking force  within the peoples' movements. Another thing to remember is  that a force of this kind may establish alliances with the most  obscure sectors of the country.</p>

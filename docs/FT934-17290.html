That compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.13m, incurred after a Pounds 1.54m write-off in respect of film costs. Because of the absence of any sales of completed animation productions to the ITV network, turnover for the first half was down from Pounds 4.05m to Pounds 1.78m. The pre-tax figure was after interest charged of Pounds 73,000 (Pounds 6,000 received). Earnings per share were 0.14p (1.49p losses).</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Permanent Interest Bearing Shares PRICES OF Permanent Interest Bearing Shares have risen (and thus yields have dropped) since we last printed the table on August 14. But Pibs fell back this week as news of higher than expected inflation weakened the prices of all fixed income instruments. PIBS are fixed interest paying shares issued by building societies. Income is usually paid twice a year. They offer higher yields than gilts because of their higher risk: building societies are less secure than the government and if a society collapsed, PIBS holders would be last in line to be paid back. As their name suggests, PIBS will never be repaid and there is no guarantee that investors will get back what they paid for them. Broadly speaking, the higher the PIBS yield, the more risky the society is perceived to be by the market. Simon Mozley of Hoare Govett, which supplied the table, says that the recent issue from the Halifax 'met strong demand despite the current low yield levels. This was a function of the near-par price at which it was issued compared with the premium prices that exist for other issues.' The Halifax issue is denominated in Pounds 50,000 chunks, which makes it unsuitable for small investors.</p>

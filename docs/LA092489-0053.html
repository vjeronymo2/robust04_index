			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECRETS SHARED: HANDYMEN IN HIGH DEMAND  </P> <P> When we published our story on handymen ("Fix It Yourself? Most Still Call  Handyman" July 16), we asked you to share with readers any advice you might  have on finding a good handyman, or even the name of your favorite workman.  Here is a sampling of the recommendations.  </P> <P>  -- The Editors  </P> <P> "His name is Alex and I've used him for 10 years. He can fix anything from A to  Z and he's very conscientious. . . .  </P> <P> "He has installed new faucets and plumbing, put in air conditioners, replaced  electrical outlets, installed new light fixtures and painted inside and outside  my home. Now he is putting in sprinkler systems in my front and back yards.  There is not one job he can't do."  </P> <P> In dozens of letters like this one from Livia Kalman in the Fairfax area of Los  Angeles, readers attested to the rare qualities of their handymen, whom they  seem to have found with a combination of good luck, good neighbors and  recommendations from the local hardware store.  </P> <P> And in most cases, they were willing to provide names and numbers, a very  generous action on their part, because many people guard their handyman like  the gold at Ft. Knox.  </P> <P> Kalman's handyman, Alex Messinger, (213) 655-7341, who lives in the Fairfax  area, has a master's degree in electrical engineering from Slovak Technical  University of Bratislava in Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> He fell into handyman work soon after arriving in the United States when his  landlord needed several repairs in his apartment building. "That's how it  started, by word of mouth," Messinger said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Bit of Everything  </P> <P> Apartment manager Joyce Chapin needed a little bit of everything done for the  West Los Angeles building she manages -- plumbing, electrical, carpentry and  roofing -- so she inquired at Raes Hardware store on Santa Monica Boulevard,  which has since closed. There, she found an employee, John Martin, who  moonlighted as a handyman.  </P> <P> In time, his brother, Bob Martin, came with him to help with the burgeoning  list of chores, and Bob Martin, (213) 836-4890, still works for Chapin. "He is  friendly, reliable and does almost everything," Chapin wrote.  </P> <P> A second West L.A. reader, Shirley Saxton, also recommended Martin. "I can't  say enough about his kindness, efficiency and ingenuity," she wrote. "I call  him, 'my technician.' "  </P> <P> Lucille Dearborn of Venice was lucky enough to rent a cottage several years ago  to David Felix, who turned out to be, in her words, "a Jack-of-all-trades."  Felix built a fence for his landlady, landscaped, did some minor plumbing and  painting.  </P> <P> "He's quite artistic and will even recommend colors," she said.  </P> <P> Before her chance meeting with David Felix, (213) 287-3739, Dearborn had  pursued several recommendations from her local hardware store.  </P> <P> But, like many homeowners looking for a helping hand, she found that "one man  was very talented, but also very booked up. I would describe my search for help  as a hit-and-miss situation, so I call myself very lucky."  </P> <P> Echoing Dearborn's comments on Felix was Michelle Friedman of Santa Monica: "He  is an excellent, careful and exact handyman."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Few Hiring Tips  </P> <P> Joni Halpern of San Diego wrote to say that she wished she had read the  handyman article years ago. Over time she has picked up a few tips of her own:  </P> <P> "I engage potential hires in conversation about the job to be done," she wrote.  "I want to know exactly, in detail. . . . Do they explain what they will do and  why? Do they take time to look closely at the job area?  </P> <P> "If they recommend expensive major repairs, do they suggest a second opinion?  If they use implied threats about what will happen if I don't do extensive  repairs, I cross them off my list. . . . Finally, do they stick to business?"  </P> <P> Halpern recommended Wayne Glover, (619) 296-9966, because he "is careful,  experienced and quiet," she wrote. "Before starting a job, he explains the  details of the job and the fact that he prefers using top-grade materials. He  completes the job within the estimated time and he cleans up his mess each day,  so that family life can proceed as normally as possible.  </P> <P> "He examines every job carefully to determine whether there is some hidden  cause of whatever problem the homeowner reports. For example, there were cracks  in the ceiling of my living room, and other handymen said it was simply a  matter of filling them and painting.  </P> <P> "Mr. Glover went under the house, examined the structure and found that a  portion of the house was sinking due to poor drainage. He fixed the problem  himself."  </P> <P> Glover worked for many years in industrial maintenance and found himself being  called upon to help friends, so he decided to try the handyman business full  time. "The challenge of making things right" keeps him going, Glover said.  </P> <P> We also heard from handyman Curt Kinkead of Posey, a small community near Lake  Isabella in Kern County, who asked that we do not print his phone number or  address, because, he said, "I already have as much work as I can handle." But  he wanted to offer some advice to the readers:  </P> <P> " . . . there is no substitute for being an educated consumer," Kinkead wrote.  "Before you even think of calling a handyman, buy or borrow from the library  one of those books on how to fix anything in your home and read the section  that deals with your particular problem.  </P> <P> "If you have questions or find complications not covered by the book, take some  Polaroid pictures of the situation and head for your friendly local hardware  store.  </P> <P> " . . . when you have a thorough understanding of the problem, then call the  handyman, have him analyze the problem and give you an estimate. If his  proposed solution differs markedly from what you learned was needed, or if he  insists on doing more than is needed, thank him for his time and call somebody  else."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A General Contractor  </P> <P> Sharon Huston of Chatsworth praised her "handyperson," J. B. Newman, (818)  703-7146, "a skilled general contractor who does superb work on every job she  tackles, large and small. . . . I have confidently recommended her work to many  family members and friends."  </P> <P> Andrew Steele, (818) 761-8468, came highly recommended by Lance Thompson, a  free-lance writer in Sun Valley. A former drummer with the British rock 'n'  roll band The Herd, Steele learned to do handyman things the hard way. He  accepted a job as a building manager several years ago and in preparation,  disassembled everything with working parts in the apartment that came with the  job -- refrigerator, heaters, air conditioning, dishwasher.  </P> <P> "I'm still alive to tell the tale," he said.  </P> <P> Innate ability was the reason Batiya Keigler of West Los Angeles recommended  Steve Katz, (213) 413-9750. "He a natural. Everything he touches he fixes," she  said. "I say that he has golden hands. . . . He's only $15 an hour, and he can  even fix cars. He's the greatest."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jewel of a Gentleman  </P> <P> Lynn Kern of Los Angeles wrote:  </P> <P> "I have found a jewel of a gentleman . . . who can do just about anything and  if he cannot, he has the resources to get it done. I have had him do carpentry,  masonry, electrical and plumbing." Her handyman is John Winfield of Studio  City, (818) 760-7831.  </P> <P> Susan Nathe of West Hollywood said her handyman, Michael McGonigle, (619)  434-2166, lives in San Diego, but works in Orange County and Los Angeles as  well.  </P> <P> "He did a fabulous remodel for me in my condo," Nathe wrote, "and has installed  skylights, hung doors, built fireplaces and is a trained Corian installer. . .  . Several friends recommended him highly to me and I have only glowing  remarks."  </P> <P> Another letter writer was The Times' bridge columnist, Alfred Sheinwold, who  recommended his handyman, Bob Buckley, (818) 708-3800, as "competent, reliable  and not too pricey." Added Sheinwold: "He's quiet, but articulate. (There's a  contradiction!)"  </P> <P> From Monrovia, Pat and Elizabeth Chaney praised their handyman, Steve Schrum,  (213) 259-8695, who, like many handymen, is also a general contractor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Patient and Thorough  </P> <P> "He is patient, conscientious and thorough in his work," they said. "He has  been of invaluable help restoring to its original beauty our 1914 home."  </P> <P> Janis Brock wrote from Thousands Oaks to recommend her handyman, Kevin Suitter,  (805) 499-2326. "He is multitalented and reliable," she said, and she sent  along his leaflet, which says: "Call me first, if I can't do it, I recommend  someone who can."  </P> <P> And, finally, we heard from a Long Beach reader, Michiko Sakimoto, who voiced  the concern of most of those who have been fortunate enough to find a competent  and fair handyman.  </P> <P> She lives in a neighborhood with a lot of elderly people. And while she felt  compelled to let us know about her handyman, she asked us not to tell too many  people because she and her neighbors rely on him and if he were to become too  busy, she worries that he wouldn't have enough time for his older clients.  </P> <P> So Handyman Bill, who helps out so many of those along Lewis Avenue, your  clients are grateful.  </P></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Management: Getting back on course NOT many people can claim to have been sacked twice by the same company. Peter Saunders, though, is one of them. The axe first fell in 1982 when Saunders was pub information bureau manager at Whitbread London, one of the brewing group's operating subsidiaries. Redundancy was mercifully short lived and his career seemed to be back on course with Berni Inns until 1990 when its then owner, Grand Metropolitan, sold the restaurant chain to Whitbread. Whitbread subsequently decided to run down the Berni brand, with the result that Saunders lost his job as marketing controller last year. Not surprisingly, he has since opted for a complete change of direction and now runs a marketing consultancy, specialising in the food service field. Saunders is hoping to capitalise on his commercial experience, but he has also used his periods of unemployment and two outplacement training courses to good effect. Conscious that only a lucky few like him are sponsored for career counselling by their ex-employers, he has written and published a self-tuition manual called Successful Job Hunting. Saunders' product has been vetted by a senior UK personnel expert (chosen by the FT). She describes it as 'easy to follow and well cross-referenced. There is a strong personal touch. I wouldn't agree with everything in it but the important thing is it's positive.' She suggests the manual is most suitable for those up to and including middle managers and could be valuable for anyone who has been out of the employment market for a long time. Saunders is offering the manual* to FT readers at a special mail order price of Pounds 24.50. *Available from 116 Eskdale Avenue, Chesham, Bucks HP5 3BD.  Tel 0494-775867.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There are numerous tar dumps in the new federal  laender, the result of lignite coking residue dumping. A  two-stage conditioning process developed by Wuppertal-based OeKa  can be used to obtain a solid fuel from this matter, which is  rich in phenol and aromatic hydrocarbons.    If a lime-based storage mineral (Novomix) in suspension form  is stirred into the tar, it both reduces the odor given off and  creates an initial liquid fuel that can easily be piped off. In  the second stage, Novomix-F is added continuously as a  compacting agent, within a short time turning the tar into a  solid substance matching raw lignite in appearance and calorific  value. This material can consequently be burned along with  lignite. The storage minerals' basic components bind the acid  components of the flue gas during combustion.    The process has been successfully tested in a pilot project  supported by the Land of Brandenburg. The storage mineral,  which OeKa Environmental Engineering developed together with  various universities, can be used to immobilize pollutants found  in gases, fluids, and solids.</p>

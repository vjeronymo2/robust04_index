			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Sport: Irish chase a Cup that cheers - Yachting INGENUITY has been the key to the 1993 Champagne Mumm Admiral's Cup. When the unofficial world championship of yacht racing begins off Cowes next Thursday, it will be a small, devious field that crosses the start line. Take the Irish team, for example. Ireland has been in and out of the AC over the years but never won the trophy. Thanks to Sydney-based businessman John Storey, the Emerald Isle, which has previously tended to export its sailing talent, is co-favourite to take the cup. Several years ago Storey encountered Harold Cudmore, the Cork-born professional who skippered Britain's bid for the America's Cup in 1986. Cudmore showed him that by chartering top boats at exactly the right moment, one could both block the opposition and 'ride good horses.' Stir in the visceral willingness of Irishmen who ply their trade in other countries to fight for the Auld Sod, and one has a winning combination. The first consequence was victory for Storey/Cudmore/Ireland in the 1992 Southern Cross series in Australia. Bitten by the bug, Storey moved on with the svengali Cudmore at his elbow. Their master-stroke for this campaign was to buy the world champion two-tonner Shockwave from Kiwi owner Neville Crichton. Under the procedures devised for the 1993 Admiral's Cup, the points scored by each team's two-tonner will probably be crucial. As the middle-sized component of each team, between the one-tonner and 50ft yachts, they should be competitive across the whole range of conditions. With only the best two results per team from each race scoring, this is important. As a class this is likely to be the swansong for the two-tonners. Numbers are declining and good ones have been stalked and hunted across the world by would-be Admiral's Cup captains. Britain could not be certain of having a team until some appallingly delicate negotiations with the Turkish owner of Prodzza (the former Unibank, of Denmark) were concluded. Cudmore's 'stroke' - as the Irish would put it - with Shockwave had a beautiful symmetry to it. As well as giving his team the most powerful platform possible, New Zealand's sailors were unable to find an adequate two-tonner and are not competing at Cowes. They have always provided formidable opposition in previous events. With only eight countries competing, the field is smaller than since the early 1970s. Cudmore, sailing for his own country for the first time since 1979, will skipper the one-tonner Jameson I (ex Fram XI, owned by King Harald of Norway). Jameson II (ex-Shockwave) is steered by Gordon Maguire and the 50-footer (Jameson III, aka Heaven Can Wait) is under the control of ex-Whitbread skipper Joe English. Once this formidable collection of personnel and hardware was assembled, 'King Harold of Cowes', as Cudmore is sometimes known, was able to go to Jameson, the leading Irish whiskey brand, and secure team sponsorship. Cudmore had to act like an independent film producer: juggling the studio, the stars and the bank until they are all safely to hand, pointing in the same direction. Britain has had to go through broadly the same process to assemble a team. It may be no coincidence that team captain Graham Walker has had Cudmore skipper a good number of his racing yachts over the past decade. Once Walker acquired the 50ft Indulgence (ex-Juno) earlier this year, it was a question of building the rest of a team around that platform. 'I'm sure that despite a low number of teams this is going to be the most competitive Admiral's Cup ever,' said Walker. With a dearth of top-level racing available around the world, there is absolutely no doubt that the best boats and top crews are gathered in Cowes. However, Walker is confident of Britain's chances of regaining the trophy they last won in 1989.</p>

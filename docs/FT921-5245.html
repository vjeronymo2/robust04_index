			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Observer: Chain reaction The super-unions are coming. Yesterday saw an overwhelming vote by members in favour of amalgamation between the AEU engineering union and the EETPU electricians union. Public service unions Nupe, Nalgo and Cohse are also deep in talks. All that remains is for FTAT, the furniture union, to join forces with MSF the technical union. Naturally, the new combined union would be refloated under the name MFI.</p>

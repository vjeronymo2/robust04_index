			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tebbit attacks EC farming 'conspiracy' LORD TEBBIT, the staunch Tory anti-Maastricht campaigner, last night attacked the European Community's agriculture policy as 'a Franco-German conspiracy'. The former cabinet minister was speaking in the Lords on the fourth day of committee stage debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, the measure which would ratify the Maastricht treaty. He protested that the Common Agricultural Policy subsidised Greek tobacco farmers while the Community was unable to save the jobs of British coal miners. He said: 'If we applied the CAP argument to the coal mining communities of north-east England, or Wales or Scotland, we would have a very different look to this country. 'They are communities who are finding it extremely difficult to find alternative work - and, I might add, the product of their labours was essentially useful and not essentially dangerous.' He complained: 'But these, after all, are mere English, Scots and Welsh miners, and they're not to be treated with the same kid-glove approach as the Greek tobacco farmers. 'Where is the equity? Where is the sense of being 'communautaire'? Where is the social cohesion in these matters?' Supporting calls to remove CAP provisions from the Bill, he condemned the policy 'a Franco-German conspiracy against the public interest of the citizens of the Community and particularly against those of the UK and, indeed, the citizens of the world'. Pressed by Lord Bonham-Carter (Lib Dem) on whether he had changed his general stance on Europe, Lord Tebbit said: 'You must not assume that we all through life resolutely resolve to refuse to learn from our experiences. 'I voted (to join the EC in 1973) on the basis that, if we were at the heart of Europe, we would be able to resolve these things.' Junior employment minister Viscount Ullswater told him that Britain, by being at the heart of Europe, had succeeded in getting CAP reform onto the Community's agenda and some progress was now being made. The committee stage debate was adjourned until Monday.</p>

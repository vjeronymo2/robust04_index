			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Fang Yuan (2455 0337): "Zhu Rongji Has </F> Decided To Lay Down His Heavy Burden in March, and There Will Be  Keen Competition for the Post of Central Bank President"]    [Excerpt] As disclosed by a source in Beijing, China's  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has decided to resign the post he took  up concurrently as president of the People's Bank of China at  the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress,  which will be held in March this year. His successor will  probably be Yin Jieyan, who currently holds the position of  director of the State Administration of Exchange Control. In  view of the ghastly signs of price rises and an overheated  economy which have emerged in the mainland's economic situation  recently, the national monetary conference, which ended a short  time ago, decided to slow down the pace of monetary reform and  to continue to practice macroeconomic regulation and control  policies.    It has been disclosed that the news about Zhu Rongji's  intended resignation as president of the central bank came from  Zhu himself when he attended a national monetary work meeting  last month. It was reported that, in his speech, Zhu Rongji  indicated that the responsibility that he shouldered in  macroeconomic management work was so heavy that he was unable to  simultaneously attend to the work of the central bank. Given  the intense rivalry between the two most promising vice  presidents -- Zhou Zhengqing and Dai Xianglong -- the post of  central bank president may finally fall on the "dark horse" --  Yin Jieyan, the current director of the State Administration of  Exchange Control. As disclosed, Yin has worked in the central  bank for a long time and, as early as 1985 when Chen Muhua was  president of the bank, he was secretary general of the bank's  board of directors. Since last year, particularly since the  unification of exchange rates this year, Yin has performed  outstanding work in stabilizing the renminbi's exchange rate.  He is worthy of being called an experienced banking official  with expertise in modern banking. Hence, he is most probably  the candidate who will be selected by the central authorities  for this post. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Swithland listing in jeopardy as result of uncertain placing THE ATTEMPT to place shares in Swithland Group, the Midlands motor retailer, ends this morning against a background of City predictions that not enough shares will be sold to allow its plans for a listing to go ahead. Swithland's placing was planned in two stages: first the sale of 12.34m new shares to raise Pounds 10m gross and 370,370 shares owned by Mr John Hayes, the founder and chief executive; and, second, the sale of 5.79m shares owned by NatWest Ventures, Swithland's venture capital backer, and the Hayes family. The price of the shares was 81p each. The placing, sponsored by Ionian Corporate Finance, was not underwritten and the issue prospectus stated that if Harris Allday Lea &amp; Brooks, the brokers, could not sell all the 12.7m shares of the first stage, the placing and plans for admission to the Stock Exchange would be abandoned. City concern about Swithland appears to have increased following reports of its brushes with the Office of Fair Trading on questions of consumer credit regulation. Swithland acknowledged in its prospectus two legal disputes with APS Realisations and Dixon Moutrie Silkstone, which are advertising agencies, the first being in administrative receivership. In both cases the agencies are claiming that Swithland has not paid its fees. In both cases Swithland is making counter-claims. The placing was designed to provide funds for expansion and to provide an exit, or partial exit, for NatWest Ventures. In what looks now as the unlikely event of a successful placing, the Hayes family stake in Swithland will be reduced to less than 30 per cent.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Aspin warns defence cuts will be difficult PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton's choice to be the next secretary of defence warned yesterday that the new administration might find it difficult to cut defence spending by even as much as projected by departing President George Bush, let alone achieve the bigger savings Mr Clinton wants. Mr Les Aspin, previously chairman of the House of Representatives armed services committee, reiterated the Clinton team's goal of cutting an extra Dollars 60bn (Pounds 39.4bn) over the next five years from the Bush defence budget, which itself includes big reductions. But Mr Aspin and Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, warned that the budget baseline figures used by the Bush administration, which show Dollars 280.5bn of defence and national security spending in fiscal 1994, might be unreliable. Mr Nunn said it would be impossible to pay for a 450-ship navy, as planned by the Bush administration, with the money currently allocated. The attack on the Bush defence budget projections echoed more general criticism voiced earlier this week by Mr Clinton of his predecessor's overall budget legacy. Mr Bush's pro forma budget for 1994 shows a record deficit of Dollars 327.4bn this year, dipping slightly before climbing again to Dollars 319.8bn in 1998. Mr Clinton accused the outgoing administration of camouflaging the gravity of the outlook for the deficit, which he said would, if left unchecked, 'soar above Dollars 400bn near the end of the decade'. Mr Aspin acknowledged that it would not be easy to achieve further defence savings, but said it would be possible to reshape forces at a lower level than envisioned in Mr Bush's 'Base Force' while maintaining their effectiveness. 'The Bush administration had presented a force and a budget that took cognisance of one revolutionary development in our international security picture - the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, but not another - the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself. It was a one-revolution budget in a two-revolution world,' Mr Aspin said in answers for his Senate confirmation hearings.</p>

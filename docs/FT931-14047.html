			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Debate about the dollar THE DOLLAR lost another pfennig in European trading yesterday as dealers continued to wonder whether the US currency's recent rally was sustainable, writes James Blitz. The dollar has lost more than four pfennigs since its close in London on Friday night, and yesterday bottomed out at around DM1.6060 before closing at DM1.6110 against the D-Mark. There are certainly technical factors behind this latest fall, which follows the sharp rise above DM1.55 at Christmas-time. A rise of that speed and scale was always certain to be followed by some profit-taking. However, there appears to be a growing feeling in the London market that this new fall reflects a fundamental re-assessment of where the currency is heading in the first quarter of this year. Mr Mark Brett, a currency economist at BZW in London, is among those analysts who believe that the sharp US economic recovery of recent months cannot be sustained. 'Rather than being a period of accelerating US recovery, 1993 will be another year of bursts of nothing happening,' he says. Mr Brett believes that the economic recovery seen in last week's impressive retail sales figures, which showed an 8 per cent rise from the previous December, is unsustainable. He points to the sharp drop in the savings ratio in the US, from 5 per cent of gross income in the summer to 4 per cent last month, as a sign that consumers are using savings rather than newly-generated money to buy goods. This view is far from universally held. Mr Mark Slater, Managing Director of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch International Bank in London, said yesterday that the dollar was a little overbought, but predicted a dollar rate of DM1.85 before the end of the first quarter. He believes that German short term rates should be down by about 250 basis points before the end of the third quarter, and that this is certain to underpin the dollar. He also believes that the central banks have used up a lot of their dollar reserves in recent months, buying the D-Mark for dollars, in order to repay the Bundesbank for recent intervention. The market's attention may now be on whether the dollar falls below the significant technical support level of DM1.60. That is the average level of the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate calculated over the last 30 days. A chart line drawn between the two recent troughs for the dollar - DM1.39 in October and DM1.55 in December - should show the currency at DM1.60 at the present time. A weak dollar might raise new tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism. But yesterday brought another day of consolidation, with Denmark cutting interest rates by one percentage point, to 12 per cent, without this weakening the krone.</p>

Sudan announced yesterday the expulsion of  the British ambassador because he considered Sudan a British  colony.    The dreams of the colonialists have returned again. The  dreams of the West have returned again. Their ambitions in  Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan, Libya, and everywhere in the Arab world  have returned. Their ambitions have returned again. [passage  omitted]    The colonialists will pull back when they face these [words  indistinct] these challenges and this determination; the  determination of peoples to live freely brothers. Yes, they  will have to be very wary. This is coming from the masses of  Surman and Bu 'Isa only, not to mention the masses of the Arab  nation and the masses of Libya as a whole. There are masses in  Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Iraq,  the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, and Sudan [repeated as heard].  There are innumerable masses and the colonialists will find it  difficult to impose their dominion again on a nation that is  beating the drums of confrontation, a nation that has decided to  live freely.    Yes, brothers, we are not just talking, we are demonstrating  with deeds. The national resistance in southern Lebanon is  daily writing in blood the words that we are speaking now, and  it is paving the path of liberation with the bodies of the  martyrs of Hizballah and the Lebanese national resistance.  There is fighting every day [word indistinct] in southern  Lebanon and Palestine under the leadership of Palestinian Jihad,  the Fatah Eagles, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the  Popular Front, the Popular Democratic Front, the Popular  Front-General Command, the Fatah of Intifadah, and  Fatah-Revolutionary Council. [passage omitted]    Brothers, those who sell Palestine now in a public auction  will be punished by the Palestinian people. Brothers, those who  betray the Arab nation will see their just fate.

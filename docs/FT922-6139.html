			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Mowlem serves Pounds 18.5m writ on Eagle Star THE long-running dispute between John Mowlem, the construction group, and Eagle Star, one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, has escalated further with Mowlem serving a writ for loss and damages exceeding Pounds 18.5m. The action arose following claims by Mowlem that it was wrongfully dismissed as management contractor on the Carlton Gate development of luxury flats in Maida Vale, north London. The contractor was dismissed in 1989. The developer, Carlton Gate Development, was half-owned by Eagle Star, a subsidiary of BAT Industries. The balance was held by a banking consortium led by Security Pacific EuroFinance. When it was put into receivership in December 1991, Mowlem accused the company of behaving 'deplorably' and of taking the action to avoid its financial obligations. Shortly afterwards, an arbitrator found that Mowlem had been wrongfully dismissed and awarded it Pounds 12.25m plus costs. The company said that virtually none of the award had been paid. Mowlem is pursuing separately a claim for Pounds 1.1m against Phippen Randall &amp; Parkes, the project architects, which it claimed had wrongfully deducted money from payments properly due to the contractor. Mowlem alleged the architects had also unlawfully conspired with Eagle Star to terminate the management contractor's Carlton Gate contract. Both parties, according to Mowlem, had wrongfully interfered with, and procured a breach of, its contract. Phippen Randall &amp; Parkes said it had acted properly throughout the project and was fully confident that any tribunal would reach the same conclusion. Eagle Star said it refuted all the allegations made by Mowlem in its 'spurious and mischievous' writ and would vigorously defend its case.</p>

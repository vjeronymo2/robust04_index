			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva report: "Premier Strengthening </F> Positions"]    [Text] The last few weeks have seen some quite active  personnel changes in the government. The best-known are the  elevation of Nikolay Travkin and the removal of Sergey Shakhray  from a ministerial position. There have also been other,  less-noticed events which are nonetheless very symptomatic.    The edict on Travkin's appointment as minister without  portfolio was drawn up by the Presidential Staff. But analysts  agree that the Democratic Party leader's promotion to the  corridors of executive power did not happen without  Chernomyrdin's knowledge. It is entirely possible that the  initiative even came from the premier. At any rate, observers  consider it beyond dispute that Viktor Stepanovich's position is  now so strong that the president can no longer afford to make  any changes to the government without the consent of its leader.    Why is Travkin needed?    World experience shows that it is usually representatives of  major political structures that are appointed minister without  portfolio. And, in terms of their influence, such ministers are  often equivalent to deputy premiers.    But it does not seem as though Travkin was in a position to  claim such a role. The faction he heads in parliament is one of  the smallest -- with just 15 people. The party he created is  virtually collapsing.    Apropos of which, analysts believe that the Democratic Party  of Russia [DPR] has no future. Its regional structures are  coming apart at the seams. Thus, in early 1994 the DPR's entire  Volgograd cell -- the largest political structure in the region,  with no less than 2,000 members -- left to join "Russia's  Choice."    Judging by everything, Chernomyrdin by no means needs  Travkin  because he is a DPR member. The newspapers have been  speculating about his possible appointment as the government's  plenipotentiary representative in the Duma. Official sources  are not confirming this report, but it is entirely possible that  Nikolay Ilich was asked to join the government precisely to  strengthen contacts with deputies. Ultimately, he may not be  called an official representative, but to all intents and  purposes that is what he will be.    Analysts are assuming that Travkin could quite easily take  on  this role. First, he has a great deal of experience of  political work. Second, he has the image of a sound,  down-to-earth regular guy. So it may well be assumed that  Travkin could be used in the Duma as Chernomyrdin's envoy above  all with a view to conducting behind-the-scenes talks with  representatives of factions for whom Nikolay Ilich's figurative  and accessible way of setting out an argument is far more  convincing than academic speeches by professors and other such  know-it-alls who are "former laboratory chiefs."    However, Viktor Stepanovich might also have some problems  with Nikolay Ilich: Travkin is not somebody else's team player.  He is a leader and highly ambitious. Although....  Chernomyrdin is said to be very good at cutting people down to  size. He is not a man to be trifled with....    As for Shakhray's removal from the position of minister for  nationalities affairs, this initiative most probably came direct  from the president and his entourage. It is thought that the  main cause of their differences was their different approach to  the settlement of relations with Chechnya.    This question might seem to be a separate issue, but it  touches on some serious problems. Resolving it today will mean  laying the last brick in the foundations of the Russian state  and ending the period of its initial construction.    The relieving of Shakhray of his duties should hardly be  seen  as weakening the premier's position. First, interethnic  problems have traditionally been the prerogative of the  Presidential Staff, and the premier kept away from them.  Second, observers consider Shakhray's achievements in this post  not to have been significant enough to result in a  behind-the-scenes struggle over him between the president and  the premier.    But let us leave the vice premiers to one side. Over the  past few weeks there have been some interesting events at deputy  minister level. The chronology is as follows. Decisions were  drawn up by the government apparatus for a closed session of the  Cabinet of Ministers Presidium on the dismissal of Yakov  Urinson, first deputy minister of economics, and Deputy Finance  Minister Sergey Aleksashenko. But, on Premier Chernomyrdin's  initiative, the question of their dismissal was not examined at  the presidium session -- both received a reprimand. And the  other day, by a Chernomyrdin directive, Deputy Minister Yakov  Urinson was accorded status equivalent to a minister.    I would note for reference purposes that Sergey Aleksashenko  is a young financier. He is known as a top-ranking specialist  who has liberal economic views. He is known for his independent  behavior and judgments. Yakov Urinson is a career state  planner. In liberal democratic circles he is known as one of  the first and few apparatchiks of the old school who actively  supported the idea of market reform. He is said to be  particularly favored and respected by Chernomyrdin.    It seems as though there have been some major clashes over  these two people (above all, Urinson) between apparatus leader  Vladimir Kvasov and the premier himself.    The premier's desire of late to support the liberal-market  wing of the government is due to a desire to preserve some  balance of power within the Cabinet of Ministers.    After the too-independent Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov  were  "forced out" of the Cabinet of Ministers, Chernomyrdin was left  one-on-one with emboldened sector lobbyists whose appetite and  the pressure they exert are constantly increasing and already  pose a serious threat of catastrophic inflation.    The drama of the situation is also increased by the fact  that  the leader of this camp -- Oleg Soskovets -- is number two in  the government. Chernomyrdin has been forced to leave  operational work to him increasingly frequently of late, because  the premier himself is becoming an increasingly political figure  -- he has to control relations with parliament and the  presidential structure.    But Soskovets, left to his own devices with the economy,  seems to have been making a lot of mistakes. For instance, at  the recent congress of the Association of Russian Banks he  suggested that the bankers use one-third of all their banking  funds to invest in production, and half of their  currency-dealing profits to support the agro-industrial complex.  It is hardly surprising if, after such statements, money which  had hitherto remained here starts flowing out of the country.    Thus, the balance in the government is being seriously  upset.  Analysts believe that there is a very great likelihood that  Soskovets, Zaveryukha, and Co. will prove the stronger. In this  situation the premier has been forced to support the camp of the  liberal free-marketeers in the government in order to save the  economy and his own political future.    This camp, which has now been considerably weakened, is  represented primarily by Aleksandr Shokhin and Sergey Dubinin.  But the role of Yakov Urinson has considerably increased of  late. And this is why. Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin,  as insurance against the anger of dissatisfied lobbyists, is not  refusing any money to anyone, but is proposing that the money be  found from investment funds. And Urinson is in charge of  investment. So it is not the acting finance minister but  Urinson who has to tell those desperate for money that the cash  is not there.    It is curious that the anti-Urinson campaign in the  government (along with the anti-Aleksashenko campaign) is being  headed by Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the apparatus, who has  clearly been staking a claim recently to the status of  independent politician. It is obvious that the civil servants'  leader cannot be said to wield the same clout as the premier.  Observers believe that Kvasov would be out of the picture in a  trice if he started really annoying Chernomyrdin.    In short, Viktor Stepanovich is not currently to be envied.  What he needs in the government now is another Fedorov -- only  one who talked a bit less and was able to look like a  subordinate when required.</p>

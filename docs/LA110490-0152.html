			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ENCINITAS  </P> <P> An Encinitas woman was allegedly kidnaped from her home by a former boyfriend  just moments after calling 911 for help Saturday morning, a Sheriff's spokesman  said.  </P> <P> Donna Marie Maloney, 36, of the 100 block of Phoebe Street, called 911 at 7:55  a.m. Saturday and said "Sonny" was kicking in her door.  </P> <P> The phone was then disconnected.  </P> <P> The first Sheriff's deputy to the scene arrived three minutes after Maloney's  call was placed and found the door kicked in, the telephone disconnected and no  one inside the apartment. A witness said Wilmer "Sonny" Evans Hart Jr., 43, of  Encinitas, led Maloney to her car, a 1984 tan over gold Dodge 600 convertible  with license plate number 1JWM820, and ordered her to get in the back seat.  Maloney complied and Hart drove away in the car.  </P> <P> Maloney and Hart had apparently had a tumultuous relationship over the past  three weeks, capped last Sunday by Maloney filing a temporary restraining order  prohibiting Hart to contact her. Maloney claimed Hart assaulted her.  </P> <P> The missing woman is described as white, with shoulder-length brown wavy hair  and brown eyes, 5 foot 7 inches and 128 pounds. She was wearing a long white  nightgown. The suspect is a white man, 6 foot 3 inches and 210 pounds with  blondish-gray shoulder-length hair and blue eyes and a Fu Manchu-style  mustache.  </P> <P> Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Hart and Maloney is asked to call  Sheriff's Homicide Detail at 565-5200.  </P></p>

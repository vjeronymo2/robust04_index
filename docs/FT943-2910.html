			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Mirror Group restores dividend - Montgomery confirms joint venture for subscription cable channel The Mirror Group announced yesterday that it was paying its first dividend since the days of the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Even though the payment is only 1p it was being seen as a significant development since the publisher of the Daily and Sunday Mirror was returning to normality and even respectability. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 34.7m for the six months to July 3. The previous figure of Pounds 69.9m included an exceptional credit of Pounds 36.1m, mainly representing the release of pension fund provisions. The modest increase in profits before exceptionals, against the background of a price war in the industry, was matched by underlying growth in earnings per share from 6.4p to 6.6p. Advertising revenue rose from Pounds 83.4m to Pounds 84m. Turnover fell from Pounds 237.2m to Pounds 230.6m. However, operating costs were reduced by Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 176m and interest payable fell to Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 15.8m). The group said a Pounds 350m restructuring of debt had been arranged in principle on much improved terms. Mr John Attwood, finance director, accepted that in any other industry the performance would be considered flat. But 'in the context at least of the newspaper industry at the moment they (the results) are exceptionally strong.' Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of Mirror Group, also confirmed yesterday that heads of agreement had been signed to form a joint venture with five of the largest cable and telephone companies in the world to provide a national subscription channel on cable. The channel, to be called Live TV, will be distributed to more than 500,000 homes from the outset and will focus mainly on live events. Heads of agreement have also been signed with Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Evening Mail to develop Birmingham Live, a local version of Live TV. Mr Montgomery said sales of the Mirror had remained about 2.5m a day, which with sales of the Daily Record took the total to 3.2m. Mr Montgomery also warned that the reduction in the price of The Independent, in response to cuts at The Times and the Daily Telegraph, would have a damaging effect on revenues and losses for the year. Losses at Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent, are likely to be larger than expected, although Mr Montgomery declined to say what current trading losses were. The Mirror Group's 28 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing, purchased in March, cost Pounds 1.4m over the four months since acquisition. COMMENT The shareholders of Mirror Group are not exactly going to respond with three cheers to yesterday's results. But the modest restoration of dividends, reduced operating costs, the prospect of better margins on debt are all signs that the Mirror is becoming a normal company again. There are also welcome signs of future thinking through an involvement in cable television and signs of some circulation growth, particularly on Sunday. Profit growth is likely to remain modest, with about Pounds 70m likely for the full year. Mr Derek Terrington at Kleinwort Benson is forecasting only Pounds 82m for next year - assuming the price wars continue - which would give a prospective p/e ratio of nine. The share price fell 4p to 131p.</p>

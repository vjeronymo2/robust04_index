			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BOOST FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING  </P> <P> Affordable housing got a boost recently when a federal judge agreed to allow  local nonprofit groups to develop projects with $17.5 million from the Century  Freeway replacement housing fund. The community groups will also get technical  assistance and private investment from the Local Initiatives Support Corp. That  combination should allow 500 townhouses, condominiums and apartments to get  built quickly, and for fewer public dollars.  </P> <P> The Century Freeway was envisioned as more than 17.3 miles of traffic lanes  between Norwalk and the eastern edge of LAX. The project also included an  unusual commitment to jobs, training, affirmative action and replacement  housing for the residents of 7,000 homes that were razed to make way for the  freeway. It was intended, according to the judge overseeing the controversy, as  a highway "that had a heart." The state paid off tenants and homeowners, but  also promised to replace half of the housing that was destroyed.  </P> <P> Despite good intentions, the housing program, run by a small state agency, got  bogged down by inexperience and layers of bureaucracy. At various steps along  the way, the projects required approvals from the Federal Highway  Administration and Caltrans, two government agencies that know a lot about  highways and little about housing.  </P> <P> The housing program slowly produced, as a series in The Times pointed out  nearly three years ago, poorly built, badly located or half-empty apartments  and condominiums. The tenants' lawyer, John Phillips of the Center for Law in  the Public Interest, argued justifiably that a public-private partnership could  do better.  </P> <P> The new arrangement was approved last week by U.S. Circuit Judge Harry  Pregerson, who has overseen this case for 18 years. It allocates a fraction of  the remaining $126 million in federal funds to nonprofit developers. LISC will  add private dollars raised from tax incentives to triple the number of units.  </P> <P> Developing low-income housing is not an easy task. Giving any part of that job  to nonprofit developers should pay off quickly -- with more affordable housing.  </P></p>
